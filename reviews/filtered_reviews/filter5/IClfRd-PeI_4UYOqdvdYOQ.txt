You will NEVER be disappointed here. If you are, you are not human. This is our neighborhood go-to on a clutch- and we clutch at least once a week... Seriously best Z around - atmosphere is amazing with open air bar , lots of light and such an upbeat atmosphere! (Guitar playing in the background is AWESOME BTW. You have to pay attention to him-  he is playing much more than guitar, holy cow!!) we love, and I mean LOVE shrimp tostada bites, cornbread, pot stickers, ahi tuna and of course our waitress NICOLE!!! (Best ever. For real - and it's not the chambord  marg talking!) PS- gotta try at least one chambord marg, our only drink of choice here!
