I've always passed by the place but didn't take notice until I got a groupon for it and wanted to try it out. I really liked the decor and the restaurant looks clean. The food I ordered was great and fresh, and the horchata was quite different from other places but it was pretty good. They had a wide variety of salsa, my favorite was the salsa pecan. I would most likely come back again for the food and good customer service.
