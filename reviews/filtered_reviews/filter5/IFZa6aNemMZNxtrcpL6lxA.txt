I absolutely love this place! Their burritos are amazing! And I love the atmosphere everyone is super nice and it's such a party! The restaurant has fun things like a guy who makes ballon hard and contests and an mc. The ceiling is full of fun quotes that you can spend the day just reading them all!! Definitely refer this to everyone!
