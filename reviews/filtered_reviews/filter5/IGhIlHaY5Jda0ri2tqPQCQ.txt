EASILY my new favorite mexican restaurant in Phoenix! When I first saw the restaurant, it reminded me of The Mission in Old Town Scottsdale. Both are mexican restaurants set in old churches that have since been renovated, however upon entering Taco Guild I found the ambiance of Taco Guild to be much different. It is warm and inviting, with vaulted ceilings and almost an upscale pub feel. I loved it. We were sat right away, and we tried quite a bit of food. The chorizo meatballs were extremely tender and basically melted in your mouth. The queso dip had the perfect level of spice and an excellent texture. Their chips are very good, and their guacamole is made fresh and the perfect consistency of "not too smooth, not too chunky." I also ordered the a shrimp taco and a chicken taco on lettuce, and they were both wonderful. I love this place because it's affordable, charming, and has really excellent mexican food that is fresh and flavorful. I will absolutely be coming back soon!
