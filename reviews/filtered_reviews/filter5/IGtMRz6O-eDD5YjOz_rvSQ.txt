Simply the Best. When you want to impress your guests, or a business colleague, take them here? Completely safe, guarded, protected, patrolled parking lot for those of you scared to venture into unfamiliar territories. Outstanding from beginning to end. From friendly, enthusiastic welcomes, to prompt tableside attention. Delicious Margarita and Dos Equis to wash down fresh chips, and fiery salsa served in a delightful tiny gravy boat for pouring or dipping. At least 4 servers tending to your every whim from delivering food, to clearing plates. Presentation is everything and here they do it right! From spotless, immaculately clean everything, everywhere you look, to pressed slacks and dress shirts on all the servers, there is pride in everyone's performance here. The food is the Bonus! Excellent flavor, robust and tangy, complex, plentiful, fresh and filling. You want to clean your plate! Prices are more than fair and reasonable for what you get! Charming Mexico Decor throughout without being gawdy or cheesy. Nice enough to impress a date before a concert or show Downtown. Absolutely my favorite place to dine in South Phoenix.
