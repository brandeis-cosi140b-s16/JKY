These are the best damn tacos in Las Vegas! I'm serious. All of the tortillas are homemade right in front of you and are used almost immediately on the taco orders. I came here every time I walked by. For 2$ a taco, you just cant beat the taste and freshness of "The Fat Taco". I just wish that I could find a similar restaurant near my house.....I live in San Diego, I know they exist. The only bummer about El Gordo is how far on the end of the strip it sits. It's almost directly across the street from Circus Circus, you know, the ghetto part of the strip. I've grown up about 45 minutes away from Mexico my entire life and only here did I see all of the nitty gritty taco ingredients. Cabeza, Lengua, Cheek, etc. But by far the best on their menu is the Adobada. Do yourself a favor and come get a damn good taco!
