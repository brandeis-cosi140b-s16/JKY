This is a great little place that is tucked away on the northwest corner of 16th street and Bethany Home right next to Luci's.  It originally branched off from the old Richardson's that burned down a couple of years ago.  The menu offers a great variety of some delicious New Mexican food.  The atmosphere here is great but place is very small, although they do have a larger room for a bigger party off to the right when you walk in.  The larger room an be reserved for special occasions with a $500 deposit.  I personally enjoy having Sunday brunch here early with my parents or a couple of my closest girlfriends.  They offer a $5 bloody mary or mimosa all day Sunday!
