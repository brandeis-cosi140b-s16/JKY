Wife and I were on vacation in Vegas. We come here every year. We do lots of eating, lots of gambling, lots of partying, and of course lots of sleeping.

We always stay at the M GM.  While walking through their restaurant and food court area on the ground level, we noticed that the Mexican restaurant called Diego's was no longer there. In its place, was another Mexican restaurant called Hecho en Vegas. 

Now, usually when I see a restaurant replaced by a similar restaurant, it kind of is a turn off. It seems like they replaced apples with apples.  

We had been to the now defunct Diego's before, and it wasn't that great. It was overpriced, under portioned, and they never actually seemed to be open to serve their full menu. It was always happy hour appetizers pretty much every time we tried to go there.

We decided to give this new place a chance, hoping that it was completely different from the original Diego's.  Believe me, it definitely was. The service was excellent, our waitress knew the menu very well, and the food came out fairly quickly.

 Instantly, I noticed that this was not your traditional Mexican food. It wasn't super greasy, it wasn't super salty, and it wasn't heavy-handed with the seasoning. Everything was very delicate and almost seemed sort of like a Mexican version of fine dining cuisine.

We were pleasantly surprised. I got steak tacos with some side dishes, and the wife got a steak Mexican salad and also had some appetizers. Everything was fresh and tasty.

It was a bit on the pricey side, but that is pretty much what you can expect when you're eating in one of the major resorts on the strip. We felt that our food was so good that it was worth every penny.

Bangin' food. Can't go wrong with Hecho en Vegas.
