I have been to dive bars and I been to bars which are way classier than Sandbar. But one thing that is common between all those bars is that they provide service worth your money. The drinks at Sandbar are so diluted that I would rather have had just a soda. The servers seems to be very stubborn and do not know how to treat the customers and make their experience a good one. Big NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
