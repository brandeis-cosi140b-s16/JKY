My second review.

Taco Taco has become a weekly tradition for me. I come after work on Fridays as a gift to myself for all my good behavior of not dining out and not buying food during my work week I end my Friday by hitting up Taco Taco. 

I have come to love their burritos and although I am a fan of tacos I have always been more of a fan of burritos. Upon first coming here I ordered tacos, because well, the name. But after returning a few times I branched out. Believe me, everything here is good, not just the tacos.

Many have compared this place to kind-of-sort-of Chipotle. I sort of agree. The burritos here are made in the same fashion - pick your meat, pick your other ingredients. I LOVE their pollo here. It has such an amazing flavor and the rice has a rich flavor as well. Beans are on spot and the tortillas are perfect - not too thin, not too thick. 

Needless to say I love this place. I just want to tell the (Yelp) world!
