Biggest burrito ever! It's a two-hander and once you start you cannot stop, if you put it down you will lose it. They have a bunch of different meats to choose from; chicken, cow, and pig and then of course you can do a vegetarian option as well. 
I get a vegetarian burrito, and it is seriously felt like it weighed at least 2lbs. Be sure to add the picked red onion because it makes anything you eat pop.
This place is that assembly line style where you tell them what you want to add as you move along (ex: Subway, Chipotle, Quiznos) but it is not crappy and  commercialized like the chain store examples are.
Last but not least, the theme is amazing, its obviously Lucha Libre which if you are not familiar with it specifically it's the Mexican wrestling with the colorful masks. Anyways, the whole place is decorated with masks and neon glitter, it's fantastic.

Casual, huge portions, fun decor, non-commercialized, yummy food.
