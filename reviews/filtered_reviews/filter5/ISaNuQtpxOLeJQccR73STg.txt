These are by far the best tacos in Las Vegas! Even better than TEG my previous reference and I believe the inspiration for Taco Taco, methinks the student has surpassed his master. I had the Great Bandini trifecta: Asada, Carnitas, and Pastor, all the meats had tremendous flavor and the servings were generous. The Pastor may be the best I've ever had even better than TEG in Tijuana.

Please go NOW to Taco Taco, the work they are doing is wildly important, they deserve our support.
