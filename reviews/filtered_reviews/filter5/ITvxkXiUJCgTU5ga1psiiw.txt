I went to Vegas with a large group of friends, and we decided to try this place out after it being highly recommended. The recommendation did not disappoint. It is about a couple miles off of the strip, and is situated in the middle part of a suburban area. 

As soon as we got there, it was evident that this was going to be a great restaurant judging by how packed it was. There were nothing but locals here, and the waiters/waitresses were great! They were really funny and accommodating. There was live music playing in the background and I think there must have been at least 4 birthday celebrations while we were there. They make a huge deal about birthdays and even bring out the tambourines.

The food was excellent (I highly recommend the Steak Al Cilantro), the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun.  The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get. Oh yeah, did I mention they give you fresh made tortillas? 

Try this place out for some great Mexican food! You will not be disappointed!
