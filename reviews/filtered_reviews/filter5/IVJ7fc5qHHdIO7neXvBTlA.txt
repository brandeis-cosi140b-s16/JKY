We discovered Sol Cocina last February when we came out to Scottsdale for a short getaway and LOVED it. We came back to Phoenix this week and knew we had to come back. 

First the food was incredible. Creative pairings and unique tastes to everything, make this a wonderful  experience that is not  your typical Mexican restaurant. The soup was so good, the grilled corn was unbelievably good (still craving more of that) and everything we ordered was delicious.

Most importantly was the service we had from Leah. She was friendly and welcoming from the moment we sat down and made this a great dining experience that will have to hold us until we return to Phoenix again.
