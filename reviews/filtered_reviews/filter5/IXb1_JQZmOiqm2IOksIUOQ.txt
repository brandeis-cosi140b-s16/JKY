We searched Yelp to find a good Mexican restaurant in the area. We visited based on the high ratings. We were not disappointed.  The service was great. The Manager came over a few times to check on us and talk. My husband had the carnitas street tacos and I had the shrimp tacos. Both were very tasty. We also tried the flan. It was EXCELLENT and was hand delivered by the executive chef who thanked us for visiting. I was definitely impressed with both the food and customer service.
