Went there for lunch with wife, my 92 year old Dad along with my dad's older friend and the gentleman's new wife. Gotta love those spry oldsters! 
The server started us out with drinks and tortilla chips and bottles of salsa that was obviously house made. The chips were crisp but a bit odd in that they didn't have any salt but with the excellent, if rather mild, salsa they had plenty of flavor. Service was not fast but the wait for our meal was definitely worth it!
Anyway the two ladies had to try the chile relleno's while I had the carne asada, Dad had a shredded beef taco and a pork enchilada and our friend had carnitas de puerco.
All came with refried beans, mexican rice, a bit of shredded slaw and, in my case, guacamole.
The rellenos were near perfect with a very large well roasted chili battered with a delicious very light batter and filled with a good Mexican cheese. The sauce was just right and had sufficient spiciness to be interesting without being overpowering for those who aren't crazy about hot. My asada was also very well prepared with the thin steak well charred and the corn tortillas of good quality. The beans and rice are very well made and are obviously an in house recipe. 
I did not get a chance to taste either the pork carnitas or the taco-enchilada combo but the old gentlemen both averred that they were excellent dishes. My dad I know to be a very tough grader so his comments ensured that his dish was well prepared indeed!  Definitely the best Mexican restaurant I have found in Mesa and well worth a try.
