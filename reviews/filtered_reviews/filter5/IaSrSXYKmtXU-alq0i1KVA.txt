Hands down my favorite restaurant. I would eat here daily if I could! Table side guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it is absolutely amazing. You can get 3 tacos for $10 and they have such a wide variety! I always try a new one and am never disappointed. The margaritas are fresh and you can always get them by the pitcher. Great outdoor patio and dog friendly!
