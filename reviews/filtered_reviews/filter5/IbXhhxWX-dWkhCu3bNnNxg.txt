This is the absolute best Mexican yum spot in Vegas.  Let me a few reasons: 1) Violeta - sweet & brilliant waitress who consistently provides amazing service.  Ask to be seated in her section.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  2) Handmade flour tortillas.  3) Fajitas.  4) Fresh guacamole made table side while you watch.  They actually carve the avocados & create the guac from scratch to order.     

My other favorites are the "Filete Relleno", - orange roughy with shrimp/calamari & the "Steak al Cognac"- cooked to order smothered in mushrooms & onions with rich cognac sauce.

I just heard they have a Happy Hour, but it is somewhat of an early one (2p - 6p).
