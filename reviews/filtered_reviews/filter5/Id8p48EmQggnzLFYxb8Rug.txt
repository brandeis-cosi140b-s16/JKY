This is a unique eating experience.  Their menu is very unique.  Our family has diverse eating preferences and Chino's has something for all of us.  They have been careful to stay in this same location for over 20 years although their place is always busy.  I love the Jade Red, my wife loves the quesadilla and our youngest son loves the jerk chicken because it is spicy.

You gotta try it!!
