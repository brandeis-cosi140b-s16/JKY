This restaurant was highly recommended by friends who had frequented it for twenty years! That, in and of itself, is a heckuva endorsement! We met said friends at restaurant while visiting Las Vegas.  The food was hot, delicious, nice portions, large selections, good service.  I can't think of a thing I didn't like!   If I lived here, I'd be a regular, too!  The colorful Mexican art on the walls was a real treat for this South Carolina girl.  Good salsa!
