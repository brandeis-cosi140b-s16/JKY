We loved our first visit to Secreto. We enjoyed happy hour and a wonderful carne adovado bruscetta.  It wad juicy with just enough spice to be interesting. The chicken quesadilla was also tasty. 

We were fans of Richardson's years ago and this warm, intimate place brought back fond memories. The staff was friendly and we can't wait to go back to try more of the menu-especially the acclaimed burrito.
