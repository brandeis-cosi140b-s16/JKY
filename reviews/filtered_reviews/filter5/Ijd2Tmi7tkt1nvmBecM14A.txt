Visited again recently.  This time I had the beef burrito.  Oh...my...god...it was GOOD!  Very good seasoning, Unlike my chicken chimi last time, no need to add anything to the beef burrito!

Also ordered was a pork (carnitas) burrito.  Use the green salsa from the salsa bar and it becomes really good too!

And we took tamales home.  Can you guess?  Yeah...they were really good!!

It's almost enough to make me wish I lived downtown.
