Now you know a taco place is good when you don't have to always settle for carne asada. Gordos has the best spicy pork tacos! And they're proud of it :) this has been the best taco I've had for a whole-in-the-wall place. The vibe is great too, from workers to customers. The place is crackin up until 4am. Oh and best of all.. Non stop refills on horchata
