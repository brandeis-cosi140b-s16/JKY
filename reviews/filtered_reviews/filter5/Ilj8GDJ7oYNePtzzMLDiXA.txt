I went here like 3 times the last time I went to Vegas and it was so goooooddd !! I've never been to a taco place that includes guacamole without an extra cost. This is a real authentic taco place, and it's cool to see them prepare it right in front of you. When I go back to Vegas, this will be my first stop!
