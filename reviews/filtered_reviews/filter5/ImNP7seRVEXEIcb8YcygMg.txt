We had the Botana Plate which was a lot more food than it seems at first. The best part was definitely the gorditas the chicken was well seasoned and very tender.  In addition to that we also had some chips and salsa between the two tapas my girlfriend and I were stuffed and I'm a bigger boy! Pleasantly surprised.

The Don Julio flight was a great value $21 for 3 shots! Pretty damn good! 

The service of as phenomenal our server was Christina, she was super warm and friendly and went out of her way to answer all our questions about the menu. Our waters were always full and she was always on the floor so we could be flag her down easily in case we needed anything!
