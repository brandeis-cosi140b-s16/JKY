Probably my favorite non Roberto's Mexican, although I admit I only ever go to the bar for their cantina specials. Extremely fast and friendly service every single time I've been there. 

In addition to their free fresh chips, salsa and beans, they have several great specials in the bar area only. I can't remember the rest, but I always get the 3 tacos (hard/soft, beef/chicken) with huge Margarita (rocks/blended) for $12. They're big tacos, not the little street tacos and full of meat with homemade shells.
