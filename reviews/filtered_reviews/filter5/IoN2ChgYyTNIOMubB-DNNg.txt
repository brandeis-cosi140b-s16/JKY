I came to Vegas for a weekend trip, and I HAD to come back here because I've had some intense cravings for the salsa ever since I was here the last time in February. It was like nothing had changed - still had the delicious mesquite salsa, still had the incredible service, and still had the large portions of flavorful food. Now my craving has been satisfied and I got my friend hooked on this place as well; this place will always be on our itinerary when we come back to Vegas.
