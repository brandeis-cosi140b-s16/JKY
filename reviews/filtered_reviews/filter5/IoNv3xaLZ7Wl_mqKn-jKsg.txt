The food and drinks at the Spotted Donkey are consistently good. Sit outside and enjoy the sunset amidst the beauty of El Pedregal and enjoy a margarita, excellent guacamole and some pepper poppers - just right. The meatloaf is a little blander than expected but the Chalupa's are oh so good - with guacamole, pulled pork and some special ingredients on a corn tamale. An interesting menu, great food and a wonderful view. Love their creativity. One minor detriment: the country music that has been playing on the last couple visits. Eh.
