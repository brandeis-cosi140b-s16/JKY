This place is amazing!! Forget Chipotle and zabas, this place is my new favorite! The staff was really friendly and had great customer service. I felt welcome from the second I walked in the door till when I left. Not only that but the good was AMAZING! There are so many options to make your burrito, taco, or bowl your own and to adhere to your own taste buds. Don't know what you like? They will give you samples so you can find out.. UNLV students get hooked up here too. But whether you are a student or not you need to check this place out! Oh and on a side note for dessert get there Coconut Bark.. You will thank me
