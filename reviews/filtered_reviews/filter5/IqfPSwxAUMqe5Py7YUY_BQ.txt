After a delicious meal last night at Javier's we decided to come back again tonight. Great food. ... Big price for classic Mexican but worth it!  
One of my favorites is the Carne asada quesadilla. The steak is marinated to perfection prior to cooking. Served with guacamole and sour cream. Next up is the Camarones al mojo de ajo. Beautiful saut√©ed jumbo prawns with garlic. Muy delicioso!!!!
