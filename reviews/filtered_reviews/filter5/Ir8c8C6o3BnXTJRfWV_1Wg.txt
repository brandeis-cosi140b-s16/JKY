We came here for an early father's day dinner. The first thing we encountered was a breathtaking view of the strip and downtown through the massive wall size windows. You can sit at the bar and have a fantastic view facing the strip or asked to be seated on the lower level for a birds eye view of the strip and the old Vegas strip.

   Once you are seated prepare for some live music from a guitar picker playing to a track not far from your table. The songs were all in Spanish, but it wasn't hard to pick out an Elvis or Sinatra tune from the playlist, which made the whole experience fun and unique.

    The service at Lindo's is excellent. They have the model correct. In addition to the table server, there is a food runner and separate drink runners. The result is someone returning to your table about every 5 minutes to bring appetizers, drink refills and the food/dessert order. 

    The menu is a little hard to understand if you don't know Spanish, but it's a small mis-step in the overall experience. One thing that I noticed that was a little odd is that all of the management, kitchen cooks and floor servers were male. There wasn't one female on the floor besides the two hostesses that were greeting guests at the front door. I assume that this is the format in a traditional restaurant in Mexico.

    Everything was Perfecto from our first impression to the server Jorge shaking my hand at the end of our experience. For tasty Mexican food and excellent service, go to Lindo's in the heart of Henderson. We will be back many more times
