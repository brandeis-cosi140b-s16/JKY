If you guys want the best customer service at a restaurant this would be it! First, they made a double order for someone's tacos so they gave us the extra. Then when they found out it was our first time here, they gave us a free dessert that was to DIE for! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was so great! Will definitely be coming back many more times!!!
