For weeks I have brooded over what I should write about for my 400th review.  How would I celebrate such a milestone??  A splurge at a AAA four diamond restaurant? A Scottsdale shopping trip? A review of someplace my husband and I visited during my recent trips around the state? After much pondering and a couple of meals at mediocre Mexican places here in Phoenix, I remembered that I have never written a review of what is considered by most to be the premiere Mexican restaurant in the valley: Barrio Cafe.

Barrio Cafe is a classic in Phoenix, located in what used to be a single family home in a historic part of town.  Their food is superb.  They serve classic Latin cuisine elevated to a new level.  The menu consists of both regional Mexican dishes not found at your average tourist taco shop in Tempe or Scottsdale nor the mom-and-pop AZ-Mex places located in every strip mall in the Phoenix metro area.  The chef also throws in a few items that can only be described as nuveau Mexican. This is where the Latino foodies (Â¿comiditos?) eat.

My personal favorites are the cochita piblil and the red mole.  I also really love the mango shrimp salad - this makes a light, refreshing meal or a great appetizer good for sharing due to the beautiful plating.  The duck in Tamarind sauce is also fantastic and something I have never had anywhere else. In addition to the fabulous entrees I have described they also have tacos and tortas as well as a brunch menu but since it is nowhere near my home or work I have never been here for breakfast or lunch.  I hope maybe someday...
