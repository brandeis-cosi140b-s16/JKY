Heard about this place from Diners, dives, and drive-ins.  They were originally located off of 7th and union hills and have moved to Anthem.  If you ask my son the Chorizos, eggs, and papas burritos are the best.  The staff is friendly.  Can be busy sometimes.  The mexican pizza is excellent.  

They are closed on Sunday.  Sorry no burritos or menudo for football.
