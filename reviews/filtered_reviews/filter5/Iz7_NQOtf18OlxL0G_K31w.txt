The pumpkin bread pudding is to die for, so before I say anything else, remember to save room!  I took my son there last night to celebrate his college choice and we had one of the best meals EVER and the waiter was AMAZING. His name was Sal and he took the time to really explain the entire menu and make recommendations.  Then, he carefully timed everything so we did not feel rushed.  So nice.  

We had the duck empanadas for an app and they were very good, but rich because of the foie gras.  My son also had a delicious soup but I don't remember the name.  I had the scallops for an entree and my son had the filet.  Both were fantastic.  I had asked for the scallops to be well done and they were but still moist.  The steak was amazing...even beat The Capital Grille, my son said.  Dessert...ahhhhh.  Pumpkin bread pudding AND the churros with chocolate shake.  A true feast!  My son said he is saving his money to bring his girlfriend here.  Such a wonderful restaurant, especially for a special occasion!

PS Our waiter Sal said to come back for Sunday brunch..I think we may do that!
