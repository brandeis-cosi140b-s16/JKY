I am from Albuquerque, NM and I was happy to hear that they serve NM food. I love Hatch chili and this restaurant didn't disappoint. I had the red chili stew with pork and the beef burrito with red chili. Both were awesome. I will come back this weekend for the posole. I grew up on this food and since moving to Phoenix in November of 2011 I couldn't find New Mexican food until today. Hatch chile is the best!!
