Me and my family ate at this restaurant recently after a long day at the boat drag races. We had a waiter named david, and I can honestly say I have never had such a good waiter. There was no waiting around for him, he was on top of everything, and never had to tell him anything twice. In fact,  I talked to his manager and explained to her how great he (David) was. A stand up guy for sure. We had a big plate of beef and chicken fajitas and there's was nothing to complain about, great food. Drinks and food were great and the service was above the rest, 5 stars and two thumbs up!
