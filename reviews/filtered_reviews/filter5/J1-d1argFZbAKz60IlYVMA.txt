Forgot to Yelp about this. Went for Lunch last Sunday because my freakin' friends wouldn't shut up about it. Let me tell you - they are very smart eaters. The Blind Pig sets a new standard for contemporary Mexican cuisine in this town, and I do not say that lightly. The shrimp tamale is pure poetry and the ceviche is among the best I've ever had here in the U.S. RUN, don't walk, to The Blind Pig. Chef Jimmy is a genius!
