So good! I went here today for the first time with my friend. I got two enchiladas (corn tortilla) one with short rib, the other with green chili pork. I got half red sauce, half green sauce, with jack cheese. I also got the sour cream type stuff on top. They were both absolutely delicious, and I can't wait to come back! The service wasn't the best I've ever had, but hey, I'm not going there to make friends, I'm going to eat delicious food!
