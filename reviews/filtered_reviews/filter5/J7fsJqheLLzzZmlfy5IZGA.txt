OMG! Just tried this restaurant for the first time. Tuesdays are $2 tacos. I tried the fish tacos and they were definitely the BEST in the Valley!  I also asked for a "cup" of Fideo Soup. When they brought it to me I corrected them that I had requested a "cup." The waiter replied, "This IS our "cup!' It was a BOWL!  When I tasted it, tears came to my eyes as it tasted just like my Mom made it . Being Hispanic and eating true Mexican food is a joy where you want to return over and over again.

P.S. The mojitos were wonderful! YUMMY!
