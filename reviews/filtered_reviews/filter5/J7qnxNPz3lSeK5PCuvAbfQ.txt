Taco Me Taco!

The fact that I have never written a review for Taco Y Taco still blows me away. I've been here a number of times and maybe I've just been taco wasted on vampiro and carnitas? 

My most recent visit here was on Taco Tuesday and the place was packed, all the taco lines were full and the burrito area was starting to fill up as well. I have to hand it to Taco Y Taco; they emptied the lines very quick and sent everyone on their way to taco happiness. I was not partaking in the taco fiesta today, nope, chicken mole fries were in my future. 

Shredded chicken, creamy mole sauce, shredded cheese and cotija cheese all on top of a mound of sweet potato fries. The sweet crispy fries mixed with the savory sweet mole sauce is amazing, then you add super tender marinated chicken to the food fiesta and all bets are off. 

Mole Fries is a cure all meal; hangovers, gone!, hunger pains, gone!, the mixed feeling of angry and hungry or, "Hangry" as I like to call it, all gone! Besides the moles fries, Taco Y Taco has... amazing tacos, duh. Cooked old school like I used to see when I would visit TJ when I lived in San Diego. The meat is simmered for hours and then chopped in front of you and placed on a handmade tortilla. 

TYT also offers a full bar, I recommend getting a Red Beer. Great compliment to some amazing authentic Mexican food.
