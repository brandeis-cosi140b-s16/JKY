Great atmosphere, great food and right on the strip. Just had lunch, where my wife had the chicken nachos (which were as big as her head) and I had the Baja fish tacos, which were excellent. The staff was friendly and professional. We also ordered Mango Margueritas, which you better like tequila cause the drinks are potent and large. Come and experience this place, you won't be disappointed.
