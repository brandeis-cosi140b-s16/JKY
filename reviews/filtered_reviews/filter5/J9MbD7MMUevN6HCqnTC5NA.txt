Five stars for fresh, authentic Mexican street food, in a damn airport for crying out loud! My husband's pork burrito was tender, fresh and bursting with flavor. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla, and out came four small flat tortillas each topped with a single juicy jumbo shrimp, then covered in melted cheeses and super fresh pico de gallo. Everything was on point - the texture and home-made quality of the tortillas and chips; the slow roasted and marinated pork; the freshness of all ingredients, run out of the kitchen as soon as they were prepared. This place is better than any of the 5 mexican places in my small SoCal town. And it's in an airport. In Arizona. HUH? A bit pricey for what it is, and the wine by the glass is $10 a pop, but again, you're in an airport. If you want to eat well, it's going to cost you.
