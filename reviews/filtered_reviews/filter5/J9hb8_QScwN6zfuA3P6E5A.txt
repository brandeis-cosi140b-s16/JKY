What's not to like about this place?

The complimentary chips and salsa/bean dip are delicious.

Everything I've tried on the menu has been great (I've been here about 6 times and have gotten different things each time). Food is better than many Mexican places in Las Vegas that charge twice as much.

The prices are very reasonable and we've never had to wait to be seated. 

Ambiance is a little lacking, but this is more of a weeknight place for us when want something tasty and cheapish.
