A friend asked me, upon seeing the requisite social network check-in, how it was. My response is rather topical, but best captured by comparison to the New York City subway rat absconding with a slice of pizza.  The pizza, a giant sushi roll of tremendous quality.  The rat, you.  It is the best day of your life. I hope to die this way.
