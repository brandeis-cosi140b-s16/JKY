My wife and I hosted a 2 hour party on Saturday night, November 10, to celebrate my son's 21st Birthday.  We had about 30 people attend.  Staci Green and her staff were wonderful in their preparations and duties during the party.  Niko and Tony were outstanding in their duties behind the bar to ensure everyone had exactly what they wanted in very short order.  The food served was excellent and the drinks were top-notch as well.  We received many compliments from our party guest about the location, ambiance, food, and drink service.  If you are looking for a fun spot to host a gathering of party-goers in Las Vegas, then I can highly recommend Yolo's Mexican Grill and their bar area.  We had a great time and I'm sure you will too.
