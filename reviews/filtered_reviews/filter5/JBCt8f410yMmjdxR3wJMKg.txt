Our family tries to eat healthy, including organic and non-GMO.  Good luck finding restaurants that fit this criteria, but.... El Dorado is one of the few we've found anywhere that offers this.  More importantly, it's some of the best Mexican food we've ever had. The kids' flank steak is perfectly seasoned, the guac that they make at your table is unparalleled and the cochinita is perfection! They marinate the meat overnight on banana leaves and slow cook it for 8 hours. In addition to the food, our favorite server, Enrique, is one of the best and the manager, Christian, is always courteous and welcoming, and makes sure our dining experience is tops.
