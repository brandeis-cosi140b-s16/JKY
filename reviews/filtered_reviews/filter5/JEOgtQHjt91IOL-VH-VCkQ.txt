We used to come here several years ago, then traveled through Mexico for two years; excited to try out El Barrio Cafe after gaining some Mexican food expertise in Mexico.  We were hesitant to come again after reading some of the concerns expressed by Yelp reviewers.  We had such a good experience several years ago; we didn't want it followed by a bad one.

Thankfully however, we had a WONDERFUL dinner with EXCELLENT service from Claudia, our server.  The wait was not long, the service was very friendly, and the portions on par with prices.  For the people expressing disappointment in pairing guacamole with cranberries or pomegranate:  stay home!  This is all part of the experience and this is how it is done in various parts of Mexico.  They make the guacamole at your table and you can guide them in what you want added to it (more spices, less onions, no fruits, as you wish).  If you are not adventurous and want the same old stuff, this is not the place for you!

Waiting at a restaurant that doesn't take reservation is also part of the experience.  We went early, also taking advantage of happy hour and didn't wait long.  Our server had much more time to explain various foods we asked about.  

We received free dessert in apologies for having to wait for our appetizer.  We didn't think we waited that long but our server thought so...  First she offered free guacamole which we turned down so she insisted on free dessert.  

All in all still a great place to eat.  We will back.
