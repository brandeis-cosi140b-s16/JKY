This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant. I wish they had one closer to my house, as it's not exactly in the best part of town... but who cares the food is fantastic. If I'm even remotely close to the area this is a must stop detour. Growing up with authentic Mexican food, I've been generally disappointed with the options when I moved to Phoenix. However, this place is as good as it gets. The food couldn't taste any better.... it's simply PERFECTION. I used to not even be a fan of tortas until I tried theirs. The torta Nortena is food heaven!
