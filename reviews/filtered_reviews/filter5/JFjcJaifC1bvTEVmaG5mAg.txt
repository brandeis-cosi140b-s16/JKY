I have been eating at Rudy's at least once a week for over 5 years. My wife's favorite Mexican food item is a chile relleno and she has had them at dozens of restaurants.  She says no one makes them better then Rudy.  I'm partial to the carne asada burro, taquitos and egg &  chorizo burro which you can get all day.

Here you get to watch Rudy and his clan make your food right in front of you.  You don't have to wonder what is going on in the back, is the cook smoking or are the roaches crawling all over the kitchen like you have to do in the typical Phoenix area taco shop.
