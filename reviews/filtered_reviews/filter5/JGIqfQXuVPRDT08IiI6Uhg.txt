I just wrote my review for Rokerij, so it seems only right that I praise the originator of all my love and affection - Richardson's.  I love this place. When I was single, it was my SECOND date place, where I asked to be taken when I wanted to cuddle up with the perfect cutie pie.  There are booths that are like caves with pilows and relaxing sofa like seating,.  The food is out of control good - unique and very interesting - always!  They have scallops and bacon here as well....and BRUNCH is fun and tasty.  ....  I love DICK's too, but I can't do three reviews for the same owner...just trust us all - go there!
