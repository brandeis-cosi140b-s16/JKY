Best happy hour in the area!
$5 signature margaritas, and $6, $7, and $8 appetizers! Portions are great for sharing.
Service is always AWESOME, the servers here know what they are doing and will make sure you always leave happy.
Listen to the servers recommendations if you aren't sure what to order, they will make sure you love your meal.
And of course, the cornbread is the best! It comes to the table fresh out of the oven in a hot cast iron skillet with honey butter. It is made with yogurt to make it fluffy, yet rich. It's perfection.
