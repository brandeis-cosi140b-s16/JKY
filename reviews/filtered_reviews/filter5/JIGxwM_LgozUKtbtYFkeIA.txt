I have been coming to restaurant Mexico since I was a little kid. The staff is AMAZING it is family own and run and the same people have been working there for years. They are friendly and very accommodating. The food is authentic mexican food and delicious! The salsa is pretty spicy gives you a nice little kick. Since I moved away from AZ  every time I come back into town I ALWAYS make sure I go to restaurant Mexico before I leave! 

AND they even have toys (little action figures and small toys)for kids to play with while they are at the dinner table !!
