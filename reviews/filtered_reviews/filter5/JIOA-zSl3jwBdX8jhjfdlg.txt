This is a crazy combination and it really works! Chinese, Mexican and some Caribbean. What I find odd is that with food from 3 different "brown" cultures, the majority on the patrons were white! Just an observation. Kinda hectic in the Phoenix location, it reminds me of a busy toy store during Christmas shopping season. Dont let that scare you off it's really good, The  Red Jade Chicken is my favorite! they are or have opened a new location in Chandler, so for east valley folks, that's nice.
