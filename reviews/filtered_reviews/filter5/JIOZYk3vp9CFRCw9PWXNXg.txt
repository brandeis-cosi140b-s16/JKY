Went to Fiesta Mexicana for an early dinner on Monday.  It was between the typical lunch and dinner rush.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive to our dining needs.  My husband had the Burrito Mexicana and said it was the best he has had in quite a while.  I had the Prawn Fajitas and they were delicious.  Kevin was our waiter and he was fabulous.  Never had an empty glass, quite attentive and very Friendly.  I will definitely recommend this place to our friends, and we will definitely be dining there again.
