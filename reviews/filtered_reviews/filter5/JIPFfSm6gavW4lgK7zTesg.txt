What a beautiful, unique, delicious new restaurant. Sampled a little bit of everything!!  Mushroom tacos, dried fruit guac, yellowtail ceviche, summer corn, and chicken mole...all of which were phenomenal. The plating is especially beautiful, with each dish looking like a work of art. Also pleasantly surprising were the prices, which at this level of quality, combined with the location, I would have expected to be far higher. 
Service was equally excellent, as is the ambience. I hope this place is very successful!!
