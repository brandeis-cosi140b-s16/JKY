Awesome!!! Loved our night there. We met up with Leticia and some friends. The food was very good. The environment is nice. The tacos are award winning and worth the order. Also, get some Mexican coffee. It is very, very good. We were staying on the strip and vegas and this is worth the 20 minute trip out.
