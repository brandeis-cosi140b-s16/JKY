This is it! My new Mexican food spot. We've been here twice so far, and we are seriously impressed.
  The first thing that has impressed us both times as we've walked in was the overwhelming friendliness of the staff. You are literally made to feel like family. I'd be hard-pressed to name another place where everyone there is so cheerful, helpful, and friendly. It's like they honestly enjoy working there, lol.
   Friendliness is nice, but if the food sucks, I'm still not coming back. We've tried 4 different combos, and they all rocked. Last time I got the burrito, and this time I got the quesadilla (stomach is still a little tender coming off Hawaiian fish food poisoning). Both were really good. BF is hooked on the gordita. We both got a churro last time- we got the nice surprise that they are caramel churros- even better than they sound. Unfortunately their flan is so popular that they were out last time, but I got some today- I don't think I've ever come across a flan that was creamier than this is. 
   The decor is pleasant and the environment definitely matches the theme.
   I think what pushed it over the edge was how incredibly nice they were to me in helping me out with my tender stomach- this was the first solid food meal I've had since the food poisoning, and by far this was the right place to go to.
   Thanks, Ladies. We'll be seeing you soon   :)
