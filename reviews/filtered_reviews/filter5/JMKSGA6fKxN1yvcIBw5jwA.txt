We were looking for a good to-go Mexican food restaurant seeing as Amigos had gone out of business, and Robertos was just not cutting it. We stumbled across this place on Yelp and was surprised to find out it was located within a gas station. We still ordered though, and to our surprise..... IT WAS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD WE HAVE HAD IN LAS VEGAS. The chicken tacos are the best. The shell is the right combination of crispy and crunchy, and the taco isn't overly greasy like other places. Everything I have tried here has been absolutely delicious and not once have I had a bad meal. 

The only thing to be aware of is that there is only one guy working the whole area. So don't expect to be in and out within 5 mins. Everything is made when it is ordered, so it does take more time compared to a Robertos. But the extra time waited is definitely worth it!
