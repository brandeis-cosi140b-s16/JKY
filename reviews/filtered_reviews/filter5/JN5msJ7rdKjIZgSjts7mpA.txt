went in to try MR. Don Juan's food and let me tell you what i experienced... So first i tell my self hey this place is new i love the classy sign  I'm gonna try this food also because a good mexican spot doesn't really exist in Summerlin. So it all began when i opened the door and saw 2 Angels at the register, one was a server one was i believe the hostess, they greeted me with happiness. Even was curious enough to ask about my day which then i explained. Then unfortunately i was in a time crunch so i couldn't dine in. So i did what any other logical person would do  and i ordered the regular burrito with carne to gauge what type of place this gonna be. Me and the two angels continued to talk while i sat patiently on the very comfortable seating area they have made for us patrons. Where then i started to notice all the amazing decor in this classy place Mr.Don Juan and im sure his beautiful family own. So i get my food i wish them a great day. I get to my car i start to look in the bag AND GUESS WHAT? CHIPS AND SALSA.!!! I didn't know i got free chips and salsa with the burrito. The Salsa was so good i ate all of it before i got home, making me wish i ordered extra salsa(get extra salsa if you go here) finally i get to my desk where i am sitting now excited to see what the burrito tasted like. Ever heard of love at first Bite? As i bit into the burrito i could no longer see straight all i saw was hearts and stars, just as you might see in a looney tunes cartoon. Burrito to say the least was a 10 it reminded me of this other amazing restaurant i enjoyed while i lived in San Francisco. It held its form perfectly and didn't get soggy and every bite was filled with deliciousness. Thank you Mr Juan or Don. I will be returning here for my birthday party as long as that awesome happy hour is still around! If you love yourself go here. I want to see this place stay in summerlin forever!
