Best margaritas and cornbread! The diablo pasta is amazing, and you get enough for two meals. I usually do not eat leftovers, but Diablo pasta (and Alfredo in the Dark from Oreganos) is the only food I still like the second day. The cornbread, street tacos and trio salsa are fantastic. The Sixth Street frozen margarita is soo yummy and strong! Great place to start a fun evening in Scottsdale or Tempe.
