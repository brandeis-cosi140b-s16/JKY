This is our go-to spot in the area for Mexican food.  I love their chips and trio of salsas..especially the verde and pico.  We generally get the cheese enchilada combo.  Very good rice and beans to compliment.  I've also had their shrimp dish and chile relleno.  Would recommend them all.  I feel like someone's little Abuela is making all the food in the back.  We have always had good service whether it's for lunch or dinner...highly recommend.
