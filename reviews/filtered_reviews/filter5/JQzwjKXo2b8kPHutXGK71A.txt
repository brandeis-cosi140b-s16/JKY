My poor husband from Los Angeles has missed Mexican food more than anything else since we moved to Western PA. We finally got to Reyna's. He actually wept when he bit into his taco. The service was great, the drinks were beyond generous and the food was SO authentic. I'll make the drive at least once a month to see my husband that happy.
