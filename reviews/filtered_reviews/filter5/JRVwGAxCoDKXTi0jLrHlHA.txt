OTB is our go-to happy hour cantina. They have great happy hour deals, giant fishbowl margaritas for $4, good happy hour food (gotta love the nacho platter and $2 queso!), and the service is always good. They also have a reverse happy hour. The bartenders and crew work hard at this location and also at the Mesa location, while also still being fun to be around. For a chain mexican restaurant, they do it right.
