Me and my husband try to eat at new places. We tend to be picky eaters, so this is our way of trying  to broaden our likes. We love mexican so this was this weeks new try. I LOVED it! We started with the jalapeno bean dip and a cheese crisp. The dip was fantastic!!! I loved every bite. The chips they served with it were light and fluffy. Our cheese crisp came out late so they took it off our bill. We didn't even say anything about it, our waitress just said that because it came out 5 after our meal came out that it was on them. Excellent customer service in my opinion. I had lunch special A, a cheese enchilada and a taco with rice and beans. It was great, wasn't anything that made it stand out, but it was very good. Definitely will return, and maybe some friends will join =)
