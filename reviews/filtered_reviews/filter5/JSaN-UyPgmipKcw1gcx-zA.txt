Everytime we've been in we have had acceptional service! Recently brought my mom in for dinner (who was visiting from Florida)  on a Friday night (she HATES crowds) and she said "I would search this place out next time I'm in town." They have great food and it is very very fresh. I Highly recommend the guacamole!
