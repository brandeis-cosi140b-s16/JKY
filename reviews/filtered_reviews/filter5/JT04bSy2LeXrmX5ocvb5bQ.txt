I can't believe how good the tacos are here.  We stopped by on "Taco Tuesday" and got all the tacos we wanted for $2.50 each!!  They have a huge variety of tacos to choose from and they're not your typical ones (better).  Patio seating on a warm spring afternoon was perfect and I've heard from friends that the guacamole the make at your table is amazing.  Will definitely return.
