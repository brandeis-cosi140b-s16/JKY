We had a great time at Paco's Tacos on Cinco De Mayo! Since I knew they would be really busy that night I made a reservation on Open Table so when we arrived our table was ready! Our server Aaron was awesome, friendly and attentive. It was really busy but he still took the time to make recommendations on food and tequila choices.

We all had tacos. The Paco's Taco was amazing and they have a huge tequila menu.   Fun, lively atmosphere.  The staff is great at making sure your needs are met. We will be back for more!
