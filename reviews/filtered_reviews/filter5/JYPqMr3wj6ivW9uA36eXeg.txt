Best chile rellenos I've ever  had. Very tasty red sauce with a crispy coating.  The pepper used was not Anaheim but it was delicious. The rice and beans were also top notch.  The green chile sauce that came with another dish was spicy but was also excellent with a deep fresh flavor.  Have been here multiple times. Don't go for the hot dogs next door
