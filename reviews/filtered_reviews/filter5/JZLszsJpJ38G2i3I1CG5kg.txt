I saw it listed as one of the neat new restaurants to try in one of those Phoenix magazines and figured it might be tasty. And besides, as a southern california native, I'm no stranger to good Mexican food. Let's just say I was blown away.

The chips and salsa at a buck is a damn good deal, but you may opt against it if you have a small appetite and are worried about filling up. 

Before you correct me, I'm well aware that this is not traditional nor authentic mexican food. Infact, it's pretty obvious from the moment you walk in that it was never the chef's intention to be traditional or authentic. It is truly the work of a visionary that produces such culinary magic.

On our first visit, my girlfriend opted for the Inca salad and a carne asada taco while I went with the chicken paella. The salad is delectable-- the many greens and herbs dance on your tongue and the satisfying crunch of the quinoa keeps you wanting more and more. The carne asada tacos are phenomenal-- better than any I have ever tasted from the most authentic taco stands you can think of. Salty but limey....i dont know how but it was just amazing.

The chicken paella is excellent. The many vegetables, the tenderness of the rice and the perfect amount of seasoning make it a very savory and satisfying dish without being greasy. Just. Damn. Good.

That's not to mention the cool vibe here. Servers are friendly, (if not a bit frazzled at times) and the artwork is neat and modern. Just come here, it's worth the trip from anywhere in the valley.
