Great place for authentic Mexican food. Having been the Valley for five years now and trying multiple Mexican restaurants, this place is one of the best there is. Atmosphere is very quaint and nice, and great drink selections. Tried the smoked chicken enchiladas and they were amazing. Everyone check this place out.
