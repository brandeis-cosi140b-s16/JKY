If you're a late night eater and don't know what you're craving for this is the place to go!
I've seen this place when I go get gas at the chevron next to it, but never ate here. Around 1am me and my boyfriend were hungry so I came to find this place on yelp. What got me at first was their late night happy hour (11p-2am). $2 margaritas? Can't beat that. 
So we got here around 1am and our server/bartender was Matt. Really friendly guy, easy talker, etc. customer service was on point. I order the taco Tijuana carne asada and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Food came out and portions were decent, but really sold us on was the taste of the food! Hands down best Mexican food we have tasted before (maybe even better than Lindo's). 
Matt gave us some insight about the cook who is really passionate about what he does and even though it's after midnight, you expect food to be blah right? No not even like that. The chef knows what he's doing. 
We will definitely be back for the drinks, food, and customer service.
