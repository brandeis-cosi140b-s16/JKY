WOW I love this place!  Yep it is in a little shopping center off Central.  Small bar and dining area but service is quick and friendly.  I have had a variety of dishes here.  

The salsa that comes out when you first sit down is my fav of any mexican place in town.  Not to watery and not too chunky - just right!

The margaritas are HUGE and the perfect refreshment on a sunny day.  The enchiladas and taco salads are plentiful and just the right amount of spicy.  

There are TVs around and the wait staff is so sweet they have let us change the channel if we are looking for a specific game.  So sweet!

Love it here!
