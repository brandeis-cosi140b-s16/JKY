Come one come all... the holy grail of burritos.  Try tomatoes, potatoes and rice.  Find a spot to park next to the Hummer, the cop car, the fire truck, the Mercedes, and the VW bus, order your 10 lb burrito (which will cost you about the same as a double tall vanilla latte) and pop a squat at one of the picnic tables.  Worthy of a pilgrimage.
