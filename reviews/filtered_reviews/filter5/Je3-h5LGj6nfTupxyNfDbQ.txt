How do you make America better?  Give her a second Taco Shop on 7th Ave and Campbell and let her feed the masses!!

The addition of this restaurant to our community is a welcomed one.  The space that the taco shop took over has been everything under the sun and not been able to stand the test of time!!

The service at either of these two restaurants is always beyond exceptional, greeting you when you first walk through the door and beyond.  I just finished lunch and can't wait to go for dinner!!
