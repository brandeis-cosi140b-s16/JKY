My wife and I came here twice for the happy hour and the tacos. The $3 Mimosas were amazing and the staff was awesome. Props to Manager Jason Goetz for comping our meal because 1. There was a hair in our Guacamole and 2. A fly flew in my wifes champaigne. Phenomenal service. I ended up tipping the waitress the entire amount of our tab. Will be back again soon.
