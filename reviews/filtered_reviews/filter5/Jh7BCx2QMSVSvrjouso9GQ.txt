This place won best neighborhood Mexican restaurant from the New Times for a reason.  Great food for cheap prices.  Carne asada Tacos are perfect, and double-tortillad as they should be.

Awesome salsa bar, some of the better salsa I have had, and am a self professed expert, heh.  Highly recommend the Mexican shrimp cocktail as well.  My wife's boss, whose family is from Mexico, states that the breakfast burrito is to dir for.

They are in the middle of an expansion which will add much needed seating.  I just wish they would stay open after midnight.
