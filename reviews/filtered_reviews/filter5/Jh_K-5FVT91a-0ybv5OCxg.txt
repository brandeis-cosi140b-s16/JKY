Laura and I went in to Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch on our day off yesterday.  We were both really hungry as we hadn't ate all day and it was a good thing because I didn't even finish my plate.  

I ordered the cantaloupe agua fresca and the tinga quesadilla.  The agua fresca was awesome full of flavor and even a very nice presentation.  I am a huge fan of chicken tinga so anyplace that serves it gets an A in my book.  This place is another perfect example of that.  The quesadilla  was awesome lots of meat inside along with a great sauce and cheese on the top.  

This place rocks and I will be back for sure.  Laura even made the comment this is the first place she has ate at that makes her feel like back home in Mexico flavorwise.
