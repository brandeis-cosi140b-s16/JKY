We had dinner on Sunday May 10 and we have to say best food in Las Vegas for us.

My husband had the beef chimichanga which it was delicious.  I ordered the rib eye steak which it was a little to fatty for me. The waiter without any hesitation apologized took my plate and brought me back another steak which was unbelievable super tasty and tender.

Great food and service!!

Thanks Bill and Maria
