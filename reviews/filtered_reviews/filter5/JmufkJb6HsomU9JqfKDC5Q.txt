Picture this... it's the evening after a long day in the sun, lots of walking, lots of sight-seeing, lots of day-drinking and oh so many Scottsdale sun dresses.  Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.

Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).

In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.

I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the "best I've ever had" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens.
