A friend of mine, who has lived here over 20yrs with his family, constantly badgered me to get to this place.  Finally, I had a weekend without travel or other plans and I gave in to the drive to Mesa for what was supposed to be awesome food.  

THIS FOOD GOES TO 11....

As I have grown older, I seem to be sweating more when I eat hot foods.  The salsa alone made me ask the waiter for a kitchen towel.  Both the red and green salsas packed a great bunch of heat, but not the crappy "burn the crap out of your mouth" type of heat.  It was a slow, mellow burn, with FLAVOR!  I knew I was in for a great meal.  I had to order a red chili tamale, and a carne adovada burro.  The chunks of roasted pork reminded me of the best osobucco I had ever cooked.  I cleared the plate and ever since I left the restaurant, I have this yearning to return.  I'm obsessed now... dreaming of when I can go back and eat more.
