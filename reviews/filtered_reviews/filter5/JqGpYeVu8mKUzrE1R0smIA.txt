This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for many years.  I usually get cheese enchiladas with the green sauce, and also a machaca taco on the side.  You can't go wrong with the two salsas brought to the table----both hot, a green one and a red one alongside warm chips.  But if you want something really spicy (delicious) try the steak picado.  The ambience, the vibe, the food----its been the best for a long time.
