I love Casa Ramos! The food here is amazing.  Very quick service. All food comes on piping hot plates so it stays hot while eating. Each person gets their own mini carafe of AMAZING salsa. I've been here many times and never had a bad experience. I can't recommend them enough. And the prices/value are incredible. There are so many other sub-par Mexican places and this one is a gem in my experience.
