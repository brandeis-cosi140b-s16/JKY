We have made several trips to Vegas this year, and since discovering El Dorado Cantina, we always eat here at least twice per stay. Come for the margaritas... Stay for the dessert. Food is fresh and tasty, plenty to eat here!

If you are looking for the best Mexican food in Las Vegas...look no further.
