I really like this place.  I wish it were a little closer to my work, I'd go more often.

The meals are cheap and you get a lot of good quality food. 

One time while I was here, one of the customers was asking the waitress about the tacos after he had finished his lunch.  He was interested in ordering them some way that he used to order them, but that they had taken off the menu for some reason.  She told him that they still made them that way if you asked, and he got a little disappointed that he hadn't ordered those for lunch that day.  She ended up giving him a couple of them to go for free because he didn't know they still made them the way he was asking.  Nice service.
