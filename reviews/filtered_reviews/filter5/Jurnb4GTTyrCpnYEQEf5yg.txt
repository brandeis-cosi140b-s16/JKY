My friends and I meet at the Modern often; usually once a week from September through May.  We LOVE the staff; the bartenders are fun, upbeat, polite, and attentive.  The tacos are to die for! The home-made chips are snappy, light, and delicious. A year ago, my favorite bartender was Kat as her margs are FABULOUS!!! Now she manages the bar and is just as friendly, professional, and eager to please the customers as she was behind the bar.  

We love our favorite waiter Jim who attends to our culinary needs and keeps our glasses filled while providing a laugh here and there!  Our group is stunned with the mixed reviews on Yelp as we have only compliments for Julian and his staff in this wonderfully fun restaurant. Love, love, love the music, the food, the drinks, the prices, and most of all, the staff.

It's a great experience and a perfect location; still can catch the old Phoenix breeze on the outdoor porch when the heat is gone.  My friends and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Modern Maragrita. It has become a regular treat for us to visit, laugh, eat, and drink.
