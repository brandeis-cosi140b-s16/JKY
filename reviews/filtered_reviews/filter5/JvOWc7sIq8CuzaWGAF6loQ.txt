The atmosphere was great, we were in and out in an hour, on Saturday night. Table side guacamole was great, it would have been nice to have a choice of spice/hot level. The Birdsong Jalape√±o APA (American Pale Ale), was a great beer, it is a full body beer with a hint of pepper that fads away, making it easy to drink. My wife got the house margarita (frozen) and said it was one of her favorites.
