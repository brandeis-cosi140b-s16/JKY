I have been here 4 or 5 times now, and haven't had a bad meal yet. But the meal I had tonight topped them all, and will go down as one of the best and most memorable meals I have had in Vegas. I had the Florentine chicken nachos, and they were amazeballs. And this is still the ONLY Mexican restaurant in Vegas (land of 1,000 Mexican restaurants) that has the white queso dip that isn't spicy. Why is that? That fact alone guarantees that I will keep coming here, and that cheese was the whole reason I stopped in tonight. The service is top notch, the atmosphere is great, and though a little pricey, the food is good quality and huge portions. I love this place.
