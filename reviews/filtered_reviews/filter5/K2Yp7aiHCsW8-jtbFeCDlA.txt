I often pass by this tiny hole in the wall, but today I finally had a chance to taste the burgers. I purchased the Paradise Burger and it was absolutely wonderful! The buns was just done right and the patties were seasoned perfectly. I love the idea of having slices of cucumber in the burger and the onions that they use makes the burger oh so good! I will come definitely come back! One of the best burgers I have ever tasted! 

I recommend!!
