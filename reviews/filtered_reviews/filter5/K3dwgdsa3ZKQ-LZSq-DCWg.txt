Totally yummy!! Awesome service, great drinks and the food was perfect. 3rd night in Phoenix and we hit a winner!  Chips served with this wonderful cilantro type spread started then we shared the duck tacos and short rib tacos.  I think I liked the short ribs the best.  The service was so nice, vibe was good and the food was very tasty.  Not sure when we'll get down to Phoenix again but if we do, I'm definitely going back!
