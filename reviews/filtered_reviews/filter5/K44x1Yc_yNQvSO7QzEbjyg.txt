This place was highly recommended by a Seattle friend who had lived in Phoenix for years. I was desperately looking for a weekend breakfast place after a month living in the valley. 

WHY GO THERE? My friend's exact words were: "I'm about to change your life. Tomorrow go to Dick's Hideaway on 16th and Bethany Home. And it doesn't stand for what you think it does. There's no sign so look up the address. Be prepared to wait or eat at the bar. No bullshit the best breakfast place if not restaurant in the world."

He wasn't  kidding when he said no business sign out the building. We almost missed the place, but it's worth the second drive around the block.

WHATCHAGOT? I got the Tenderloin Benedict, which is not cheap for a breakfast entree, but all worth it. My companion had the Huevos Rancheros. I love protein in my breakfast. Remember when they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day? At Dick's Hideaway, it's the truth!

YOU GOT SERVED. Service is quick and friendly. Water is brought out as soon as you're seated. The food is hot, and so is the metal plate it's on. 

I'm glad to find this hidden gem. Dick, whoever you are, you can come out of hiding.
