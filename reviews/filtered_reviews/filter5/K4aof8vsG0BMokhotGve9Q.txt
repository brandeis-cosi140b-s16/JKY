Phat Phranks is a short drive from my house and have been meaning to try it for some time now. The  6am to 6pm hours made it very difficult for me to eat there. They really should change to 8a-8pm at the very least so people could try it out after work. I am not a good morning person so chances were slim me trying to before work and after work it is closed already. I am so glad I finally go to test out Phat Phranks. It is right off the 215 and decatur. 

I had the breakfast burrtio with egg and cheese and a bean and cheese tostada. The breakfast burrito was excellent. The only one better in town is at Nordstrom Cafe but for the price and the flavors packed into it, this is a solid #2. The Tostada was good but nothing too special. The food gets 4 stars. Frank  was the one taking the order and ringing you up. The family is the ones cooking and serving and they were very friendly, attentive and you get the feeling you are in their home and not in their place of business. There are so many businesses in Las Vegas that need to take a lesson from Phat Phrank's and learn what real service is. So with good food and service as good as good as it gets, not to mention an indy family owned place Phrank's easily get's 5 stars in my book. Support it and do it regularly because places like this need our support to survive. They are a rarity in Las Vegas and I will be doing my part supporting Phrank so I have options other than chains to go to.
