Stopped in for some chips and salsa and to kill some time, best decision we made! Chips were warm and freshly made- salsa was also from scratch the way it should be and so tasty with the perfect amount of spice.

The owner was in and able to recommend the fish tacos, amazing! We had a nice mix of fish, beef and potato all of which were off the hook! 

To make everything even better it was happy hour and we didn't even know it! Ended up feeding 4 of us for $14! Honestly one of the best values I've ever received for quality made to order food! 

Highly recommended if you are in the area! 

(It's probably relevant to mention that we are from Arizona where good Mexican food is easy to find, this is some of the best we've had!) 

Enjoy
