I went here a couple times during a business trip.  Frank and staff are very friendly and make you feel right at home.  If you get a chance to talk to them they really care about the quality of their food.

I've tried the adobada, carne asada, and carnitas soft shell tacos, carnitas torta and bacon breakfast burrito.  The tacos are larger than most taco shops I frequent.  That is a plus!  I breakfast burrito will hit the spot anytime of the day.  The torta is also pretty big and is delicous!  I personally like the green sauce with all those items.    

I know I will be back in the are for business and I'll be stopping by to visit!
