I loved it! I guess I have a knack for really liking places that other reviewers don't! The decor is reminiscent of the now defunct (that I didn't like so well) Dos Caminos at the Palazzo. The service was attentive and our water glasses were never empty which I always appreciate. 

We ordered queso fundido to start. It was the perfect spiciness/creaminess/cheesiness blend. Actually, it was probably my favorite part of the meal. Also included with the meal was a set of three salsas--including a green salsa which I adored. 

I ordered cheese enchiladas with both red and green enchilada sauces on the side. They were both really good! I preferred the green because I love tomatillos like a fat kid loves cake, which is almost as much as I love rap songs that are ten years old. 

We left stuffed and happy--always a good thing in my book!
