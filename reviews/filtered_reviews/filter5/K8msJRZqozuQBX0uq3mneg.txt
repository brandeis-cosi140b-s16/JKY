From the minute I stepped out of my car and saw the wall art that said, "Work hard &  be cool to people," I knew this was going to be an amazing place. The door this was next to seemed more like a back entry but either way, I was still greeted with smiling faces and helpful people. 

It wasn't busy so the host gave us a choice of sitting indoors or outdoors. We chose outdoors since it was incredibly nice out. Our server helped us out with drinks right away. We were celebrating so we went with a pitcher of beer to start, but I do love the option or ordering a, "short one," here. It's just a choice a lot of places don't really offer anymore, so kudos for that Joyride! 

Moving along, I ordered a crispy fish taco and the Mexican street corn. Both really, really good and super tasty next to our beer choice. I highly recommend at least one crispy fish taco while you're here! 

But let's get back to the design of the place. Like all of the uptown restaurants, it's got it's own flavor of trendy design. Be sure to check out the wall next to the bathroom, it's interactive. When I was there, it said, "In this life, I will..." and guests can contribute whatever they want to the wall. Oh, and it you're chewing gum, make sure to use one of their cute little gum things (in the sugar caddy) to dispose of it before you eat. They are so cute! 

My only regret is that we got here a little before Happy Hour and had not realized it until after we ordered, but that's our bad. I'll be back for it! Really amazing place! Check it out for yourself!
