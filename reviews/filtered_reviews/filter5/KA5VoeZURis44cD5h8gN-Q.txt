I drive 20 miles at least once a week to eat here...and I would drive further if I had to.
The other reviews are right...this place is fantastic - and we discovered it totally by accident.
My son works in the area and I had picked him up for lunch and we were going to go to Coco's - and I saw this when we pulled in and said 'let's try there..' - it was the beginning of a love affair.
When my son tells me he has eaten there during the week... I start drooling - while writing this, I know there will be a trip in the next 24 hours.

I love all the salsas - the guac ROCKS! And yes - I wish with all my might the chips were different - fresh - but I will live with it if I have to - because the rest is SO good! The carne asada is tender, flavorful and juicy - the barbacoa has JUST the right amount of juniper! The fish tacos are to die for...after reading all the reviews i will have to try the raspados - and the horchata is awesome!

If you are in the area you are stupid if you don't eat here - if you aren't in the area...drive there and don't be stupid - YOU MUST EAT AT THIS RESTURANT!!!
