The food was fantastic and the tacos have a lot of meat/fish in them, so two is enough and I tend to be a big eater

Their corn salsa was awesome as well (I'm usually not a fan of corn salsa)

I took the bartender's recommendation and got their two most popular tacos, the mahi and wahoo.  Just fantastic flavors.

I don't do the accompanying sauces so they may be better or worse with those added (I hate Mayo and sour cream)

I do know the seasonings on their own were fairly bold and grabbed the taste buds just right.  

The decor is great and makes you feel almost like you're about to hit the beach.  It was a great start to my vacation with my brother.  

NoDa is a pretty cool neighborhood as well so be sure to walk around a bit

Cabo Fish Taco is where I think I will be going from now on when I land in your fair city
