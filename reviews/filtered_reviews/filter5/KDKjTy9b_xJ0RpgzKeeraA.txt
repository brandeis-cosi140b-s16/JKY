Z'Tejas never disappoints! Make sure to make reservations as it's delicious and fills up quickly!

Happy hour was pretty decent, 5 dollar drinks and apps ranging from 6 to 8. We always get the Tejas trio-chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso. Love that every meal also comes with fresh cornbread that you can take home. This is something we haven't had at any other restaurants, and it makes th dinner unique! I always get either the diablo pasta (delicious) but tried the Baja tacos this time. I had a couple of requests and the kitchen was very accommodating. My fianc√© switches between burgers and fajitas and is always happy with his meal.

Our server was fantastic. Made great recommendations and was efficient with getting everything to us. I'd reccamend this place to anyone!
