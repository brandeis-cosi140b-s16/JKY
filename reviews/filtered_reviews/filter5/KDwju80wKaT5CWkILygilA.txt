I'm waiting for  the McKellips restaurant to open again after the fire in March.  We lived in San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico for ten years and can appreciate all the many regional cuisines throughout Mexico. I think this restaurant has taken dishes from many areas of Mexico, some unfamiliar to those who only know Americanized dishes or one region. A good friend loves Tia Rosa and took us there shortly before the fire. All five of us enjoyed the experience very much, though our differing tastes reacted differently to our meals. I had the pork chile verde burrito and loved it. My partner had an enchilada dish and wanted more heat.  I tipped the roving mariachis five bucks to hear "Las Ma√±anitas" which is the Mexican version of "Happy Birthday to You" but far prettier. The setting is beautiful and felt very much like our favorite restaurants in Mexico. Some of the dishes we didn't get to sounded authentic from the menu descriptions, others sounded Americanized. But most of their Mesa customer base probably wouldn't want some authentic dishes that I learned to love. Overall on the basis of one visit I was very pleased with Tia Rosa and hope it reopens soon. The other location isn't as convenient for us but we'll probably go there soon in the meantime.
