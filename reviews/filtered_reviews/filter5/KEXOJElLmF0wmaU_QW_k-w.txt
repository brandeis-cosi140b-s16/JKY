Other yelpers will disagree, but I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in town. The food, decor, and service are all top notch.

I love the little things about this restaurant. Guacamole is made table side, tortillas are crispy yet chewy, chicken breasts are butterflied, and the salsa is spicy without being overwhelming. Everything adds up to create an enjoyable dining experience.

Of particular note is the mole. It is smooth, rich, complex, and somewhat spicy. The mole is so layered that it is impossible to discern all of the ingredients. However, they blend and play with each other to create something that is close to magic.

For a nice low calorie treat that's sure to delight your Vegan friends, try the Quesa Fundido con Rajas. Ok, so it's not low calorie. But you really should try it at least once a year. The hot cheese wrapped in chewy tortillas is beyond words.

One of my favorite parts about Zapatas is that it is a community restaurant. I always see people in uniform here, whether they are from the police department or Nellis. People meet here after work, come here on dates, and bring their families. We always bring our out of town guests here. 

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.
