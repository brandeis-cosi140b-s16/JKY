I was really surprised this place wasn't busy. The concept is the same as chipotle, you can get a burrito, bowl, tacos, or salad. The place was real clean and good looking. The music made you feel at home. Big portions and if you show your rebel ID you get a free fountain drink. The food was delicious and full of flavor!
I will definitely be coming back!
