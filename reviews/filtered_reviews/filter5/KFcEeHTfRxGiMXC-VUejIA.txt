If you love tacos (who doesn't) than come to this place. It's amazing tasting tacos and the price is nice to take in too. Located right by UNLV, and it's a small chill restaurant. One taco is $1.75, on Tuesdays they have a $1.25 taco special. The ingredients in the taco aren't too overbearing over Eachother because the way they make it is just right. The owners are always there, so you really feel at home eating there. I think this place isn't well known, which is why it's empty everytime I go, but it makes it fast to get your food which is good so no waiting hahah. Def recommend this place!
