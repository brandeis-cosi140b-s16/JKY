Ate here once a week, sometimes twice, while I lived in Vegas. This is the most wonderful little Mexican restaurant I've ever dined at. The service and food remained consistent for years, since my first time in '09. I'm so in love with Mama Maria's that I rhyme. I don't miss Vegas, I miss this restaurant.

I had a few coworkers who feel the way I do. First, the salsa. Perfect. We'd finish at least two bowls and take it to go, too. Garlicky, cilantro heaven. Unlike any other salsa. Beans and rice? Pretty standard, but somehow tasted better on my go-to shrimp taco plate. Flour tortillas, please! Succulent, buttery shrimp, with the cheese perfectly melted on the tortilla. No one does it this way. Pico, lettuce, add guacamole... Simple? Absolutely. And yet, nowhere makes it taste like this!

Service is always phenomenal. Over the years there were a few different waitresses, most of them remembering my order. All managing the full (small) restaurant on their own. Chef always waves. Hole in the wall? Slightly. You'll get over it.
