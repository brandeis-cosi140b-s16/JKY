This is the best Mexican seafood restaurant I've been to.  Yum, yum, yum.  I loved the chips and green salsa.  The draft beer comes in a huge margarita-like glass, enough for two people to share if you don't want too much to drink.    The Camarones Culichi was heavenly.  The service is friendly and prompt.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, yet also festive.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the quality of the food and the complimentary ceviche before the main entree.  Absolutely everything was delicious.  This place should be packed on a Saturday night, although it's okay with me if just a few people know about this culinary gem.  I want to try their tequila have my next birthday celebration here--drinks, awesome food, friendly staff--sounds like the perfect place for a party.
