Hands down best view and best Mexican restaurant I have been to in greater Las Vegas area.  They give you chips, beans and salsa when you are seated.  Their horchata is the best I have ever had, like ever.  I also get the Ensalada Marinara, which is shrimp, avocado, tomato, onions, cilantro, jalapenos and lime juice inside two avocado shells.  Amazing!!!  They do fun birthday songs with sombreros, cake and tequila shots.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and fun.  And you just can't beat the view.
