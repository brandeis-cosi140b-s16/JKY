Amazing tamales as always!  My family has been coming here for about 40 years.   Not always at this location...used to just be a walk up counter back in the 70's.  I live in Colorado now but nobody's tamales even come close to Do√±a Maria's.   I bring home two dozen each time I visit.  The chicken are my favorite but the pork are also great.
