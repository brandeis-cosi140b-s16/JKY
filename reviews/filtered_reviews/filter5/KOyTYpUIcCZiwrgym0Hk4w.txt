Well, as this place is 4.5 stars after 144 reviews, it's not like I am going to share anything that will ruin the secrecy of this place and just how great it is!

I had plans to bring one friend here who is Dia De Los Muertos obsessed.  She blew me off, but I was so looking forward to it, I talked two other friends into joining me to check out a new spot.

The gal is a jamiaca fiend, and was thrilled with the drink.  Having read reviews on the size of the horchata, I convinced the guy to share one with me, we could always get another if we needed it.  (We didn't)  WOW - no other horchata will ever measure up!

Yes, the salsa bar ROCKED!  We sampled 6 or 7 of them.  I could live off the jicama, cilantro, jalepeno and lime tastiness!  And the hot red one that looked greasy had the most amazing heat/flavor ratio I could imagine ever encountering.  Truly, the acme salsa!

Being indecisive, I went a la carte with the tacos.  One each of the cochinita pibil, one chicken mole and one carne asada.
I was busy having a foodgasm with the cochinita when the gal freaked on her carne asada, making the guy have some - and they both agreed it is better than America's Taco Shop!  (Mine had to sit and wait while I was having quality alone time with the last bites of the pork.)

I will say I wasn't thrilled with the mole.  This is NOT a knock on how La Condesa does it - and if you're a mole fan, it may be amazing.  I'd never actually had mole - turns out I am just not a fan of the overall flavor.  But I love almost all Mexican food, and I love chocolate!  How is this possible!  Two rights making a wrong?  Weird!

That said...I will be back.  Over and over!  This is definitely on the short list of places to have a quick, great meal in my hood!
