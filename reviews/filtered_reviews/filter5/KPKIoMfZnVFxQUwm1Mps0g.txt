Well well...  It's tough to top this place for Mexican cuisine. From the the filet and shrimp to the fish tacos. Even the the chips, bean dip and naked guacamole is amazing. Yumm. The tequila selection is top shelf. I can always find an amazing treat in the repo's to the extra's.  Service is beyond expectations, Arnoldo is our guy!Suggestions, selections and spectacular delivery!  This is tied for my favorite Mexican restaurant in the U.S.
