Can I push this nasty half star from a full five problem over the edge....? Don't know, don't care. In my professional life of eating an assortment of awesome tacos, this one is pretty stellar and gets my FULL FIVE!
I crave taco tastiness in fine establishments and dirt holes (this is neither of the above). If they have good food, who cares, right? Atoyac (I pronounce I-O Tech...but my Spanish is not that great, I think it is Ah Toy ach) is SADLY not open on Sundays or Mondays. This is sad because I usually need some sort of tasty awesomeness to beat Mondays. That being said I will take Taco Tuesday! Try every kind. I have not had the CABESA yet. I am working my way up to it...like a runner. My friend and I ordered about 24 tacos for our work group. The guy taking our order swears he has had that many in one sitting. Wow that is dedication to your job. Gold star.
Others swear by the burritos served here. I guess I will have that as my side next time I go there. Is it Tuesday yet?
