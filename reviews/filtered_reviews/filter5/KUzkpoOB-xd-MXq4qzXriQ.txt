Great "quick service" Mexican food.  Nothing too fancy, the food here is great.  Line can be long at times, so I always call the order in about 10 minutes before I get there.  

Not everything is amazing, but their best items can't be beat.  In my opinion, here are their items, in order of awesomeness:

1) Marinated Pork Burrito
1a) Shrimp Taco (Fish is great too)
2) Bombero Burrito  (very spicy, so watch out)

After those, it's all about personal taste.  Great place, high recommended.
