My parents have been coming here since the 80s, so I've been a lifetime patron, literally. Although I don't live close by, I try to come here about once a month for my fix of that salsa, omg! Elmer's is the nicest hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant I've ever visited. While it's definitely fast food, it is 10,000x better than a Filiberto's or any other fast food Mexican place. 

Everything on the menu is great, but I always order the beef machaca burrito. Do it! So flavorful and juicy; I've never had better machaca anywhere else! If I'm here with my fam, we will order "strips" (chips and cheese) and a cheese quesadilla to share. The horchata is good but can be a little gritty at times. Elmer's makes their salsa in-house and serves it in squeeze bottles at each table. My brother and I fight over it, so we grab two bottles since we cannot share. They sell little salsa packets you can take home - I never leave without a few!
