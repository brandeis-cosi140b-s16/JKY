Great food.  I don't ever make a vegas trip without stopping by...

I've had the campechana,  the shrimp wrapped in bacon.... And of course the micheladas.

Campechana is fresh...  Squid, shrimp, abalone, oysters...  cucumbers, tomaties avocado...  Where other mariscos places fail is allowing this concoction to get watery.  It kills the taste...  but islitas manages to avoid that.

The shrimp wrapped in bacon changed my life.  I literally walked out a different person.  Shrimp...  wrapped in bacon.  I mean come on??  

The micheladas are tomato juice, oyster sauce and beer of your choice. I like dos XX lager.

This place makes a great hang out for those of mexican descent.  There are conjuntos playing classic songs.  I'm not mexican so i don't care much for it.  But its still fun nonetheless.

The environment is a bit on the paisa side but what do  you expect from a mariscos joint?

The staff are really friendly and they are eager to serve.  Every time i visit they greet you with a smile and make great recommendations. 

I'm glad I was introduced to this place...  very glad. Thanks Ale!
