Spending many years in San Diego, I would say this is the closest to the top taco/burrito shops in SD. Tortilla's are the best in AZ, no reason they have been voted that years in and out. Grab a bag of tortillas for later.

FYI, try the Green Corn Tamales, not on their menu, but a hidden masterpiece at Carolina's.
