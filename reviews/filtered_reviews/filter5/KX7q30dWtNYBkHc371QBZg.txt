I was booking a bachelorette party brunch, and decided upon The Mission. The minute we walked in, I was a fan! I adored the chandeliers, the lighting, and all the other little details throughout the restaurant. Our waiter, Angel, was extraordinarily personable and accommodating. 

We started off our brunch with the fresh guac, made-to-order at your table. it was AMAZING! I could have just eaten it out of the bowl and called it a day. Several of my friends ordered the Pollo a La Brasa y Waffles. I had to try a bite and must say, the waffles were to DIE for! Pure maple with bits of bacon, poured over a cinnamon waffle?! Yes pleaseeeeeeeeeeee! Too bad I am on a competition diet. with that said, the kitchen was able to accommodate my special diet and prepared me a breakfast plate with grilled chicken and egg whites. I tried the grits that came on the side, and they were creamy deliciousness for sure! The Chilaquiles looked incredible and, based on feedback, both the red AND green were very tasty. 

I absolutely recommend The Mission to anyone looking for a great place for brunch. I would also HIGHLY recommend making reservations. I made mine a week in advance and was glad I did... the place really fills up quickly around 11:30!
