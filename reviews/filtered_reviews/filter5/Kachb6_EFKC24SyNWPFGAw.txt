A new gem in Sunnyslope. The staff is very friendly, the food is really tasty and the servings are generous, and they offer you a taste of all the meat preparations available - all of them good, but seeing that the other reviewers have mentioned their favorite, I have to say that my personal choice is pastor. With the aid of the large illustrated menu graphic above the counter, you choose your meat (asada, chicken, carnitas, barbacoa, tinga, pastor, adobada, cochinita pivil) or green chili or fish and shrimp. Then choose the style: tacos, burrito, open burrito (served like a salad, with a large warm tortilla on the side), wet burrito (covered with enchilada-like sauce), nachos, torta, pambazo, tostada, taco salad, macho fries, or quesadilla.  The servings are generous and very filling and the items are inexpensive, but should you think that you'll have room for sides such as rice or beans, these are available at very little additional cost. The dining area, with high and low tables and comfortable booths, is completely separate from the counter/ordering area and both areas have a really fun luchador theme - I love it!  Restrooms are clean and there is a separate, large handwashing area just outside of the restrooms. Everything about this place makes it stand out over and above the countless taco restaurants of the city.
