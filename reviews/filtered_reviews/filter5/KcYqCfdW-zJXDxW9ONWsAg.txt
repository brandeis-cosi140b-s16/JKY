Hands down, this is the best Mexican food in Charlotte. I don't care if I wrote a different review earlier giving another restaurant this superlative...this restaurant is THE BEST. They've recently changed the name and changed owners, but the food is the same high-quality, authentic Mexican food. The waitresses sometimes struggle with speaking English, which can be a little problematic when you are trying to convey that you don't want meat in your dish - but if you're a carnivore and you can just point to the menu item, then go for it. 

While you're there, try the Mexican Coke. It's got real sugar in it instead of the high-fructose corn syrup...and it tastes amazing.
