Lemme tell you something. 

This place is a non blood diamond diamond in the ruff/rough. Which is a diamond of diamonds if u ask me :)

The place is very CONSCIOUS and GREATLY PRICED and totally ORGANIC, non-gmo, with great vegan options

My bf and I got the veggie burrito and it was delish. The pulled chicken street taco was soo fluffy the chicken was YUMMY in my mouth! 

And the seafood enchilada was YUM. Tho the sauce on top was a bit spicy.
