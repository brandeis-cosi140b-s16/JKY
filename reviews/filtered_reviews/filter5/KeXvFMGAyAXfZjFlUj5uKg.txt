I have been to Casa Reyna many times in the past year for both lunch and dinner. This place is wonderful! The salsas are fresh and delicious.  I suggest the mango, and the peanut salsa. The queso is also very tasty. The margaritas are some of the best I have had.
The shrimp tacos are my go to for lunch. The crema sauce that comes drizzled on it is addictive.  For dinner the verde enchiladas are fantastic.  
The inside seating is nice, but the outdoor seating in summer makes the experience even better.
