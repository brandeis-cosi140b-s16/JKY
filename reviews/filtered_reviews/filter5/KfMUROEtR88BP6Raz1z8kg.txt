Love this place.  It is my go to when I have had a hard day.  While the inside is small, the artwork is great and really I mostly get my stuff to go.

Meat:  Carne asada is great, chicken is great, marinated pork is nice and spicy, carnitas are awesome.

Burritos:  Basic but tasted good.

Bombero: Wow, what an experience.  It is spicy enough you don't really want the marinated pork as it's filler, but it is wonderful no matter what you fill it with, the spicy sauce that is poured over it is what maked it.

Tacos: $1 tacos on Tuesdays!! (except they do charge 30 cents extra for flour tortillas instead of corn)  Tastes like what I fell in love with in Rocky Point street vendors.

Enchiladas: Excellent, nothing fancy but made right and is so good.

Will update as I change up my choices.
