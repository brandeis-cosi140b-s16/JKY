I travel all over the west (Modesto, SLC, El Paso, Denver, Etc.) and entertain myself by seeking out great food. In particular, I love authentic Mexican Food. Anywhere that serves grated cheddar gets kicked right to the curb.

This place is great! I'm down here for 4 days for the Ironman, and we ate dinner one night then returned the next afternoon for something different. 

The tacos were great, the Guacamole was great, the chips were good, salsa was great. It isn't the atmosphere capital of the world, but that always costs more and goes straight to the landlord. I even ate something I didn't like for lunch made from Shrimp....but I recognize it was still great food.

If you're in Tempe and looking at a short walk over from run of the "Mill Street" chain restaurant hell, take the walk!!!
