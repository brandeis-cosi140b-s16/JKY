This place is amazing! The food is wonderful (although some are better than others) and the service is generally very nice. I had the price fix menu (a great option). I went here with my parents for my 21st birthday, and I have never experienced such wonderful food. First was the appetizers - We had the sampler (which for me, since I'm gluten- intolerant, was altered). It contained two plantain empanadas and the most exquisite thing I've ever eaten in my life - a green corn tamale. It was sweet and just wonderfully delicious. Then came dinner - a HUGE and perfectly cooked portion of premium grade steak with a small fresh field salad, mole and aoli. Divine. Then dessert - the most rich and wonderful gluten free chocolate cake ever. With vanilla bean ice cream. This place is amazing. I would recommend this place for those of you with gluten intolerance because its amazing. But skip the shrimp.
