I know Border Grill from Santa Monica, so I knew the food would be good. I was surprised how it seemed even better in Vegas. We got the ceasar salad, the skirt steak and the grilled fish tacos and every bite was amazing. We had a waiter, Jimmy, who treated us like we were fine dining and took care of us with such care even though I know he was busy. This Border Grill experience had that out for dinner, special vibe because of the food, service and decor. Impressive! 
I don't think it's a 2 money sign place though. It's more expensive than that. I did bring a www.restaurant.com coupon for $25 off which makes it more fun.
