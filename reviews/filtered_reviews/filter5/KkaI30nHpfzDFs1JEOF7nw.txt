I just went to the newest Spotted Donkey Cantina on Hayden and was so impressed with the food & ambiance!  The decor and lighting is aboslutley fantastic, and the restaurant is very versatile as it offers a bar/nightlife scene but also a dining atmosphere and two outdoor patios.  The food's presentation was exquisite and I am SERIOUSLY in love with the stuffed peppers!  Literally the best I've ever tasted!  They are filled with pork, cheddar-jack cheese, spanish rice in a tomato basil sauce.  And, the shrimp ceviche was also incredible--- very fresh and flavorful with fresh pineapple and avocado!  To boot, their margaritas are very tasty offered in lime, blood orange (the best!), prickly pear, mango and strawberry flavors!  Needeless to say, this is a must go restaurant!  Can't wait to go back soon!
