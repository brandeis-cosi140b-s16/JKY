This restaurant originated in Heber.  I spent lots of time up here as a teenager, and Heber brings back lots of good memories, so I liked this place before I ever set foot in the door, and when I did, oh my.  

This place is fan freakin tastic.  Food was great, service was great,  there was even a mariachi band on Saturday night.  

The amount of food you get, we both had another meal the next day.  We both got the taco, cheese enchilada and red burrito plate that comes with rice and beans.   Red chili meat was plentiful, very tender and tasty.  Taco had lots of tender juicy shredded beef.  But the best part of this plate was the cheese enchilada.  OMG it was good.  The enchilada sauce was definitely homemade.  I plan to go back to this place soon.   Rice and beans were good too.  Hot sauce was very spicy, and they had another option that wasn't as spicy too.  And we both got a soda.  Bill was under $27.  

I'm serious, try it.
