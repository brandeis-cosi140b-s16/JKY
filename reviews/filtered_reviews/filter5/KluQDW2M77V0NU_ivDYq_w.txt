My mouth is salivating just from writing this review. I recently moved out of state and out of everything, friends included, Rito's Burritos are what I miss most. Juicy burritos full of flavor and filling as well... which means a lot to me because I eat like a man.

...Although the staff all look/act like they're employed against their will... that's the only bad thing I can say about this place. Delicioso!
