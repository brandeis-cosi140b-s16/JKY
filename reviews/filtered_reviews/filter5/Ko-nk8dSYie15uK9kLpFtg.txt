I absolutely love this place. Even more, I love bringing people here for the first time. The experience of eating here begins before you even step foot in the restaurant. You have to know where to go since there is no outside sign. Once you are in, it is probably unlike any restaurant you've been to - feels much more like a dive bar (in a good way!). I always choose to sit along the bar so I can watch the food being prepared. The dishes are huge and packed with flavor. If you haven't been before, definitely make sure to try it. And if you have an out of town guest, this is the perfect place to bring them.
