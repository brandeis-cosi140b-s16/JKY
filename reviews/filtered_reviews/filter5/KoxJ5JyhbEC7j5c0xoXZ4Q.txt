Perfect atmosphere on the patio and excellent food. We just wanted a light bite so we ordered a half dozen different tacos and some pico de gallo with shrimp and avocado. (not sure what it was called?) We loved every bit of it. The service was great. Friendly and walked us through the menu. I highly recommend Barrio Queen! We'll be back soon!
