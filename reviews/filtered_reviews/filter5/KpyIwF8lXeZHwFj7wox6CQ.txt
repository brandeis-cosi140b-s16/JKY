AWESOME place to have mexican in Las Vegas.  Situated between the Strip and Fremont St., this huge restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.   I love their margaritas, the streak is always tasty, I love their bean dip and chips and sauces and salsa. The staff is attentive and patient(i come with my 95 year old uncle)  Really great place to eat!  Plenty of handicap an street parking.
