Hunting for authentic Mexican food??  La Santisima is the REALS!! They have over a dozen salsas in their salsa bar and let you help yourself with the complimentary basket of chips.  I ordered (2) Carne Asada and (1) Al Pastor taco and added the rice and beans for a total of $8.97.  Let me start by saying your food comes out piping hot on a hot plate.  The food is made fresh and it shows.  The refried beans were delicious, really creamy, and flavorful. The rice was not dry and also way above average in taste.  The Asada was so flavorful and tender. Definitely better than most places I frequent. The beef was not chewy at all and has an almost melt in your mouth consistency.  The Al Pastor was also amazing with all fresh ingredients including the pineapple.  If you're in the Coronado area, do yourself a favor and check out this little gem!
