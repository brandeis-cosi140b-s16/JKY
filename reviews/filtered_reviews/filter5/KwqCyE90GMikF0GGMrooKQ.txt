One of my most cherished spots for the last 15 years and home of the Best Margaritas in Las Vegas.  When you walk in prepare to be hit with an authentic Sante Fe New Mexico feel and a southwestern food with a slight twist. Free chips, salsa, and re-fried beans wet your appetite for an experience that is sure to lift the spirits. I normally stick with the carne asada or flautas but I've never had a bad meal in 15 years at this place.
