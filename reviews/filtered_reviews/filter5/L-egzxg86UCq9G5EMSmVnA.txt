Chayo is next to The Linq and offers fresh, gourmet Mexican fare. Great place to stop and grab a bite after riding the High Roller. I do have to say though, Christina was AMAZING! Super sweet, fast, checked in with us and always made sure our drinks were refilled. The food is really good but she made the experience memorable!!!! If you go ask to be seated with her- she'll make sure you're taken care of! If you're reading this,thanks for the incredible service Christina!!!!!!
