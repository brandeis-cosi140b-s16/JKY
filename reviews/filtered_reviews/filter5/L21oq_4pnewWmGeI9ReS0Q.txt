Yum! PHX Burrito House is delish! I had the red chile beef tacos, and they were wonderful.  They came in soft, white corn tortillas that tasted freshly made.  My fianc√© had the carne asada burrito,  and he was raving about it (he's a Mexican food snob). We shared an order of chips and salsa too.  Great chips, even better salsa (it has a kick)! Check it out!
