My friend told me that Cafe Rio was an upscale Chipotle, and loving Chipotle I had to try. I am not a fan of Chipotles pork but she said i must try it here, and o my god was she right. I got the sweet pork barbacoa salad and it was delicious! The tortillas were fresh and the dressing is light and pairs perfectly with the rest of the salad. I am in love. The portions are also huge and a salad can last me lunch for 2-3 days. I always order to-go so i can not say much about the service except my food is always ready when they say it will be and have never had a rude cashier yet. MUST TRY!
