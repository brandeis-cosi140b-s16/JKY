5/21: I've been here a few times; every time has been awesome! I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants, although I can't imagine better tacos out there. 

These tacos are so good, fresh, and cheap...max value for $2 each! You can definitely leave here full and satisfied for under $10. 

I've had the Spicy Pork and Steak Tacos. The fries are awesome as well. 

TIP: Make sure you ask for the freshly cut pineapple if you get Spicy Pork! 

The chefs are pretty friendly as well. I love that you can watch them cut the meat from the rack and prepare your order. 

I even overheard some guy at the Bellagio say "Tacos El Gordo." The word is out. Just about everyone will love this place! 

Whenever the weather is nice, sitting outside can be very relaxing while eating these delicious tacos. 

Amazing food! I want some right now!
