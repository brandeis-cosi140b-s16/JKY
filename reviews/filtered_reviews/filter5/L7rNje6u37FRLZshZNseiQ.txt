I have to tell ya, man, I really, really like this place.  Sitting inside, even though it gets incredibly packed, is a comforting experience.  There's something about being in Phoenix in the Spring, before it gets too hot, munching on a burrito and wincing at the blinding sunlight bleeding in through the door that just makes me feel incredible.

People will bitch, and let them bitch; if they don't like this place, stay the fuck away, then.  This is MY joint.  

Pretty much the best thing they've got going on there is the green chili cheese tortilla.  It is something to behold.  Every single time I've been there, I've ordered one.  Even if what I order for lunch is plenty, I will have the green chili cheese tortilla for later and I'll zap it in the microwave and nom on it hours later.
