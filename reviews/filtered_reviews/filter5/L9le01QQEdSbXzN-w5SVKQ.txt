I had the pleasure of enjoying their anniversary special for a few precious days--Tacos were back briefly! Too late now, but those are some delicious corn treats. Green chile burro, succulently meaty and delicious as it is, comes second. If you're reading this, you're already ahead of the game--can't believe my dad never told me about this place.
