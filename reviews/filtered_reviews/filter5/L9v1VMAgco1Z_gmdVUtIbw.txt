Went there for the first time last week and I loved it. The moment we walked in, we were seated at the bar where the smiling waitress immediately gave us chips and salsa. As soon as we ordered our beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos, we had to wait about 5 minutes to get our food (and personally, I was so drawn into the soap opera on the TV, I hadn't even noticed). Everything was delicious. The meat and the tortillas were hot and fresh, sprinkled with cilantro and a splash of fresh lime. We devoured our meal in no time flat. 
The best part is that it was crazy cheap! We spent under $20 for two people with a ton of tacos and beer. I will definitely be coming back.
