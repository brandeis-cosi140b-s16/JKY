This is a go to lunch spot for my coworkers and I. Recently it has taken a while to get our food, but if you dont get here by 1130am during the week this place fills up very quickly. 

The chips and salsa are a must! 

I usually get the chicken taco's but we have ordered a lot of different dishes off this menu and we never had something we didn't like.
