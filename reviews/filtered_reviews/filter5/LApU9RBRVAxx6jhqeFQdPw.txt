Wednesday's Special (at least the last time I was there): Shrimp Enchilladas in a Chipotle Cream Sauce. OUTSTANDING! A personal favorite.

BUT, if it's not Wednesday and:
(a) You're starving: then get the Chicken & Cheese Enchilladas with the GREEN SAUCE! (this comes with rice & your choice of beans)
(b) You're hungry, but NOT starving: ask for (a) - a la carte, without the beans & rice!
(c) You're in the mood for fish: the battered fish tacos are scrumptious! Soft on the outside, crunchy on the inside!
(d) You just want apps: Batterred Rock Shrimp. Mmmm...

ALSO: If you're not a big fan of rice & beans (which I am not), you can always ask to order the entrees as a-la-carte items! This will knock a few bucks off your dish, for something that you wouldn't have eaten (and wasted) anyway!

Beware of the chips & salsa- they are tasty and plentiful, but save some room for your meal!

You can't go wrong!
