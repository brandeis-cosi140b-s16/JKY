Go first next door to 7-11 and get a Wild Cherry Slurpee. Then , when you eat the hot salsa , you have a cooling effect from the Slurpee. 

We had a Tlayuda with chicken(big enough to split)  and a Memelita with Carne Asada, a carne asada taco and  al pastor taco. We asked about a 100% chicharron memelita and owner said  "sure, we can put anything you want."

The 3 salsas everyone mention are all awesome, We bought some green salsa to go and would have gotten the red as well but they did not have enough as they needed to make a fresh batch. I take this as a good sign of fresh food. Just an excuse to go back :)    We  liked the jalapenos and onion they served, quite lovely and tasty. Even my friend who has a hesitation for hot stuff liked them. 

We also forgot to order the papa y chorizo fritter thangies-damn,  another excuse to go  back. 

Quite a haul from Goodyear but I have a plan. Go there for lunch, then take Glendale west to Ranch Market, get some supplies there (Pollo Asada), then go farther west to La Purisima for some fresh pastries and TORTILLAS!. 

This is my nomnom tour
