The customer service here totally rocks! We had a super nice waitress.  The servers and the bus boys work well together.  Chips, salsa, beans, drinks, never went empty! They were totally on top of it.  

I had the famous shrimp tacos.  It's grilled cheese/shrimp in 2 corn tortillas.  Pretty tasty.  I felt like the food was better than average, but the service here was so great, they're getting 5 stars.
