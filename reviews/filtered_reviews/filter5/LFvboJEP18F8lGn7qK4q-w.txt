We had a party of 22 that I made a reservation for, not realizing how small the restaurant is. While they couldn't guarantee that they'd have a table ready, they were able to seat ALL of us within ten minutes, and even added chairs for a few add-ons. The service was impeccable; one server managed to take care of our tables seemingly effortlessly. Everyone got their food at the same time. No mistakes. Deliciousness ensued. It was a wonderful dinner. Some of the best service and food we've had in Madison. I will definitely, definitely be going back.
