La Condesa, you stole my heart.  Gourmet Taco Shop indeed.  Your saucy mol√© put me over the top.

You really know how to spice up a relationship with your many wonderful salsas.

I loved your warm decor and warmer service.

I can't wait to come back to sample your salsas and try more tacos.

I finally made my way here to meet some friends on a trip to Phoenix about a month ago, then I met another friend here on my most recent trip.

$3.99 gourmet street tacos.  Filling.  20 or so salsas.  Delicious.
