My husband and I stopped by on a Taco Tuesday after work. We made it just in time for happy hour and decided to sit outside on the patio. (It had rained earlier that day so it was really nice out.) To start with, we ordered a half order of guacamole and two house margaritas. Since it was Taco Tuesday, all tacos were $2.50 (normally they are $3.50). There are tons of taco options and range from exotic to traditional. My husband ordered the crispy fish, Barrio Pollo, and Suadero Azteca whereas I ordered the Barrio Pollo and Chorizo, crispy shrimp, and carne asada. 

Our guac and drinks arrived first. The guacamole was good (it had dried cranberries in it) but nothing to write home about. The house margaritas were really good - fresh lime really made all the taste difference. Almost as soon as we finished the guac, our tacos arrived. We dug in eagerly and were soon in taco heaven. Crispy fish taco was similar to other ones we've had, ditto on the shrimp. What really stood out were the Pollo tacos - regular and with chorizo. The chicken was marinated in a delicious sauce that was really addictive. 

We overhead a waiter telling another couple that he eats the pollo tacos five days and week and if he left Barrio Queen on bad terms, he'd wear a disguise just so he could come back and eat the pollo tacos. My husband and I totally agreed - we agreed so much we ordered another round of pollo tacos (two apiece) to satisfy our addiction. During the second taco round, I ordered a Limon Y Coco margarita. (Coconut tequila with lime.) Oh my... this was the best margarita I've ever had. It was delicious. Even my husband agreed and tried to steal my drink. We both can't wait to come back for more pollo tacos and coconut margaritas. Watch out!
