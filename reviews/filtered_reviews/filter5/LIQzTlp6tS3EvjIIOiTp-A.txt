Catering was awesome!
We decided to try the catering for our office Christmas lunch. Zach, the catering manager was great to work with. The food was ready exactly when they said it would be, packaged and separated neatly, and organized. The portions were plentiful and the food was amazing. Everyone in the office seemed to like something different as their favorite thing. The meats are all fantastic, the guac is excellent and has a little "kick" to it. Do not walk out of there without the dessert bark! It is absolutely delicious. Even after having Christmas sweets overload, we could not stop eating the bark. 
Service was fantastic. They walked all of the food out to our car for us, made sure we had everything we needed, and truly treated us like valued customers.
