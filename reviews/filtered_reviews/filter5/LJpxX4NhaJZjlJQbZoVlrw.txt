this place is legit!!! probably the best Mexican food I've ever had.  tried the carne asada burrito and adobada burrito. they were both excellent but if I had to choose I'd say the carne asada wins in a close one. I highly recommend this place who wants freshly made and very delicious food. Can't miss. will be back to try rest of menu.
