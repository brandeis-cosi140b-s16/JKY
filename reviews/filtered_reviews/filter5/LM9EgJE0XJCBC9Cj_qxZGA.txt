FINALLY! 
I was able to have the Chino Bandido experience! I have been wanting to eat here for a while. I just happened to be in the area, so I had to stopped by this historic place!

First, when you walk in, you have the wall!! All of the press clippings, picture of Guy, and awards! Basically just bragging about yourself! Hey! If you're good enough, then you can back it up! And Chino Bandido can back it up! 

After you read all of the bragging rights on the wall, you walk in to the order area with a deer in front of the headlights look! They already know, they will direct you to their tasting station. Give you samples of their food. After you got a taste of their menu, the planning begins! 

I ordered:

Jerk rice, cuban black beans, Jen red pork, and chinese bbq pork. Now you have an option. You can have this Plain! Everything on the plate, or in a burrito, or in a quesadilla! I chose the quesadilla way. Now, i'm not going to lie! I had my thoughts about this! Fusing two kinds of food this way? And better yet, two of the most fattening foods? Before I get into details about their food, I wanted to say that their cuban black beans is the best! And I have had good black beans, heck my father in-law was from Cuba! My Jen Red Pork was in a quesadilla, and that was amazing. Then the mixture of the Jerk Fried rice, black beans, and the Chinese BBQ Pork! I did not expect this, this was one of the best place I have ever had! Boy am I glad I do not live near by! (I would be in a lot of trouble!) 

Their dining room is spacious, nothing special, but not needed. I had a great experience here. Not saying that everyone would like it. Remember, we all have a different taste. But looking at their reviews, it looks like they are doing really well.
