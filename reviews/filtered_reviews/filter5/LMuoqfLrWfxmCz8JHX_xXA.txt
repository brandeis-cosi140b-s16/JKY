I LOVE this place. I'm a huge fan of guacamole and I must say that this place knows what's up.  You can order it to be made fresh at the table and it's always delicious! I hate onions so the option to order fresh is a really big deal for me. I switch up my food options here and I've never been disappointed. If you love to drink, and lets be honest- who doesn't (besides my mother- hi mom), order a bulldog. It's a margarita with a beer in it so basically my idea of heaven on earth. They also give you this soup before your meal and I'm obsessed with it. I have one more thing to add (while I have your attention) it's one of those restaurants where they give you a free shot on your birthday so it's literally someone's birthday there every 5 minutes which I think is pretty funny. They also have really great views if you request a seat by the window.
