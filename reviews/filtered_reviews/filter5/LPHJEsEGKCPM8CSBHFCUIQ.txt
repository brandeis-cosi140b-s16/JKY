Nando's is great! To start off their chips and salsa are great. Not only are they free but they are not stingy with them they will keep bringing them out till you say no more. Everything is good on their menu, but my personal favorite is their Pizza Blanco. It is a mexican pizza with cream cheese, chicken, tomato's, chiles, onions and cheese. You wont be disappointed at all. Carful if you get the pizza Blanco you will want to order that every time you go, you will have no other choice but to order it, it is that good!
