Our server was a young guy named Mike S (insert italian name I can't spell) and he was awesome! Very personable and attentive. Made us laugh and put in our orders so that we were never waiting too long for our food and it never piled up on us. We had a group of 4 for brunch and each ordered 5 plates. We were so full by the end but it was totally worth it! Some favorites: shrimp and grits, bacon jalape√±o PB&j smoked salmon sliders and the fried tomatillos.
