Authentic Mexican with regional signature plates. Over 100 Tequilas as well. The food is exceptional quality with organic, GMO-free, and consideration of dietary restrictions/choices like Vegan and gluten free. May I suggest the Pulled Chicken tacos or burrito or the Signature plate Pork Mole Verde. I tasted the best sipping Tequila I have ever had in US or Mexico. It was so nice to eat great food served up by super friendly servers and find a restaurant in Las Vegas that has a conscience. Support this movement, and if you don't care where your food comes from or the impact it has on our planet getting to our over full mouths, then go here anyway...THE FOOD IS OUTSTANDING!!!
