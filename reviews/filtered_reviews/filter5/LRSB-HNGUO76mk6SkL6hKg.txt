One dark night, a few years back, my husband told me he was going to take me out for some incredible Mexican food. He drove me down Boulder Hwy to El Torito and I was scared. The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired and the restaurant has an old-town, vintage feel. BUT - once you walk in, it's crowded, friendly and casual! As soon as we ordered and I tasted the abondigas soup, I was sold!

Fast forward, years later, we have small kids now and our family adores this restaurant. The hostess/manager (cannot think of her name but she rocks!) remembers her customers, even after 1 visit. Our two VERY picky daughters love coming here. Our 7 year old craves their rice and my 4 year old loves the bean and cheese burrito as well as the chips and salsa.

The staff is always accommodating and friendly. I'm fairly certain that my kids have spilled drinks at least once per visit and they handle it like nothing happened.

Their chicken is fresh and seasoned well. My husband always orders the fajitas and he loves them!

On our last visit I decided to be very bad and order a chicken chimichanga covered in sauce. I'd been craving one so I gave in. I haven't stopped craving another one since that visit but I usually stick to healthier fare like fajitas. 

The enchiladas rock, the salsa isn't very spicy but the flavor is so good! Their fresh chips are a family fave!
