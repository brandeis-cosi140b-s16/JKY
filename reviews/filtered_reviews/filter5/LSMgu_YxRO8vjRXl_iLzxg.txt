Came here for lunch at the end of a conference last week with three other conference attendees and enjoyed a wonderful and unique Southwestern style lunch.

I ordered the Carne Adovada with Eggs; a huge plate with 3 eggs (mine over easy - is their any other way?), a huge chunk of smoked pork simmered in red chili, potatoes (or you can have hash browns), beans all served over a tortilla. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pork was fall apart fork tender smothered in a rich red chili that added great depth of flavor without overpowering the meat. The potatoes were large cut and good. A real delicious meal that went great with the house margarita.

My other friends each ordered something different, and they all looked really good, especially the Relleno Platter, which I was thinking about ordering before I decided on the Carne Adovada. In fact, there were many things on the menu that I would have liked to try - so much to try but only one lunch/day.

I really enjoyed this place and will seek it out again if I'm in the area.
