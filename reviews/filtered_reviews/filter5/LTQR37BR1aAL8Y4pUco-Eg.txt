La Unica rocks. 

The authentic tacos are awesome, there a $1.75...try one if you have never had one.  We almost always get the burrito Tuawana...also their ice tea is perfection mixed 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened.  Staff is AWESOME, some of best people I have ever meet.  To ME there is no doubt this is the best Mexican food in the Charlotte area.

Also, this is in a small strip mall...they also have signs to that read no meetings, no seating before all parties arrive...in other words "we're too busy to seat you if your not ready....and please don't hang around because we are really busy..."  (my interpretation)  GREAT FOOD!!!
