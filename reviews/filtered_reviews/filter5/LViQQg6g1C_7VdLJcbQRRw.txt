I was just saying how much we needed a really good Mexican restaurant in the area and here we are!
My mother and I ate here for dinner last night.  It was wonderful!  I had a shredded beef burrito and my mother had beef tacos.  The queso was great, a little thick, but really great taste and mouth feel.  The chips, salsa, bean dip, and soda refills kept coming.  I agree with the previous reviewer about the attentive staff.  We actually had the owners, a husband and wife, come over a few times to check on us.  The food was also very fresh and it all tasted homemade.  I thought it was reminiscent of Via Mercado and was surprised to find out that most of the staff came from there after they closed!  We are going back next week to try the happy hour specials and margaritas.
