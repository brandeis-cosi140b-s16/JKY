We had this recommended to us by a friend and I thought the mixture of the 2 was really weird. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have some really great food. I've been here 2 times now and out of everything that Ive had so far, the nachos are my favorite. If they had these nachos at a random movie theater that theater would own all. The kalbi  sticks are a great quick snack. Service is fast and the lady we had explained things very well especially at explaining how hot some of the meals are.

For the type of place this is I can't really imagine it any better.
