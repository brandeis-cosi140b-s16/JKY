This is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I've been to them all: Los Dos Molinos, Bario Cafe, Old Tortilla Factory....this beats them all. This place is definitely more authentic tasting than the ones listed above as well although it's still not the real deal but to be honest, real Mexico Mexican food is not that good anyway (Menudo anyone).  

Don't be afraid of it's outdoor appearance. It looks like a Liquor store from the outside until you realize it's a restaurant. Inside the restaurant is clean and beautiful. The service is friendly and the food is delicious. Their salsa is not watery nor is it mild and lacking in flavor like all the other restaurants in Phoenix except for Los Dos.

The only problem is its location.  It's at the northeast corner of 7th ave and Buckeye (I-10 and 7th ave) During daylight hours it's safe.  And it's pretty safe on the weekends if you can arrive there before 7 PM but on Friday and Saturday, I wouldn't eat there past 7:30.  There are a lot of police officers who eat there and it's local cop joint so its not that dangerous. YOu will have some homeless dudes ask you for money on your way in or out.
