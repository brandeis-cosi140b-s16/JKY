Awesome time at TQLA last night with my group. We hadn't been there yet but wanted to give it a try, and we were really pleased. It was not your typical mexican food, in fact it's not mexican food...it's southwestern fusion with a new mexican type twist, real southwestern food. The menu is awesome and extensive, you have a ton to choose from.

We shared a quesadilla, a tray of shots, and I got the chicken enchiladas seriously good portion of food. The carne asada looked great too, I'll have to get it next time. Great food, good ingredients, you can tell the kitchen puts in that extra effort, they are not your run of the mill cooks, they have skill you can tell and taste.

Servers were nice and versed, we didn't wait long for anything. Both managers walking around were very nice and classy and checked on us to make sure everything was up to par, they cared about our table and the people around us, answering questions, bringing drinks to other people, etc, I like to see that! It's rare to see. Very happy with the staff all around.

We will definitely come back for more
