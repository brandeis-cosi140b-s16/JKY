This review is based solely on their tamales! I haven't actually visited the restaurant, but their tamales speak loudly. My fiance's parents choose this Dona Maria location for our Christmas Day tradition, so I've had them at least once a year for the last few years. They are good. Really good. They prefer the pork with red sauce, so I haven't had the opportunity to try the chicken with spicy green sauce or other variations. The masa is moist and delicious. The pork is succulent and flavorful with the great red sauce. Most importantly, the tamale is HUGE and there is no shortage of filling! It really is the winning combination for the best tamales.

I would highly recommend ordering a dozen for $19.25 (or $1.60/each) rather than paying $3.95 for one. They also offer an order of half a dozen for $14.25 ($2.38/each) which is still a better deal. Call ahead to place your order and it comes double-bagged for easy storage (freeze some for later!).
