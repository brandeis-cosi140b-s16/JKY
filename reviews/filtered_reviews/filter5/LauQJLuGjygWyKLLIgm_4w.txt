Yum off the charts. I was moaning from their shredded beef  tacos. Some of the best I have ever had and I am surrounded by mexican joints.

Prices were reasonable especially for the higher end drinks.

The location near the art galleries makes for a perfect date night. It is also super charming inside and on the patio.

This will be my Scottsdale go to place.

Am so jealous of the locales that they get this place in their hood!
