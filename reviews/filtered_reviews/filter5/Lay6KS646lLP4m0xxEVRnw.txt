Whatever they put in their food is AMAZING!!!  I got pancakes, eggs and bacon and my partner foodie in feasts got a benedict dish of some sorts effffffing AMAZING!!!!  Everything about the place screams give me more.  The decor is rad, the ambience (at 2PM) was pretty popping I think and the service was spot on.  FInding this place is quite a feat but overall the food experience was grrreat.  Beware first come first served because the size of the place is pretty tiny.  Great place to set a wonderful expectations of being a foodie of sorts with a knack for the unexpected.
