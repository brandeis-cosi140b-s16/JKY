OK. We were starving. My wife and my girlfriend had just gotten pedicures and I had been wasting time at the Home Depot while they were being pampered. I digress. We were starving so we all decided on Mexican. The Yelping began. We decided on Juan Jaime's base mainly on a good friend's recommendation and not the reviews. We were not disappointed! Two of us had the three taco lunch and one of us ordered sides. The three taco lunch consisted of fish, pork and shrimp along with rice and beans. The pork was outstanding! The fish and shrimp were solid. All three of us had the house Margaritas and they were simply delicious. Brandon was our excellent server. My wife wanted me to deduct a star from my rating because we had to pay for chips and salsa. The excellent service (and my two Margaritas) got the star back. We will return to Juan Jaime's!
