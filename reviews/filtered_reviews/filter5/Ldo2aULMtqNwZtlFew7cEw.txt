Went last Friday night for my first time. Was on my way to Jimmy Johns, but decided to try this out. It smells fantastic when you walk in. The gal was really helpful and gave me a sample of both kinds of chicken, the steak, the Barbacoa and it was all good and made it hard to choose. I ended up choosing the spicy chicken taco salad. It was a very generous sized salad. The gal then gave me a sample of the horchata that her Grandma makes from scratch. It was delicious!! Had a great experience and will be going back to try the burgers!
