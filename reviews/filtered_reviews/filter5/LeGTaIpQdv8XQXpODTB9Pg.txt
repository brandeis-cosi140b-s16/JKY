When I first heard of KoMex I was a skeptic.  As I am always unwilling to try anything new, and definitely anything fusion. However I ordered the Chimichanga. And was BLOWN away!  I love mom and pop, hole in the walls. And The smiling Korean lady, made it that much more pleasant. The food is fabulous, the service was great.  My second visit, I had the enchiladas, and tacos. And I have now found my new "Comfort food" place to eat. The price is great for that budget hunter. And you get your fill and then some.   Thanks to Yelp, and to friends we found this place. And RECOMMEND IT!!  Love love it!
