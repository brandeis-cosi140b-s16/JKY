3 of us ladies went in on a Sunday for a fun brunch and Ooh boy did they deliver!  They were pretty busy but we were able to get some good seats at the bar. Two of us ordered the 'Hangover Cure' for $38.50 and we got to order 3 menu items and all you can drink for 2 hours. 
I ordered the Carnitas skillet which was just enough and soo good, Carnitas almost as good as I get in Mexico.  We also ordered the Baja & Shrimp tacos which were also very good. We got too many drinks to describe each but I definitely enjoyed each one. Don't even get me started on how amazing their fresh aguas are!
For as busy as they were, I felt very taken care of by our Bartender/Server and he even hooked us up with chips and salsa to go. 
All in all, I will most definitely be returning again maybe next time for dinner. I have actually been to the one in Chicago and liked this open concept much more and I feel like they had a couple more drink options as well. 

Great ambiance, delicious food & drinks, not to mention a cute looking manager to look at.. all key elements for a 5 star rating in my book!
