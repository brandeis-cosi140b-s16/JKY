The best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I especially like the Shrimp a la Diablo, fish tacos, and unique breakfast items, such as the tilapia omelet.  When the owner can get fresh habaneros, the habaneros sauce is fantastic, striking a delicate balance between bringing out the flavor of the pepper without overpowering your taste buds with heat.  However, since he believes in quality, if high quality ingredients aren't available, neither will the sauce. 

If you want good, solid, unpretentious real Mexican food, this is the place for you.
