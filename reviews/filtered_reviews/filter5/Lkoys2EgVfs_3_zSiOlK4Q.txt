..just had the most deliscious late brunch at this place. Started with a freshly made aqua fresca Pina Colada. Ordered the Torta del Rey and la Plata del Peluche. The place is famous for its tortas... and damn I know now why. Both mains were absolutelly delicious. To finish of, we ordered the flan for desert, that was like the cherry on the top, literally. Def great place and nice service. Coming back for sure!!!
