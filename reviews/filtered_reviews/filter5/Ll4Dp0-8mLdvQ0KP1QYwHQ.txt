My American Dollars go a loooong way at KoMex!  I fed a table of three for just about $20 and the great thing about it was we were all full to our bellies!   The fusion of korean and mexican food is done right at KoMex.  Korean BBQ, salsa and corn tortillas make a good combo especially at the going rate of $1+ each.  Throw it down with the killer Bulgogi Fries, which is a mother-load of marinated bbq, salsa and cheese on top of a bed of fries.  Be sure to try out all the sauces on their sauce caddy.  The mix of korean and mexican salsa makes a great addition to such classy grub! Kimchi I'm out!  ...oh but don't forget, location is a lil' north townish, so lock yo doors!
