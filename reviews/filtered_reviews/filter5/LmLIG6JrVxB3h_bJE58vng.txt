My boyfriend and I are Leticia's regulars, and we are both Hispanic and know good Mexican food when we have it. I have to say the overall atmosphere of this restaurant is what really wins me over. Everyone is so nice, the d√©cor is very appealing, and its just a comforting place to pig out on great food. 

The service there is GREAT, I have an attachment to the older man Hector- he is ALWAYS so incredibly friendly and always makes sure that we are all set with chips & salsa and our waters/soda are filled. He is such a sweet heart. 

The food...authentic. From the Pozole (which I just had a week ago because I was recovering from a flu and it was SO GOOD. ) to the enchiladas covered in salsa- everything tastes like I went to Mexico. For real. Its some good stuff. 

All in all, its a great place to grab dinner and have a few drinks with your friends, family, spouse...whoever. Anyone will love it. 

I should be a Leticia VIP hahaha
