Driving through Phoenix and it happened to be lunch time. I was at the red light sitting at the intersection where Gadzooks is located, did a quick Yelp lookup and decided to try it. I'm glad I did, because it was really good. I had the 2 enchilada plate. One short rib and the other chicken tomatillo. Both were good. They are super stuffed with meat, no skimping. After choosing my tortilla, all corn for me. (U can choose a half corn half flour tortilla), pick your filling - they have meat and vegetarian options. Cheese and sauce topping. Then its put in the fire oven briefly to warm and melt the cheese. Choose salsa and other condiment toppings and voila (or ol√©! In this case)

I was there during the lunch rush. People were constantly streaming in and the line moved quickly and food served quickly. Friendly staff. Great food. Nice easy parking on site. 

If you have little ones, there are booster seats and high chairs but no changing tables in the restroom. 

Glad I took a chance on this place and would definitely try again! Maybe soup on a cold day in Phoenix....
