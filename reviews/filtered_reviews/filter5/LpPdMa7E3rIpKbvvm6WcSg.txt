I found the Burrito shack driving by,it truly is a shack and I was a little leery but when I saw the line of people outside waiting to order burritos I decided to give it a try. There are a few tables inside but open so this time of year it is hot however it's the best deal in town and the best burritos I've ever had. Quite a few people called and order the burritos ahead of time which is a smart way to go however I had my Green chili breakfast Burrito In less than 10 minutes
