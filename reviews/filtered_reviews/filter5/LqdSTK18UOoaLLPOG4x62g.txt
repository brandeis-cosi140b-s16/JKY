First time trying this place out, and I must say it exceeded my expectations by far. 
Great food, even better service! 
The person taking our order was more than helpful and gave us plenty of samples.
I chose a two entree combination plate and picked the Red jade chicken quesadilla, gringo chicken and jerk fried rice plus Volcano cookie. Let's just say the plate looked brand new when I was done.  Will definitely dine here again.
