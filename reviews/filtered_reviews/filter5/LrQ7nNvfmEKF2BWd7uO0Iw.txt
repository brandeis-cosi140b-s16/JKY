This is honestly my favorite Mexican restaurant. Staff is always nice and friendly!! I love their chicken fajitas. They give you so much food. My fianc√© has tried many things without any complaints. My favorite part is the spicy salsa! It's chunky and so flavorful. It has a massive kick to it!! Sometimes I buy some to go. The restaurant is clean. Love this place!!
