I had a quick dinner here and was completely amazed at the service and the food! Granted, I had the Beach Bar Entree Salad - but it was great. The best Cilantro Lime Avocado dressing I have ever tasted (and I eat at nice places). On the salad plate was a delicious corn salad, marinated chopped tomatoes, fresh julienned jicama, avocado and super fresh heirloom lettuce. I couldn't believe it. This is the place to eat at the Vegas airport.
