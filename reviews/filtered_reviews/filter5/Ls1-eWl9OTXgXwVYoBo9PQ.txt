Obsessed with this place. The bacon guac is amazing. The trio of corn pico de gallo is sooo delicious! Pork belly tacos are out of this world. The mushroom tacos weren't my favorite. They offer bibb lettuce instead of tortillas for the tacos, which is great for the health conscious! Drinks are fab! Had the pineapple cilantro marg, and the passion fruit with heat. Best part:: if you work in the industry and go after 10 pm, everything is 50% off!!!!
