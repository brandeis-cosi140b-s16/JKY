There's Mexican joints and then there's this place. It's pretty pricey, but you're getting something special here. I got the potato tacos and was really damn happy with 'em.  We also got the chorizo queso as an appetizer.  Wow, that was tasty!  A must stop if you're in the Caesars Palace forum shops and you have $$ to spend
