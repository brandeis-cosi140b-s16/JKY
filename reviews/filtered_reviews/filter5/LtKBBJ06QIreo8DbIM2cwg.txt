Yum. 

My spouse and I got 3 tacos each (don't judge, they're small!) a side of rice, a side of beans, and 2 sodas for about $12!

The place is tiny and a bit on the warm side, but the food more than makes up for it. I had the carne asada tacos and they were amazing. Very simple - 2 small corn tortillas, carne asada, onions, and cilantro, and delicious!

We got 3 types of salsas, one red, one green, and one cilantro saucy good thing. They each had the perfect amount of flavor and heat. 

Our meals also came with a nice little side of grilled onions and jalapenos. They were amazing. The onions were perfectly sweet and the jalapenos had crispy, salty skin.

We will definitely be back again next time we are in the area.
