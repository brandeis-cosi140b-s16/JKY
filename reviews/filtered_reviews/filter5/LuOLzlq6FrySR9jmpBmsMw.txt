The food was amazing and the service was even better. They saw us coming from the window and had a table ready with a high chair for our little one. Made special dishes for a couple of our pickier eaters and everyone enjoyed everything put on our table. The entire meal was perfect. The guacamole was delish, my shrimp was cooked perfectly and had the perfect balance of spice and flavor. You could feel their enthusiasm for their food and service. What a treat!
