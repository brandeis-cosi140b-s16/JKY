Received ad in the mail decided to try "bark".  Peppermint bark is delicious!! Sweet and hint of mint at the end. The original "bark" is the cure for the chocolate and salty crave. This stuff is so good I had to call the shop on Maryland and tell then that it really did "broke da mout" wife enjoyed too and she not a chocolate fan.  Great customer service you will not be diss appointed.
