It's time. It's time I finally share the wonders of täkō. Maybe, although I've bellied up to the bar (for food, too, okay?) often, I haven't shared my experiences because I wanted to keep this secret all to myself. Well THAT obviously didn't work! 

Let's begin with offerings from the bar. DO indulge! A classic margarita perhaps? A Ramon Gin Fizz? Maybe a Spicy Cucumber or a Classic Daiquiri or an Anjeo Witch or......SO many well created cocktails from which to choose. Or maybe a frozen concoction or interesting beer? Let your bartender guide you...some of the best in town are behind the stick.

On to the food. If you're a lover of guacamole, THIS is the best in town. You're given a slip of paper with add ins for your custom guac to check off with abandon. My hands down favorite combo is bacon (if nothing else, GET THE BACON!), roasted poblano and blue cheese. And the chips! Whoa. 

The tacos. More to the point, the täkō tacos. The Japanese word for octopus is täkō, hence the täkō taco is an octopus one. And it's delicious! My first experience with the cephalopod, I'd say it tastes like a cross between lobster and shrimp with a similar texture. 

More traditional? Don't miss the carnitas or al pastor tacos or if you'd like to step outside of the box without going all the way to octopus, the Korean tacos are an umami bomb of tender wagyu beef, fermented cucumber, pickled carrots and peanuts. 

The atmosphere is comfortable, sexy even. If you're lucky enough to score a swing out seat on the sidewalk out front of the open kitchen, grab it! Oh, and word has it that brunch is coming soon. Shhhhhhhh...let's keep it out secret.
