Been meaning to write a review for a while now. I've been to SumoMaya a handful of times and it has been great every time. Some of the drinks need a little work flavor wise, but the food is spectacular. The rock shrimp tempura is delish! The maya roll and the Suzuki roll are great, I can't wait to try more of their sushi. The ceviche is some of the best I've had anywhere. Ahi tuna tostada, the Vietnamese shaking beef and the filet are all amazing. I could go on and on! I can't wait to go back and try more! I also look forward to trying the new dessert menu items as well. Go check it our for yourself, well worth it!
