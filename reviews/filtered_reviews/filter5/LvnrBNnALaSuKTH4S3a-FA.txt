Hands down best Mexican food.  Nice folk behind the counter, even when it's slammed.  Drink bar is a wreck, salsa is excellent.  Sometimes there isn't a table. We still go, it's an institution around here.  I have yet to manage to have menudo there.  Holiday tortillas are to die for.  Everyone is pleasant, including the customers. And it's not a zillion dollars plus tip.
