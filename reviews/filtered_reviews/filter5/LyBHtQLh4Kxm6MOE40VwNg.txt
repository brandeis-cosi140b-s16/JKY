It's funny how everyone is pleased, but that one bitch below!  LOL  Well, but then again, it'll be boring if everyone agreed.  You can never please everyone.  I just have to say that this place makes the best, legit Mexican tacos!!!  I've been coming to this branch for years now.  I used to go to the other branches, but this is now my favorite, being on the strip and all.  I'm currently vacationing in Australia right now, and I've been craving and dreaming of their adobada and carne asada tacos.  That'll be the first thing I'm gonna eat, when I get back to my Las Vegas home!  Keep doing what you're doing, coz you're doing it right!  Acknowledge the positive comments, and just ignore the negative.  They're just haters.  At least the good thing is, they won't be back to spoil our fun at Tacos El Gordo!  Much love! Ciao!
