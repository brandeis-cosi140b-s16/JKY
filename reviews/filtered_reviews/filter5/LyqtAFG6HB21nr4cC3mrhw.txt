By far my favorite Mexican in the East Valley.

This is a hidden gem - for a long time, I drove by, not even thinking it was open, or even realizing it was a restaurant!  Its located in a fairly tired section of Mesa's Main Street, which is the only thing keeping it from packing its doors.

The cuisine is consistently good.  The chips and salsa are fresh and clearly home-made.  The pricing is reasonable.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  And its never busy (not a positive for the owners, I know, but great if you have hyper kids).
