I really love this place, mainly because they have an awesome Happy Hour 7 days a week 4 - 7pm. We always sit at the bar, the bartenders are really friendly and give great service. Their specials include: $3 draft pints, $4 Three Olives Vodka cocktails, and great food specials (I recommend the big cheese crisp for only $4!!). We went there on a Saturday, watched the Dback game, enjoyed several drinks and dinner, and our tab was under $30 - can't beat that!!

We also used Carlos O'Briens to cater a big party that we had - and it was a HUGE hit! Very moderately priced with really yummy food.
