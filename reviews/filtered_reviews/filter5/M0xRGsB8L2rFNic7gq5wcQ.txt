Run, crawl, moonwalk....do whatever you need to do to frequent this glorious establishment. My mouth waters at the sheer thought of their pork barbacoa. It's so flavorful and perfectly prepared I rarely can convince myself to get anything else. When I'm a starving beast, I go for the burrito. When I feel like behaving myself, I grab some enchiladas, but honestly with their fresh ingredients and wide array of choices, I don't think a poor choice is possible. The man in my life loves the fire grilled steak tacos. 

Perhaps your first time around the ordering process may seem a bit stressful, there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen for sure. But once you get your favorites nailed down you'll be a pro! Pick certain items and you may even get a song (the nachos are most entertaining). They do have pick up with a dedicated register so if you can't handle the stress just call it in! There's usually a pretty decent wait at this location so this is a wise choice around dinner. 

Lots of drinks to choose from too, including my favorite the Mint Limeade. Refreshing and delish! The 5th star was a necessity as they also offer your choice of favorite hot sauce! Any place that provides more condiments than you know what to do with earns major bonus points in my book. Tapatio, cholula, YUM! 

Try it out, this location or any....I think you'll be very pleased!
