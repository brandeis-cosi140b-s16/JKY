We went last week for 1$ taco Tuesday. Wow, let me tell you about this place.

First when we walked in it was SLAMMED. It has to be good right? So there is an extensive menu of all kinds of things, burritos, tacos.. and huge nacho plates and other mex dish menu. As I was looking at the menu and the surrounding patrons I see that most of the best choice to get was tacos. LOL, not sure if it was on sale or what, but hey, I'll be part of the incrowd.

I got 2 beef and 1 chicken taco with a side of guac and cheese dip and their homemade salsa. The guac was so creamy and chunky with the fresh ingredients . I loved the embrace that this place has to cilantro. I LOVE cilantro. Tacos had them on it, and if you even wanted extra you can ask for it. The dips came with 1 bag of chips for each side. So be prepared to be overloaded with chips for easy dipping. The chips were great! They seemed to have some chili seasoning on them. 

What make this place so unique than the others? THE SALSA BAR! You have such a huge choice lineup of different salsas depending on what you were in the mood for. There was super hot, hawaian and others that looked awesome. You can put as much as you want into tiny to-go cups for easy transport. **just don't take more than you can eat*  :)

I am highly impressed with this place, and I will be a returning customer, thanks for the great service.
