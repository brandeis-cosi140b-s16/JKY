I'm so happy they opened up another location next to my work. Me and my coworkers came last Wednesday for their HAPPY HOUR.
From 11-3 they have lunch specials for $8. Such good and filling food for that price. They also have a HAPPY HOUR for their drinks. 1-6 on weekdays...I'll have to come back for that.
They seem to be doing amazing so far, parking isn't a hassle. The staff is great. The food is great. I'll be back very soon
