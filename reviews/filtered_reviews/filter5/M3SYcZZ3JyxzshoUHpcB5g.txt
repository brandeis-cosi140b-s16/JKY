Being an AZ native along with my husband, we eat lots of Mexican food and tacos. We have lots of places we love to go and get our fix of Mexican food. This place by far has the best tacos we have ever had. The salsa bar is so great with like 16 different salsas you get to help yourself to from Pico to strawberry to pecan, I think we tried them all! Such a good experience and friendly staff. We haven't even left and are planning our next trip back, tomorrow maybe? Live this place!
