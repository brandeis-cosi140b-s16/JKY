This was hands down the BEST food we have had in Arizona so far. There were 11 of us and It's always annoying to seat 11 people right during the lunch rush, but we were greeted promptly and seated by our waiter Doug who gave us absolutely phenomanal service. His knowledge of the food, recommendations, and bubbly personality made our experience exceptional. I felt like I was at a friends house, he seemed interested in what we were doing and made more than just small talk with us. Sometimes when I eat out I feel rushed and like just another patron, Doug made our entire party feel welcome, brought out everything correctly, promptly, and with much enthusiasm. As far as the food itself, it was to die for! There are Mexican restaurants around every corner in this area, and much of Arizona,  but I would strongly recommend coming here if you want FANTASTIC service, amazing fresh food, and an overall incredible dining experience. Thank you Doug for making our lunch so great! You deserve a raise!!!!! We loved you!
