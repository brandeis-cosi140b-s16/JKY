Worth the second chance. I change my review to 5 stars. The brunch was amazing. It was a tapas style made fresh brunch. So make sure you order a head if you think you would still like to sample another item on the menu. My wife also enjoyed the place as well. I think we will be back again soon. Not sure if a reservation is necessary but why risk it. It's Vegas, you never know how things are going to be.
