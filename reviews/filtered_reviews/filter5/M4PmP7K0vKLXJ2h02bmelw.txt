With a gluten free intolerance, I usually avoid Mexican restaurants, but our group of 6 heard fantastic recommendations for this place, so I went along with a positive mindset and was pleasantly surprised. Our server was not only knowledgeable of gluten, but told me with confidence exactly what menu items were safe. It seems the make all tortillas, chips, etc fresh in their restaurant and possibly the dressings as well. 

With a gf peace of mind, I enjoyed a beautiful spinach mango artichoke salad with sliced jicama and raspberry vinaigrette. The best, the BEST salad Ive ever had. That say a lot for a salad!!!

All of the five gentlemen in my group greatly enjoyed their meals as well, from the guacamole made table-side to the fajitas and other authentic dishes. Delicious, delicious food with knowledgeable servers in an authentic and clean environment. Check it out!!!
