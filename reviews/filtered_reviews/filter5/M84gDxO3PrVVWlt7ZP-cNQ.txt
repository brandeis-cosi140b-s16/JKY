I'm a HUGE taco fan! Always loved them and always looking for new taco spots! A buddy from work introduced me to Los Tacos one day and I've been hooked since. Sure it's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for and trust me you get your money's worth! 

The people are always on a hustle prepping food and getting orders out in a timely matter. I highly recommend this place!
