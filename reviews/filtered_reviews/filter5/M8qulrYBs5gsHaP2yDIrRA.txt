This restaurant makes my heart happy ... We just had a family birthday celebration last night with a party of 8.  We were happy to learn that it was half priced wine bottles (Sundays and Mondays), so naturally we had 4 bottles on a Monday night :)  

We had 3 small plates to start the meal - the calamari, quesadillas and ceviche.  All were very good.  I could eat the quesadillas all day every day!  The ceviche has an interesting flavor, almost like cinnamon.  It wasn't my favorite ceviche in town, but I did enjoy it.  

Everyone ordered something different.  Skewers, New Mexican Platter, Swordfish Special, Halibut Special, Surf & turf, Steak Skewers, Chicken Skewers, and I can't remember the last meal.  Everyone was very happy with their food. We did have a small hiccup with the chicken on the skewers not being totally done, but our server was very apologetic and offered to bring back some properly cooked chicken.  But he was already full so he declined.  They took the whole skewer meal off the bill without us asking or even putting up a fuss about it. I loved the surf & turf, perfectly cooked and the shrimp was wrapped in bacon - yum!

We also had a couple of desserts - the flourless chocolate cake, which was a delicious fudge cake that we devoured ... and the creme brulee, which they brought with a lit candle for the birthdays we were celebrating.  My husband prefers his creme brulee custard a little more firm, but i thought it was perfect!  So I ate most of it  :)

I think our server was new because he seemed to have a shadow most of the evening.  But he did a great job, was very personable, and if I was smart enough to find out his name, I would love to sit in his section again.

They never seem to hurt for business, yet they still manage to make you feel like they want you to come back again and again!  And I will!  I love this restaurant - it's definitely a family favorite!
