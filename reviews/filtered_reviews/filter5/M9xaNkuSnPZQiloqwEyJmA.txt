After a 5 hour drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas my boyfriend and I stopped at Tacos El Gordo for take out dinner back to our hotel. We ordered 14 ADOBADA tacos for both (we were really hungry). The tacos were great. We had them with the green sauce (guacamole?) and pineapple. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Vegas.
