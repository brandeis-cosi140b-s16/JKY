Yummy all the way.  Hard to get all the basics exactly right but Mangos has delicious beans, rice, tortillas, and the Carne asada is bomb.  Then to top it off they have the awesome fresh fruit drinks which are a highlight for me.  I like to mix them, strawberry with pineapple, mango, watermelon, they all make my mouth water.
