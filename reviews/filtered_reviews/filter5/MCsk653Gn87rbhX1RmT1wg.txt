A James Beard award for a Mexican restaurant?  Evidently Barrio Queen has one, and that can't always be a good thing when it ramps up the expectations.  Unless the expectations get crushed, then I just need to recalibrate.

Tuesday night in Scottsdale, and my hosts brought me here for a feed.  This is an extremely clean, decorative and exciting restaurant with a menu to match.  The table appetizer was a plate of nacho chips with a black bean dip, deep and rich in flavour.

We started with the guacamole, made tableside.  Big chunks of avocado with cilantro, jalape√±o, lime, onion, tomato, this was not a green puree.  The unexpected was the dried cranberries added in for a tangy sweetness.  Sometimes they use pomegranate seeds-delicious!

For a main, I had the tacos, which was a tough decision since they are available in more than a dozen different variations.  I tried 4 different tacos as a sampler.  When they arrived, I thought they looked a bit small, sort of how a slider looks compared to a full burger.  But they filled me up just fine.  I could have ordered more at $3.50 a pop until I was as stuffed as I wanted to be. 

But there was dessert.  I ordered the Choco Flan, a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake with Mexican chocolate drizzled over the top, and finished with crushed pecans.  This was an amazing dish!

A big win!  Now I need to lay down and rest...
