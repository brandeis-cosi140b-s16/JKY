I am an AZ native from a large Mexican family and we all cook and make our own tortillas. I'm always looking for authentic Mexico Mexican food and finally found it here. Taco pastor was incredible. Their shredded beef taco was so full of flavor and crunchy. My husband had the carne asada burrito and besides being lean, tender, and so tasty, the tortilla was homemade and perfect! The best part was the four different kind of salsas at their salsa bar which were spicy and delicious. Thankfully they have a drive-through so we'll be there for lunch quite often. This place is clean and great!
