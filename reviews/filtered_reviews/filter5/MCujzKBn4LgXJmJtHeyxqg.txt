The salsa bar IS the best in phoenix. Just tried the Napoleon taco made with filet mignon: loved the sauce with mushrooms and crunchy onions, as good as what you would find in a fine dining restaurant. This will be my new favorite along with the cabo shrimp taco: big fresh and juicy shrimp fried to perfection! I also love their quesadillas...not like anything you would get anywhere else.
