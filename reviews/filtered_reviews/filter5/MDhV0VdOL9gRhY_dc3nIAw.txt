Man oh man. This place is amazing. If anyone is looking for some Asian fusion this place will hit the spot. I came in here around 9. It was pretty quiet and  we got seated immediately and ordered right away. Here's the stuff we ordered;
Bulgogi tator tots: with bacon bits, sour cream, tomatoes, green onions, and topped with delicious melted cheese. 5/5. This was a special on one of the menus so look/ask for it because it's a must have! 

Kimchi fried rice: with pork belly and topped with a yolky egg. The best kimchi fried rice I've had in Vegas. So flavorful and the kimchi was perfect. Some places don't have good kimchi.. But man, it was on point. 5/5

Korean chicken wings: bold flavor and sweet and tangy at the same time. They were really delicious as well, but I've had better Korean wings at some other joints. 4/5. 

Service was amazing as well! Water was never empty. The owner even came out to make sure everything was okay. At the end our server also boxed our leftover food for us. (they serve huge portions here) 
I will definitely be coming back. I want to try those tacos so bad!
