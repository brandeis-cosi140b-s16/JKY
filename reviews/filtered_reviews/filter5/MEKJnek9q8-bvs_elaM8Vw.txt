Komex is a must when we go to Vegas.  We have been to the other location a few times and decided to try this location on a Sunday. (This one is closed on Monday, the other is closed on Sunday).

We shared a 1/2 order of beef nachos and 1/2 order of pork fried rice.  The 10-year ordered the calamari tacos.

The nachos were my favorite, I think I prefer their beef over the pork.  Huge portions and these were just the 1/2 orders.

This location is a bit further out from the strip, but its roomier, newer, and cooler (literally, like better air conditioned) than the first location.
