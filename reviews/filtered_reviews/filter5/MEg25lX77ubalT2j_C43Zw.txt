The best Mexican food in Arizona, period.

The Elmer's signatures are
(1) its sauce (my mother buys 32oz at a time to take home), which is spicy, fresh, and delicious.
(2) strips, which are simply tortilla chips with shredded cheese

I love the pastor tacos and the pastor burrito. Pastor is a spicy pork, and Elmer's loads it with cilantro and onions. Get it early though... if you get the pastor just before close, it won't be as fresh.

In December, they offer their tamales for Christmas Eve, just make sure you place your order a few weeks out.

Lately, everything has gotten a bit more greasy than it used to be (especially the refried beans)... if you are looking for "healthy" Mexican food, keep looking.

If you get there during Chandler High's lunch hour, look for the non-student line to the right, or call in your order ahead of time. I have the number programed into my cell phone :)
