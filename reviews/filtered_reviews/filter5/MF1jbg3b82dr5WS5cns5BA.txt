Not only some of the best food I've had in Las Vegas, but also the healthiest.  There's no deep frying going on here my friends.  The best Mexican food I've ever eaten in my life, and I'm from south Texas!  Being a local, I eat here as much as I can.  The tortillas are homemade right in front of you, the meat is cooked here, the salsa is amazing, my favorite are the cabesa tacos, which is meat of the head of the cow, which if you know anything about beef, that's where the most tender and flavorful juicy meat is.  I always buy at least 6.  No preservatives, no BS, just outstanding quality service, and some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Hands down.  No casino in vegas or any restaurant in vegas beats these tacos.  If you want to jizz in your pants, get $10 (because that's all you'll need to get full) and head over there and enjoy.
