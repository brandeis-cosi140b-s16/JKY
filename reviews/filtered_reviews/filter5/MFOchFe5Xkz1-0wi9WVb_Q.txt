We came here after the other Mexican place we wanted to go to was closed and ended up having a great dinner! I went in with no expectations since it was so last minute, but loved all of it. The waitress was personable and had some solid recommendations, the margarita was awesome, we loved our dishes and the atmosphere was nice for a quick little date night.

I had an enchilada and taco, my fianc√©e had a burrito and both were delicious. We will definitely be back.
