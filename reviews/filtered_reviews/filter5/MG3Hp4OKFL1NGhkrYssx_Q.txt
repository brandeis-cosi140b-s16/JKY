It's been said by most, but I just wanted to emphasize what a pleasant, cheap departure it is from the expensive, crappy chain food on the strip.  The walk from most hotels is just long enough to be sobering after a long night/morning out in Vegas (I walked from Planet Hollywood), and if it isn't, the food should help.

It's especially awesome for those of us who come from the east and don't get particularly good/authentic tacos.
