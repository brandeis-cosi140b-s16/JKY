I sincerely love this place.

My friend Brian recommended we meet up here once when we were both in town. Needless to say, it was a great recommendation!

Although the location is unassuming and rather inconspicuous, don't let the strip mall scare you away. The wonderfully friendly staff and the wide variety of options will make everyone happy, even the vegetarians!

However, you shouldn't come here *just* for the vegetarian options (which I will try eventually, just to see how good they are). This place is excellent for spicy and sweet selections of beef, pork, and chicken, all of which you can sample before you dive in.

I highly recommend getting a combo. You can choose two items, preferred style of rice, and preferred style of beans. The items can either be presented alone or in a burrito or quesadilla. I usually get a quesadilla as one of my items, the pork fried rice, and black beans. It's hard to go wrong with the combo, seriously!

My favorite meat selections are the Chinese BBQ Pork and the machaca. Lately I've been trying other things, but nothing has let me down so far. 

The free cookie is also a big bonus. Love their snickerdoodles! I'm not huge on cookies, but these ones are so soft and so delicious that they are entirely worth getting a half-dozen (or dozen!) to bring home. 

I never seem to finish my combo, as good as it is. It can be a good light lunch for two or just make for excellent leftovers later. 

Also: try going on the weekends sometime - they make different kinds of cookies and also offer a tostada on Sundays and Saturdays!

All in all, I really wish I had this place in San Diego. It'd be a hit, too. But I tend to visit every time I am in Arizona to see my parents, so perhaps that's what keeps it such a great place to return to again and again. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, no?
