This is the fourth time we have come to Diego pops and this place has never disappointed! We love the shrimp, cod and skirt steak tacos! They are always consistent and fresh. The new manager Justin was so friendly and informative on the tequlias they offered and anything else we asked him. The atmosphere is fun but chill. If you like tacos definitely try this place out! One of our favorites on the Scottsdale strip! :)
