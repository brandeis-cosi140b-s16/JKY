I used to love Pro's but, being slightly out of my way, my trips became less and less often. Then I got a coupon flyer for the *new* Los Altos Ranch Market. I was like, "$5 off a $25 purchase, SAY WHAAAT?" Turns our Pro's had gone into bankruptcy and emerged under the joint ownership of a couple other Hispanic market chains. Fun facts but the coupon got me down there Saturday morning. 

Same old Ranch Market with shoes for sale up front, the assortment of prepared food, drink, and bakery items, and chicharones from bite size to mucho grande. I like their produce and meat selection but wish they carried salmon other than the frozen bags. Still, it was a good reminder of the shopping experiences I had before my current battles at my local Fry's and Basha's stores. I suggest we all commit to hitting Ranch Market a little more.
