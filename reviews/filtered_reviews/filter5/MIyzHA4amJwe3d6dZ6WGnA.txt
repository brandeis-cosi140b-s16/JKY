Saw CR II on Check Please, Arizona yesterday and liked what I saw, so we checked it out last night. They were out of horchata and flan, apparently a run on the latter due to being showcased on the show earlier in the day. I had combo fajitas (steak + chicken), while zombie girl had a fajitas choice that included fish, shrimp, and scallops. Both were excellent. Tried the Cheese Crispy appetizer, it was just OK - a bit on the greasy side. Chips and accompanying salsa both excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, service was great, the place is clean and clearly well-run. Will definitely be back.
