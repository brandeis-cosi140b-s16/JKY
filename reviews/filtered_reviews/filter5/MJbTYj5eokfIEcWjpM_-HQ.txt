If you're looking for Mexican food, you need to come here.  The food and drinks were fantastic.  I must admit that I take pride in knowing good, authentic Mexican food, and especially margaritas.  I'm so happy we tried a sampling of several items, the appetizers, a few entrees, and even the desserts.  Everything was exeptional.  Tip:  I don't typically expect the desserts at a Mexican restaurant to be anything special, but don't leave without ordering them.  

The ambiance was great, the food was great, the service was fantastic, and the margaritas were some of the best I've ever had.

Glad I found this place and would highly recommend!
