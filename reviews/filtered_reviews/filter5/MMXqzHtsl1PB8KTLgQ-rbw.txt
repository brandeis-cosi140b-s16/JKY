I can not stop thinking about this place!
 Instead of trying to get you to relive my experience I'm just going to give you the reasons why you need to get up and go.

1. Check in deals
2. Free chips with salsa and guac
3. Food is awesome (Love the tacos!) 
4. Cheap!
5. Veggie options
6. The lady who owns it is super nice
