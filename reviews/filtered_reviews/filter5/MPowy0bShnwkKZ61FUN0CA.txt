Visiting Las Vegas I wanted to find some simple no fuss good food off the strip happened to find Braddah's  island style burritos bowls and tacos. The meats were so tasty and the "coconut bark" dessert was the best sweet sugar rush I had in days. The staff recognized me as a first timer and were so helpful. I'll be back.
