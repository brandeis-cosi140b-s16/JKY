I thought I had yelped this already but here goes....
This place is AMAZING.....beats Lindo by food and price!!!
My family and I go at least once a week and anytime we have out of town guests we take them too.
Fajitas for 2 is the best deal in town (it can actually feed 3 depending on your appetite)
They also have a great happy hour and you don't have to sit in the bar to order from the happy hour menu.
Def my favorite Mexican food in Vegas!
