Close to Nellis AFB, one of the closest mexican sport bar around... Overall review was awesome... Our waiter Antonio was excellent at providing excellent service by being aware of all his tables.. Making sure our chips and dips was never empty.. And his sense of humor is great.. He was always polite and always have a smile on... Their live musician has a very strong voice and very good on the guitar.. Atmosphere was dark-- setting the bar mood but really bring you into the Mexican theme..! Food was amazing-- the chips bean dip and salsa was unlimited and very delicious, I had their enchiladas de mole.. Which was rich with mole sauce but a bit too cheesy for me.. But still Sooooo Gooodddd!! You got to try this if you're ever around Nellis AFB! Or just in Vegas itself!!
