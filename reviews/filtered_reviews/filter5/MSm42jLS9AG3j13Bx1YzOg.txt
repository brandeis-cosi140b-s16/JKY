So delish! Check them out, they offer a simple menu of tacos, quesadillas, gorditas, tortas, and their signature is the Papa Loca. They offer the party pack too which is awesome for entertaining. Very cool concept, they have renovated an old business and it is nice to see when that happens. 

Apparently the owners were cooking and selling food out of their backyard and every Friday night the line would stretch down the street to just order some of their tacos. Someone discovered this, and helped them get their own restaurant going.
