I have a client that had mentioned this place a couple times as one of her favorite restaurants. I recently made it in myself and had a great experience. Noah was our server, he made great suggestions and was totally patient with us, GREAT service! We started with the Blood Orange margarita's that were amazing! Followed those with the tableside guacamole that was equally fantastic. I had the fish tacos... they blew Wahoo's out of the water, plus the presentation was beautiful. To finish out the night we had the pumpkin bread pudding and the chocolate dessert of the evening... Unbelievable! I am so glad I don't live closer or I would eat the bread pudding every day! This is a great place for food, ambiance and service with friends or for date night. Noah mentioned their brunch and I hope to check that out too! Love it!
