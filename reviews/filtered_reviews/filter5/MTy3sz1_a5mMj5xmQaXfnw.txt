Absoulutely love this place! I get the trainer salad with chicken every time, and it's my favorite salad from anywhere. Their tacos, burritos, and breakfast items are all great, too (not to mention they have the best posole in Phoenix according to New Times). Everything is always fresh and quick, plus it doesn't break the bank like some overhyped street taco places I won't mention. It's as authentic as any little taco shop, but you're guaranteed good service in a clean, enjoyable atmosphere. Be sure to stop by for Taco Tuesday!
