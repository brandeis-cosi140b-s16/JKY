Oh how I miss Dick's(hehe that's right I said it). Seriously, we no longer live in PHX but Dick's is a must visit each trip back. There were weekends we would eat there Fri. dinner, Saturday lunch, and Sunday breakfast. Yes that's a little much but this place is that good. Is the sirloin burrito still off the menu? Order it, they still make it. Anything you order will be excellent. Best burger in Phoenix. They cook over an open flame wood fired grill. Salads are top notch. Fish plates are always the best. All with a New Mexican(state not country) style. Great bar. Fantastic wine cellar dining room if you get the pleasure of eating in there, as some nights that's where they seat you. I love this place. My favorite restaurant in the country.
