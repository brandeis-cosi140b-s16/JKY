I give the Machos a 5-star because they make simple, good tacos. 
Salsa bar is great, especially the hot sauce and the carrots. 
Place is clean and friendly.
Maybe grill or light fry the tortillas so they don't crumble, but this only happened to 1 of 3 tacos, so what do I know!
Also, make you register offer tip options. We like you that mucho!
Boom!
