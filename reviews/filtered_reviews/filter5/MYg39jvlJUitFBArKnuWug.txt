It's places like this that give meaning to the term 'hidden gem.' You can barely see the sign for Sombrero's from the street - probably why I've passed it a million times and never really noticed it. Luckily for me it came up on Yelp when I was looking to satisfy my craving for Mexican!

I stopped in around dinnertime. It wasn't very busy so I was able to just walk right up to the counter. The women working were very friendly and more than willing to walking through the different meat options.

I got a burrito bowl with carnitas. Like Chipotle, they let you choose what you want in your bowl. I was a little worried t first because the carnitas looked like they might be spicy (they were in a red sauce). But actually they were not hot, just very flavorful. The meat was really tasty, the other ingredients tasted fresh and the bowl came with a small side of chips which were perfect for scooping up my bowl ingredients. I can see why their nachos are so popular. Something about their chips make them great with toppings.

This place is the real deal. Good portions and good prices. Plus they have awesome murals on the wall. I only wish they hadn't run out of churros! Oh well, there's always next time!
