We have been Ritos burritos  fans for many years!! Specifically for the location of 51st Avenue and Glendale. We moved further out west and we're sad that we would no longer be able to enjoy our Ritos burritos as often as we did! To our great surprise we found a RITOs  located in surprise! Let me say we were not disappointed the red chili burrito was just as good or actually my husband thinks was even better than what we've had before. The beans were great , very tasty, however a bit thicker . My only critique would be that I would like to have the cheese Tortilla to be a little bit crispier ! Overall we recommend this restaurant for some good authentic red and green burritos! We recommend this location if you have grown to love the original RITOs!!!!!! Also another plus size they accept credit and debit cards!!!!!!!!!
