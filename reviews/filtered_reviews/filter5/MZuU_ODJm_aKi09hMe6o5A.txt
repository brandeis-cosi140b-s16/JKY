I've been here twice now, both times I ordered one of their Tortas and both times I was definitely satisfied with my meal.

The first time was a few months ago and I tried the Tortas Del Rey; their signature torta.  This thing is absolutely HUGE!  Everything in the torta was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent.

The next time I ordered something new on the menu called the Torta Norte√±a. This torta has grilled steak, grilled onions, jalapenos, cheese, avocado and a mayo chipotle sauce that made the sandwich extremely tasty.

I am looking forward to the next time at Los Reyes, this food hits the mark!
