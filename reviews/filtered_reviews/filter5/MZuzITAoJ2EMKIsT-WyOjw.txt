If you like burrito's this is as good as it gets! Move over Moe's, Qdoba, Tijuana Flats and Sulsaritas you have nothing to compare to Phat burrito. I wish I was closer to Phat Burrito and could go there more because it is super tasty. I prefer the fish burrito with there lovely mango salsa that they put on it but you really cant go wrong with anything there. Its not the fanciest place by all means but they have a real relaxed atmosphere and the staff really seems to enjoy working there.
