I discovered this place on a whim when we were driving around central Phoenix a few weeks ago. It had a cool Dia de los Muertos skull on the sign and I thought someone had told me about it so we stopped in for a weekend lunch. 

Our server was super nice and explained about their awesome salsa bar as everyone else here has commented on. I loved the chipotle tomatillo salsa, while my husband preferred the pico de gallo and my daughter (who is 2) could not get enough of the creamy cilantro one. I had the Condesa special tacos which were awesome, especially when topped with some of that chipotle tomatillo salsa. 

What was really outstanding though was the horchata. So outstanding that after finishing mine in the restaurant, I ordered another one to go. It's not like any horchata that I've ever had before as it was kind of light brown in color and had lots of chopped up fruit and nuts in it. I would go back just for the horchata!
