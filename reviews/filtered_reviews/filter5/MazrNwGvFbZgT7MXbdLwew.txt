We may have been spoiled because I went for a Bachelorette dinner and our meal was specially created by Chef Simon who is a good friend of one of my girlfriends. 

At first, I was not expecting anything more than another filling, greasy, mexican meal. Then, I tasted the salsa trio and each was a burst of flavor. All of them were delicious- green chile and smoky chipotle were my faves. Then the meal went up a notch when the guacamole cart came around. The guacamole was made fresh table side. Ours was spicy and so good!! I am going to make some at my next party. 

Then came the main course:
Sea Bass- cooked to perfection, buttery, melted in my mouth
Steak- medium rare, juicy, mouthwatering
Chicken Mole- tender, sauce was killer, could lick it off the plate
Rice and beans- beans didn't have the canned refried bean taste, not oily. 

Desserts- Cheesecake, Choc Cake, Flan, and beignets (?) I was too full to taste all of them but the fried donut looking things were good. I am a fan of sugar donuts so I liked it. 

It was such a good meal that it made me sleepy. I wanted to call it a night but it was just the beginning.....hour 14 of my 24 hrs in Vegas!

Thanks  to Chef SIMON and his staff for giving us excellent food and superb service.
