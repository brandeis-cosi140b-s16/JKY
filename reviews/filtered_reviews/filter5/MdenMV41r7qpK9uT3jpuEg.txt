I tried this amazing place for the first time about 3 weeks ago and I must say I instantly fell in love. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place to eat at. The owners are always very friendly and attentive. I've tried only a few dishes and some desserts, and all of them are delicious. The mole is so rich in flavor, the best I've had in my life. The chanclas are some sort of sandwich stuffed with chicken and a sauce on it made out of chorizo and other ingredients, it's so delicious. I am glad we have this restaurant in the neighborhood. I'm ready to try all of their dishes. If you like to eat TexMex don't even bother to come here, they only have delicious authentic cuisine from the Central part of Mexico.
