I was here with a group of about 12 people tonight, and I think at some point independently each and every one of us said "I can't believe this is in champaign," with an emphasis on "I can't believe this is in champaign behind the neil street post office."

For real.  This is the best food I've had in champaign.  My strip steak was a fantastic cut of meat, prepared perfectly.  I sampled almost everyone else's dish, and there was nothing that I couldn't have eaten a whole plate of.  Duck Enchiladas, man.

Hit it up now, before word gets out and it gets impossible to get in.
