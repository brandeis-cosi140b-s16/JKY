Still head over hills for The Mission.  I have even made a pit-stop on the way home to kill my sweet potato fries and grilled street corn craving (I know carb overload).  They just added a few new things to the menu, one of which is the black cod, loved it (hopefully that can help balance out my love of the carbs).  Be sure to make a reservation because the cat is out of the bag on the locally owned gem!!
