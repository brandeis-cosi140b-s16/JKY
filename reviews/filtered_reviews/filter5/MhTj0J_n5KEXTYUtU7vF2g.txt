We went to La Hacienda last night for dinner - it came highly recommended by a friend of ours who works at The Princess (thank you Sarah!). We were a little uncertain since it seemed a little pricey for Mexican food (there's a Mexican food restaurant on just about every corner in AZ), but since we are staying at the resort, we decided to try it. We are so happy we did! If you come here, get something worth trying that you won't find on other menus (don't get your standard tacos, fajitas, or enchiladas). Our server was very helpful and offered excellent suggestions.

We started with the Pepitas Guacamole - not your typical guac. They add veggies, pepitas, and other ingredients to make it extra delicious and different. The salsa that comes with it was amazing too!

For entrees we shared a steak dish, Tampiquena, as well as the Carnitas. Although Carnitas is something you can find in many places, this one was fantastic. Our server highly recc as his favorite dish :) Our favorite was the Tampiquena steak. The Tampiquena comes with a cheese enchilada covered in mole sauce. I'm not a fan of Mole sauce, but my fiancé absolutely loved it. The sauce was only on the cheese enchilada so it didn't alter the deliciousness of the steak for me. I also loved the Habanero Slaw that came with the Carnitas. Yumm!!

I guess our entrees took longer than the chef wanted so he gave us a complimentary dessert - Tres Leches cake! We didn't actually notice the wait, but appreciated the kind gesture. We were stuffed so we took it to go and ate it for breakfast :) 

Drinks: we had been drinking by the pool all day so we just went with cervezas. I had a Tecate, Michelada style, and it was perfect! My fiancé had a Negro Modelo. 

Overall, great ambiance and prices weren't bad for a restaurant at a five-star resort. We enjoyed everything so much we would definitely recommend it.
