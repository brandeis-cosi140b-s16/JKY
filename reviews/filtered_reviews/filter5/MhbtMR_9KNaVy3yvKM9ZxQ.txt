We went for my wife's birthday dinner and it was great! We had reservations and were quickly seated in a great spot to see the lights of Vegas and enjoyed chips, salsa and bean dip. Dinner was excellent and the service was prompt. The menu has everything you could want and more unique dishes than anywhere else for Mexican food. To finish the celebration our server and staff all sang a birthday song, gave my wife a tequila shooter, fresh churro's and made her wear a sombrero. Fun, festive, and did I say, amazing food!
