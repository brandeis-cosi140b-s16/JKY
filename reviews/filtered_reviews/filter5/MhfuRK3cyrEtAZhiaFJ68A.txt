I loved the food, the decor, the service, and the feeling Casa Reyna provided me with at my lunch today!  It was not crowded, which was shocking to me for how great my experience was there.  Definitely better than any Mexican food that I have had before and it is all pretty much made right there.  The food is all locally produced which made me feel comfortable eating it.  If you are thinking about going out for a traditional, delicious mexican lunch or dinner I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.  Also they have the cool little store upstairs with lots of different Mexican foods to purchase and take home with you.
