We love this place! Normally we dine in getting a queso fundido, shrimp ceviche salad and fajitas, which we always have a ton of leftovers to bring home, typically lasting us another meal or two. It is always pleasant and the food is constantly delicious. We enjoy the free chips, salsa and bean dip as soon as we sit. However, today we got take out of just the shrimp ceviche salad and the fundido to go everything was just as delicious at home. I did ask for the fundido in a metal tin so I could reheat it in the oven, it was perfect, hot and delicious. The salad is constantly perfect to me and the edible bowl has a great flavor.
