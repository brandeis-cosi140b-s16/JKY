I've been passing by Tubbs for awhile and i finally bad a journey to go in. It was an amazing experience for me. From the drinks like the paradise margaritas to the endless chips and salsa. The entr√©e omg there so good I've been try a new one everytime I go.

In the theme of atmosphere it definitely feels like walking into a piece of Texas style dining. They also have the food to back it you. When you sit down your give a great greeting  and a basket of chips to snack on, make sure you stop by the salsa bar. I always get one of each.

This restaurant brings Atwood street alive. It's a must stop spot on the eastside of madison.
