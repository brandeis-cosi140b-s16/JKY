The food is always great at both Popo's locations. I have been a fan for over 35 years. The restaurant has never been known for great or even mediocre service. Our server tonight must have been the reigning Arizona Hide-N-Seek Champion. We could not find him to save our life. Good luck in the regional qualifier against Big Foot.
