Everything was tremendous,  from the chips and salsa to the frozen drinks that were on special.  Although it did take nearly 2 months to get into the place due to the hours of operation and them being booked on reservations,  the food was well worth the wait.  I had the wagu  beef tacos and it was amazing.  Would recommend to everyone I know.
