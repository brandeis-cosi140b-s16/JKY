I recently found myself at Los Olivos for dinner and was reminded of just how great this place really is. 

I have been there many times and almost always order the same thing - the mini combo. It's a mini taco, mini enchilada, mini tamale and a mini tostada served with rice and beans. A plate full of mini food! Yea! Awesome every time. 

On my last visit I decided to keep it simple and just get two tacos. Full sized. I got one chicken and one beef. I had never had the chicken and was pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite and discovered it was fried chicken! In a taco! Score.

Whether you like chicken or beef (or I think they might have shrimp) the tacos at Los Olivos are the best tacos in town, hands down.

And to top it off they have really good chips and salsa, which to me can make or break a place.

The other great thing about this place is the first room as you walk into the seating area. It looks like what a mexican hobbit hut might look like. Totally cool.
