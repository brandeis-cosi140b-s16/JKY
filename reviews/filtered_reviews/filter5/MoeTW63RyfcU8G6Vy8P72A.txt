Get the sweet pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style. It's so good that I haven't ever tried anything else. 

Line usually takes about 15 minutes because the place is popular. It's an assembly line and you will repeat your order to about 4 different people before you get to the cashier.  Totally annoying, but the food is worth it!
Tortillas are made right there -very fresh.
