My wife and I moved here at the end of August 2015. Before we relocated I started using Yelp to bookmark the places I thought would be good, Paquime Street Foods was one of the first and we have been eating here 2-3 times a week ever since, why? Because it really is authentic street foods of Mexico, except that the restaurant is sooooo clean and the people that work there are so professional and neat that its actually better than eating at a taco, torta or antojitos cart in the dusty Mexico streets, I can say that because I was born there, and plus its true.

Our favories so far have been the potatoe and cheese soup on fridays (get there early cuz it runs out), it tastes just like the one my nana and mom make, the only thing I would add would be some corn kernels. The rib eye tacos are way better tasting than any taco I have had in phoenix and taste as good or better than any taqueria in Mex., get em on flour tortillas. And my wife loves their tostadas and flautas, her favorite are the shredded beef ones. Weve also had their pozole, their broccoli soup is the best one ive ever had and i like to add a bit of Tapatio sauce to mine. We love their pork tortas, breakfast tortas and mexican hot dogs. For dessert, their pan dulce is so soft and sweet and one of the best crafted breads ive had, their flan is one of our favorite and their esquimales are also bigger and better tasting than the paleteros on the street in Mex.

In conclusion, this place is too legit, and we will continue to eat there regularly as long as they keep serving great food in this extremely clean and inviting environment.
