What can I say... I LOVE tacos! And these definitely do not disappoint. The tacos are huge! I mean MUCHO MACHO huge! I ordered 6 thinking they were small basic tacos and I was wrong. They are packed with flavor and each one has its own flair. I really liked the Pastor (sweet and flavorful with green papaya) they even have sriracha here too! The 50/50 was perfect, great combo of flavors with the pico and queso fresco. A great ( and clean ) place by another local owner! Wish I had more room to try dessert, I also had a fresh batch of Horchata topped with pecans (sooo good and refreshing) . Dan and his staff are super friendly and want to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. If you are in the downtown/uptown area this is def a great taco spot.
