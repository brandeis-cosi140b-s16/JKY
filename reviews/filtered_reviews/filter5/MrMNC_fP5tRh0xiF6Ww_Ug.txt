Went to check out Cinco de Mayo specials that I read about on-line. $5 margaritas and happy hour prices all night! 
I arrived at around 6:00pm and the place was packed! The hostess was helpful, we ended up grabbing a high top table within 5 mins. Instead of waiting 30 mins. for the sushi bar.

I ordered the house margarita, sesame ginger chicken taco, tempura cod taco, and chicharron de pollo. Everything came out VERY quickly and tasted super fresh. My uncle had the edamame and Salmon avocado handroll which he enjoyed. 

Overall great service, decent portions, and flavorful food. Considering the crowd that was there, everything was perfect.
