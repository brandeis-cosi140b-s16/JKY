Zero complaints except maybe that I wish the place itself was larger! The atmosphere is spot on, it has the feel of beach taco shop for sure. The outdoor seating area is awesome, super fun place to kick back with friends! The tacos were sooooo good and prices were reasonable! Crab fries were yummy!!! The owner was super cool and making his rounds, service was spot on. I will def be back!!!
