Wow!  I don't write enough about the great places at which my wife and I eat, but this one CANNOT be dropped!  We're in town with friends for a little R&R when a chef at another restuarant, also excellent, suggested this place among 10 or so others.  This food is AWESOME!  We started with margaritas: she had the pear basil, I the Aguacate.  I thought hers was sweet but tasty; mine was out-of-the-ballpark fantastic.  So good, in fact, that my wife got a second margarita, an Aguacate.  It's loaded with avacado -- yes, avocado!  Weird, but really good!  You MUST try this one.  Then we went on to a grilled street corn appetizer.   Fantastic!  We had it off the cob (easier to share).  It had a sort of chipotle aioli, which I guess was the chile paprika, with butter, cilantro, and cotija.  Then came my brisket torta:  smoked brisket, habanero, barbeque, aji amarillo, coleslaw, yucca bread.  I love this place!  My wife had the butternut squash tacos -- and I really didn't think any non-vegetarian could get this excited about a vegetarian dish!  Superb!  We tried the sweet honey chipotle grits as a side, which I thought were too sweet, but interesting, and we tried the Mission fries, a mix of sweet and regular fries with seasoning, lime, and chipotle ketchup or aji amarillo.   The damages with all of the above (total 4 margaritas) came to $86.00, sans tip.  The service was wonderful -- thanks Simona!  Lots of other cool selections.  Had I room for more I would be telling you about dessert.  Until next time (tomorrow?), I continue to be your
