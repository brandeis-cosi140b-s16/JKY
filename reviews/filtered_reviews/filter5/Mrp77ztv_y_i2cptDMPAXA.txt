We ordered the table side guac, the deep fried chicken taquitas, and the sea food enchiladas.

The server (omar) was kind enough to tell us that if we checked in through yelp, we would get the flan for free.

Now onto the review of the food. The salsas, three types, are all very flavorful.  My favorite is the green and the medium red one.  The tableside guac is delicious, and we'll worth the high price.  The sea food enchiladas is very good,  the combination of the creamy sauce and the scallops work well.  The chicken taquitas was crispy!  The flan was well made and is creamier than the other flans I've previously had. 

Also, reservations on Monday are necessary, otherwise the wait can extend to 2 hours.  Another option is to hover around the bar to find a bar seating for dinner.
