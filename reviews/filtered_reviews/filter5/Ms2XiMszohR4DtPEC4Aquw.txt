This place is awesome! This was my first time in AZ, and I wanted to see what AZ had to offer me.. Not only are the bartenders great at El Hefe, but the staff is amazing as well. I came here on a Saturday night, had little to no wait getting in ( we were a group of 8 btw ) the DJ had the crowd going the entire night ( actually having songs you can dance to helps ) He plays quite a bit of variety, so everyone's able to enjoy themselves. I was able to get a bite or two to eat, and the food is great it was really fresh, and didn't feel to heavy, just the perfect type of atmosphere if you're looking to have fun with a group of people, or even stop on by for dinner ( which I might consider next time I come back to AZ) Must admit the lemon drops were the best drink of the night for me! highly recommend making this a stop on your weekend and enjoying both the food, and the club.
