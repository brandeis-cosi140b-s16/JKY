I've been here many times since my last review years ago, on their opening night, so it's time for an update.

All of my bar experiences here have been great. My last review criticized the draught list. Not anymore. They always have a well-curated and seasonal rotating list that is short and sweet. The happy hour is a great deal for margaritas, and the daily specials are good as well.

The service has been nothing short of phenomenal, to be completely honest. I'm a vegetarian with a million food allergies under the sun, and they ALWAYS accommodate me without making me feel guilty for asking. The servers and bartenders are the perfect fit for this place, knowledgable and trendy and always up for a recommendation or a chat.

The food is really unique, and everything from the dips to the tacos to the brunch is worthy of trying. The menu is short and simple, with only the best food making the cut on the menu. Cheers, Verde!
