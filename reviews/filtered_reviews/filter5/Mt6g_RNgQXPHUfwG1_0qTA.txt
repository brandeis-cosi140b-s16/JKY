I went here on a Saturday afternoon, oh, about 3 p.m. It was a perfect time. Parking was not an issue. I was able to park in front of the restaurant. There was plenty of patio seating with lots of shade. I ordered the Carnitas en Chile Verde appetizer. Delish! As for the entree, Ivhad the Cochinita Pibil and it was sooooo good! The service was beyond excellent. I wish I could remember our server's name. She made sure we had everything we needed. I will definitely go back again! :)
