This place is a diamond in the rough cause it's hard to notice but once here u will fall in love w/ the food & drinks. Plus the service is right there w/ any 5 star restaurant as they r very attentive to you. Felt as if I should wear a suit & tie just to eat here due to the incredible service I received.

Plus if u need a little retouch on your latin dance moves they got you w/ dance lessons on Tuesdays 6pm-7pm & 8pm-9pm

My recommendation is the tres leches cake & the Imperial Shrimp. 

Everyone needs to come down and make this the new locals spot as it operates 24/7 like true Vegas style.
