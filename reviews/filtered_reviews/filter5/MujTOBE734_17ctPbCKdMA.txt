Love this place!  The name pretty much says enough for the whole review:  Blanco TACOS AND TEQUILA....what more do you need.  Okay, the food was yummy, and service was top-notch!  We had the guacamole (huge serving)  and a cheese crisp with beef and avocado that was very tasty, but don't miss out on one of the 30+ tequila's in your margarita!  I had their "classic"  on-the-rocks-with-salt and it was perfect.

The BEST thing about this restaurant is that it's casual and a spot for anyone.  You don't expect that at " The Borgata", but it's a fact-check it out!  We saw everything from a large group of business people, ladies with their children and 2 young guys hangin' at the bar.  Love it and hope to be back soon for a full meal or-- just drinks. 

All Fox restaurants are having a killer happy hour special running through the summer so check them out!
