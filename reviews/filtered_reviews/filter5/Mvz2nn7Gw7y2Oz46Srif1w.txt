My husband and I always stay at New York New York. This is our favorite place to eat there by far! The food is amazing! Their appetizers are so good. And the service is the best. The manager Mary is wonderful and I wish all servers at other restaurants were as awesome as Chris. Already looking forward to our next trip just so we can eat there!
