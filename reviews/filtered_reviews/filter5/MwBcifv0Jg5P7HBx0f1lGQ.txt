I'm really surprised I'm able to give a Las Vegas restaurant 5 stars but this place did everything that I want in a restaurant right. 
1. We had a party of 8 at 8pm. We were seated in 10 minutes after being told it would be a 20 minute wait.
2. The drinks were good. Las Vegas pricey. 
3. The food was excellent. I am only going to talk about my experience since our party was so large, I didn't have a chance to ask how everyone else enjoyed it. 
The chips and salsa were great. The chips were puffy and the salsa was not too spicy. I got a ceviche, which was spicy and perfectly seasoned. It was really, really good. I also got the fish tacos which had a really delicious salsa on top. 

We stayed at Bally's this visit and will do so in the future. When we do, we'll definitely come back for another visit.
