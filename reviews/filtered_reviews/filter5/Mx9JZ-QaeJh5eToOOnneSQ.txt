Well.  WOW.  I honestly can't believe how good this place is.  I have been a long-time fan of Carolina's so I feel bad for saying this, but Rito's beats it hands down.  I went for the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style (I meant to specify green sauce but I didn't so it came with red) and it was amazing.  I can't wait to try it again with the green sauce.  My friend ordered two shredded beef tacos...and wow.  You can't go wrong here.
