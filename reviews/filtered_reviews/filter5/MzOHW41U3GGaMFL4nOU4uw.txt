My family has loved Somburros ever since we moved to Gilbert. When we found out the owners opened up a sit down restaurant we couldn't resist. 

The atmosphere at Isabel's Amor is so cozy yet chic. The service was amazing. We had the most adorable server named Isabel; she ended up being the great granddaughter of the actual Isabel that the restaurant was named after.

I always get the pollo fundido at Somburros, if you like that you have to try the carne asada burrito, but you have to get it enchilada style with red sauce. Best decision I ever made. One of the most amazing parts is they keep their warm chips and delicious salsa coming. You also cannot leave without trying their home made tortilla, so soft and so warm. I have yet to have more authentic sit down Mexican food.
