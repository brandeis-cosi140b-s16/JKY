This was my second time at Tacos El Gordo--and it was just as good (although more inebriated) than the first. 

Came after spending the night with Lil'John at Surrender. We got the pork shoulder, carne asada, tripe, and tongue. The pork shoulder was my favorite--some bits crispy and some bits very juicy and flavorful. I think we inhaled those tacos within minute (granted, they're sized to be about two large bites). 

Great way to end a great night out, or in the words of Lil'John, YEEAAAYYYUUHHH.
