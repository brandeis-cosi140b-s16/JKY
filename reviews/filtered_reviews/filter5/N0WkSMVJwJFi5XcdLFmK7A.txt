If you're looking for fast, friendly service with scrumptious Sonoran Mexican cuisine...this is a spicy jewel in N. Scottsdale.  I would go here for the chips and salsa alone!  They also have a very cozy little patio outside with a rolling creek that makes sipping the house margaritas even more enjoyable.  

Wondering what's yummy to eat here?  I'd say start with the mini fundidos. These beauties are mini eggrolls stuffed with cheese, chicken, and green chili goodness, drenched in a jalapeno cream cheese sauce.  Served up in a mini skillet these are a tasty way to start your dining experience.  

I've sampled a few of the dishes here, and if you are a fan of green chile, you will be very pleasantly surprised to see a variety of their dishes are made with Hatch green chile.  Growing up in New Mexico, I was very happy to see this on the menu!  When the menu says "spicy" they mean it!  Try the enchiladas, quesadillas, and the green corn tamales.
