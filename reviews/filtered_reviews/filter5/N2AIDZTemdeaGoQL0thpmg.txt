Distrito is a unique dining experience; located in the Saguaro hotel, the decor is quirky, colorful and fresh.  This place is a foodie's paradise. 

The menu consists of modern Mexican tapas (small[er] plates), an interpretation of the street food of Mexico ("Distrito Federal").  Everything comes out as its ready and is meant to be shared.  Flavors are Iron Chef-worthy (after all, it is Iron Chef Jose Garces's creation); whatever you do, don't rush through the meal!  Every bite packs a lot of flavor, and it was fun to discern each ingredient as we pregressed though the meal. 

My favorites were the yellowtail ceviche (at√≥n), the traditional guacamole, chilangro chop salad, tacos de pollo, tacos de mahi mahi, and jicama con manzana (jicama, cabbage and apple slaw).  The cochinita a la pibil (berkshire pork shoulder with achote and pineapple BBQ) was a little too acidic for my taste. 

It was an enjoyable dining experience, definitely out of the ordinary. I'm excited to return for different tastes from the plentiful menu.
