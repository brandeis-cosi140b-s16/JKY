One word to describe the restaurant: sexy!  With super cool decor and some nice mood lighting, that is the first word that comes to my mind when I think of this restaurant.  On both of my visits I was lucky to be seated in a comfy, spacious booth in the back overlooking the whole place and was able to take in the ambiance.  That spot was great for people-watching!

They serve complimentary chips and salsa which taste amazing!  We totally could not stop eating them, even after our entrees came.  The salsa was tasty and the chips so crispy and not too greasy.  Yum!!  So good that we ended up coming back the next night as well!  Sorry, Chevys.  I now have a new favorite place for chips and salsa!   

As for my entrees, the first night I got the combination plate with one cheese enchilada and one crispy chicken taco.  Rice and refried beans came with my meal as well.  I enjoyed the taco but I've had better enchiladas elsewhere, so the next night I ended up getting the taco dinner (crispy chicken tacos again).  To drink that night I ordered a virgin strawberry margarita, which was pricey at $10 but really good.   Other items we tried: their guacamole and fried ice cream.  Their guac was fine though not as tasty as their salsa and not quite up there with Dos Caminos guac.  Their ice cream was ok as well.  I think we just got some to be able to hang out there a little bit longer :p

This place is so much busier than the restaurant that was here before, and with good reason.  Great atmosphere, tacos, virgin margaritas, and chips and salsa = one of my new favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!
