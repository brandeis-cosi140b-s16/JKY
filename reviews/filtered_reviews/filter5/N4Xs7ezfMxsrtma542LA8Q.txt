If you're in the mood for tacos, this is the place. Their carne asada is delicious because you can really get that "off the grill" taste. My favorite thing here is their carne asada-crazy potato. It's basically a baked potato with taco fillings. They also have a good variety of salsa and condiments on the side such as pico de gallo and cucumbers. I personally mix the pico, green salsa and a bit of lime juice in my crazy potato to create the perfect flavor and heat, but to each their own. I also like that you get free chips and salsa every time you check in so I put a little bit of that in my crazy potato as well. They have Coke by the glass bottle and delicious horchata as well. 

Quick tip: come before dinner time (~6pm) if you want to dine in because it does get crowded and you might have to sit outside in the cold/hot weather that AZ has to offer.
