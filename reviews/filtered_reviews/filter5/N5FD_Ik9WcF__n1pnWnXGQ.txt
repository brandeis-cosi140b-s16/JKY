Best tacos in my time here in Arizona. These aren't your taco Tuesday tacos, but they are at a Taco Tuesday price. All tacos are 2 bucks all day every day. The place was empty at noon midweek and you order at the counter and the cute counter girl brings you the tacos and a green and smoky red sauce with a kick in a cold squirt bottle. These are way above normal drive-through salsa taste and leave a great aftertaste. The Carne Asada tacos were stuffed pretty nicely with meat (onions and cilantro are your choice) and the tortillas were griddled and laid down double so nothing ever fell apart. I started with two and had to return for dos more. English is spoken here, but all the customers that day were of the Mexican origin. The counter girl was very sweet, even pointing out some cilantro on my face as I ordered for the second time. Now that is good service.
