My wife found this place based on reviews while she was traveling earlier this month. It just so happened that we were already coming back to this area for vacation, and this was the first place we ate at in Glendale because she previously had such a good meal.

So my expectations were very high because it's all she has been talking about.

And I was not disappointed! First of all, the salsa bar is huge and offers so many diverse flavors. Pecan? Peanut? Radish? Along with the more traditional salsas. Here's a tip, try mixing the Pecan with the Rabano Pibil (Radish) for a great combination. My personal favorite was the guacamole salsa, it definitely has some heat.

I had the El Goucho Quesa and it was amazing. It's like a deepfried quesadilla, with amazing argentine seak with tons of other goodness inside. The Oaxaca cheese is so good sprinkled across the top along with avocado slices.

Another thing that beat my expectations - the house margarita. A little sweeter than the usual margarita (flavor comes from grapefruit juice) and if I weren't driving I would have had 2 during the meal.
