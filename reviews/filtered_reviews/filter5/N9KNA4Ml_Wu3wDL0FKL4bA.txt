We came here one night based on a recommendation from our AirBnB hosts, who live down the street.  The food is amazing, the atmosphere is terrific, as is the service.  A standout was the bartender, who took extremely good care of us and everyone else who needed anything during the half hour wait for a table (totally worth it, by the way).

This is the food I grew up with, but cooked the way only the best home cooks can manage.  it's authentic and refined and completely delicious.  I look forward to more visits and working my way through the menu.  Also, weekend brunch here is on my Phoenix bucket list.
