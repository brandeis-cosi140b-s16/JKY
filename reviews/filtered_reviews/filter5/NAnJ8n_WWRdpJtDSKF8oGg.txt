Very enjoyable meal. Would rate 4.5 stars so I'll round up. We had lunch on a Saturday. Weekend menu has brunch items as well as the regular menu. We got the tableside guacamole which was great. We also shared the grilled street corn which was nicely topped with a spicy cream/cheese sauce. I had steak tacos and wife had chicken tacos. Small tortillas but stacked with a good amount of the meat/fish of choice. 
Can sit out on the pato or inside which is nicely done in wood and dark tones. Service was very efficient and attentive. My only complaint was the table for 2 is too small. Having chips and guac leaves little room for other plates. Dessert menu could be improved. We had the fried banana and it was okay but enjoyed the cinammon gelato. Prices a little high but on avg for Old Town. Will definitely return for the guac and tacos!
