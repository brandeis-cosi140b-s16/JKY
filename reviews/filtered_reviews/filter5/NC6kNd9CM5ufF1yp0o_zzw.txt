Whenever, and I mean, whenever I am in Vegas, I visit Lindo Michoacan.

Everyone I have recommended is a loyal customer.

Let's start with, you can call the restaurant, and as long as you have more than 2 people, they will pick you up and drop you off.

Once you enter, it's a nice soft light setting.  I suggest sitting on the side where the one man live entertainment is located, it adds a bit of an ambiance.  Once your seated, you're provided amazing chips, with a refried bean dip as well as a salsa.  Order the Pina Colada, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

I had the Chicken Fajitas, such a plentiful serving and tasteful meal.  I am unsure, but I do believe their tortillas are freshly made.  In the past, I have had their shrimp, which is also delicious.

Their service is phenomenal, they have a team of servers that stand by, waiting to help.

I can see why they have been voted a top restaurant, they never falter, and in every visit, I am guaranteed great food, time, and experience.  I must recommend you celebrate yours or your family birthday here, YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT!  I need to end this review, I am becoming hungry and Vegas is far away!
