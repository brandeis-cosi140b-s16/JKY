Love cafe rio! It is kind of like chipotle, except good. The barbacoa is where it is at. I always go for the enchiladas with hot sauce. I don't care too much for their beans, but the rice is great as well. They do fresh tortillas on the grill. I always grab an extra one as they are too good to pass up.
