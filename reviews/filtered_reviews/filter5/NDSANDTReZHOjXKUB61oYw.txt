The Spirit of the Old West Alive Awards have held the last two months events at Macayo's Mexican Kitchen and everyone (30-40 attendees)was very happy with the food. Friday nights can get busy but our service has always been great! JT takes good care of us dealing with everything from special requests to hanging banners. 
The food is always wonderful! Hot and seasoned just right. Generous portions and plenty of chips and salsa. The Margaritas are perfect. I can't say enough to thank Randy for setting up screen and projectors, and making ours a nice evening for people who keep the spirit of the old west alive.
