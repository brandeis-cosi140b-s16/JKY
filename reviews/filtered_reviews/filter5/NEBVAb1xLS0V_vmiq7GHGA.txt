I live in Mesa, but any time I'm headed out downtown I think of Mi Patio. I was first taken there with a friend who grew up in the area, and now I take the guests! The taco salad is big, filling, and tasty- get the shredded chicken, and say yes to the guac and sour cream. The Baja Burrito comes in the most amazing cream sauce- get that dish with rice and mix it all up. Top it off with a $3.50 huge margarita- it must be close to 30 oz- they are the cheaper "sweet mix" taste, but the price is right!
