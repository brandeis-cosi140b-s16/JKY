Been here 2x now.

I saw the bad service reviews and wanted to try it twice to see if the experience was consistent.  Both times - excellent.  Our server(s) attended to everything on time - every time.  Service was spot on.  

The food was the best part.  I'm an AZ original and have been eating this family's restaurants for decades.  The youngest member of the family to open this new La Ristra location has captured the flavorful art of time-tested New Mexican inspired dishes and added a little different twist at the same time.  The best part is still the Hatch chilies that bring this menu to life.  

I had the adovada ribs on my first trip and loved them.  Cooked until they were falling off the bone and covered in a rub that was hot but not ridiculous.  Very good with the house margarita and black beans and fresh tomato slices.  

On my next trip I rolled up on the traditional New Mex burrito with carne adovada and green sauce.  Again - hot - not stupid - and loaded with flavor.  The tortilla had been slightly crisped before being made enchilada style (melted cheese and a crisp tortilla is always good) and the rice and beans were spiced perfectly.  The whole plate worked well.  

Everyone's food arrived in a timely fashion and came out hot/fresh.  

They've won my business - I'll certainly be back.
