If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out. You need to get in your car, buy a Carlito's burrito, ask for it smothered in green chili and taste it; you can thank me for the tip later. The nachos too have this sweet spice on it and even when you're at the bottom cause you ate all your nachos in one sitting, you'll still find cheesy goodness at that last bite waiting for you. Great place.
