Living in Arizona for several years, I have been to a fair amount of taco shops. But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.

We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.

The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while. 

Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had. 

Next time I find myself in Vegas this will be at the top of my to-do list.
