Tried this restaurant several months ago, enjoyed it, and have been back many times since.  My wife and I usually get a traditional margarita, as they taste fresh and are delicious.  We have eaten quite a variety from their menu, at both lunch and dinner.  The multiple distinct flavors and evident clear quality never fail to impress us.  We always ask for the same server, Ramon, and his pleasant and enjoyable demeanor always adds to our experience.  Great place, and always look forward to returning.
