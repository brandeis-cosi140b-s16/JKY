For an airport restaurant, this place is great! I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service that I have since decided that I no longer hate this airport.
I was promptly seated and showed where an outlet was under my table, should I need it. Nice!
My waitress was SO friendly and helpful and was actually enthusiastic about the food. She also asked if I preferred sweet or not so sweet cocktails and gave me food suggestions. I seriously couldn't believe I was in an airport as she described the marination process of the shrimp.  
The drinks were great and the food was actually mighty tasty. The guac was fresh: sprinkled with cotija and cilantro, and the chips house-made. The shrimp chopped salad was bursting with different flavors and a really good-sized portion. I was super-stuffed by the end of the meal. Also, they let me hang out there for three hours and did not once rush me or pressure me to leave.
So if you have to eat in the Phoenix airport, go here, seriously.
