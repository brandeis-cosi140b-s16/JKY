Tried it last week. I thought it was terrific.  Quality of food, originality, prices......all excellent.  Service was very good.....tad slow but they had a party of 20 that might have thrown things off some. Some items are quite spicy so I'd ask about what you order.  Menu was cryptic to me, I had ask on a number of items; "what is this?"
Anyway, I don't write reviews often unless I really enjoy a place or if something is awful.  
PS: House margarita was terrific!
