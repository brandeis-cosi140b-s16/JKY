Holy cow Yum! I wish we had a place like this in Portland, Or. The salsa outstanding! I started with the Pineapple Margarita and my mom had the Pina Coloda. They were excellent. I had the chicken mole enchiladas, and they were the perfect balance between, chocolate and spices. These are a must try. 

If I ever visit Mesa again, I will be all over this place. :)
