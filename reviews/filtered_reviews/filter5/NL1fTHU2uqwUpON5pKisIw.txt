The Crescent Ballroom is probably my absolute favorite place to see a show! It's very spacious, yet intimate. The sound system and acoustics *R*O*C*K*!!!!! The staff has always been really friendly and deliver the utmost in professional service. The layout includes all that you could want in the way of two bars, ballroom, restaurant, indoor/outdoor seating and the place has never given me so much as one reason to complain. Even the bathrooms are always in tip-top. What's more is that the place, as well as the performances booked there, attract a very interesting, eclectic and amiable group of people and I've met someone new and cool everytime I've been there. In short: *L*O*V*E* it!!!!!
