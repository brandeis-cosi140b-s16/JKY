Is it Chinese? Mexican? I don't know but why am I eating beans with chopsticks?

This place is great! worth the experience, slightly complicated ordering system for the first timer, but they are there to help you through the process.

Food is cooked fantastically, flavors are great!

Stop in you won't be disappointed!!
