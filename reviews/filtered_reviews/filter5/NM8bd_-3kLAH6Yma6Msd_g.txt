Love this joint! The wife and I like the club at night, but this time we had ourselves a little day date. We made a reservation, which was easy and they sat us right on time. The hosts were great, then we met Adam-our waiter. He was SO chill and nice!!! He seriously killed it, he was funny, nice and had genuine customer service. We were going to get an app and some tacos, then he reccomended that we just hold off on the tacos until we see the nachos, which were the size of his head (insert joke here). They were! and they kicked butt!!! We had a 2 margaritas while we were waiting, then a pitcher with dinner and it was SO GOOOOOOD!

Adam-thanks for a fun dinner, you kicked ass.
Diablo's- keep up the good work!!!
