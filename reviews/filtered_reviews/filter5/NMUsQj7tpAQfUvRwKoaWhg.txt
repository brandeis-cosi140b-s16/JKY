My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one year anniversary and as per usual I scoured yelp to find a suitable restaurant choice. I was in the mood for Latin-type food and found Escobar's. The boyfriend and I left work around five and arrived at the restaurant around 5:30. I was expecting to be one of the first tables being that it was early. When we arrived there were already 5 or 6 tables seated, I took that as a good sign. 

We were promptly greeted and shown to a table. We were brought water and bread (delicious, by the way) and within a minute our waiter was at the table greeting us. 

As we looked over the menu our waiter described the special of the day and gave information on the many delicious sounding menu options. My boyfriend loves calamari so that was a no-brainer for the appetizer. He is pescatarian but the wild mushroom enchilada struck his fancy. His review: The enchiladas were delicious. Most places give you three smaller ones, here you get one large enchilada with a generous amount of filling. The sauce that covers the enchilada has a nice (not overpowering) bite to it. 

My food: AMAZING. I had the seafood paella, half a lobster, shrimp, and mussels. The lobster and shrimp were perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Some of the mussels were a tad overcooked but based on the rest of the meal I was willing to overlook this tiny misstep. 

The waiter was well on his game, eyeing our water glasses from across the room and bringing more before we even emptied the glass. 

We will definitely be coming back!
