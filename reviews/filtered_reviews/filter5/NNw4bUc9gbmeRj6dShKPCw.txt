I don't give many 5 star reviews because I believe they should be reserved for ONLY the best food combined with great ambiance.  This place does it all- and that is high praise after living and eating well in NYC for 2 years.  

The first time we tried eating here we walked away because the wait was 90 minutes minimum (Friday night at 6:30 PM).  We wised up and decided to try again arriving Saturday at 5:30.

We had a party of 4- and we were seated without a wait.  The waiter proved to be exceptional - offering descriptions of the entrees that made our mouths water.

We had the guacamole- made table side which was excellent. I have never tried it with pomegranite seeds before and it was a nice twist!  
For my main I had the slow roasted pork- Conchita Pibil, which was excellent.  The flavors in the mashed potatoes and grilled zuchini were also stellar.  
Someone in our party tried the chiles en Nogada (which is a seasonal dish) and it was excellent also. 
We skipped dessert because we were so full- next time I will save room.

 I will certainly come back here and highly recommend it to anyone who wants good authentic cuisine in a "funky" different atmosphere. 
Warning: it can get VERY loud around the bar area- especially on a Friday night.
