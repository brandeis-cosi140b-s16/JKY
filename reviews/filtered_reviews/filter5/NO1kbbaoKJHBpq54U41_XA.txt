I'd like to thank Charlotte social media for posting Instagram pics of this delicious spot. One picture of Mexican corn (elote) convinced me to go there as soon as possible. 

It didn't disappoint. It's one of the best restaurants I've tried in a long time. 

Everything was delicious: elote loco, arepas, empanadas, and carne arsada fries. The ground beef was crazy good and the grilled steak on the fries was tender. The arepa's flavor matched its ridiculous size. 

They have a solid selection of craft beers and cocktails. And a salsa bar! I kept eyeing other people's orders thinking that next time I'd order what they got. 

My boyfriend mentioned that this was his favorite restaurant in Charlotte so far.

Obviously, we are big fans. And yes, it was worth my own Instagram pic.
