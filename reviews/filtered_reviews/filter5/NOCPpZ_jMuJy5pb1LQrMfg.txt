If I could give 6 stars here, I totally would.

A year ago my wife and I (then engagaed) were looking for a reception venue. We shopped all around the strip at various hotels and chose Mandalay Bay. We wanted to have the reception within walking distance. Reading other reviews about various venues had us concerned and since we weren't spending a brazillion dollars we were given peasants' treatment. We decided to check out Border Grill and it we just couldn't say no. All in all we have to thank the manager Destiny for making it a wonderful experience without issue.

Fast forward a year later, the experience was right on the mark. We had Alicia as our server who was the right amount of attentive, the orders were turned around quick and service with a genuine smile.

The entre√©s are well priced and delicious. The skirt steak and goucho steak were two items I have tried and liked the best. I prefer mine a little rare and the seasoning was just right. Expect a hint of char. My wife had the chicken chilaquiles which were delightful - highly recommended.

Their signagure drinks are the house-infused margaritas and sangrias. All are fantastic. And let's not forget dessert. I am a big fan of the tres leches cake. A year later I am trying to find a way to replicate it.

In summary - the price is great for the high-level service and quality of food/drink. I can't recommend Border Grill enough.
