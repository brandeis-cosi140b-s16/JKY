PONCHOS IS BY FAR #1
(Not to be confused with the dingy Panchos Buffet.)  

This place in located in South Phoenix and is only about a 10 min drive away from the airport.. Makes it convenient for people who are traveling into or out of Phoenix and have that itch for real Mexican food. This place is always packed. The food is served piping hot, with great chili sauces and unlimited hot chips and salsa and is super affordable to boot! I recommend the Pollo Fundito - Marinated pulled chicken chimichanga that has a warm jalapeno cream cheese inside.. Not good for you, but tastes oh so good.. This place has great music, fantastic margaritas, and friendly service..  The one thing I do not like about this place is their Guacamole. It is unimpressive so don't waste your time adding that to any of your dishes. Lucky for us that we don't need the guac to make this place rock!  Side note... Bill Clinton dines here when he visits the grand canyon state.. They painted his picture on the wall where he usually sits. I'm a Republican and I keep coming back.
