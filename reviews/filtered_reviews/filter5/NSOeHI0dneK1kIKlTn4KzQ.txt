Came here on a Sunday night during Happy Hour. We were pleasantly greeted and escorted to our table. The hostess informed us we were in time for Happy Hour, so we scanned the menu to see if anything caught our eye. Man oh man is their HH menu extensive!? I was blown away!? We settled on a beer and strawberry margarita. Beer is standard, good as always; as for the margarita, that could be deadly and dangerous. It is so perfectly blended that you cannot taste the tequila. As for munchies, we were given an endless supply of chips, salsa, and refried beans. Yum.

As for our entrees, they were ridiculously good. We both live in San Diego, so our standard for Mexican food is relatively high, but I would come here in a heartbeat, if in the area again. We ordered a beef chimichanga and a chicken enchilada. Both were delicious and flavorful, especially the chicken. Neither were dry either. The portion was just right too. Not something you would share with someone else; if you took any home, it would be a VERY small amount.

The service was excellent, above average I would say. The food was spot-on. I hope this place makes it. It's a hidden gem if you are looking for somewhere off the strip to relax and enjoy.
