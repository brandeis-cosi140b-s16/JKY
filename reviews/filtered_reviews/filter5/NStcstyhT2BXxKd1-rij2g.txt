First time visit, late Saturday night. Food was good, though presentation wasn't too pretty. Ordered a burrito and when served, that's all that was on my plate. A little sauce and maybe a sprinkle of cheese with some garnish would have painted a prettier picture, but it nevertheless tasted very good. We shall return.
