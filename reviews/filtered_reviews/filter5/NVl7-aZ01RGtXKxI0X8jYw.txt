I'm very busy at work today but wanted to take a quick couple minutes to yelp about this place...

The carne asada burrito was great - alot of flavor, juicy, did not make my stomach hurt (like places like Filibertos sometimes do).

I'm confused at some of the reviews that call it pricey....My lunch companion mentioned it was extremely cheap (and he always complains about high prices so that is saying something!).

The place is very cute and just a perfect little place to grab a simple, delicious lunch (if you like carne asada like I do).
