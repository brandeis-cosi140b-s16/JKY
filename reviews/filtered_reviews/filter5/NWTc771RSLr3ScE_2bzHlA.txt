My fiance and I never would have heard about Maize if it was not for an article about them written in the DI. This very small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant is truly a hidden gem! The tastefully decorated building is very small and has limited seating, which honestly suits the quiet intimate atmosphere perfectly! (if parking or seating is a problem, you may want to show up during "off hours", such as after 1pm or before noon, perhaps? We visited during break when campus was empty and had no issues). The owner was very friendly, chatting with customers and explaining the different items to us and offering his recommendations.

The portions are very inexpensive ($2-4 on average!) and on the small size, so that you may mix-and-match different items. My fiance and I each ordered 2 chicken tacos and then shared 2 quesadillas: one filled with pumpkin blossom and one with huitlacoche. We had never had either filling, and they were AMAZING! The corn tortillas are all homemade, a little thicker than usual and really good. We were also offered free tortilla chips (which were also thicker than normal, perhaps made in-house? Very good!) with two delicious homemade salsas and lime. A delicious and filling meal for two for just over $10, not bad at all!

In short, this place offered some of the best Mexican food I've ever tried/ It is extremely authentic, and much lighter than the more stereotypical heavy refried beans/sour cream/cheddar cheese/oil-drenched Americanized "Mexican" fare. We will be returning next week to bring a large order home to my fiance's family in town :)
