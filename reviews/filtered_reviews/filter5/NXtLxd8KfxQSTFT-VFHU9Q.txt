Joy ride never disappoints! Great atmosphere, phenomenal food, and great drinks! On Saturdays they are in happy hour during the lunch hour, and the five dollar frescas are a must (the cucumber mint is my favorite!) The service is always friendly and fast, and the waiting area is a beautiful patio. We all got the tacos and loved them! Highly recommend the crispy fish :-)
