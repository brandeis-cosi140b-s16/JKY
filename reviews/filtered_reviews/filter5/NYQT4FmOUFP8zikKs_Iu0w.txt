Visited this place for the first time the other day. They have a great happy hour, it was buy one get on free drinks so my guest and i ordered a margarita and the waiter brought out 4. It was hard NOT to drink them since they were already on the table. Pretty thoughtful, since it started getting real busy after 6pm. I ordered the Cognac steak with the mushroom sauce, it was sooo good! Next time i want to try the Coca Cola steak, it sparked my curiosity.
