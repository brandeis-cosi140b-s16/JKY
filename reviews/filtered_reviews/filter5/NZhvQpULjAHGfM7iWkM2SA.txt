Maaaannnn. This is my favorite Tex-Mex spot in Madison. What got me hooked on the place was their margaritas. They are damn good (Ultimate/Palace). But, the best thing about this place, in my opinion, is the TAMALES!! Every single time I look at the menu like "Maybe I should get something different..." and (almost) every single time I don't. The tamales are the bomb. They also make a mean taco salad, as well as some delicious and unique tacos. I seriously haven't tried anything here that was not good. This includes their salsa bar (which you can enjoy for free if you're a Yelper and you check in) which has four delicious types of salsa. Anyway, I should probably get a job here so I can get a damn discount with how much we go.
