This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for 4 years now. The tortillas are the best I've ever had, and the Camarones con Rajas y Crema (shrimp in a cream sauce) is my go-to meal. I dip the tortillas in the shrimp sauce. The service definitely can be slow at times, but if you just ask any server for help they will always take care of you, sometimes you just have to ask!
