Best elote ever made. Their food is out of this world. The bar has many different salsas; all of which were fantastic. Every bite I ate of my carne asada burrito, I tried a different salsa. It was like having a different burrito in each bite. Lots of sides at the bar to choose from as well. Traditional veggies like cucumber, onions (grilled and uncooked). Black beans, etc. I can't say enough about the elote. It was off the hook!!! Great menu all around. A must if you are in Vegas!
