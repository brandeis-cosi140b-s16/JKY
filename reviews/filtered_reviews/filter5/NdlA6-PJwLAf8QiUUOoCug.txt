I had to find out what this restaurant was all about when my wife told me she couldn't wait to go (she has been here before). I don't eat mexican food, I don't generally like it and lived all these years not thinking mexican food could be this good. The fajitas were great, the guacamole appetizer was unlike any I've had before. I would describe it as gourmet mexican food. Excellent service as well.
