The holy grail of tacos... Believe the hype. This is the end all be all of my happiness for food. Best tacos ever, hands down. The exterior of the restaurant is a little rough looking and isn't very visible from the road. Also, I do wish the menu was more descriptive in regards to what the tacos were garnished with ect. Our food came out quickly and the service was good. Overall this was win and I can't wait to return. 

Items Ordered:
(Tacos) Shrimp, chorizo, fish & crane asada 

Carne asada quesadilla with a side of rice and black beans.
