Maybe not the world's most authentic Mexican food, but oh how I love Cantina Laredo.

I go here every time I visit friends in Phoenix, and I've never had a bad meal here.  At dinner I'm partial to the camaron poblano asada.  The combination of steak, poblano pepper, and shrimp is fantastic, and I've never had meat cooked this perfectly before.  On my last visit for lunch I had the mole enchiladas, and they were excellent-- maybe not the best mole I've ever had, but heaven for this Mexican-food-starved-Seattleite.  They make the guacamole tableside and can make it as spicy as you want, which is nice.  Their chips are good as are both salsas, although I didn't really detect a difference in heat.  The beer selection is good, and I remember liking their margaritas as well.

Service is great (tableside guacamole!) and  the building itself is pretty.  Definitely a fan.
