Visited here for the first time while my mom and sister were visiting from Ohio after having 3 recommendations to try it out! 
Food was delicious and portion sizes were great! Everything was great, and the server even offered to take several photos for us to showcase our experience via Facebook for Ohio friends and family! (Haha) overall great positive vibe with great good and great service!
oh, and OMG!!  the chocolate cake for dessert was impressive!! all 4 of us shared, and we still took some home! 
margaritas were good, as well as all of our other food!!
