Awesome food. They are very authentic Mexican food. I've had their tacos and burritos and they are flavorful and you add what you want to the burrito.even the kitchen sink if they could. The last review about them skimping on the meat. Seriously they don't. On the tacos just have them cook corn tortilla on their skillet for a while otherwise you have a soggy tortilla.ive seen their quesadillas and tortas and I'll be trying those soon. I've asked a few customers in Saturdays and Sundays if they like the menudo they are eating and haven't heard one bad complaint. Seriously this is the new spot. No more driving to phx for authentic Mexican food.
