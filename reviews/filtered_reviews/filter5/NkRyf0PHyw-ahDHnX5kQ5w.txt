First off, when we arrived we elected to sit in the bar area because the game was on.

We waited a little bit for our server, but it wasn't too long before another server noticed us and came right over. Very attentive waitstaff took our drink orders and checked up on us frequently, but wasn't overly clingy. Very good.

Food was excellent. We had the lobster dip, stacked enchiladas with a flavorful shredded beef, and I had "Spooning Rellenos." Everything was delicious and flavorful. 

The cloth napkins were a nice touch and the happy hour looked decent too.
