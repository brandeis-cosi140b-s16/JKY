bean and cheese burrito. oh my god. 

since i first discovered their bean and cheese burrito, i knew i was a fan of this restaurant for life.  i don't know how they get the beans and cheese to be so perfectly combined (they seem like they're whipped together), but it makes for an amazingly delicious burrito.  i come here almost every week because i'm constantly craving them-they're seriously that good. get it with avocado to make it even more tasty! 

ok-now that you know how obsessed i've become with this delicious creation-i can tell you about all the other things i love.  

COCHATA! 

holy crap! as someone who already loves horchata, i nearly lost my mind when i had this combination of horchata and coffee. i can get two of my fixes in a single drink and it tastes amazing.  

i'm also a huge fan of their carne asada burritos, the meat has an incredible flavor and is really tender.  the america's corn is also a favorite of mine; the flavors of the cotija cheese, lime, and chili go perfectly with the corn.

and they have mexican coke! how great is this place?
