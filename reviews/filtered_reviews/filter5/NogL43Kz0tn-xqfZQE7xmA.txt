I love this place. I have a hard time trying new things because the BBQ chicken here is just that good. I usually go w a burrito which is huge and you can make a 2nd meal out of. I also love getting tacos so I can have two different things. BBQ chicken taco and the fish taco are my favorites! Don't skip the salsa bar either.
