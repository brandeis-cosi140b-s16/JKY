Visited Vegas for the weekend and dined at Chayo. Had the most amazing breakfast and our waitress Christina couldn't be any nicer! She was attentive, quick and was so so friendly. Her awesome personality really made our dining experience so special and we can't wait to come back! The white peach margarita was delicious! Had a great experience and couldn't recommend any more!
