Our first time at this brand new restaurant and I am please to say it was a first class experience.

We visited for lunch just a couple of days after opening so expected them to still be working things out but everything went smoothly. As a Brit I had to go with their $6 Fish & Chips. For that price I expected a smaller portion but the two pieces of fish were a decent size and it was more than enough for lunch. The fish was tasty and the batter cooked perfectly. Served with Tartar sauce and lemon, these guys understand how to cook my national dish (they even had malt vinegar for the chips ... bloody marvelous!).

My lunch companion enjoyed two 'delicious' fish tacos and also said it was the right amount for lunch. 

Well priced, friendly service and a very cool look to the restaurant makes SoCal Fish Company a place I will be returning to again.
