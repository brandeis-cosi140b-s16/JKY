Went here with a Groupon a few weeks ago. I'm still thinking about how good the food was!

I'm from the South, and had just assumed Mexican food isn't as good here in the Midwest. 

Was I wrong! Best Mexican food in the area by a landslide, fantastic margaritas (no bottom shelf liquor), and in-house-made tortilla chips. Service was very good--the waiter was incredibly knowledgeable. 

GO!
