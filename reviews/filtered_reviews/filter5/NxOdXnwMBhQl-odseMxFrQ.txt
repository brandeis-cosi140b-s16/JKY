The out-of-town family wanted Mexican, so we took them here. Since I don't eat meat, I'm not a fan of most Mexican restaurants because there is a limited selection for me. Here, the waitress recommended the shrimp and veggie tacos--both were great. And, I could even eat the refried beans (because there was no lard in it)! We all got Cadillac Margaritas and everybody was very pleased with their food. I also appreciated that they were so diligent about the reservation, a party of 8. They gave us a table upstairs that was private and spacious. For someone who doesn't typically consider getting Mexican food, it says a lot that I'm looking forward to going back here in the near future.
