The level of service from this restaurant is excellent. Each time my husband and I dine here we are never let down. The staff, food, and environment is awesome. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food. You are seated right away even on busy nights. I am not certain how they do it. I love the location. The Centennial Hills area is very beautiful.
