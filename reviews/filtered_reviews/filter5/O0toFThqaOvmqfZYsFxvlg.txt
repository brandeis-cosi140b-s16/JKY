I've been to the las palmas in Oakland before, so I knew already that I was going to love this place. I got a ribeye taco with saut√©ed onions, tomatoes, verde sauce and an incredible hot salsa. The way it's set up is you pick your meat and add your toppings separately. The tortilla is amazing and you can tell it's all house made. The tacos are incredibly cheap and soooo good! 

The inside of the little store is adorable- they have a Mexican deli, produce, Mexican snacks and candy and they even have coke and other pop in glass bottles. Adorable. 

This place is awesome and it's a must if you are in the Brookline or Oakland areas !
