Summary: by far and away the best Mexican restaurant in the valley. Expect massive heat in their dishes, cooled off by their equally potent margaritas. 

The staff is attentive, many of which are relatives of or friends of the owners. The atmosphere is not as quaint as the central location but the recipes are spot on. One marg and your feeling good, two your extremities go numb, three and you need a seatbelt to sit up. The food has a home cooked feel, hard to duplicate in mass. Their beef stew is Hearty with large chunks of beef and potatoes. The heat is like pulling your tongue out with pliers and resting a ghost pepper on it. For you heat lovers, you will not be disappointed.   Their desserts are a sweet treat to end things on a high note. They are the $#|?
