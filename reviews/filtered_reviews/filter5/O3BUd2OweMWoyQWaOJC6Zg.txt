I have no idea why a previous reviewer would give this restaurant a 1 star review, saying it is on par with Taco Bell. In my opinion, the 1 star review is undeserved. My husband and I had lunch here today and we had a wonderful experience. The food was excellent and made from fresh ingredients. The waiter was efficient and extremely friendly. The prices are very low -
most lunch entrees are between 6 and 7 dollars. The decor is colorful and fun with local artwork on the walls. I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual lunch or dinner.
