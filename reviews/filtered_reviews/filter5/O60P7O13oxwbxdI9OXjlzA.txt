This place is legit! My friend from Yuma has claimed this is the most authentic Mexican food restaurants in phoenix. Story goes a little something like started as a food truck got popular. And was even featured by Guy Ferri (white hair dude on food network). I always order a variety of street tacos. Sometimes my friends will ask someone at the counter what they're favorite thing on the menu is. They've always been awesome suggestions. They were extremely satisfied (surprising bc neither of them are huge on Mexican food). I live this place and dine here regularly. As a matter a fact I'll prob go down for lunch today. 1$ taco Tuesday!!!
