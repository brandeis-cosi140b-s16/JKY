I am convinced that they put crack in the tacos along with the rest of the food. This place is the Bomb! Its a small Mom-Pop style of operation so the service can be slower depending on the crowd size but it is worth the wait. The price is right plus they give out free chips and guac while you wait. Try the kimchee fried rice with spam and you won't be disappointed. The attention to service is top notch even though the Korean lady is running circles trying to get everything out. Great combination serving Korean-Mex tacos. Who would have thought this pairing is outstanding?

I'll be back, unless I go to treatment...Haaa
