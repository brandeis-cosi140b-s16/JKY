I've been a regular here for a couple years.
Usually show up at night for dancing. Its always random one night its rock, another its hip hop, another its trance/dance. I love the change of beats. 
Dress code is whatever you want. I've gone after a wedding (suit attire) other times I've gone with just jeans and a t shirt. Just as long as your positive than this is a nice place to hang out.

Last Saturday I decided to go early 6pm.
None stop chips with red and green salsa.
Chicken Burrito is stuffed with ingredients.
Flamenco show.

This venue is awesome day or night, drink and food.
