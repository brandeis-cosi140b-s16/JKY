Wow best mexican food in Vegas!! Coming from LA it has been a rough 3  1/2 years trying to find a good mexican spot. Best service I have had ever at a restaurant. Very attentive staff and amazing atmosphere. The view at this location is spectacular. If you are planning on a date night, you can call and make reservation. A great view of the valley. It is worth the drive from mountains edge. They had live music on Friday. Very good place. My husband did good by bringing me here. Real authentic cooks! Love this place!!
P.S. The only bad thing is when you leave, the smokers congregate and smoke right in front of the restaurant entrance. So gross for someone who loathes the smell of cigarettes .
