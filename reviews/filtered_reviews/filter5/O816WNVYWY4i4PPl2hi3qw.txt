Admittedly, I have never been in the actual restaurant - only downstairs.  I don't consider downstairs as part of the restaurant, it's more casual and an atmosphere I prefer.  There is a certain underground flair at this place, it's dark, romantic, cool, and lounge-tastic.

We usually go to take advantage of the small plates.  You can have scallops wrapped in bacon, blue crab tostada bites, brie and steak bites for under $25.  

This is one of my favorite places, the food is always consistent and the staff is absolutely wonderful. Make this a staple in your week, especially after a hard day at work.
