Love love love this place...best tacos I've ever had. I had the bulgogi tacos.The kimchi makes the tacos taste out of this world. We also had the chow fun...yummy. Free chips/Guacamole and bottled water. And it's super super cheap. Can feed a family for 20...can't even do fast food for that price. The staff is nice.. can't wait for them to open another store.
