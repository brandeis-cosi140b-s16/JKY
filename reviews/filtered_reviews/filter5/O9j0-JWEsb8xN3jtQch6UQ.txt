Found this place on Yelp and made a reservation for our weekend in the area attending spring training games. The drive was a little longer than we anticipated and it seemed as if we going out to the middle of nowhere... but then we made it to the el Pedregal center, and found the restaurant. This is a pretty business center in the foothills near The Boulders. While the center was not busy for a weekend night, The Spotted Donkey Cantina was abuzz.

We were a few minutes early for our reserved time, but they promptly seated us at a great corner table on the patio. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and seemed committed to making our experience a good one. As the sun set and the temp grew cooler, our request for the heater to be lit was promptly fulfilled. It kept us cozy while we enjoyed the lovely desert evening.

Our server made a few recommendations. It is the first time we've eaten at a Mexican restaurant where chips and salsa are not included in the dining experience, but we ordered them as an appetizer and they did not disappoint. Fresh, crispy chips were accompanied by a trio of delightful salsas. The dark, roasted tomato salsa was especially yummy and had a surprising after burn.

I ordered an unusual entree (for a Mexican food restaurant) that was spicy meatloaf with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. This was one of the server's recommendations and it was a good one. I really enjoyed the spicy jalape√±o flavor of the meatloaf. My hubby ordered more traditional fare of chicken enchiladas. One enchilada had red sauce, the other one had green sauce. He was very happy with his selection and ate every bite.

This place is not cheap, and it is a bit more than "casual" but it made for a lovely date night that was truly enjoyable in every respect.
