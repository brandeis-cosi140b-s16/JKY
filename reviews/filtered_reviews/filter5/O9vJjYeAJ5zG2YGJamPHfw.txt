Finally a place that serves legitimate Russian Cuisine in Las Vegas.  The Food was delicious. The ambiance of the place was awesome  The price was right.  The  service was spectacular.   The owner (Alex)  went out of his way to make you feel special.  I can see coming back to this place over and over again.   Definitely a must try it out place.
