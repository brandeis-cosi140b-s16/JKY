My new favorite place!!!! Tacos were amazing with just onions and cilantro even! Huge portion of chips and salsa (pico). Staff very friendly!!! So happy my friend recommended this place! I had been looking for a good taco place. Robertos, etc were not cutting it... The flavor of the carne asada alone is great and they give you a huge portion of steak!!! Happy happy happy!!! Now if we could get a los tacos on the south west side it would be heaven!!! :)
