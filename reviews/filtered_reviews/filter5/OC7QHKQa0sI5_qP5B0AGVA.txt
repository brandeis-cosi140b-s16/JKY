Ya'll know I'm going to plant a solid 5 STARs for the gourmet-all-you-can-eat SALSAs in this wonderful establishment! 

Incredibly pleasing choices ranging from mild n' smokey to furious, flame-grilled. Warm chips are served and the menu is brimming with delectable, hot choices including burros, quesas, and super-tasty fillers. 

Firstly, the pecan-fruit filled horchata is like a cold, lingering dessert. And it's huge, perhaps +32ounces of deliciousness. Spoon, please!

The Mole Chicken burrito was on the *sweeter* side and although super complex and dark choco-infused, it called for 3xpinch more spice to counter the sucrose.

The beans and rice are fair to fairly good, but nothing special. I've had great refried beans in my life and La Santisima could improve on this. I'll admit. 

The melted queso dip pleased the eye but must be consumed ASAP, prior to cooling down. Order prior to entree.

The la House burro was very savory, filled with shredded, grilled chicken and finely chopped fixings.

Service was genuine and sweet. Hoping to have a party their soon! 

A clean, cozy, artful gourmet taco shop is what you can expect from La Santisima.
