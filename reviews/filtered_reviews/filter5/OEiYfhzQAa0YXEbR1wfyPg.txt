Great selection of beer and tacos.  I was surprised to get 2 different Hefeweizen beers on tap- plus Weihenstephaner in bottles too.  Al Pastor taco was great.  Salsa must be made daily.  Yesterday it was a bit more smoky.  Love the atmosphere and art- especially above the bar and the eagle-mirror.  Great service too!
