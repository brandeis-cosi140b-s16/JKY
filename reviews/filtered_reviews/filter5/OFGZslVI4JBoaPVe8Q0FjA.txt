Great tacos!  I wasn't expecting it to be so nice.  I also thought that the fajitas were really tasty!  Something about that sizzle.  The manager was super knowledgable too, and suggested a mango margarita for my wife which she thought had the perfect balance of taste and tequila. Pro ballers that live in the area have also been known to drop by on occasion too, so good people watching at night.  If you haven't tried it yet, it's worth the trip.
