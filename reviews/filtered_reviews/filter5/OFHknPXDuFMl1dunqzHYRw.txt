Everytime we go to Viva, food has been excellent. But the wait staff and the manager really make it a great dining experience.  They are really on the ball. The live music is a plus. Tortillas are handmade and the guacamole is made at your table to your tastes. Soup is great and the salsa and bean dip are sssooo good. Everything we have ordered have been great. From the tacos, steaks, and fried fish. Parking is limited so go early.
