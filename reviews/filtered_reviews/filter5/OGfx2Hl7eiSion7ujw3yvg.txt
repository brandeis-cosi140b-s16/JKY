The only semblance of a complaint I can muster is that the restaurant is SO small, it can fill up in minutes, and you'll find yourself scooting sideways between chairs to get to that delicious damn salsa bar. It's so good, I'm not even minus-ing a star for the crowdedness. Honestly it adds to the charm and intimate atmosphere of the place. The food is out of this world. Phoenix's absolute best Mexican food, as far as I'm concerned.
