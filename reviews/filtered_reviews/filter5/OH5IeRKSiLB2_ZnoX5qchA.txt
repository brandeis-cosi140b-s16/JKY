Whenever I am on the west side, want Mexican and want to splurge, this is the place to go! Food is definitely the best around. I've been searching for a place like this since I moved to Phoenix.  Some people may dislike the decor and blah blah, I think it gives it a distinguished feel. 

Our waitress that served our group of six was on top of her game and all her other tables. She re-filled the chips and salsa a whopping three times. I kept eating them, chip after chip, saying to myself, "these chips are so light and the salsa is so fresh"!

Lunch menu gives healthy portions at a great price. I had the chicken fajitas and had enough food to last a week. I am definitely going to come back to enjoy more of the variety off the menu. Of course I over ate :)

La Pi√±ata. One word, Yum.
