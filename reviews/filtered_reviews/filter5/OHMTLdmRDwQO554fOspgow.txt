Went to eat here based on a friends recommendation.   Purchased a groupon and met everyone down there.   Ended up getting served by the owner who honored our groupon even though it was Saturday and the groupon clearly stated Monday through Thursday.  Enjoyed the meal and service.  Portions were big and salsas and guacamole were great.  Owner operated business with owners who care.  Definitely worth trying out.
