I have only been here for brunch, but can't wait to try lunch or dinner on for size!  We were the first table in on Sunday and were greeted right away by our server and felt at home with its cozy interior.  It's a small place but has lots of character with the heavy solid wood and wrought iron furniture.  Love the Dia de Los Muertos art and heavy wood bar with cowhide bar stools and authentic Mexican glassware.

We sampled quite a few of the salsas at the salsa bar and there is a little something for everyone including those that can't take a lot of spice.  This is a big plus for us since our family has spice tolerances from 1 to 10+.

What was on our menu? we tried the divorced eggs (which I added avacado), black mole chilaquiles with chicken, and an egg scramble with side of bacon; all of which were served with black beans.... Delicious and full of flavor! I'll have to post the brunch menu next time since it is not currently on their website.

Each of us would order the same thing again, but so want to try the other items of delicousness on their menu.

I guess we will have to make La Condesa a staple on our restaurant list!
