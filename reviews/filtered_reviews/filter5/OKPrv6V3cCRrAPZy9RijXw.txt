The place is super small. I tried to do take outs everytime I visit. The food is ready literally less than 10 mins after you order. Try their pastor (taco, burrito, etc) it's soo good!! They also have this thing called ghost pepper which is really really spicy and you have to ask for it. My friend bet me $50 to eat it, and I did! It was not spicy - it was painful! Do not attempt!
