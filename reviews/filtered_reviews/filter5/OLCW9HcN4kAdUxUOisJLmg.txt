My wife and I were visiting Vegas over the weekend and some friends took us to Cafe Rio for lunch on Monday.  Walking in I thought it was sort of Chipotle-esq and  was wondering why it was so packed.  Now I know!  

I had the sweet pork barbacoa burrito "enchilada style".   I am still daydreaming about it days later.  I wouldn't shed a tear if all the Chipotles and Qdobas here where I live, in Colorado Springs, closed down and were replaced by Cafe Rio.

That burrito was unbelieveable.  Perfectly savory, seasoned, spicy, sweet, and moist pork.  The rice and beans, and the green chili sauce on top weren't a distraction from the barbacoa but were just right.  

Damn.  Why am I writing this review?  I'm just making myself hungry thinking about Cafe Rio.
