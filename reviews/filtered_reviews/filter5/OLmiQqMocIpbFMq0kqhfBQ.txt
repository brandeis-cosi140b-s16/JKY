Boom! This place is quite the discovery. So I had it bookmarked for awhile and I am really glad I finally got to try it. We arrived right before the lunch rush and when I say rush the place was packed when we left. No real motif to the place, more just like a local bar/restaurant with simple tables and no hostess. I love these types of places! We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away. 

So the food is a mix of Mexican and Korean, two foods I really do enjoy so I was excited. We tried the dak bulgogi tacos with lettuce, the bulgogi bowl with fried eggs, spam masubi and the pork belly masubi with a fried egg. All of it.....amazing! 

The masubis were a large portion and a definite reason to go back. Definitely recommend this delicious spot!
