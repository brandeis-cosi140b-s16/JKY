I love this place! I've yet to go wrong with anything I've ordered and after today's meal, I had to get on Yelp to say "GET THE EMPANADA". It was unbelievable. With a perfect dipping sauce on the side. My bean, cheese and spinach pupusa with cabbage on top was also delicious! 

On previous visits, I've ordered tacos and arepas - also fantastic. And I enjoy their guac with chips.

The prices, the food, the fitting atmosphere...all make for a great experience every time.
