The Al Pastor were like none I've had before. PHENOMENAL DELICIOUS PERIOD. I've been looking for this style of Taco in LA and no luck, go figure. The service was great cause the Paisas making the Tacos were down to earth and I understand the Lingo ;-) I also enjoyed the Chiles asados and cebollitas. Nothing beats these Tacos Estillo Tijuana!!!
