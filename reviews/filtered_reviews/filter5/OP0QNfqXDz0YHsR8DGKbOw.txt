This place is hands down dripping in awesomeness. The layout is hot as well as the waitresses. The guacamole was the best I've ever had and the menu names using lines from classic comedies was excellent. References to "Trading Places" and "Fletch" were epic. The tacos, sheer amazing. Get beer, tequila, and tacos with your Bill F**king Murray shirt and life is awesome.
