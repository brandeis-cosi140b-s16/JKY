Oh my good god this place is amazing. Thank GOD we had a reservation because the place was freaking packed (Friday, dinner). 

The service was on point - our server even took the time to write all the specials (and their descriptions, and there are a LOT) down on a piece of paper because we were sitting right in front of them and thus couldn't really see. We didn't ask him to do that - he just took it up on himself. Totally unnecessary, but it's that extra mile, folks. 

I got the Rokerij Benedict - all I can say is holy orgasm in my mouth. Forreals. Basically it's two little beef tenderloins on two english muffin halves, topped with CRAB and jalepe√±o hollandaise.

Probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. 

Their green chile potato is their signature item and I found it rather unremarkable for something that they promote so heavily. But it was fine. 

Drinks were strong, atmosphere cozy, staff amazing. Loves.
