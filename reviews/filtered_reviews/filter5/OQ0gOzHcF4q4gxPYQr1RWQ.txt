Hands Down the best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona. You know the food is legit when you have to order in Spanish. The combination plates are a nice selection for indecisive eaters. I had a Torta al pastor with a taco de asada. The meat was deliciously seasoned and juicy, no where near dry. They also have a salsa bar with 3 types of salsa, as well as fried jalapenos and pickled items. Can't wait to return, I may have just found my new regular spot.
