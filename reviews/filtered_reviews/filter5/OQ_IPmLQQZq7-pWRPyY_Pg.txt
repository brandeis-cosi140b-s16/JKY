The name "Dick's Hideaway" is an understatement! This is as hidden as a restaurant can get. Hole in the wall? Yes! 

I was Yelping around on Saturday morning looking for somewhere to eat in AZ that wasn't a chain. Challenging task, I know. I needed something that reminded me of home. Something with character and culture. This is when my prayers were answered and I stumbled upon rave reviews of this adequately named establishment. Chile Adovada on their brunch menu? Surely I wasn't in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn't resemble a Denny's or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don't like spicy flavors! If you like heat as much I do though, you will love it! 
I will definitely be back at Dick's again soon! 
Ciao!
