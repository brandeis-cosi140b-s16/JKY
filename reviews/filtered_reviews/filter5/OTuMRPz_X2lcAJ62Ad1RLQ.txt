Authentic great tasting food combined with amazing service makes this place worth a visit! I had the combination platter which included a crispy chicken taco, Green chille pork burrito, and a beef enchilada (including rice and beans). Every bite was savored and have absolutely no complaints about this place. My co-worker drank about 6 horchatas being that as soon as she was done with one, the server would immediately grab another (Now that's service)!
