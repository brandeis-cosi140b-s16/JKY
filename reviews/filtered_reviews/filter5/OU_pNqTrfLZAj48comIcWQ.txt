This place has excellent food! The homemade tortillas that are used for the soft tacos are to die for! Try the fresh fish tacos they are phenomenal. The nacho plates are huge, make sure you share with someone. The sliders are the best sliders I have ever had! The burgers taste like freshly homemade hamburgers like you would grill at home. The specialty margaritas are excellent, try the white peach if you like sweet drinks. They also did show us the scorpions that they will put in a shot of tequila if you want to try that....
