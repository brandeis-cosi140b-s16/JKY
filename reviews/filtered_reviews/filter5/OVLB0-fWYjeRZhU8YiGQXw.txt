This place is absolutely incredible. I've had Mexican food here in AZ, California, Chicago, Mexico and this place is the best. For the value you get an incredible meal that can feed the whole family. The torta must be 2-3lbs at least. It's huge! And under $8. WOW.

If you like authentic Mexican food from Mexico City and don't want to spend too much money this place is it.
