BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH!!  I love this place.  I work in Oakland and have visited this place on several occasions for lunch.  Just wish they had a seating area, because in Winter if I walk down there my tacos would be cold by the time I get back to my office and parking down there can be difficult.  But it is just a cart on the street in front of a Mexican mini market so I can't complain.  The workers don't always speak much English but you can just point to what meat you want and all the meats are so delicious.  They have varieties of ground beef, ribeye, two kinds of pork, and chicken, and a fajita mix.  One of the best features is their salsa bar which has many delicious salsas and fresh lime and cilantro that you can try all of if you would like.  It's extremely cheap but I think it is cash only.  Definitely a great deal.  I haven't seen any veggie or fish options, so this seems to be a place for meat lovers, and the meat portions are generous.
