te encontre! 
I've been reading yelp reviews of this for a good two weeks and was dying to go here.

After a long day of not eating, I forced myself to go here. It's completely out of my way but boy was it worth it.

I ordered two things:
Carne asada tacos combo plate and a Tinga quesadilla.

The fact that they have tinga makes me very happy. It wasn't as "tingaish" as I would have liked it, but then again, no one has ever made me tinga like my Tia guty. 

The bad:
- teeny tiny parking. I came here at 4pm on a friday and was the only person there for a good ten minutes. I can't imagine finding a parking spot when there are more people around.

- The tortillas weren't great. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special. A taco should have a good tortilla in case the meat sucks (not that it sucked here).
- The rice and beans portion is small. WAY small. I get that a restaurant needs to make some profit, but these are tiny. 

The good-

- The quesadilla is huge. By huge, I mean I ate half of it and had to save some for later because of how filling the doughy tortilla is. This is not your average quesadilla. Not only do they use the right cheese (not your Americanized mozzarella and monterey jack or even, god forbid, chihuahua cheese), but the tortilla is flaky AND flavorful. That's a quality tortilla. This tortilla is nothing like the one used for the tacos, you can tell they make these themselves.

-The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat. 

- La horchata. Now this is what horchata should taste like. Other restaurants take note because people may come here solely for this. The fruit is a cute side trick, but the horchata really is good.

I give it five stars because it reeks of unpretentiousness and we all know how much I loathe pretentiousness. The artwork is simple but quirkily Mexican, there is nothing fancy about the decor (which I like) and the cook looks like my Tio Memo (except he can cook whereas my Tio cannot). 

Overall, I hope they don't change a damn thing here. Let it become as popular as they can but please, please, don't change what you have! Finally, some authentic (and I hate using that word) tacos in Phoenix.
