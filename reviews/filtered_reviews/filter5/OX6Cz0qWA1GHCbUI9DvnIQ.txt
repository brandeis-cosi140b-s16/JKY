Me and some friends wanted to secure a place for our burrito fix during our stay at Vegas and Yelp led us here.  We each ordered a carne asada burrito and of course with guacamole cause guac is so yummy!  This is definitely an authentic Mexican food joint, but it had a Chipotle feel because they built each of our burritos step by step in front of us, which was a nice touch.  The staff is very friendly here and I didn't get that sketchy vibe that some good Mexican food places give off.  Definitely coming back here during my next Vegas trip.
