This is a great place to eat at it is authentic Mexican food and done right came here yesterday in the evening with a friend of mine and her two kids she's been here before but this was my first time being here and I have to say that I like this place they have a station that you can stand at depending on what you want you tell the cook that's making it he makes it in front of you and your orders ready to go and you can go to the salsa area and choose what kind of toppings you want the people here are friendly it's very clean not sure about the bathrooms because I didn't go into the men's bathroom but judging by how they keep the restaurant clean I'm pretty sure it's the same overall I plan to make the trip here again the only negative about this place is it is pretty pricy especially when your coming with 4 people but that's my only gripe 5 stars for me.
