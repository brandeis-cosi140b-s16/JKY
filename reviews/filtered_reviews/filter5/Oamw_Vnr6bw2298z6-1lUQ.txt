Love the taco creations and the décor! Taco Guild is housed in an old church. Complete sense of repurpose! The Stained glass windows (They appear to be original) give an ambiance that is unlike anywhere else in the valley.

The Food:
Guacamole: The choices! I added jalapeño bacon to mine- it was delicious! 

Tacos: My favorite is the Lamb (served with blue cheese which is a nice compliment). The Yucatan Shrimp, Red Snapper and Urban Beans Braised Beef were also favorites.

Drink: Friends who had the margarita's were huge fans.
