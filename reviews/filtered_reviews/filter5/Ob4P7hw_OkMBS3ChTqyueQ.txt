This restaurant is amazing!!!  The food is INCREDIBLY delicious and reasonably priced.  I had the enchiladas - the order came with three enchiladas, one cheese, one chicken and one shrimp.  Seriously, seriously yummy!!  The service was great and the ambiance is among the best in the Valley - it's cozy, quaint and so relaxing.  This restaurant has been in Ahwatukee for a year.  I had driven past a number of times, but a friend finally suggested we try it. What an amazing restaurant.
