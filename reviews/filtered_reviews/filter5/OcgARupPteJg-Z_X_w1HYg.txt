This review is for the bar, and for those who don't mind sitting at the bar.

The service is amazing! Cesar, Ricardo, Pepe, Javier....thank you for being personable, respectful, passionate, professional and fun. The drinks and food are always PERFECT.

These guys "flipped me" from RuM to TeQuiLa Mojito's. I recommend the Corzo Reposado Mojito. It offers a cool, oak taste that can be modified with different tequila's. If they have raspberries, try a rum raspberry Mojito. Or better yet, try a blueberry Mojito. If you ask them to recommend a drink, they get excited. I tried several different "Specialty Drinks." All were great....and the beer is cold.

Diego isn't typical Mexican food.  I was thrown off and surprised the first time I ate here. I ordered the taco's. Really good, but I had menu remorse. Don't get me wrong, the taco's are very good, but when the food is this good, I like to aim high. The result was visiting many times, trying many apps and entree's, and looking forward to more.

In addition, my 2 restaurant experiences were great, but I won't go into that....this review, as stated, is about my overall bar experience. One of the benefits of sitting at the bar is that everyone visits. The restaurant servers, hosts and managers...all very nice and professional. It's like family without the family discount.
