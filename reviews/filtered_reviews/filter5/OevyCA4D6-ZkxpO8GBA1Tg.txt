I went in with some friends this past Saturday and we had a blast! We were sitting at the outside bar. It was one heck of a party! Then it started storming and dumping rain and the party still did not stop! The bartenders were still making drinks even though the TVs and computers went down. So they had to only take cash. They all worked really hard and no one left because it was so much fun! I want to come back on a night when it's not raining but I'm sure it will be just as fun!
