This place is a total hole in the wall, but it is hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different places. I love the fish taco combo plate the best, but the fish burrito is also great. Other awesome choices are the rolled tacos, pastor tacos, cheese enchiladas and steak quesadilla. Everything is wonderful!
