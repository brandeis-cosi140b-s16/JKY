This place is tho!!! GREAT tacos. Fajitas are the best! Margaritas..yummmm. The green salsa is my absolute favorite (tomatillo). I have been coming here for 5+ years now. The food has NEVER let me down. One of the owners is usually on site and you can tell they care about their product. I have recommended this place to numerous out of town friends, and they have always enjoyed the experience. 

They have an upstairs area that you can rent out for special events. The atmosphere is perfect for larger parties and fun occasions like graduation parties, work events, wedding showers, etc.  We have rented the space and utilized their catering menu a few times and they have always been very helpful with each event. Very accommodating! Warm staff! You will not be disappointed.
