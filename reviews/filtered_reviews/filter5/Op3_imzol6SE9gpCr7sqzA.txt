We were visiting Las Vegas for the long Labor Day weekend and had a taste for Mexican food and turned to yelp for help and this place turned up first and after reading a few of the reviews decided to give it a try. The reviews didn't lie it's good food and good service! The beef fajitas are good and do not disappoint! Even the chips and salsa were good!  The sopa de Fideo they give with each meal has a lot of flavor.

Give it a try and you will want to go back again!
