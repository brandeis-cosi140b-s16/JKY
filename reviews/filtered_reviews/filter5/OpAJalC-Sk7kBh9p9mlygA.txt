Great service, lovely art, amazing food 
I always have to get a shrimp ceviche it's the best ceviche I've ever had and I Live in LA so I've had plenty different varieties of ceviche. I love Javier's because it is fresh , very citrusy, and more meat than liquid. 

Another plus is that their drinks are strong, good strong like I can have one drink and not need a second one where usually I do get 2 at other restaurants. So even though the margarita are 14-16$ it's worth it when you get your money's worth of liquor. These margaritas aren't shy. Neither am I but I've never sent a drink back here. Really happy about that.

If I had to list a con about this place I would say just beware it's pretty dim so those with poor eye sight may need the assistance of a cell phone flash light or something equivalent to see the menu clearly. Otherwise, enjoy!
