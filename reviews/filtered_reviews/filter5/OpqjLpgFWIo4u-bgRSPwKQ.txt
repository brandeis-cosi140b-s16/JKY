Real NM food. We have searched for good New Mexican food since moving here in Aug 2012 from NM. This place is great, red and green are both good! Love the real coca colas from Mexico , too. They sell frozen Bueno chile and frozen hominy. We love the red Navajo taco with carne adovada, the enchiladas (red carne and green chicken ) , and the stuffed red sopapillas with carne adovada . Finally a place that cooks they way we like it!!! Our daughter goes to school in AZ , and she was so happy to get real New Mexican food, cannot find this in AZ!
