How lucky am I? After returning to Las Vegas from golfing at Wolf Creek I happened to stop for gas at a seven eleven and asked the lady behind the counter if she could recommend a good Mexican restaurant. Of course she directed me a mile up the road to Zapatas. There were no large tables available so they sat me across from the bar at a little two seater table. The chips salsa and beans practically followed me to the table....amazingly quick service. The wait staff offered service with a smile and the food was delectable! The offerings are so vast I had trouble deciding between a burrito or the pollo a cognac. The waiter steered me towards the chicken dish and I wasn't disappointed. The creamy sauce was out of this world and the chicken was tender and sauteed with onions and mushrooms. I was pleased to stumble upon this local gem and you better believe I will go out of my way to return on my next trip to sin city!
