Everyone I know around here eats at Roberto's, they deliver and it is prob the best Mexican fast food in the near vicinity other than my Mom's cooking of course! Now I dont eat meat so when they can accommodate me with w/e the effffff I want and however picky my high maintenance self can get, well they get kudos in my book! They make a mean Chile Relleno Burro you can put w/e you want in it crema, pico, rice, beans they will customize it for you no prob. This is my fav relleno place on this side of town period! Dont forget the Horchata!
