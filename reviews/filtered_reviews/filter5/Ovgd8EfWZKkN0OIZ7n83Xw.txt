WOW! this was delicious!  

The salsas are pretty tasty. Mild, green, fire roasted (which I found myself eating continuously), hot and of course pico de gallo. As we were walking to the car my son said "I'm glad we went here.  It was good.  You know what I liked best?  The salsa!"

My kid loved his cheese quesadilla.  It was LARGE. I had a bite and I'm thinking they butter the cooking surface as it reminded me of a grilled cheese sandwich.  He got some beef on the side but hardly put a dent in it.

I had a beef taco and chili relleno combo and they were both great!  The taco had one of the tastiest shells I've ever had, but the relleno was the highlight of the night for me.  Appearance and texture were not impressive, but the sauce they put over it... WOW!  Saute'd peppers and tomatoes - not the usual red sauce for sure.

Other things to note - They guys working were exceptional.  They came out and checked on us a couple times.  You could tell it was important to them that we loved the food.  
I was initially disappointed with the $19 I spent on a meal and a quesadilla, but we added meat to the quesadilla and got two drinks - and the food was tasty enough to make the price appropriate.  

We will be back soon!
