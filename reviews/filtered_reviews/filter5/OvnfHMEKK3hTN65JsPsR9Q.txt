I've heard nothing but good things about Tacos Atoyac and I convinced my father to join me on my taco adventure this evening. You can barely see the restaurant's sign at night so you really have to pay attention where you're going. I expected the restaurant to be small but I was really impressed with how clean it was in there. A restaurant can never be too clean! I scanned the menu and decided to try out a few tacos. 

I ordered one fish taco, one carne asada taco, one al pastor taco, a side of rice and beans, and a fish taco for dad. I almost didn't order the al pastor taco but the big guy at the register told me he eats one al pastor burrito everyday. I didn't know If I was gonna like it so I just got the taco. 

You gotta try the al pastor burrito. I say burrito because one taco just won't do it. After you eat one taco you'll want like ten more so just do yourself a favor and order the burrito with extra green sauce. I should have listened to the big guy. 

The two fish tacos were served in one dish and even though I ordered one for me and one for my dad I never got the pleasure of trying that delicious taco treat because my dad ate them both! He knew one was for me but just devoured them one after another. I forgive him. If that happened to me I'd probably do the same thing. 

The rice wasn't mind blowing but the beans were pretty tasty and all the salsas I tried were great. 

Tacos Atoyac does not mess around when it comes to the taste and quality of their food. I can say with no hesitation that this is the BEST Mexican food I have ever had. Get your booty here and see what all the fuss is about!
