First time at this place, it was hard to come check it out with Costa Vida so close and so good. But from now on, when we have the money, this is the new place to go!

The food was very delicious (I had the carnitas tacos), the complimentary chips and salsa were also great, and the chips didn't seem gross and greasy like most other complimentary chips (think Chili's). Tried two margaritas, they were very strong and worth the happy hour price. Our server Lyndsey was very nice and she wasn't at all annoyed that we were the only people to be sitting outside in the heat, making her come outside to check on us every time. 

Only down side is the menu seemed kinda pricey unless you're here for happy hour. But the food is high enough quality to be worth the high price!
