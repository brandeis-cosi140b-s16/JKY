One word: Raspados.

Oh. My. God.

Seriously, I didn't even know this place existed and now I'm already craving it again. This is simple food done absolutely right. Not loaded with extra ingredients, but each bite is bright, fresh and bursting with flavor. The guacamole was creamy but chunky and perfectly salted. The tacos were amazing... but what really made the meal was dessert- Raspados. Shave ice flavored with your choice of fruits (I had strawberry with pineapple) and then topped with a scoop of ice cream. I'm salivating as I type this. 

What made it even better was the cook, who is the owner's mother, came out and visited with us for a few minutes. She was the nicest lady, and boy does she cook like a mofo.

Eat here for dinner tonight. You wont regret it.
