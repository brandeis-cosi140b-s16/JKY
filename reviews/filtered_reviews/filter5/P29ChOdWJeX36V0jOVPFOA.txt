Who am I fooling, I love this place.  7th Ave location is perfect for take-out on my dinner break at work, and the 7th St location is just right for walking to from my apartment.

When you go there, order:
-Chips and Salsa (spicy, or course) - delicious, and don't be shy about asking for some free refills
-Carne Asada Vampiro
-Pastor Vampiro

Nothing more, nothing less.   This is one of my absolute favorite meals in Phoenix any day of the week.  It also makes for a great hangover cure!

I have been disappointed by the size of the regular burritos, but the Vampiros really are over-the-top good.
