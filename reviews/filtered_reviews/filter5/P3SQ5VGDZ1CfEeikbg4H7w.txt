We asked a friend to pick a local-owned place for lunch.   Holy Cow!  Padre's exceeded all expectations.  We arrived earlier than our friend, and it being our first time, I was surprised that 3 people greeted us as if we were regulars.  Everyone was so friendly and ready to assist us.  Needing more information, our server very happily helped us with deciding what to have.  When our friend arrived, they already knew his favorite drink and offered it almost as soon as he sat down.      The "Cuban style Pulled Pork" torta was Fantastic!  Because we had the chips and salsa, half of the sandwich and sweet potato fries came home with us.  Later, it made a thoroughly delicious dinner too!  We look forward to going back, it was such a great experience.
