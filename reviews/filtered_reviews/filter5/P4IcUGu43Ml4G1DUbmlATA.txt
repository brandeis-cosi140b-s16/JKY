If you're looking for real Mexican food, you need to come here! Very family oriented. Very clean. My family and I LOVE this restaurant. Most of the workers know us by now! LOL It's family owned and the owner always walks around to make sure everyone is doing okay. The food is amazing. The service is awesome! They're always super fast to bring out our food. I'm sad because we are moving in about a month - our house now is right next to this place and our new home is farther away. You better believe though we will be driving the extra miles though just to come and eat here. My favorite restaurant!
