Had "The Shack" breakfast burrito. Probably the best one I've had in a while. Usually I can't finish the entire thing but it was so darn good I couldn't stop.

The Shack, with a Mtn Dew at 830 in the morning is a good start to a Saturday!

Location is really awesome as well, it truly is a shack. Cool decor and makes you feel like your somewhere else!
