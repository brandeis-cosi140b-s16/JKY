We had dinner at SOL two of our seven nights in Scottsdale. Love the food and the Blackberry/Ginger Margaritas!! Some of the must haves on the menu: Peel and Eat Shrimp, Beet and Watermelon Salad and Kobe Beef Strip Steak!

Luckily we are returning home to Orange County so I have SOL Newport Beach and Solita in Huntington Beach - yummo.
