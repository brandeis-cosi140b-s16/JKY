Love this place!  The food is delish and the price is amazing!  It can get busy during lunch and dinner times.  Menu is bigger, now they have  burritos!  One of my favorite things is all the stuff they let you get for free on the side.  Cream guacamole, salsa, grilled onions and more. Make sure you check in before. Today they have a special for free salsa!  I will have to save it for next time.
