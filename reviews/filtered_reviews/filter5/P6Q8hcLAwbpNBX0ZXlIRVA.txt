Parking is an issue if arriving after 5 pm on a week nite.  That image fadded quickly.  The quaint authentic decor is highlighted by the hand painted mural of the owners home kitchen. The story was facinating.  The wait staff were prompt and accurate with our drinks, apetizers and entrees.  They knew when to be there and when to let us enjoy our meal.  I cant wait to share this wonderful eatery with my foody friends.
