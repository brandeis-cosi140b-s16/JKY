This place was amazing!  Like everyone one else, we would drive by and it looks scary on the outside.  We read a few Yelp reviews just to see what it was a bout and decided to try it.  I am so glad we did!  
You are greeted by the nicest person taking your order.  They are very helpful for first timers.  You can see everyone in the back making things from scratch in small batches.  We got a Connis Burrito, chips and salsa, a ground beef taco (My new favorite!) and a chicken taco.  The food was amazing and we had to order more salsa as we ate it all.  
The service was great and they remembered our name.  They ran out of some things and someone came out and apologized to everyone and told them their food would be out shortly.  No one seemed to care as everything was being made fresh.  
It's really clean on the inside and the food is made with love!
