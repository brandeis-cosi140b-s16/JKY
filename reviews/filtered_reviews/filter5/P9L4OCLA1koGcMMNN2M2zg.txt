Korean, Mexican FUSION? HAD to give it a try and holy mole the value of this place and the amount of food AND flavor wonderful :)  If your one of those people who wants a 'fancy' place to enjoy great food, move on and leave this hidden gem to the rest of us.  
While asking a question about the contents of a dish it was apparent that at least one of us had some knowledge of korean food and then we were offered kimchi as well.  We will def be back, HUGE portions we both ordered the bulgolgi and we most definitely could have shared.
