After reading several reviews on Yelp, we had to try this place. Any restaurant that has a Dutch name yet is classified as a Mexican restaurant definitely piques one's fancy.
Having found a space to park in the rather small parking lot, our group headed toward the entrance. Arriving there we had a choice, straight ahead or down the stairs into the bowels of the earth. An easy decision as the stairs reminded me of an English castle I once visited.
At the bottom of the stairs, the view we were offered was delightfully reminiscent of an old English pub (I'm not getting a Dutch vibe yet!). As there were no tables that did not have reserved signs on them, we decided to sit at the bar (great decision) and managed to find four seats at the end (or beginning if you have just entered the restaurant). We ordered a bottle of wine, because it was happy hour (half price), and perused the menu. As we couldn't decide which wine to order, the bar person, Nicole, gave us a couple of samples so it was much easier to decide.
Everything looked tasty and what we ordered was delightful. Of the three dishes we ordered, the pecan grilled trout was the winner although nobody complained about anything, as all the plates were empty before we left and we were all stuffed. A close second were the carne adovada and the parppardelle with duck. (Nothing came third as two people ordered the carne adovada). The cauliflower and brussel sprouts were melt-in-your-mouth yummy.
As we were eating, the restaurant filled up so I would recommend reservations as the eating area is not very large.
Overall, this was a great meal and this place ranks highly on my places where I need to eat again (and again).
As we left, I considered whether this was really a Dutch restaurant and I have to conclude that it is because the Dutch really know how to make food taste great.
