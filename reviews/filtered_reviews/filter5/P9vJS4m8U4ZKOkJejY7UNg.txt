Azteca is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  If you go there you'll see why, tons of charm and the food is amazing!!

Great atmosphere at lunch or dinner time!  They have a tons of cheap lunch specials and you get a ton of food.  Plus, all you can eat chips, salsa and Mexican slaw...Yum!!

One of my favorite dishes they serve is the Carnitas Des Reyes (I think that's how it's spelled!)!  Sliced beef strips in a tomato-ey sauce with green peppers and onions.  Served with your choice of flour or corn tortillas, rice, beans and guacamole.  The beef is so tender and has a ton of flavor.  If you've never tried it before, please do!  If you like fajitas, you would like that dish!

I've also had their fajitas and they are the best around!  I don't think I've had a bad meal there.  

Service is always great and fast, especially at lunch time.

Oh, and at the end of your meal you get these wedges of tortillas dusted with sugar and drizzled with honey and strawberry sauce, topped with whipped cream!  One of my favorite desserts ever and you get it with your meal!  Yum!!

Don't let the fact that it's attached to a Days Inn make you not want to go in.  Just keep your focus on the food and atmosphere and you'll forget that the hotel is even there!!
