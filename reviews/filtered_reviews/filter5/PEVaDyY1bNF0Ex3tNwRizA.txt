This place has the best authentic Mexican tacos  in Vegas. period. You have to stand in line for each type of taco you would like to order and that can take a while to get your tacos, but this place is completely worth the wait. I frequent this place almost every week. If you want the true experience of Mexican cuisine make sure you get everything on your tacos. They will ask you if you want everything on it. My personal favorites here are Adobada (spicy pork) and carnitas. The adobada isn't too spicy and has wonderful salsa and creamy guac on them. Don't go anywhere else if you are looking for the best authentic Mexican food in town!
