I have been going here for over 20 years and it never disappoints. I always get a bean burro enchilada style and a taco. I think eating it out of a tin pan adds to the experience. They have the best beans and best red enchilada sauce I have ever tasted hands down. I live in southeast gilbert and make the trek at least once a month. Worth every mile driven. I wish they'd open one on the east side.
