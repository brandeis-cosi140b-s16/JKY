Great food and awesome experience! Came here  while staying at the Hilton across the street. Caught happy hour on Friday night and had a great drink (the lemongrass) and guacamole. Stuck around for dinner and had the Pad Thai and enjoyed it a lot! Fun, lively environment - especially for a Monday night.

Enjoyed our first nights experience that we came back with a large group the next day for dinner. The bartender recognized us and hooked us up with drinks. I ordered the ramen. Pork belly was perfect and serving was generous. 

I recommend to anyone staying at the Hilton in town for business. Way better than hotel food!
