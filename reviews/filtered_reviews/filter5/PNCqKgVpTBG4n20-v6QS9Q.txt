I don't know why other places in town even put fish tacos on their menus. Cabo Fish Taco can not be beat! I've been a fan for years and there is no better meal than chips and freshly prepared salsa before an order of their signature fish tacos (nix the cabbage) and side of baja rice. All washed down with one of their inexpensive, yet effective, margaritas, the el cheapo. All for less than $15! It's a meal that satisfies and transports you miles away, to a place with sand between your toes and worries washed away to sea.
