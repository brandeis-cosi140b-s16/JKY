Oh, man, Viva Michoacan! This place is so incredible! My favorite Mexican place in Vegas. I've gone plenty of times and even celebrated my 21st birthday there! The restaurant is what I would call upscale-kitsch. 

The Mariachi guys aren't the typical warblers that you get elsewhere. Ask them to sing "Malague√±a". These guys can BELT! They also do a rockin' rendition of "La Bamba" if you want something more upbeat.

Their house tequila is incredible. As is the free bean dip and salsa. Mmmm.

My favorite dish? Pollo Parangaricutirimicuaro. If you're gringo and can pronounce it, you get a free shot! Otherwise, just ask for "Pollo al chipotle". They'll get it. It's two giant chicken breasts in a spicy chipotle-tomato sauce. I'm craving it SO BAD right now!
