In Vegas visiting Family not too far from Leticia's, they said its always busy but had not been in to try it yet.  We hit the strip for the day and came back to their pad badly needing takeout so decided to try it.  

We ordered a family patter for 4 and went to pick it up after 20 minutes. We choose Carnitas and Carne Asada from a list of typical favorites (Enchiladas, Taquitos, Tostadas, Chile Relleno, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Flautas, Burrito)

it was all hot and packed up neatly in aluminium catering trays, the meal included plentiful helps of each:

Carnitas, Carne Asada, tortillas, Rice, Beans, Chips, Guacamole, Pico, and two types salsa. All of the food It was outstanding!  Great flavor and all the fixens to go with it.  Plenty of left overs for the next day, we will definitely make it a must stop next time we are in town. 

Thanks for the great dinner!
