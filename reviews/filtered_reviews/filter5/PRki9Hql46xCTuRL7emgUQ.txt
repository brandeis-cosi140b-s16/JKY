This place is legit! Found it one day using the "wheel of lunch" and gave it a shot. One of my favorite lunch spots in central Phoenix. I always do two enchiladas with the 50/50 tortilla. I do a different meat in each (the chicken is one of my favs though). The red enchilada sauce is a little more smokey, the green is a perfect spice. I usually do my enchiladas Christmas style to have the best of both worlds. 

One piece of advice is they are a pretty small establishment. During the lunch rush (which starts about 11:30) I usually go the takeout route.
