I don't make it a habit of reviewing chain places, but this is an exceptional location. The service is fast, friendly and helpful. Once they even helped me carry my food to my table when I had my infant carrier. But beyond that, it is just darn delicious!! Best Chipotle I've had. It's as if the cooks actually taste what they are serving instead of just following the recipe, because the seasoning is spot-on every time.
