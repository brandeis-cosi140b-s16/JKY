Wow. I am always on the lookout for a good breakfast burrito and this fulfilled every ounce of my craving.  

When I pulled up bright and early, about 8am, the parking lot was empty.  I wasn't sure if they were open as there is no open sign and it honestly looks like they are under construction as all of the signs are temporary. I checked the door and flagged my cabby to show he could leave.  

I ordered the chorizo breakfast taco with red sauce and a Mexican Coke. Not long later I received a burrito the size of what I normally get from Chipotle and was immediately excited. After the first bite any hesitation after seeing the entrance was gone. The tortilla was toasted perfectly, not at all soggy. The chorizo was finely ground and was seasoned with great taste, as was the red chile sauce. And I believe what yielded the fifth star was the added crispy hash-browns. So good. 

Definitely make the trip.
