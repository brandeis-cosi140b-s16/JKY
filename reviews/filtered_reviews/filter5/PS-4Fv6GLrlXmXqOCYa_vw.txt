I have never been here before until a few days ago.  I came here based on a really good Groupon offer and it had pretty good ratings on Yelp.  I knew it was a hole in the wall, but I was surprised by the location.  The restaurant looks awfully small from the outside, but it has a very "modern" and neoclassical look on the inside.  On the outside, I would not take a date here, but on the inside I would!

I went with a friend and we decided we wanted to make the most out of our Groupon, so we got cerviche as an appetizer.  I love the tangy and lime taste from cerviche, and this dish did not disappoint.  I was looking at the menu, and chips and salsa is $2.  I think that is the only negative, but cerviche and chips was good enough for me.  We got chicken burritos with red and green sauce on the side.  It was absolutely delicious.  A major winner for me was the usage of clean white chicken.  

The service staff was incredibly friendly and helpful during our visit.  I will definitely make another trip out here in the near future.
