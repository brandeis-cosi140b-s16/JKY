Great local Mexican restaurant. The ambiance and decor of this place were great. Really cheerful and fun environment. They even had a gentleman who sang and played guitar. nice touch!
The food was fresh and tasty and my margarita was strong!
The wait staff was very attentive. 
This is my new local spot for Mexican food!
