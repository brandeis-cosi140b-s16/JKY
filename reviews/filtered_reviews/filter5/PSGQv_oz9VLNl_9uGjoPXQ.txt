Whaat? Where have you been the last 17 years, Burrito Factory and why didn't you send a tweet/carrier pigeon/smoke signal when you opened? My husband and I ventured down South on a grey Sunday, but it was all smiles and sunshine in the Burrito Factory. The owner was super friendly and walked us through the whole menu and told us his story (we asked). 

I was so excited to not only have a place with several delicious homemade salsas - some without Cilantro - HALLELUJAH!!, but also California style burritos that as far as I know aren't anywhere else in town. For me, the most exciting thing was that they had Sopes. Not sopa (soup) but Sopes, which is kind of like an ultra thick corn tortilla fried which is used as a base like a tostada. It's only made in certain parts of Mexico, so until now, most of the Mexicans who owned restaurants in Charlotte were from non-sopes territory apparently. At the factory, they top their sopes with spiced pulled chicken on top of the beans and I usually like mine with ground beef, but they're so nice I'm sure they'd customize. They also had a number of really good looking salads that I will definitely try. Even their chips are delicious, and their tomatillo salsa and an orange creamy chipotle sauce is to die for. 

In addition, they had flavored waters (like uncarbonated soda) and the pina colada was really delicious. We got a horchata to go as a dessert. :)

It's exactly what you want a burrito place to be - fresh ingredients, unique combinations, great salsas, fair prices and delicious salsas. Perfecto! My only complaint is its location, but word on the street is they're looking into a location somewhere closer to uptown (Dilworth maybe)? Can't wait!
