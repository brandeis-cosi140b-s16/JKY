I have been going to La Pinata for the past 30+ years.  This is Mexican comfort food at its best.  The high quality of the food has remained the same over the years.  My "usual" is the Green Chili Burro, enchilada style. The green chili has consistently tender beef chunks in a rich beef and green chili gravy.  The crowning touch is the outstanding enchilada sauce.  With soft drinks, the meals for 2 cost a little over $20.  

Over the past few years we have ventured off our normal orders and have tried the chili relleno, tamales, cheese enchiladas, and the salad carbon.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  

The staff is always friendly.  Our usual waiter, Matt, always takes very good care of us.  

During the bad economy, I worried about this little family run business.  I am so happy to say that they are still going strong.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.
