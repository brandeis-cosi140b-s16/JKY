This was are first time there,  I am the pickiest person when it comes to food, atmosphere and good customer service.  This place went above all expectations.  My daughter ate all of her food which is very rare,  and the (I'm guessing the manager) made my daughter a hot chocolate wich they don't even serve.  My chicken burrito was amazing, the cheese dip was amaaazing.  The coffee and chocolate ice cream brownie were fantastic. They went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect and always was there right on time.  Not to mention the decor was beautiful.  We will be coming back many more times.  Thank you joyride
