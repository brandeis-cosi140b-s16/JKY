One of my favorite places to dine out. LOVE the atmosphere in the basement!  If you ever have the opportunity reserve the banquet room-it is a must do!  The staff kept the drinks full and plentiful all night, dinner was hot and DELICIOUS! (Surprise I had the filet ,asparagus and sweet potato) And if you have friends like mine that are a bit boisterous (you know who you are) the banquet room creates a nice buffer between your party (literally) and the more sedate diners.  The menu has some less traditional items- like the twice baked sweet potato served in a chile...MMMMM. Or the shredded crab meat that tops the steak...This is a Phoenix institution- and a must try.  You can't call yourself a Phoenician if you haven't dined here.
