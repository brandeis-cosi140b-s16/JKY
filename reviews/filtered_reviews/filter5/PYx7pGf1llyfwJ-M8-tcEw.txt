Definetely would go back. Very good: draft beer, margaritas, guacamole.
The entr√©es & service were exceptional. This is the place to ask the server what they would recommend; I had a carne asada dish, wife had chicken. Don't know what "regular" Mexican food was like, although they had large selection. They had a lot of items I had never seen anywhere else. 
Expensive, if you are looking for something more affordable, don't go here; you will miss the best dishes.
