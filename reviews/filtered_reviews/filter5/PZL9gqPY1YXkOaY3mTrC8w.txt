We had a reservation at 8 for a group of 7. We showed up a little before 8 and they told us they were just getting out table ready and asked if we could wait. Literally 5 minutes later, a waiter brings by free mini sized margaritas as a thank you for being patient. Already in an awesome mood.

The drink menu is extensive, and just about everything is great (I would know because we all swapped drinks and tried each others).

Food: you must get the guacamole as a started. But caveat, do not overeat chips or you will be full by the time your entree arrives! I ordered the butternut squash tacos, which were so good. Everyone else got steak or fish and also loved their dish.

Great ambiance, great service, nothing but raves about the food and drinks.
