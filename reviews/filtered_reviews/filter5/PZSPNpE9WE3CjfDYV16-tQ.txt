Picked this place randomly off the street after being accosted by Jesus freaks in plaid shirts telling us how we were all going to die and students were getting shot and we are all going to burn.  I guess standard for Arizona?  Looked even from the exterior to be a sleeker establishment than the neighboring college-y places.  More expensive but not prohibitive: and the food portions were pretty generous, starting with a huge baskets of fresh chips and amazing salsa from the get-go; even refilled once when the waitress' "spidey sense" went off to make sure we didn't stay skinny like Americans aren't supposed to be.  Massive menu of tequila that was so intimidating that I just stuck with the cocktails which were spicy and just right: one with ginger and one with what seemed like jalapeno with a strong afterkick.  Got a couple of the 3 taco plates and a large portion (Canteen Corona And Lime Roast Chicken, Served Half Or Whole, With Choice Of Two Sides And Flour Or Corn Tortillas) which fed the three of us.  Desert of Chile Mango sorbet with mangos cut and chile powder on top was perfect.  Modern and well lit decor; had to laugh at the IKEA lights but they are pretty cool looking the way they did it.  Only odd touch was the ketchup bottle squirt soap container which I guess reminds us we are on college row.
