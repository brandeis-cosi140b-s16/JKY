I had dinner reservations for my wife and I at a different locale. 40mins later, we left and went next door to Mercandito. We had been there twice before and liked the food. The place was packed, especially the patio area where we wanted to sit. Somehow, they seated us outside in less than 2mins and our waitress Adrianne was incredible!! Best service we've enjoyed in awhile. My wife and I bothe had the RIbeye Ranchero, and it was one of the best steak either of us have ever had!! Fast,friendly service, good stiiff cocktails and great food and atmosphere!!! One of our new favorite places!!!
