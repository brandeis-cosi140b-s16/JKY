OK, I'm going to admit living in the 'Dale I have no reference for good Mexican food as I'm not sure it exists there.  However the experience and food at Tia Rosa has been so gut-bustingly fantastic I have to give this place a fiver!

The Tia Rosa style fajitas with carne asada is amazing, tender, and has a ridiculous amount of flavor.  It's not a traditional carne but fantastic nonetheless.  I can't bring myself to order anything else, but apparently there are other menu options as well.  The chips and salsa is fuh-ree and includes the verde, regular, and hot stuff upon request--I recommend you make that request.

The only two negatives--one of which would normally be a -1 star--are a lack of beer on tap and no hot sauce available!  I can grudgingly live with the beer issue, and I've solved the hot sauce problem by bringing my own Cholula.  I'm not sure if the Little Lady was entertained or embarassed.  Anyways, keep in mind it's BYOHS and get out to RDTR for some fantastic Mexican food.
