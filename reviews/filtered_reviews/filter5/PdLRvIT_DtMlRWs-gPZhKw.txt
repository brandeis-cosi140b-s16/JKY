Delicious! We were running late for our reservation & they did not give us a problem when we informed them of it. The hostess was miserable, but the wait staff made up for her personality. The decor makes you feel like you're in Mexico and kept clean. We ordered Sangaritas, which were a nice sized drink. We found out later on that if you don't finish your drink, you can ask for a To-Go cup at the bar, so you can take your drink with you! I suggest getting the appetizer sampler or a combination platter, this way you can taste a little bit of everything off the menu. Our combo platter was delivered to the wrong table, so we were compensated for the inconvenience. It was definitely a good choice for our first night in Vegas!
