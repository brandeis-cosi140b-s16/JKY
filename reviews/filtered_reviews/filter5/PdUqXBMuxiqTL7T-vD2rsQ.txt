Yesss! This is our new go-to Mexican place. 

The restaurant looks very unassuming outside, as it's in the middle of a strip mall, but the decor is cute as soon as you step through the door. Everything from the service to the food was fantastic. We tried the guac (super fresh onions, roasted garlic, chunky avocado, awesome touch with the white cheese on top, a slight kick), three different types of tacos (the veggie ones were amazing), and a side of roasted cauliflower (verrry interesting!). 

And since no Mexican restaurant is complete in my book unless they serve chips and salsa on the house, I was happy to note the cauldron of chips arrived immediately and without prompting. Their chips were pretty standard, but both the red and green salsas were excellent. The green salsa was heavy on the cilantro, really addicting, and tasted like it was made to order. Ugh, seriously, no complaints! And the kicker... every Monday is a happy Monday, with happy hour all day and all night: $3 drafts, $1 off select menu items, and $5 select cocktails and wines.
