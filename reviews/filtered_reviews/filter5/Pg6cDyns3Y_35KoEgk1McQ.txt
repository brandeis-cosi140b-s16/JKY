Went again last Friday and staying true to form they did not disappoint. Tyler was our server and did a good job of suggestive selling. I tried the shrimp tacos which were tasty and had a good spicy kick to them and the Lobster Tacos knocked it out of the park. Also try the Mac n cheese(I know that sounds crazy) because it is delicious and a pleasant surprise. Hayes the GM came by and table touched when we left. We ran up a good tab so it was nice to have him say thanks. He gave us his business card which was a nice touch.
