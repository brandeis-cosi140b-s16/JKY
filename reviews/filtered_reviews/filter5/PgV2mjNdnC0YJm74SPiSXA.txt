For the price, Yo Rita's is definitely as good as it gets. Add up the fact that it's around the corner for me, and it's an even bigger winner. 

This is a simple menu restaurant by a smashing chef. Lots of fresh ingredients, lots of specials, 90% tacos. The tacos are pretty sizable, but the problem is that you'll want to order 3 to try out the different varieties. With the chips, you don't want to order more than 3.  

Hands down this is the best place for Mexican-inspired food in the city. I hope they start opening for lunch, but for now, head down there any evening and chow down on some delicious tacos.
