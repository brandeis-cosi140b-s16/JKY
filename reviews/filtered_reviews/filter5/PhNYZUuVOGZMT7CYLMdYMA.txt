Really exceptional breakfast, and it kicked off our experience in the Southwest for our vacation just right.

I highly recommend giving this a try. Usually restaurants in hotels and airports or tourist sections don't have to try very hard. After all, they are guaranteed some amount of traffic.

Well the food here even the farmer's bread with breakfast was something far above the norm.

I had the Chorizo breakfast plate, it was so good I would search it out the next time I am in Sky Harbor.

Step right in, my friend.
