We came here with our friend who is a true New Mexico Chile Head. The restaurant is decorated really nicely with a N.M. theme that's fun and inviting. Our server told us it was her first night, but she was great. We ordered the appetizer sampler and everything on it was delicious. We all enjoyed the basket of fresh Sopaipilla . I ordered the Stacked Enchilada with Green Chiles. Damn good, very well done. Wifey had the Tacos and they were wonderful too. Great place and recommend.
