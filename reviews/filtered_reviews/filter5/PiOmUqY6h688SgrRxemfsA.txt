I have patronized Garcia's since 1962 when it was located at 35th Ave. and McDowell.  In 2001 my wife and I moved to Marshfield, MO and we still drive back to Phoenix at least once a year to eat at Garcia's.  This is my favorite eatery in the United States.  We now live in the mid-west and I haven't found decent Mexican Food since we left Phoenix.  I judge every Mexican Restaurant I eat at by this one.  

I particularly like the combination appetizers and I really like the Green Tamale... oh yeah... and the Chimi's and... oh hell, I like it all.  The food is great, the service is good and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The chips keep coming and the salsa is delicious.  Olivia has created an icon.
