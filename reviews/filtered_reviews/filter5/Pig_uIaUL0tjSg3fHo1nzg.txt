ULTIMATE CHIMICHANGA!!!!

Need I say more?

I went there, not once, not twice, but three frigging times this last week because of the Phoenix Film Festival.  It was amazing all three times.

I love their chips/salsa and like the headline says.. the Ultimate Chimichanga was insanely delicious.  In fact, I am craving it as I type this.  I wish you were closer Chimi!

Good service, the people are always on top of your drinks/chips and anything else you need. The place can be pricey, so watch the drinks you order.  

I cant wait to go again. :)
