Café Rio is my favorite little fast - food Mexican restaurant. They have a cute "Mexican styled" restaurant and you can almost always count on friendly employees. A+ customer service is definitely something they aim for. They will often ask to take your tray or bring you something (eg. dressing, tortillas, or anything not quite ready at the moment). Around lunch time Café Rio hits their "rush hour" and although there are plenty of seating both inside and outside you may have a little trouble finding a seat for you and your friends! Another thing to be expected around lunch time is the lines are longer than usual, but the wait is worth it if you ask me.

The delicious, fresh, fairly cheap food is always something I look forward to eating with a few friends after class or a long day of shopping. Contrary to the good, the meat is a little sweet for some peoples liking which is why some people prefer Chipotle over Café Rio, but the sweet meat is giving their food their own style. I'm a vegetarian, so I don't have to worry about this. Go me!

You can find Café Rio restaurants all over the valley. This makes it easy to get a quick, filling meal no matter where you are. It's kind of like McDonalds... But fresh and actually taste good! Plus, they cater! My family uses the catering services they offer all the time for anything from baby showers to Super Bowl parties.

I would of course recommend Café Rio to anyone. More specifically a salad with house dressing and shredded lettuce, rather than the big pieces, this makes it easier to eat. I say give it a try. You don't have much to lose. Café Rio is trendy and cheap. Worst case, you don't like it and you're only out a few dollars.
