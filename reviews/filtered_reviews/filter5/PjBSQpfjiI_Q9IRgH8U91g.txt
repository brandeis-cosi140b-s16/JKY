Let me start off by saying that I am shocked that this has a 3-star rating on Yelp, I understand that the prices may be a little high, but remember 1) this is Vegas and 2) this is in the Cosmo, neither of which are known for being economical.  So come on people..

My rant is over...  After having eaten at China Poblano, which my first José Andrés dining experience, I will likely name my first child after him, then force my child to name their first born after him.  The food and drinks are playful and just flat out phenomenal.  I opened the night with his Salt Air Margarita, which has salt water foam on the top of it rather than a salted rim, and it was hands down one of the best margaritas I've had.  The bartender explained the José developed the idea after he was swimming in the sea and swallowed some salt water, then viola!  To kick off the food, I ordered barbacoa and pescado tacos.  Have you ever had food that is so good that you just smile after eating it?  Well this does just that.  I then switched gears to the China portion of the menu and had When Pigs Fly, which is 4 BBQ pork steam buns.  The buns are light and doughy while the inside is a burst of unbelievable flavor.  Last, but not least, I had to fuse the two worlds, so I had the tuna ceviche, which was an interesting take on the classic by adding soy sauce and roasted amaranth seeds.  

I was convinced the first time here would not be the last, but unfortunately I had scheduled work dinners throughout the week that screwed this plan up.  Luckily, I was able to convince a group to take me here, and the second time was just as good as, if not better than, the first time.

Bravo, Señor Andrés.
