Had an amazing experience with the whole family.  My sister and brother in law came to Vegas from Japan and my parents and I came from Virginia.  We had been craving some Mexican food and El Dorado really delivered.  Not only was the service really great, we also had a chance to meet and acquaint ourselves with Executive Chef Paco.

The food was phenomenal.  We had the steak fajitas, the carnitas, and the carne asada burrito.   All the Margaritas were great ( I think we tried all the different flavors ).  My personal favorite was the Jalape√±o flavored margarita.  For dessert, I highly recommend the flan.  According to Chef Paco, the flan's recipe is from his grandmother and you can really tell that the flan is a work of family love.

We had lunch and dinner there three times in the course of five days.  That's how much we enjoyed it.
