We tried this last night for the first time. Place was very clean. Lighting was minimal, it seemed really dark inside. We both ordered the fish tacos and an order of chips and salsa-to go. Fish tacos were amazing, they had a tasty orange sauce on them. There are three tacos in an order. Plenty of well seasoned fish on each taco. The tacos came with lime wedges, extra orange sauce and a green salsa, and a grilled green onion that I wasn't sure what to do with. The chips are made in house I believe, they were delicious. The salsa was really good, not spicy(which I like), and not super tomatoey. It was more orange in color and it had a little sweetness to it. I don't know if it's standard for each order of chips and salsa, but a large container of awesome guacamole was in our bag too. We will definitely be back, I need to try the ribeye tacos that everyone else is talking about!
