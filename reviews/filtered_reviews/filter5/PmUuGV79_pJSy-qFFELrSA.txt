This place was so much fun for my first time being there. The music is great they play all kinds from spanish to house you name it, It can get a crowded if you go real late. The earlier you arrive the better chances of you getting a table to sit on. The bathroom was pretty cool no waiting in line i want to say they have about 8+ bathroom stalls not sure i know it was more than 8 though. As for the drinks they are a bit pricey but its vegas what do you expect. Other than that this is my go to place for a fun night with my girls. Oh i almost forgot the cover charge for girls was $15 but thats because we got there after 11pm.
