We go to Blue Agave ALL the time. Food is great. Let me tell you, if you check in with Yelp! there is always a coupon available or you can go to Living Social or Double Take and buy a offer from them. We never not have some kind of deal when we go. 
Chips are thin, i love thin chips and the salsa is like a chipotle salsa, love that too.
They offer a great gluten free menu. I am hooked on their Carne Asada Rice Bowl. I also love their spicy boneless pork ribs, there is so much meat and the flavor is out of this world, comes with rice and your choice of black beans, pinto beans or refried beans, flour or corn tortillas, i choose corn because of the gf thing. I'm told by my Alex that Ultimate chimichanga are delicious. 
There is a full service bar and a huge list of tequilas to choose from.
Get on their email list and they will send you offers there too and updates on up coming events, like Blood Mary specials, yum, they have good ones :)
We recommend giving Blue Agave a shot.
