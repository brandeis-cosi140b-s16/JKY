As the stars say..."As good as it gets". Carne Asada Tacos are the best, but I like to mix them up when I order, so I get the shrimp, chicken and pork for variety. Their hot sauce (red) is so good, I like to squirt it in my mouth (this is where Dumb and Dumber got if from), also the freshest guacamole in the valley. Breakfast is great here. I always have the flapjacks ($5.00) with real, authentic, bonafide, verifyable Maple Syrup, not colored corn syrup. The breakfast burrito is good for two and the coffee is so soul satisfying.

I'm going to work the rest of the menu till I try it all. This guys is a real artist and cares about his food and custumers. More, more, more like this is needed.
