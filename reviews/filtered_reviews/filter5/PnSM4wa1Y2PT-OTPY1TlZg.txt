We have driven by here so many times and finally stopped in. Got three burritos and two street tacos. Verdict...so good!!!  Meet was tender and juicy and the girls behind counter were helpful with all of our questions. The burritos the kids loved and every last drop! They have a fabulous creamy red salsa and there are just no words to describe how good it was!!
