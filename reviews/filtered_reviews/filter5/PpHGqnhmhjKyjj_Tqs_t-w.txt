I highy recommend the Border Grill for any of your three meals in Vegas. I have to specifically single out Randy and thank him for making our experience so wonderful. He was an absolutely amazing server who took our time at The Border Grill to the next level. My husband played Menu Roulette and Randy nailed it with Chicken Poblano Enchiladas. Oh my goodness, DELICIOUS! Nice choice! My parents ordered the Carne Asada tacos and the tortilla soup. They were very happy. I had the Grilled Fish tacos and they were great! I will definitely be eating here again and definitely be ordering the Poblano Enchiladas.
