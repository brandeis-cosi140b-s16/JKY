My family and I were visiting from Santa Clara on holiday at a nearby Hilton when were in the mood for Mexican food.
After walking in downtown Scottsdale we decided to try this place. We were immediately seated by our waitress, Ivette(sp), and were given a complimentary appetizer. The booth my wife, six children, and I sat in was perfect. I ordered the Barrio Pollo Burrito...OUTSTANDING! The quality of the chicken was superior. The horchata is the best I have ever had and the genuine service Ivette provided was top notch. 
I look forward to returning to Barrio Queen when in the Scottsdale area in the future.
