I mostly concur with the positive reviews, i just feel compelled to battle the nimrods who haven't gotten it.  I have eaten here more than a half dozen times.  Not a single disappointment.  The pork torta?  Three consecutive times, all fantastic.  Naco torta, satisfying and delicious.  Side vegetables?  Fresh and well cooked.  You could choose to find fault with the layout of the place or the casualness of service.  I choose to do neither of those things, as I am not a difficult Wang-slave.  Eat and enjoy the food, that is the only relevant thing here.
