AMAZE! So happy there are now two locations in town. Tacos are so juicy, tasty and only fresh ingredients. Soyrizo breakfast burrito is delicious! Carne Asada fries are perfect. Love the hibiscus tea. The veggie and sauce bar is loaded, the best in any mexi restaurant, as long as they keep it stocked LOL Mexi corn scrumdeliumpcious!
