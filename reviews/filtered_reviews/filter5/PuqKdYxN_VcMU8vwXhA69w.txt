Wow, what combinations and so creative.

After a work conference, I broke away for lunch, and what a surprise!

I started with the Coconut Ahi Tuna tartar. This is tuna covered with a coconut reduction, and then placed inside a coconut with shredded coconut on the bottom. Comes with a wedge of lime and crispy plantains. I first ate the tuna without the lime, and there was a nice sweetness to the tuna, but adding the lime later on gave the tuna the classic ceviche taste! Highly recommended.

Next was the Korean Beef tacos with grilled pineapples. The sweet pineapples and pickled onions was a perfect contrast to the Korean beef tacos. Add the avocado and you have a creamy taco with lots of flavor.

The final frontier, dessert! There is no dessert menu, it was provided verbally. When I heard the dessert, I knew that was the one. She said "Churro Cheesecake"! The cheesecake itself seems to have a hint of cinnamon added, and then pieces of churro was added on top, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar to make it complete. Comes with a side of vanilla ice cream. Makes me with there was more pieces of churro but that was plenty of sugar already.

Fantastic meal with surprise parings, there menu has a lot more to offer, I just tried the items that appealed to me!
