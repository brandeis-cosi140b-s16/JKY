ok, so I worked at the ASU Polytechnic campus for 3 years before trying the Burrito Shack.  Students, faculty, and staff would all rave about it but I refused to eat anything from a shack.  I was so worried about the quality of food.  One adventurous morning, I stopped by for a breakfast burrito.  Oh my goodness!  It was heaven.  I cannot believe that I worked there for 3 years without trying it.  LOVE it!  I was able to get a small egg/cheese/potato burrito with a small coke for about $3.50.  Seriously.  Cheap but delicious.  It is so delicious!  You will not regret it!
