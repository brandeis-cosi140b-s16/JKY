We've been going to this restaurant for 25+ years, since it was in an old A frame building down the street. I can't say enough about the food and the staff. The enchiladas are amazing, especially with shredded beef or adovada. Although the chile is spicy, there are options for those who don't like it hot. The shredded beef burro is chock full of tender, flavorful beef and the shredded beef and guacamole tostada is fresh and delicious. Add a pitcher of their amazing margaritas and I am one happy camper!  Staff is friendly and efficient and the owner/manager John always makes us feel welcome. Hope to be a loyal customer of Los Dos for 25 more years.
