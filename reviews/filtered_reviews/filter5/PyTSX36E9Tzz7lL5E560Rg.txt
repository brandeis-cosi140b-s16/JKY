Fresh fast Mexican! Maricris is really sweet at the counter. Margaritas for $4.95? Can you say YES???!!! Beer is on ice. My $6.99 chicken taco salad is HUGE and came w sour cream and guacamole! My honey's combos plate (taco, tostada) is crisp and tasty w rice and beans. The mild salsa has great flavor and the spicy salsa actually has a bite and is making my nose run. Wish we had a place like this back in Oregon! The only tip I have to offer is that they put a picture of a margarita in their window and on the menu bcuz we wouldn't have ordered one if Maricris hadn't mentioned it. :)
