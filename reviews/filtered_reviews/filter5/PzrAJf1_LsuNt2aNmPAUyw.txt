I have been eating at Los Olivos since 1987.  It is the ONLY place I think of when I am hungry for Mexican food.  The Corral family has kept this one in the family, and they still make the fresh tortillas and guacamole daily.

Order the chicken chimi supreme, it's not on the menu but it's always a known by your waiter...huge chimi done enchilada style with heaps of guac and sour cream on top.  The margaritas are fab, if you want a splurge go for the Cadillac.  Mmmmm.  

This one is a must eat every time I am in town.
