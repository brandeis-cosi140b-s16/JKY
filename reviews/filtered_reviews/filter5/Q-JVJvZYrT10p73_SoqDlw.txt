My name is Chris and I work for a celebrity chef on the strip in Las Vegas. This is the second time my wife and I have been to El Dorado and we love this restaurant. Tonight we were here for my wife's b day party and Jesse was our server. He gave us great service and we were a loud party of 11. Thank you Jesse. In addition, the executive Chef Paco came out to say hello to the group and that made us feel special. Get the table side guacamole....it is so smooth! The chicken breast fajitas were delicious!!! Thank you guys! You rock!
