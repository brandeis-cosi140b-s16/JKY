Wanted Mexican food and found this thru Yelp.  Reviews and pics were good so decided to try it for lunch.  It's small.. has 4-5 tables.  Only 1 other person in there when I went.  I ordered at the counter then grabbed a seat.  The gentleman who took our order also gave us chips with sauces.  The chips were bagged but they were good.  I ordered the flautas and they were really good.  The woman who cooked served us and she was very nice.   It was a cheap, quick, and flavorful lunch and I will be returning to try something else.
