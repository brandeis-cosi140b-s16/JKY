Huge fan! The jalape√±o shooters are hot hot hot and delicious! The fish tacos are also very good  I don't remember what everyone else at my table got but we all walked away satisfied. We also had an awesome waiter who was super friendly -- I'm not sure if that's a turn off to some people, but we had a blast!
