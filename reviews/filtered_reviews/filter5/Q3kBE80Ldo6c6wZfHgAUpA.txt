Just went here for some snacks. Had a margarita which was delicious (not too sweet or made with fake mixes). Started with the guacamole and salsa trio - the guacamole was excellent and the salsas had yummy different flavors. Also tried a couple flatbreads which were quite good. Ended with the cheesecake and the spicy chocolate cake, both were awesome. Pistachio ice cream with the cake was great! 

I love OHSO down the street, but the food at Milagro was MUCH better and more flavorful.  

Will have to try the tacos next time, I heard they just won Best Tacos at the Taco festival.
