As usual, Rokerij doesn't disappoint.  We had a party of 7 and sat in the cellar in one of the booths which fit us well.  We had a vegetarian in our group and with mostly meat and fish dishes served we were a little worried she wouldn't find much to suit her tastes. Steven our server was great and pointed out so many options to her. She left full, satisfied and can't wait to go back for more.
Others in our group had Lamb, Pork and SeaBass.  As usual it was delicious and did not dissapoint!  The servings are large so expect you may go home with a to-go box.  Wine list is great but if you prefer a cocktail they really know how to make them.
We love the Rokerij and will visit the cellar again as well as Richardsons patio once this summer heat goes away.
Keep up the good work Rokerij.
