The best two things are the fresh tortillas, and the mint limeade!  Tastes like a virgin mojito -- so good!  My friend told me Cafe Rio is better than the other Mexican QSR's I frequent (Chipotle, Zabbas, Baja Fresh, etc) and I was hesitant ... but he was totally right.  The steak salad with everything is wicked filling, and instead of a fried shell, they serve it in a nice, toasty fresh tortilla.  I've been back once a week since trying this fantastic place!  The line at dinner time is really long, but it moves quick.  The UNLV location has a little bigger servings, but I like the atmosphere on Eastern better.  Cheap for a meal and half -- my steak salad and a large soda ends up $11.07
