Hands down my favorite Mexican food in Surprise! I love it so much I usually eat here about twice a week. You won't find better Mexican food in the area. I love the beef tacos and my new fav is the rice & bean burrito enchilada style. There hours are short and they close early so you'll need to plan ahead for dinner. However, if you live in Surprise and haven't tried Ritos yet you're missing out!
