This is a hole in the wall place with tables in a separate room adjacent to the bar. Like the reviews state no sign so look for the copper doors. The atmosphere in the restaurant area was nice and quiet. We 4  sat at the community table which was a beautiful polished copper.  We all had the special which was ney York strip topped with crab and came with asparugus, brocoli,  and carrots with a jalape√±o hollandaise and their signature potato in a green chili. We also had chips salsa and guacamole which all had some heat especially the green salsa. Everything was prepared perfectly and was delicious.  I would go back.
