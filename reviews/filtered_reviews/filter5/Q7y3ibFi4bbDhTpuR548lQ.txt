This place is a great example of Mexican with American influence done right.

Since no one else has seemed to talk about the lengua tacos (because most of you guys may be too scared or too fond of your carne asada fries), I decided to let all my fellow lengua lovers know that this place has AMAZING lengua tacos and the now three times that I've had them they never disappoint. It's hard to find good tacos de lengua, but thankfully I live fairly close to Frijoles so I can my lengua fix with no problem.

The staff is friendly and seems to be made up of mostly Latino/a descent workers and that always gives me a sense of relief because you know they're not gonna give you a sad excuse for Mexican food like Chipotle or Roberto's.

Aguas frescas are just as good as you would get at Cardenas, maybe even better because you can taste how fresh it is!

The "Mexican street corn" I like, but it's not very authentic. They put their own twist on it by charring the corn and what tastes like lime juice on it? I'm not sure, but it's still pretty tasty. Just don't expect to get the kind you'd buy from the elote man on the actual street. :) 

Try this place guys, you won't be disappointed!
