My husband and I sat at the bar for happy hour twice and were not disappointed.  This is a great spot to rest after walking around downtown Scottsdale.  The drinks are delicious and their HH food menu has decent prices and a good value.  My husband loved their chicken quesadilla and salsa.  I love their white queso skillet dip and smashed potatoes.  Their grilled chicken fingers looks so darn good and smelled amazing.  I was bummed we had already eaten when they brought them to someone at the bar.  Will be back to try those next timne!
