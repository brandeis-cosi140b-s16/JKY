When my friends wanted to eat mexican food on the strip I wondered the heck why. Since all of them were from San Diego and that's where some of the best mexican food comes from but they were raving about Tacos El Gordo. 

We got the adobada tacos, and abobada fries which I had no idea at first it was the marinate pork. It was absolutely delicious-nish. Probably the best taco I ever eaten before I love the sauce they use on the taco. It was good and very creamy. I like the number one fan of carne asada fries never having tried abobada fries but I gotta say they made a believer out of me. It was delicious and I love how much sauce it had. Yummy the definite mexican joint to hit in Vegas.
