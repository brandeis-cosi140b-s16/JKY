That was the best Mexican food I've ever had, and that includes travel to Mexico.

We were in a hurry; our fight was boarding in 15 minutes. Rox got us our food within five minutes, and steak tacos coupled with a Goose Island IPA are a great way to start my trip.

Sure, it was pricier than I expected, but it was double the food at 120% the price. 

Worth it. 

I'll be back.
