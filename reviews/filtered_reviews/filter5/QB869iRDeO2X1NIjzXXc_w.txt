Arriba's is a very unique "New Mexican" cuisine ... different than typical Mexican fare in the Valley.  We used to take a drive up to Scottsdale every so often to go to Arriba's, but were glad when they opened in Gilbert!  If you love spicy, this is your joint ... if you don't, it's still great--just ask for them don't turn up the heat quite so far!  I wear glasses, and if I'm not careful at Arriba's, they start steaming up as I eat!  Arriba's is a chain, so it feels somewhat that way.  But their food is so unusual, it's worth it.  The White Sands Chimchanga is wonderful.  The Poco Pollo Con Queso is my favorite ... golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese, served with rice and refried beans.  If you like the hatch chile experience, Arriba's is IT.
