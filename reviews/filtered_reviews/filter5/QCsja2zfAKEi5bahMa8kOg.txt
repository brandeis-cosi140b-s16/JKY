I'd have to say that out of all the Mexican places I've tried in the Valley thus far, including non-chain places, this is definitely the best!!  Wonderful food, generous portions.  We frequent this place at least 2-3 Fridays a month and have tried about 1/2 of the items on the menu.  Usually taco salads don't do much for me, but this one is actually good!  Chips/salsa are very good (especially with the hot sauce), fundito is amazing, cheese crisp extravaganza is fantastifc.  I've noticed many of their best items are served with jalapeno cream cheese, which really is addictive.  I'm fairly certain this is why ppl have so many cravings for Valle Luna.  Never had any service issues here.  Building is very old but adds to the authentic ambiance.  Have never come during happy hour or sat in the bar area, just the dining areas (there are several "rooms" which is nice and changes things up a bit if you come here often).  The only negative is that sometimes it gets a bit loud w/kids running everywhere, but overall a very pleasant, casual place for any occasion.  restaurant.com offers a $25 gift card for just a couple bucks, and all you have to do is spend $35 (and some of this can be on alcoholic drinks!) So you end up getting $35 worth of food/drinks for about $20-25 with tip.  Not bad!  Val-pak also has buy 1, get 1 free entree coupons almost every time, but even without discounts, the prices aren't too high.  Granted, I definitely wouldn't come here as often if discounts weren't available though.
