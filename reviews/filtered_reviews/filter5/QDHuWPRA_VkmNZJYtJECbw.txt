Everything I have gotten from here has tasted amazing. Maize doesn't have much indoor seating and there aren't many parking spots. They always have a long line. Despite all these cons, you can never go wrong when ordering food here. They handle long lines really well. That have gotten used to long lines. My favorite thing to get here is their torta de milanesa. Their chips are really good; They might be a little greasy for some people but I can't get enough of them. They give you two different types of salsa with your food and both of them are really good. Their menu is simple and easy to understand. They also have your classic Mexican sodas. The prices of all their food is cheep. I would pay more for the quality of the food they provide. I hope that in the future they expand their restaurant because the food, service, and environment is really good. If you don't know what to get you should try their quesadillas.
