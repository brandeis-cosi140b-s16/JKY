Hit Tacos El Gordo at 11:10 am - Just a few people in line - Score!  As it was my first time, I was a tad confused.  There are separate ordering lines depending on the type of taco.  I ordered the adobada taco in the first line  and the Cabeza taco in the second.  I tackled the Cabeza first.  The flavor was out of this world!  The adobada had just the right amount of spice.  The pork had a little crunch to it - perfection!  Two tacos were definitely not enough.  But by the time I figured that out - the place was crowded!   Will have to go back as I forgot to order pineapple with the adobada!  My friend got a side of charred peppers and scallions that I must order as well.  It is lunchtime yet?
