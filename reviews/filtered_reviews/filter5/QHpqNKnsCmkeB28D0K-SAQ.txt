The tacos were amazing!!! When you step inside you'll think you are in Mexico. Everything from the art to the bar is authentic. The salsa bar has so many exotic selections that you will salivate over. The menu even caters to vegetarians. The tacos and burros are amazing. I will be a regular here and you should be too! Oh yeah and Alfredo makes killer margs!
