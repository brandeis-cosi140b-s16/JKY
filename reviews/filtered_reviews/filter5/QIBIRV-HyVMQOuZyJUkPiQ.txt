I freakin love this place! You can count on them to give you excellent service and a delicious meal! I live for Margarita Monday's! Half price! The food is fresh and I've never had anything I didn't like. Great variety on the menu too! The crab quesadilla is to die for!!! This is a go to neighborhood fave! Great for kickin it with the girls, a date o business lunch. Cute patio too! They get my vote! :)
