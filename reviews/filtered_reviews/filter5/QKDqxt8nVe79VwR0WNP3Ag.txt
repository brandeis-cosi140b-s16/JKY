Tonight we are here and not only was it amazing but the service was impeccable. Our server, Romilio was the kindest server we have genuinely ever had. Our food was running a little long but he was always by our side making sure we were fine and even gave us an absolutely amazing chicken soup obviously made from scratch. And I'm so happy he did because I would have never tried it but now we'll be ordering it with every meal. I will always come back and tell everyone I know to come here. Ps, always get the Lechon Asado it's phenomenal
