Oh. My. Goodness.  I realize that I just reviewed this little-slice-of-Heaven last week, but our latest visit deserves an update.  

We brought my visiting mother-in-law to La Condesa, so we could share the Mexican-food love with her.  For the last two days, I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people, raving about the "amazing" Mexican food she had on Saturday.  

On this visit, they had the Carne Asada (they were out last time).  My husband liked it, but actually thought the Tinga chicken was even better.  He swears there isn't a better chicken taco in town, and I think I'd have to agree.  My MIL had the chicken mole tacos and loved them.  She orders mole whenever she gets the chance, and rated it way up with Barrio's dish.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the mahi-mahi burro.  Oh, goodness... I'm having a flashback of it's amazingness...  luscious chunks of fish, smokey bacon, mushrooms (which I normally pass on, but they were fantastic!), and their velvety cilantro-cream sauce.  Ahhhhh.... so good!  

Another 5-star visit!
