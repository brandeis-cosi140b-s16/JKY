I gave this restaurant a 5 star because I really enjoyed the food.  I don't have much to say about Las Cazuelas other than you have to try their cooking to appreciate it. I don't need to search anymore for good authentic Mexican food in the Las Vegas Valley area. I am totally satisfied with the excellent food that came out of the kitchen each time I visited.  The taste is not overpowering with mounds of cheese and overly tangy sauce.  If you want good and real authentic Mexican cooking, you must try Las Cazuelas.  If you prefer to get rip off with Americanized junk, there are pretty of other places.  This place is unique.  I do have to mentioned the service was also very good.
