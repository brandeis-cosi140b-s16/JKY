First off, let me wonder how the heck I didn't hear of this place before this week?  The food was amazing!  I did take out and I ordered the Texas burger, which isn't on the menu but they made it for me.  2 patties, yummy brioche bun, BBQ sauce, cole slaw, green chili, mozzarella cheese, and bacon, plus I had them add fried onions.  Yum!  My whole family loved the french fries.  I got the french toast fries and they were also very good to try.  I will probably stick with regular fries in the future because the French toast ones were heavier and real sweet, although they would make one heck of a breakfast too!  My son got the plain burger and added bacon and ate it all up.  The only one that didn't like his too much was my husband with the country burger, but he tried mine and liked it, so he will be back but will order a different burger.

My son and I tried shakes.  I got the peanut butter one and it was incredible.  My son got the lucky charms marshmallow shake and loved it.

I will be back!
