This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I have tried most of them.

The vegetarian tacos are delicious, and you can get the taco dinner (2 tacos, rice, and beans) for only two dollars. Their salsa is also delicious.

I will quickly become a regular here - I can't believe it took me so long to find this place!
