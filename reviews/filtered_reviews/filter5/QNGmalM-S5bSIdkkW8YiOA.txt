I've had this place a couple of times since have being introduced to it and today I decided to try the Shrimp Bowl with rice and beans topped off with cabbage or lettuce to your liking, cottage cheese, Chipotle sauce, and a salsa of your liking red/green. It was delicious and I seriously recommend having that bowl!
