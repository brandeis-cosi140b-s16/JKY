The best airport food I've had in years, if ever. 

I knew I was in for something special when the waiter brought the bread and sauce, a sublime combination of tapenade, caponata and salsa. 

Then came the menu. Decisions, decisions. Should I play it safe and order a burrito or try something different and new? I chose the latter and went with the cochinita pibil, a slow-cooked (12 hours) pork dish served with mashed potatoes, a sort of pico de gallo, marinated cucumbers, tortillas and a little au jus on the side. Fan-freakin'-tastic. 

Not sure why the other Yelpers on here gave this place such short shrift. If Barrio's other locations really are that much better than here, then this is the best Mexican "chain" on earth. 

Worth getting to the airport early for!
