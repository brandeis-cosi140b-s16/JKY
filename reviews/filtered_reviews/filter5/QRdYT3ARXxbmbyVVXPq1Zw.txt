I will def come back here. The only downside is you get 1 refill of your fountain drink. Service was amazing, very attentive. The shredded beef chimichanga had very well seasoned beef and perfectly flaky exterior.  They could have cooked their enchiladas a little more, but the sauce was delicious. 
And their rice was the best I've had in a long time.
