It has become a weekly routine to come down to Tacos El Gordo for dessert on the weekend. Yepperz you heard that right.... dessert. I like the Asada tacos and they are $2 each. I don't like any of that guacamole sauce they put on it. They have signs to let you know what each line is for so make sure and pay attention because these lines can be mad crazy. If you like grilled peppers and veggies then ask for a plate of them free of charge. You can also ask them to put foil on your plate if you want it to go or you can sit at tables they have set up under a tent style area outside. If you like good ass tacos them come here.
