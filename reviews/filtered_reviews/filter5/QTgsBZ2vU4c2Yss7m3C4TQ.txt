Omg. If I could give this place 100 stars, I would!! This place does it right!! Real authentic Mexican food! Homemade tortillas right in front of you. There's a line to order, get your food & move on & pay with the cashier. It gets packed! But for a good reason...a really good one!! Food is BOMB!!!!!!!!! Definitely coming back!!!!
