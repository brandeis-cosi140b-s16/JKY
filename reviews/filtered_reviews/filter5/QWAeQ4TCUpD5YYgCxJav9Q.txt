One of those places you have to know is there. Once you find the place, you will be back! The restaurant is great! Food is in large portions and freshly made. VERY reasonably priced and good selection. I always get the Carlito's burrito which is stuffed with your choice of meat and covered with sauce. Friendly staff and great food!! Yes, we all know the shopping center is difficult to get in and out of, but that does not stop me from going to Carlito's Burritos.
