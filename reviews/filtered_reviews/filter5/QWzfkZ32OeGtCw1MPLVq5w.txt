I have gone here since it opened, and it has always been my favorite mexican restaurant.  In the last couple of months the management has made some changes that have made this place even better.  The salsa is now made fresh every day and you can totally tell!  They also added freah guacamole to the menu which has a great flavor and again, it is fresh!  My personal favorite is the baja sauce.  I will keep coming here!
