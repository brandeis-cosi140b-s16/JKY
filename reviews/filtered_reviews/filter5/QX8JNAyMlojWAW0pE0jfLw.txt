I have decided....Los Reyes De La Torta is my favorite place for Mexican Food.  I  would consider myself a Mexican food fan.  I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and I even had a Mexican roommate who made awesome Mexican food all the time.  So I think I know my Mexican.  This was probably my fourth visit to Los Reyes.  My wife and I decided to have Mexican food for Cinco de Mayo.  I tried several new things.  I started off with the Tosada de Ceviche (Shrimp Ceviche) - Awesome flavors - just the right amount of lime/lemon and salt.  YUM!!!  Then I went with the Peluche plate packed with goodies (The steak was nicely seasoned and blended well with the sausage, ham, grilled onions, grilled peppers, pineapple, jalapenos).  My wife got the always amazing Del Rey.  We also threw on a plate of Chiles Toreados (grilled jalapeno and onions).  Everything was fantastic.  Oh yeah - they also have great Aqua Frescas.

We have taken out-of-town guests to this restaurant who also loved it.  My wife and I are surprised that we don't come here more often.  

Other items that I've tried at Los Reyes that I liked as well.

Tacos de Cabazea
Tacos de Asada
Torta Nortena with Steak
(Tacos de Lengua - not 100% sure that I have tried it here...)

I reserve my 5 star ratings for only my favorite restaurants - Los Reyes is definitely one of them!
