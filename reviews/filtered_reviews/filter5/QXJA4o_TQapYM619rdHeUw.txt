I've been living in Phoenix for about two summers and I can confidently say these are the best tortas I've ever had. Although the atmosphere is somewhat loud and the wait can be long during busy hours, the wait is always worth it. The staff is very friendly and you can never go wrong with any of the dishes you pick. If a torta is a mouthful, their quesadillas with handmade tortillas are delectable. I also recommend trying out their aguas cremosas made on the spot. This is one of the few places in the area you can he a delicious, full meal for an affordable price.
