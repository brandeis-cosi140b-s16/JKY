WORTH THE WAIT.

I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.

Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)

First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS. 

Here are some things to remember when waiting here:

-The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar.
-You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them.
- Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too!
-You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed)
-Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them.
-The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed "gay tacos". 
-You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it.
-The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring.
