YES - this is a five star place.  Tacos el Gordo has perfected the "Taco Shop!"  I might even move over to the east side just to be closer...

The place was packed with mexicans!  This is a no english establishment.  You can get by with just pointing and saying "si" or "dos" or "gracias."  In other words - the place is authentic!

There is a cafeteria style ordering system.  Adobada, carne asada, something that looked like beef parts.  The cooks were slapping the tacos together as fast as you could snap your fingers!

I had the adobado tacos and carne asada tacos.  Adaboda - other than the pork and pineapple I have no idea what went on my taco but it was MUY BUENO! Same with the carne asada tacos - ME Gusto Mucho!

The service was fast and friendly.

The place was very clean - especially for how busy it was.

It was worth the 20 minute drive.
