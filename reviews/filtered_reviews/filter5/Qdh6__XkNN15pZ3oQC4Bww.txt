Perfect!  Great real gourmet Mexican food, great atmosphere, good service.  An upscale place but they do have a kids menu and plastic cups so still go even if you can't find a sitter.  Some reviews say the dress code is dressy; the wait staff wears nice jeans and black polos, so similar for the guests is fine.  It's on par with Rosa Mexicano in DC and NYC, Tamayo in Denver and Maya in SF.  If you like gourmet Mexican it's a must.  The corn soup with huitlacoche, the chicken mole, and the pork shoulder were some of our favorites.  The organic margerita and guacamole are also great. It's pricey; entrees 26-32, the organic Marg was 13; but worth it!  A huge tequila menu.  Enjoy!
