We try to eat here every time we are in Vegas - its that good!  I've been happy with all my meals here, the latest being a gaucho steak salad, which is a whole bunch of steak strips served on half a head of lettuce with onions and a fabulous dressing, as well as an interesting vegetable that looked like a cross between asparagus and broccoli.  It was all very tasty.  My dh had the chef make a shrimp diablo fajita that he really enjoyed.  Prices are good, service is great, food excellent!
