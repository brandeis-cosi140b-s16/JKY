I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in their meal at Hussongs.  Most recently I had one of their carnitas sandwiches and it was terrfic.

I like Albondigas Soup.  I try it wherever I go and Hussongs serves a really superior soup.  Vegetables are crisp and the broth tasty.  The meat is hearty.  

Try it and you be the judge.
