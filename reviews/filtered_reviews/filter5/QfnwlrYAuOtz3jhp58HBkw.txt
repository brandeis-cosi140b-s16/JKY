I love this place.  It is my new favorite in the Northwest.  Everything is fresh.  No canned foods and prepackaged ingredients.  You can taste the difference.  Had the grilled fish street tacos today and they were excellent.  I am still craving them tonight!  My husband loves the puffy tacos.  They are tacos in shells similar to the shell you get on a Tostada salad.  Looked yummy.  Carnitas and Carne Asada platters are great choices as well.  Large portions so you can take some home for lunch the next day.
