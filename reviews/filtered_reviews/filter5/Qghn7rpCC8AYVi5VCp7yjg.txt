Huaraches is one of the best spots for Mexican food in Champaign/Urbana. The building is easy to find, although parking can get tricky. They have fresh chips and you get 4 different varieties of salsas and mixing cups to create your own blend. GENIUS! The margaritas are spot on and always perfect. Same with the food. I've never ordered a dish that wasn't drool worthy. The service has always been spectacular, even when our group may have been a little rowdy after a late night out.
