Amazing food!!!!! We came here for breakfast and were not disappointed one bit! We had three delicious types of salsas while we were waiting for our food. The breakfast burrito was exactly what I was looking for - I got chorizo and it was perfect. A great size, not too big and the potato chips they serve with it were amazing!! They were cut from real potatoes and cooked perfectly. We also got a chorizo quesadilla for breakfast which didn't disappoint either! We got the free flan dessert for checking in which was amazing. Great flavor! We would definitely come back here next time we're in town and would recommend it to others as well! :)
