Love love love this place!.. Green chili burrito is the BEST! Tacos are great. Everything is fresh and made to order. And the beans - oh those are like crack- once you try them you are hooked and crave your bean fix. This is a place everyone who loves Mexican food should try. Don't be scared of the area, you will be okay.
