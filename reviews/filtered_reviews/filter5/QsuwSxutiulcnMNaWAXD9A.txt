I've noticed lately that I maybe give too many 5 star reviews. So, I decided to maybe not be so easily impressed with just basic service. However, there is no way I can in good conscious give this place anything less than the 5 stars it deserves! Immediately upon entering the door I was greeted with a friendly hello. Once I told them it was my first time here, the young woman behind the counter immediately grabbed a bowl and gave me samples of the different meats. They were all good, but I had to go with the pig! I got it in the three taco deal and they were nothing less than delicious! They were not at all stingy with the ingredients, and it was all fresh. The meal with a 20oz Coke was around $10, which is about on par with Chipotle. Will definitely be back!
