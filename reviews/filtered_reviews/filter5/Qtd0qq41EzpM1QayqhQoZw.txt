I went yesterday and had what was one of the best green chili stews ever! When it came to my table I was my typical skeptical self. It was very green in color..hmm i hope this isnt going to be a stew with a bunch of tomatillos and very little chili? Boy o boy was i wrong. As soon as I took the first bite I was in heaven. Huge green chili flavor and watch out it is pretty hot, just the way it should be.  The potatoes were nice and small, and little bits of tomato in there too. Good amount of meat but not too much leaving room for that delicious broth. So yeah. I guess you could say I loved the place.
