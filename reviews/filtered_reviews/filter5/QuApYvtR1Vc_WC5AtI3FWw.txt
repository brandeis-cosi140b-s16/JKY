First time here and we like it a lot. Better than Juan's. We'll definitely be back. The only negative I can say is what others have mentioned in that the menu is extensive... too extensive and a bit intimidating as in I don't know where to begin. Other than that the food was good, service was average which is what we expect in Vegas, and we sat outside which was nice so ambiance was good. Unlike other folks I don't think the prices were too high I think they're good for the quality of food you get and let's face it, businesses need to make money. Que Bueno Mercado's!!
