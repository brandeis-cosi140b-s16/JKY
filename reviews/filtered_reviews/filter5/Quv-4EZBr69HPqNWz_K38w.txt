Ahhhhh the irony! The gf and I woke up Labor Day, and we were gonna go for it. We were going for the Dick's!  Arrived at 11am, and it was busy, but we still got 2 seats right at the bar. sweet. Ordered Bloody Marys and our bartender gave us 2 little sidecars of DosXX. Wha? "It's all about you, today," and he smiled. So cool. We were tired, hungover, and this was such a nice bright touch to start our day.  

Tenderloin Benedict (medium rare) for me, Adovada for the lady. Clean plates: indeed!  I'm really a bitch about a good hollandaise and man, I have got to hand it to them, they do it proper. The adovada was saucy and totally hump-worthy.

What a fantastic way to start off my Fall. This Kitty is a-purring!
