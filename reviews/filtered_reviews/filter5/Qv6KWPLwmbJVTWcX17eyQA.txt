This place is blowin' up on Yelp and for good reason!  I have a strong desire to knock one star off every review I have for other Mexican spots after eating here.  The salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.

I decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco and the Cochinita Pibil - marinated pork.  I seriously think the Cochinita Pibil was the best taco I've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  The Dogfish Shark taco was very good as well.

I think my search for the best tacos in Phoenix has come to a close!  It's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience.
