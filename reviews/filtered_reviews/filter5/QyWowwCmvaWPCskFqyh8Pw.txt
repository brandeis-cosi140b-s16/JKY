I did not know that this gem of a restaurant was so close to where we live.  I am so glad my parents told me about this place.  First off, they have the BEST green sauce I have ever had.  Seriously. So good.

Went here for dinner one evening, and we had to wait about 5 minutes, no biggie, the place was busy.  We were seated and our waiter brought over the most delicious chips and salsa.  I have a soft spot in my heart for salty homemade chips, and they definitely delivered.  The salsa was a bit too spicy for my taste, but the smidgen that I had of it was quite tasty. The hubs was practically drinking it out of the bowl even though it was a hair spicy for him as well.

I ordered the enchilada with beef and green sauce.  Came with the usual rice and beans.  Hubs got the same I think.  I'll say it again, best green sauce ever.  I devoured as much as I possibly could, but I do not have a second stomach, so the other half of it was coming home with me.

We've come back several times since, and each time is as good if not seemingly better than the last!
