Tacos El Gordo is a frequent stop for me. Incredible tacos at a terrific price. Probably the best tacos in town though there are a few others I'd say are in contention. Nevertheless, Gordo is the one I frequent the most. The tacos are largely prepared like your average street taco (/w onions and cilantro) and salsa. However, the meat is always well cooked and very flavorful. They have great options, my personal favorites being the Buche, Adobada /w pinapple, and it becomes a toss up between Tripa or Lengua. If you're starving, go for some Adobada fries; a large plate of French fries loaded with the slow roasted adobabda seasoned pork, cheese, guacamole, a bit of sour cream and salsa.
