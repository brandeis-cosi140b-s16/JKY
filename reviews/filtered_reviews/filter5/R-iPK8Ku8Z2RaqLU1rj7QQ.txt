My in laws, from New Mexico, love this place.
Seeing how it is focused on "New Mexican" cuisine, I think that alone says alot.

Quite frankly, I liked the food better than most "Mexican" or local restaurants here in Las Cruces - which says something as well.
I had the Rio Grande Enchiladas with carne adobada - smothered in queso fundido - it was awesome!

No one at the table had a complaint, we had nothing but compliments for the food.  

Also, interesting and encouraging side note - the waitress said when she was hired, part of the training was to have the wait staff try ALL dishes on the menu.  Seems like common sense, but not having worked in the industry (unless you count Taco Bell and a sub shop in high school) it seems that many wait staff in many restaurants display an ignorance of the menu that really leaves the customer scratching their head.
