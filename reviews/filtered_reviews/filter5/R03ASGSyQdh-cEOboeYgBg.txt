Hand's down my favorite "Mexican" restaurant in Charlotte...but be sure to make a reservation as it is always crazy packed.

The guacamole is a must-have, as well as the sangria or one of the multiple flavors of margaritas. I've tried quite a few items on the menu (chopped salad, tortilla soup, enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos, and fajitas) and all are out of this world (multiple vegetarian options are also available). As I said, we frequent this restaurant.

Cantina has great happy hour specials if you're sitting at the bar between 4-7pm during the week. And the patio is a good place to hang out with friends in the spring/fall. The servers are always friendly and on top of their sections. Only downside is that you have to be careful where you park. They're sticklers for towing where signs are posted - highly recommend you use the valet.

And before you leave, be sure to get the Tres Leches cake. You won't regret it.
