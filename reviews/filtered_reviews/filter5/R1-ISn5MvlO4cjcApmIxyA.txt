A real dive of a restaurant with some top tier quality food. Has a good combo platter that includes 4 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink if you are hungry or you can load up the tacos as you go.

For $1.50 per taco and $2.25 per specialty taco it is a decent value as they really load up on the meat. Of their regular tacos their Asada is damn tasty and their specialty taco offer a wide variety of flavorings.

Great place, right across from the university, very easy to miss as they are in a tiny corner of a strip mall that can't be easily seen from the road.
