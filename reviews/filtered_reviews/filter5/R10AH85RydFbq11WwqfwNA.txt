I have always driven past this place, and wanted to give it a try. Last night I was finally able to try this place, and I can't say enough good things about this place!

The decorations and atmosphere of the restaurant seems very authentic. As we walked in, we were greeted by two beautiful smiles. We were seated within 10 minutes. It was quite crowded for a Sunday night. 

I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and sangria. My husband had the beef tongue tacos. They give you as much chips and dips as you want, and our order also came with a delicious tomato noodle soup. 

All of the food was delicious: Zapata's food is one of the best Mexican foods I have had. Whenever I get the munchies for Mexican food, I know where to come from now on.

Excellent service, and great food and drinks. Definitely would like to come back for my birthday celebration dinner!
