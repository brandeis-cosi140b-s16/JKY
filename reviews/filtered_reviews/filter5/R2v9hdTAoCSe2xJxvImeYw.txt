Hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas! I had a chicken taco, a carnitas taco, and a pastor taco. All of these were arguably the best street tacos I've ever had! The salsa bar is not just loaded with amazing fresh salsas, limes, and radish like you would expect, but it also has fried jalapenos in two different types of hot beans which really allows you to make a meal of a few tacos. Don't forget about their burritos, salads, and the Mexican corn! Oh god the Mexican corn!
