Went there last night with my grandparents (who are EXTREMELY picky about where they eat) and they absolutely loved it!
The costumer service was awesome and we were helped the second we walked through the door, seated immediately, and got our food very soon after ordering. The food was phenomenal as well and I was very pleased with how flavorful my grilled chicken breast was.
