Yo Rita is one of the coolest, most creative restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The food is unique, well prepared and informally presented.  The food and bar menu is always changing, and I haven't been disappointed with anything I've had there.  Try the escolar taco, the absinthe martini, or the shrimp ceviche.  Atmosphere is informal, but in no way divey.  Probably one of my top five favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.
