I am a student at UofI and I've been going to Maize since forever. I'm a regular and most of the time I order the taco Mexican with pork. Their taco is best eat fresh. Also the guacamole is really fresh and tasty. Also try the fried quesadilla. I believe their marinated pork is the best among all meat, but that could be a personal choice. Anyways, Maize is a cheap, fast but most importantly tasty Mexican restaurant.
