Oh my god. This restaurant blew me away from every single detail. The service was personal and impeccable, even asking us if we had any food allergies prior to ordering. We shared the guacamole which was undeniably the creamiest and most delicious I've had. It was bursting with fresh cilantro and those creamy California avocados. The tortillas were obviously homemade, crispy and salty. So so very good. 

My boyfriend ordered the 2 dollar happy hour Barbacoa tacos, (spelling? Sorry, I don't eat meat), and he, who is consistently a very neutral person, was drooling over these. He loved it so much, he ordered another one. You must stop here when passing through the shops at Cesar's!
