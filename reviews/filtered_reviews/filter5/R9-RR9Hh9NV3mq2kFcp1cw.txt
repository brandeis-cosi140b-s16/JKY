Wow! I usually save my 5 star ratings for the truly special
 Restaurants that have it all. Well I don't know is  Bandito had it all but it sure did the nite we ate here!!

We started with a tasting and education on the menu from a very nice worker at the counter. She let us try 6 items but after the second one I was sold!
I ended up doing The 2 combo platter. With emerald chicken and red jade chicken. I choose to have them made into quesadilla. 

We sat down and had to take our photo with the giant panda. Then sat down and a few moments later our food came. Perfect! I also ordered my food with jerk fried rice which also had peices of chicken in it. 
 
I was blown away experience. I totally loved the emerald chicken in a quesadilla.  Possibly the best quesadilla I have ever had. The emerald chicken was just so tasty.   The red jade chicken was also good as a quesadilla but I think It might be better alone with rice.  The red jade is like orange chicken but with a kick!

Overall this is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phx, I will for sure come back and I will try even more!!!!!  I can't believe I've been in Phx most of my life and it took me so long to enjoy this restaurant.
