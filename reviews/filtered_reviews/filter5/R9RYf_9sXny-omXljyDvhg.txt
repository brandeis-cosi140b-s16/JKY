5 stars for the salted dulce de leche shake here. Probably one of the many reasons I will never see a six pack on my body, but I'm okay with that. Seriously, the sweet and salty combo of this shake soothes my soul. 

The burgers not bad either. Although I wouldn't be upset if an in n out were to move into Arcadia.
