Blanco is absolutely amazing every single time I go there, which is often. I have yet to order anything that wasn't delicious. Their guac is awesome, nacho appetizer with pulled pork, cheese crisp with avacado and pulled pork, and for the tacos you have to get the crispy shrimp, carne asada, and award winning bbq. Anything! Oh and their street corn is delicious too! Definitely a favorite place of mine, 5 stars for Modern Mexican food in the Scottsdale area.
