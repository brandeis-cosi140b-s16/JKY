Seriously AMAZING views of the city! For that alone I would continue coming here!
But in addition to that you also get tasty food and very friendly service. While I was there last time there was an amazing Mariachi band that was so charming and fun!
The staff at this location are really nice and are always great about accommodating us when we have large parties or special occasions. 
On busy night you may have to park down the street and walk to the restaurant but that is just a testament to how popular and great this place is!
