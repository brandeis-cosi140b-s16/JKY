EASILY, THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD ON THE STRIP!

Overall one of my favorite restaurants in vegas, everything is amazing, EVERYTHING, tacos, taquitos, micheladas, margaritas, great beer selection,  The food is a little pricey but it's well worth it.  I recommend just eating at the bar area and enjoying the view of the strip.  Love this place!!  Start off with a Modelo Especial michelada and order anything off of the menu and you'll start the day/night off right!!   Portions are a little small so if you're a fat slob that just wants a ton of food, you might not want to eat here.
