We loved Joyride for several reasons.  First, the service was prompt and attentive.  There seemed to be more people waiting on our table than most restaurants.  The attitude of everyone working there was great.  We were greeted by all employees with a smile and everyone said good bye.  This is a reflection of outstanding training and management.

The food was fantastic.  Our party of seven each ordered something different.  Explanations and recommendations by the server were appreciated.  The food arrived promptly and was fresh, hot, and tasty.

The next time we visit Phoenix, this restaurant will be on our list of places to eat.  Kuddos, Joyride!!  :)
