Got seated immediately for a table of two. The servers we had were very nice and friendly. The fries we got as an appetizer were huge!!! My tacos were delicious. Boyfriend's burrito was gigantic and he loved the tender pork! I loved the variety of tacos on the menu and the boyfriend was very impressed with their choices of Tequila. His drink was really strong. Some bang for your buck!! My horchata was absolute perfection. Will definitely be coming again with more people!!
