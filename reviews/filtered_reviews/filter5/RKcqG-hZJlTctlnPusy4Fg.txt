I am frequently at Crescent due to the awesome lineup of bands rolling through town but just recently I tried their tacos. OMG. Just thinking about the fish or vegetarian tacos makes me hungry. 

The ballroom is my favorite venue to see bands in PHX. If a band is scheduled at the marquee I get so sad. Its just such a crappy venue compared to the wonderful crescent. Whether it is a HUGE sold out show or a free local band, any night at the Crescent is a good night. I just wish people would stop getting up in the front of the dance floor and just hangout on their phones the whole time I MEAN COME ON! Respect the band and dance your ass off if you are going to be in front! Or I might just have to punch your phone out of your hands ;)

Anyways get the tacos. You won't regret it.
