This place is legendary.  If you're feeling brave, definitely check it out.  If you aren't, find someone who is, and have them take you.  The mix of Chinese, Mexican, and Jamaican go together better than you could hope!

My standard course of action was to get the jerk friend rice, black beans, a Sweet and Sour chicken quesadilla, and then some random item for fun.

So if you head out, make sure you try a Sweet and Sour chicken quesadilla, and say hi to the owners, if you get a chance.  They are super nice folks, and have some fun stories to tell ;)
