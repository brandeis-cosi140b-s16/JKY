Yes, 2 dollars/street taco is a little steep. But it's still cheaper than most food places on the Strip.

I ordered 2 carne asada and 2 spicy pork tacos. then i went back and ordered 2 more spicy pork tacos.  If I were to go back I'd order 6 spicy pork tacos.

Maybe I've been on the East Coast for too long but after the first bite of the spicy pork taco I felt like weeping for joy.
