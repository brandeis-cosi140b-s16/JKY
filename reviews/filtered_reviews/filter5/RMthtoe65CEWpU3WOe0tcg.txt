I was asked to go here for lunch about 4 years ago by a co-worker.  I was sorta skeptical from the get go as I can be a little picky when it comes to latino/mexican cuisine.  My initial reaction when I ordered a burrito was...pretty good.   The really awesome part was the decor and really super friendly staff.  They really seemed genuine to thank you for your business

The second time I went I ordered thier fish tacos (minus the onion).  OMG!  Wow.  Almost perfectly made tacos.  Nice Chunky pieces of fish, and the lime is the extra mwah for these!.  The sauce that's included is in perfect proportion, although I must say some days are better than others (too much vs too little)

Now that I'm a fan...Fish Taco Friday at my work place with Two Hippies is the way to go!
