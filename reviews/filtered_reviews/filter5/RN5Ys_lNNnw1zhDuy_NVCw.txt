This is the first time I've been to this place, I've passed it up multiple times for other bars but regret it now after I tried their food.. Seriously get the protein bowl and the smashed potatoes.. So good. The staff is nice I asked them to change the channel to a specific game, it was done in seconds.. Try it out!!
