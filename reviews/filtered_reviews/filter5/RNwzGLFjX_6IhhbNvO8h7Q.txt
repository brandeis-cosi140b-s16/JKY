Today was my second dining experience at this best-kept secret in my neighborhood.  I was raised on Mexican food and Sombrero's is the real deal:  Authentic. Mexican. Street-Style Servings.  The proteins (chicken, beef, pork) are slow cooked in their chile sauces--oh muh goodness, People...  First-timers: I recommend the 5 Street Tacos, this way you can sample most of their proteins & chile flavors (5 small tacos = really filling). It's a small, super casual joint with bright, colorful walls.  They have 10-15 small tables, a salsa bar, and a simple, straightforward menu.  Fantastic service as well: really nice, patient employees/owners.  Only recommendation is that they label their salsa's (mild, hot, etc) on the salsa bar.
