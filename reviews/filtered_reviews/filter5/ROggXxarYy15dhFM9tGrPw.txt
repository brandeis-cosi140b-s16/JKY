Dining with Style.

Wow; what a treat!  Arriving in Pittsburgh, I was told I couldn't leave without trying some Mexican food from Mad Mex, and I'm glad I did.

The restaurant is planned out amazingly well.  I'm told each location shares the same theme, but are decorated individually.  When the weather is nice they'll open up the large garage style doors that make up the front of the restaurant; which allows for the feeling that you're enjoying the outdoors while not needing to be exposed, that in mind they do have outdoor seating for those who wish to enjoy the weather fully.

They have a wide range of alcoholic beverages, but you have to try a flavored Margarita.  They have six of so to choose from, and you have have them froze or unfrozen.  It was warm enough day that the frozen ones were perfect for the situation.  Be careful though; they make'm strong ;)

The food was scrumptious and not overly priced.  Obviously with it's Mexican background the food is Mexican, but they are accommodating to requests  The burritos are huge and topped with the Mad Mex logo when it arrives at the table.  It appears they pay special attention to the finer details which allows their patrons to enjoy their amazing food, environment, and well attentive staff.

So; I'll say to you - You can't leave Pittsburgh without trying Mad Mex ;)
