My new favorite spot. Thanks Yelp! We ordered the molcajete  with diablo sauce - be warned! it really is spicy. Not called diablo for nothing. The flavor was still there and I love spicy, but next time I'll try the tomatillo. Bit too painful for me. ( I ordered a horchata to try and help numb my swollen tongue)
I really love the side of beans,salad and rice. Beans are perfectly seasoned, salad is tangy and refreshing, and the rice has texture. Not the pink puffy rice with minimal flavor that is served at so many mexican restaurants.
They also have strong margaritas and huge mugs of draft beer.

Just seeing the pictures makes me want to go there now!
