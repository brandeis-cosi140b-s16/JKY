Clean, classy atmosphere and super friendly staff. I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to Spring Valley. Got the deluxe carne asada fries to start, and they were delicious! The fries were crisp, which I find rare for carne asada fries and the flavor was out of this world. 

I got a chile verde burrito and my fiancé got a red chile burrito, wet red. Both burritos were huge, like Chipotle-sized. The chile verde had great flavor and the perfect amount of spice. The red was almost too spicy (my fiancé doused it in sour cream), but the meat was delicious. We also tried all 3 salsas, green, mild, and hot. All were AWESOME. This place is a major threat to our diet plans, as I'm sure we'll be back for more.
