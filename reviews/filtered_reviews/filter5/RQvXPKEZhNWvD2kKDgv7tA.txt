THIS PLACE IS NOT CLOSED. It has been reopened as of the end of April under its new name, Restaurant Atoyac Estilo Oaxaca. Buen Provecho! (This place has the best horchata in the state.) the food is fantastic, true quality Mexican food. The place may seem underwhelming from the outside, but the food blows you away.
