I love this place! Excellent, fresh food and friendly service--one of my favorite lunch destinations.

First, finding this place was a bit tricky the first time I went. It's in the middle of a strip mall and has a very small sign that says "Taqueria" rather than "Mexican Grill". Thankfully, I ended up in the right place, because I love the food. I walked in and found the place to be rather crowded. It's a small place with only a few tables. If they keep making food this good, they're going to have to figure out something for a bigger space, in my opinion. But of course, the disco ball is an essential element!

There are a number of options: burritos, street tacos, open burritos, tostadas, etc. Once you pick generally what you're ordering, you pick the ingredients that will go on top of or inside whatever you're ordering. I've had the open burrito both times I've gone, and I've been really happy with the results.

The red chili chicken and chicken tinga are both tasty. They have them pre-prepared when you arrive, but they heat them up on the skillet. You can choose rice, beans, cheese, sauce, and a variety of toppings like cilantro, pico, etc. The guacamole is pretty solid, although I never like how expensive guacamole is priced as a side at restaurants (side complaint). And as far as the tortilla options go, you can choose a bunch of different types: corn, corn/flour mix, flour, wheat, and they're all good. The open burrito comes with tortilla or chips, if you so desire.

After all that, there's a salsa bar with limited, but excellent, options. The spice level is excellent, and the flavor is as well.

The service is very friendly. They're happy to help you through your order, and they even checked on me as I ate my food, even though there aren't really "servers" in the restaurant.

I'l be back many times in the future, because I love the setup of this place, and the food is delicious!
