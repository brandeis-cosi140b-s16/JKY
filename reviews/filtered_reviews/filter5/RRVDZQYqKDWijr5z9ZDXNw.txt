Mad Mex, you can do no wrong.  I'm not sure if it's the Big Azz Margaritas or the tofu sour cream that makes me want to cry more.  Asides for the wait, I've never had a bad experience here.

I'm a bit of a picky eater at times, but love this place because they let me mix and match my soft tacos.  Usually end up getting one chicken, one steak, one ground beef with all the fixings, albeit variations of the traditional.  I opt for the soy cheese and tofu sour cream.  Gotta have me a piece of the blue cornbread as well.  Not sure what they do with it, but that ooey-gooey part is what I crave.  I'm sure people look at me and think 'what a pig' because of all the food I have in front of me.  If the shoe fits, I'm a pig.  Nothing wrong with chowing down on some of the best Mexican food I've ever had the chance to explore.

Two suggestions for y'all:

1. Opt for your margaritas on the rocks.  The frozen ones do one hell of a job on you when you get brain freeze.

2.  Pay attention to the indicators for the bathroom.  Don't be a goof like me and go into the wrong bathroom on multiply occasions....I still don't think I can get that one right.
