When I first heard about this, Korean and Mexican Fusion, my first thought was "wha?!" with just a hint of skepticism (just a hint).

BUT, since I considered myself open-minded and I'm easily swayed by many, MANY good reviews from friends and yelpers, I became more excited to try this place. I mean, come on - bulgogi in a burrito with kimchi? That sounds pretty tasty! Besides, I love Seoul Food. =)

KoMex isn't too big, but luckily they had a booth that accommodated me and my 5 other friends. There were 3 guys and 3 gals. The guys and myself each ordered a burrito, while the girls ordered tacos. We also ordered some fried wontons (4 for a buck!)

I was clearly very hungry and thought I might be able to finish my food. I didn't stand a chance. I ate about 2/3 of the burrito, a couple of chips and guac, a wonton and waved a white flag. 

The wontons are ok, but for a $1, definitely not disappointed. The burrito was SO GOOD! There was a good amount of meat and if you get kimchi (which I suggest you do if you like it), the burrito is just HUGE! I want to say it was the size of my forearm. Considering I'm petite in the sense that I'm short with short limbs, I think that's a pretty accurate description.

Everyone left stuffed and happy. If you are in the area and want to try some off the strip joints, you should stop on by.
