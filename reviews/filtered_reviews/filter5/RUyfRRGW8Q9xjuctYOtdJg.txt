LOVE Leticia's! My husband and I have been going since shortly after they opened. Best mexican restaurant I've been too 

Sometimes we get the chicken fajitas which are good, but different with zucchini and mushrooms. 

I usually get the shrimp tacos ensenada style. Shrimp fried with a flour tortilla.

Most of the time our order is correct but every now and then when we have the older man as our waiter who never seems to get our order right. We keep coming back because the food is good and we've been going for a while.
