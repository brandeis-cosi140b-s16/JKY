My friends and I ate here for lunch today because I saw an ad for them in the paper and I read such great reviews online. I read one bad review & because of that, I wanted to see for myself because I LOVE good Mexican food!  (The bad review said,  "All the great reviews must be fake because the place looked nothing like the pictures.") The place looked exactly like them to me. ("The service was horrible.") Our service was excellent! Our waiter was great, the manager was great and the chef even came out and checked on us twice! He even gave us a free dessert! ("The food wasn't good.") Our food was delicious! I had carne asada street tacos, my friends had shrimp tacos and enchiladas. We were all very pleased with our meals. I'm very happy I found this place and will be returning often. I'm guessing the bad reviewer probably works at a competing restaurant nearby!
