Everything is amazing here! My Favorite dishes were their Queso Fundido with Chorizo served with warm flour tortillas, and their Ribeye was excellent. They have a wide selection of ceviches with different flavors and variations. We ordered sangrias, very strong. For desert we had beignets with chocolate sauce.
