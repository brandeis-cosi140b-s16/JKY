Old Town Tortilla Factory is a fabulous find in old town Scottsdale.  You begin your meal with delicious homemade flavored tortillas. The food is just as delicious as their tortillas. I had the build your own tacos and it came with 3 types of meat, beans, rice,  lettuce and pico. The meat was cooked to perfection. The outdoor patio is perfect for a night out with friends,  a date or even a large group of people.   The staff are very friendly.
