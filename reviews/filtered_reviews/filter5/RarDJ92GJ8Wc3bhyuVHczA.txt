Came here on a Sunday afternoon, it was pack. Had the michelada while we waited to be seated. Michelada was delicious. Not too long of a wait. Live music. Seafood was fresh and delicious. Def try the pina mixta. Omg my mouth is watering thinking about it. Go to spot if u ever out in vegas and want authentic Mexican seafood
