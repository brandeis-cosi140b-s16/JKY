Great local place. I love the shakes (too much)! A great alternative for in n out  if you want to support local biz or want to stay in the Arcadia central area. The drive thru is always fast and the staff is always friendly.

My only gripe is the ac is always FREEZING which deters me from ever wanting to eat inside.
