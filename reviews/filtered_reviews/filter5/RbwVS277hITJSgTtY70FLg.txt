Holy cow. This place is real life. Clean, petite and the smell of that grill..It's all great. The steak is fresh. The food is made to order. The employees are attentive. The horchata is heaven liquified. Here are some pics I took but there was much more food not seen. I didn't want to take any pictures. I wanted to eat what I was smelling but that would have been selfish of me...so..Go here. Just for a cherry on top. The salsa bar we gorgeous. Everything fresh. The process is genius...you order upfront, you get your salsa and sit your hungry ass Down and wait for your food to be ready...once it is and you have eaten it whole you may go back to the front and tell that magically chef to whip up some more tacos and you pay when you have reached food coma...also to add creditably to this I am half Mexican/Spanish. It was a taste of childhood. Authentic.
