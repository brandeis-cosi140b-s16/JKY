My boyfriend and I visited Macayo's for dinner and we both where impressed by our waiter. (I wish I remembered his name) He was on top of everything despite it being a very busy friday night rush. He brought us waters right away and was very attentive throughout our meal. The food was delicious, I had the chimichanga and my boyfriend had a shrimp burrito. The shrimp burrito is not on the menu but our waiter said he would make it happen. We where very satisfied with our experience and will for sure be back!
