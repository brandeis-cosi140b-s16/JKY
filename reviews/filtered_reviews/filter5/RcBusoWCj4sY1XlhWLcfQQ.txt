I have been to the Rokerij on several occasions. We had a marketing retreat there a few years back and booked the private room (which is a great size - seats 12-15 people comfortably) and is fully equipped with a flat screen and computer for presentations and what-not. I had a friend book the room for a bachelorette party (I wouldn't necessarily have a "party" here... but it's certainly a great private space for small groups).

The second time I went, I sat in the main dining space, it was so-so. A little dark for my mood (it was the middle of the afternoon - I just came for lunch) and wasn't feeling the darkness dungeony vibe.

The third time I went, I found that little spot in my heart that was longing for a happy hour space such as this. The downstairs bar is by far one of my most favorite spaces. Thebar stools - large and squishy - perfect for your bum. The fireplace - awesomely lit - and oddly no warmth comes from it? There must be some crazy ventilation - I don't care how but I love it. There are a couple of large circular booths - very private - in the downstairs bar area as well - perfect size for about 4-5 adults. 

They have a superb selection of seafood - and everyone around me ordered it. From Sunday to Tues. I believe they have 1/2 priced bottles of wine, we asked the bartender for some reccomendations and he gave us a couple of samples. We ordered a very nice red from Carmel Valley - it was amazing. Coupled with the chicken tacos (quite a kick to them - disctinct horse radish nose tingle...but great spice) and onion rings (more of the gourmet variety - not too greasy at all with very unique sauces) and we had ourselves quite the happy hour.... err actually happy 4 hours... 

That's what happens when you go into a bar with no windows!!! You lose track of time...inhibitions out the window... it becomes a black hole with food and wine and friends... it just sucks you in to this vortex of happiness. Rokerij you are my new drug!
