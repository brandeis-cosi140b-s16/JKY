I saw 450 plus reviews and almost 5 star rating. Well here is another 5 star. The menu is a little overwhelming at first. So I tried the Cabo Shrimp taco. Amazing. Then the smoked marlin taco. More amazing. Then the tinc a chicken taco. OMG. The salsa bar is extensive all made from scratch. I tried six of them and they were all terrific.  The salsa peanut and salsa strawberry really stood out.
