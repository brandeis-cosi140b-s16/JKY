I love this place. Great food and great service every time I come. Drinks keep coming when they become empty and I love the 3 salsa they serve right when you sit down.  I love the chicken zuchinni it's a personal fav and the rice and steamed veggies are delicious as a side. Veggies aren't over cooked and they aren't smothered in grease.
