I've only been here once with my girlfriend (aka my future wife), but it was hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. The adodaba (spicy pork) tacos were amazing, but what really surprised me were the fries that had both adobada and carne asada and some amazing sauces whose name escape me, but all I know is they were the best fries I've ever had. I will be coming back as often as possible.
