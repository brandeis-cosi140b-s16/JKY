The best street taco's i've had.  As authentic and cheap as it gets...

If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty.

Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your "street tacos" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL.
