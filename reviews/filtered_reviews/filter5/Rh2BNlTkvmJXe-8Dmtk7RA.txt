Believe the hype!!!! Meat is so juicy the green sauce get EXTRA of that bomb!  the spicy pork is so good I've tried taco y taco & some were saying it's pretty much the same NO! It sure isn't el Gordo is thee best from taste, favor && hey it ain't open late for no reason. I live in Cali & the husband I go to gardena it's called the " taco truck" & we love that place we believe el Gordo tops that place. So try it real good !
