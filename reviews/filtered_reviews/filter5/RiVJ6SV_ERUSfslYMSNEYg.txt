Cheap prices...friendly service...good food.

Went here with a group of 7 people and we were accommodated quickly.  Tables were combined, orders were quickly taken and they even separated the bill 7 ways.  For a grab your own seat and order at counter type place they did not have to do all that but they went out of their way for us.

Ordered guacamole and chips with salsa for appetizers.  Salsa was to thin for my taste but the chips and guacamole were excellent.  For main dish ordered the blacked chicken quesadilla, ground beef taco and blacken chicken taco with black beans as a side.  Everything was good and tasted fresh.  

Open kitchen is a nice touch.
