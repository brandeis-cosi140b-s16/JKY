Rafael, the manager, was amazing! We were walking to Carson's kitchen and saw this quaint restaurant. Rafael was standing outside and heard us talking about possibly looking at the menu. His warm personality enticed us to take a look at the menu. As we were looking we inquired about Carson's kitchen. He did say it was good but they didn't have many options, so we decided to stay. No sooner had we sat down and gotten water did he bring us out flautas to try and appreciate our business. He gave us the VIP treatment and we ended up giving him the option to order for us! Everything was delicious. We were all satisfied and felt very taken care of! As I am writing this he had dessert sent out for us. There is nothing better than feeling like you're taken care of and appreciated in a town that you've never been.
