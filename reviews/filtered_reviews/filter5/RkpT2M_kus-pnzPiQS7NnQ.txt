I am coming back here. Went with a friend who is a huge fan of Mexican foods of all kinds. We were both impressed with the food and service. The guac was great, the almond horchata was a pleasantly refreshing surprise, and the Garden Variety burrito was the best veggie burrito I have ever had. My friend was happy with her street tacos as well. The service at the Gilbert location was wonderful as well. We were immediately brought chips, salsa, and water, and our server was pleasant and very accommodating. Her recommendations were spot on.
