Joyride was like dying and going to taco heaven! 

Tried their braised beef and carne asada tacos and they were amazing!! I love that you get a side if you order three tacos. I also tried their watermelon margarita which also was pretty tasty. 

The ambiance was nice. Candle at the table was a nice touch. Very modern feel to it. 

Server was super friendly and helpful in the ordering process for us first time goers. I definitely will be back!
