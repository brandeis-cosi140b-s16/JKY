Now THAT's how you do a margarita!  Strong and tasty!!  These people know their stuff!

The food was great too!  We both had a form of enchiladas and an app of the chips with 3 salsa dips.  SO good!

Friendly service, and so prompt!  They know people have 7pm shows to get to!  And they got us out and tipsy and on our way to Phantom!  

Also, we had a $100 gift certificate as a wedding present to use here...and we tried to splurge and STILL didn't go over $100.  This is a great stop while your in Vegas to save cash and have a good meal (and drink!).
