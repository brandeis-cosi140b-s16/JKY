I was tipped off about this place for their fish tacos and salsa bar. I was expecting a divey taco joint but was pleasantly surprised with their old-world style decor: wooden floors and tables, heavy metal chairs, Mexican-inspired art, hand-made pottery plates with their name painted on, and the wooden bar all added a cool vibe to the place, albeit small. 
Space is very limited and most of their tables accommodate 2 persons. We watched several couples who walked in after us, get seated before us as we were waiting for two tables to open up in order to be able to seat our party of four. 
A basket of chips was brought over immediately and you can then go up to their salsa bar and sample as many as you like. The variety is amazing and it's fun to try so many different types ranging from very spicy to slightly sweet. 
The menu looks good all around. Tacos, burrito-bowls, tortas which they call lortas, etc. You can order a la carte or as a meal with rice and beans. We opted for the tacos and I tried the vegan, the veggie, and the dogfish shark. I ordered three expecting them to be really small, but I was only able to finish about two! All three were delicious and fresh tasting. Can't wait to go back and sample a few other menu items!
Service was polite, and prompt. I love that they leave a bottle of water on your table for you so we never had to wait for more refills.
