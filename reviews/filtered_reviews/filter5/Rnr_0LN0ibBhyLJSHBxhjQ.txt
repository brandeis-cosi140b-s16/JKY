Wow what an awesome meal. I had the chicken cognac and my husband had the rib eye with cognac. Very delicious!!! The meat was tender on the steak. The chips and salsa were accompanied by beans and fideo. The fideo was so good, very soup like, and very delicious. The main thing I would want to express is the attention to detail, especially the service was 10 stars. the staff all works together and they are on point. We never had to worry about our glasses being empty. The same thing with the chips and salsa and bean dip those never were empty. This place deserves all the stars asked then some. You will not be disappointed coming here to eat.
