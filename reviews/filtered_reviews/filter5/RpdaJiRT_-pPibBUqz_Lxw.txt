LOVE this place!! It's right on Scottsdale Rd so it is really easy to find. 3 hour parking is all up and down the streets around it too so that is not an issue. Great place to go sit outside on a nice day and have a Corona or Pacifico with some chips & salsa. They have a good happy hour and the atmosphere is fun and summery. Their food is delicious. They have the best Mahi Mahi tacos I have ever had. When I am craving fish tacos, I go directly to Loco! I have taken many friends and family here after talking it up and all agree that the fish tacos are amazing. I have also hear the Lobster tacos are great, but have never tried them so I will have to do this. Loco Patron is great for lunch, dinner, happy hour, a place to watch a game, etc. One of my faves.
