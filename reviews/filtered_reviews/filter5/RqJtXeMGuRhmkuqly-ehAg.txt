Believe the hype!

We've been wanted to eat here for a while, but often our plans are last minute and this place is always packed.  We were lucky early last Saturday night and scored a table outside.  It wasn't too cold yet and they had heaters set up.  I love the guacamole - they start with a base and then have a list of items to mix in, sort of like you find at ice cream shops.  We tried blue cheese and mango.  While it was good, the blue cheese was a bit strong for the guac, but that's really our fault for selecting it.  I definitely want to try new combinations.  We had a Poke which is raw (sushi) tuna with delicious lime foam on crispy rice crackers.  A couple of the rice crackers had stuck together and were a tad oily, but it didn't detract from the dish.  At the recommendation of our server we had Korean Beef Tacos.  All I can say is Yum!  The Neville Island Ice Tea was a nice twist on the drinks and I also had a seasonal pumpkin margarita.  While it was good, there wasn't much pumpkin flavor.  

Pittsburgh needs more places like this.  Great food, great atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  I can't wait to bring some out of town visitors so they can taste the new Pittsburgh restaurant scene.    Taking in to account atmosphere, quality, and price, this could be the best restaurant in the city.

If there is a downside, its only that the food is so good its always packed.  Be sure to make reservations.
