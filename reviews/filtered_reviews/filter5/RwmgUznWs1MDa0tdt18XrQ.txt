Awesome food! The chef and the staff are beyond generous and hospitable! While every white person in my family ordered variations of the burrito, I went left and ordered carne asada tacos. Perfect size, nice spice, and the ingredients were as fresh as possible! Everyone in my party enjoyed the location and decor. Shout outs to Frank and his mom who takes pics every five minutes.

If you want great food, grab a shot and some flautas here!
