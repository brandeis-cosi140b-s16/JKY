We visited this restaurant on 8/16. 
They had a good happy hour. The drinks were tasty. They had an amazing selection of beer. Their staff was nice. You can get your tacos as nachos. Genius! The corn salad, queso & beer, puerco verde tacos, steak salad and the tortilla soup were all legit! Did i mention they make all their tortillas fresh! The music and the atmosphere was seriously a lot of fun. Great vibe. Everyone was dancing on the patio while inside the restaurant it was not too loud and the ambiance was nice so you could enjoy your dinner and have conversation too. We had a great time. No wonder Imperial Tacos & Beer won Best of Las Vegas for Best Underground Night Spot!
