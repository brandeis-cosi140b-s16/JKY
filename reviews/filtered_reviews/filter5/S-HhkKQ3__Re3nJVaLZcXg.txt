Adobado.  That's the only word you need to remember.

After a loooong night at XS,  we were too hungry to even think about sleep.  Generally, we'd hit up Earl's, Grand Lux, Ellis Island, or any other 24/7 places around the strip.  This time around, a friend from UNLV told us we gotta try this tacos place out.  There was no way I could've refused since tacos are one of my favorites and we figured... gotta trust the locals!

After a short drive, and it really is a short drive from Wynn properties, we were there and it was still packed at 5am.  Two lines, one for adobado and one for everything else.  The reason there's a line for the adobado is that the spicy pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit, just like how it would be in Mexico!  The pork is shaved directly onto fresh warm tortilla, then they add all the toppings for the tacos: lime green cream sauce, salsa, onions & cilantro.

The spicy pork has a ton of flavor and the cream sauce just works so well with the salsa and the pork.  Oh!  Also, if you look closely you'll see a chunk of pineapple at the top of the vertical spit.  You can actually request to have pina in your taco!  Definitely wouldn't have known if it wasn't for our friend and that sweet warm pineapple in the taco was definitely what makes this taco one of the best I've ever had! 

We also shared some carne asada fries.  I've lived in San Diego for a few years and I have yet to find carne asada fries comparable to the ones I've had in SD.  Tacos El Gordo's fries do come close though!  Fries are covered with carne asada, shredded cheese, and the same lime green sauce with a few dollops of guac!  Heavy, yes, but very much needed after 6+ hours at XS :P

So glad my first Mexican food experience in Vegas was such a legit one.  El Gordo is now a must.  Affordable and tasty, can't get better than that!
