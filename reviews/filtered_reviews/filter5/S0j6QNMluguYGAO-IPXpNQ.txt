I can't even.  This place is so good.  The salsas are unique and tasty so check out the salsa bar.  My husband ordered a cactus burrito- devoured it.  He's a vegetarian and had lots of good choices!

But the big wow for me was the corn quesadillas.  I know it sounds a little unassuming but order one.  Really.  I ordered the black mole chicken quesadilla and thought I was the luckiest girl in the world when it arrived.  My husband was seriously jealous-  so much so that he immediately got up and ordered the vegetarian quesadilla... Remember that he just inhaled a burrito....  his was just as incredible as mine.  

We're now trying to figure out how many more times we can get here before we fly out Sunday.
