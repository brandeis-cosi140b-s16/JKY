The story is as good as the food itself. 

I'm going out on a limb here and saying this place deserves 5 stars just on the nachos alone. I know the signature dish is the puerco pibil, this will have to wait till my next visit. I was pleasantly surprised to have fresh spinach and blue cheese on my nachos platter. The cheese tasted like it was gourmet home made cheese. I like the story how authentic Mexican dishes with French influence plays a roll in the dishes served. Keep in mind this was what they served at the Phoenix Airport location. I really need to stop by the downtown location. My only complaint if I had one was the price being a little on the high side. $40 for two beers and a nachos plate. Honestly, you get what you pay for here though. I would totally do it again!

Great job Barrio Cafe!!!
