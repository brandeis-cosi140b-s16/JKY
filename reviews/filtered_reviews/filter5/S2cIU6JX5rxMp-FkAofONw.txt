I go to Cafe Rio alone, with my entire family, with friends, with visitors, or just the baby and I.  No one is ever disappointed with their food.  The beef, chicken, and pork are all superior to any other fast-service and most sit-down Mexican restaurants.  My personal favorite has to be the pork,  Pork salad, pork tacos, pork burrito, heck I'd even eat that pork all alone on a paper plate.  IT"S THAT GOOD!  It's sweet, tender and tasty.  When accompanied by Rio's fresh tortilla's (made right there in front of you) it's as close to perfect as you get.  However, you HAVE to leave room for the tres leches...it is deliciously drenched in that sweet milk concoction that tres leches is famous for.
