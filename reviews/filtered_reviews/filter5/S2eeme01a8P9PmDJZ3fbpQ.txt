Very friendly, terrific greeting! On a side note, restaurants should really pay attention to the host or hostess that gives us first impressions. They win big in this department. Server was great and really knew the menu, they offer gluten free options as well. Dinner was terrific. Every dish tasty, hot and great. 
As we walked out the hostess thanked us for our business and sounded sincere. The restaurant was packed and every moving part was 5 stars.
