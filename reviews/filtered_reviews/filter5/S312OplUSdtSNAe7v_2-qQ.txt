This place is legit. If you want real Mexican street tacos then this will be the right choice for you. Caution to those who can't handle spicy food... The meat here is definitely not for the faint hearted!!! Your mouth will be on fire. Tell them it's your first time and they will let you try all the meats before making your selection--- highly recommended!!
