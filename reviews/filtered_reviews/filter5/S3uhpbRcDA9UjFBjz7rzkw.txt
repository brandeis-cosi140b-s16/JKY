Not only is Mi Amigo's located inside the same esplanade/plaza as my all-time favourite AMC theatres, but Mi Amigo's makes fast food seem like it takes forever.

We got here right at noon. There was apparently a conference going on in Phoenix the same day because there were people everywhere wearing badges from different universities from all over the world. This place was PACKED. I could tell that the staff was not expecting this rush because they only had 3 servers and 1 bus boy and every table and chair in the house was taken.

We were told we would have to wait 5 minutes for a table, but 30 seconds later we were walked right in. As I mentioned, the place was PACKED and every single one of the servers had a glow about them from running around like crazy. They were HUSTLIN' and they did an impeccable job. 

Because there were only about 3 servers on staff this day, each server was responsible for one third of the restaurant (and it is HUGE). Each of them was helping the other out; I saw them running one another's food, and clearing plates regardless of whose section it was.

Our food arrived moments after we ordered it, and despite the fact that the restaurant was slammed, everyone was very pleasant. They made sure to smile in between their sprints to and from the kitchen.

It was a wonderful experience dining at Mi Amigo's and we actually ended up going twice over the weekend because we enjoyed it so much.

This place deserves mad props. It's quick, it's cheap (we paid $15 for 3 people's lunch) and it most definitely hits the spot.
