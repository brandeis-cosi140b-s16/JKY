My wife introduced me to this place when we first started dating, she worked here when she was in high school and bragged how great it was.  I was immediately obsessed, margaritas are my drinks of choice and the Frusions taste amazing and pack a punch as well. As far as the appetizers I enjoy the Tejas trio and the tostada bites . When it comes to entrees go you can't go wrong with the Jerk Salad, my wife taught me to substitute the Chicken with Ahi. She also got me hooked on the fajitas as well, I'm a chicken guy but the steak ones are tasty as well.

We stopped here on Sunday with my wife's family and my best friend, "Bubba" waited on us and was super attentive and accommodating.  We were very impressed with his personalized service.

I'm a little disappointed to hear that the one in south coast plaza closed but despite the new ownership, it's still one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm in Arizona.
