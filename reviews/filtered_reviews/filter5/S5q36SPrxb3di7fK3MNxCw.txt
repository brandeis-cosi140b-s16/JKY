OK!

Here's the skinny. These are my favorite tacos in town. They provide you with two corn tortillas and your choice of meat and from there you have the ability to select toppings from the topping bar including: habenero sauce, red sauce, green sauce, an avacado sauce, pico de gayo, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lime.  The meat changes daily and typical consists of ribeye, chicken, beef, chili pork or chorizo. 

There really isn't anywhere to eat, but you can always pop a squat on one of the many door stoops right there on Atwood Street. I've done it many times without any complaints so far. Just watch out for broken glass on the street!
