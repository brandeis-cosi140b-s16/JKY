Revisited for dinner and had a fabulous evening.  Our server (I believe his name was Mark???) was spot on.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous, and never let any of our drinks go empty.  I truly appreciate good service like this, which is what my last visit was severly lacking.

The food was spectacular....everything we had, from the margaritas to the octopus nigiri.  I love their selection of delicious foods offered and will continue to revisit this great restaurant.
