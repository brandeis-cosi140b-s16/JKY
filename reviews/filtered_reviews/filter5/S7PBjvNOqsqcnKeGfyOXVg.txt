BEST mexican food in the valley. Beans are the BEST. Enchilada's &amp; Tacos are the BEST. Pollo Fundido is very very tasty. I usually stick to my usual routine: the "Muchas Cosas" plate: cheese enchilada, folded taco (i always get beef), bean tostada, beans, rice &amp; a flower tortilla. You can't beat it. I LOVE this place. My only complaint, not really a complaint, just a preference, is that I love the FLAVOR of the salsa, but prefer chunkier salsa w/ fresh cilantro. But the salsa they have is GREAT in folded tacos. The chips are good, but i prefer thicker chips, but again, thats just a preference.

They are ALWAYS busy, so get there early (or wait til later to go). They have a take-out window if your in a hurry. Don't even worry about the neighborhood. We just moved near south Phoenix from Chandler, and its fine. The ambiance inside is awesome and the hostess is very friendly. 

You just can't go wrong here. A++++ food!
