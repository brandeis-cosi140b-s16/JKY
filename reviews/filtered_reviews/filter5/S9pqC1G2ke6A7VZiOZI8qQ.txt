Great drinks, friendly staff, creative food (I am talkin' Lobster Floutas for God's Sake These people are not fooling around here)what the devil else do you people want? Good prices you say? Well here you go, you have found your place!And lets talk happy Hour for a second shall we. I had more than a Touch Of The Creature and my bill was so low, I was sure either they had made a mistake, or my vision was so blurry I was reading my tab wrong. I asked (hey I am an honest kind of Cat) they assured me it was correct. In short get out to this place and enjoy the great food, drink and staff! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
