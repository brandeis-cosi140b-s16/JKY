We ate there twice this week and it was great. Breakfast special was 2 eggs  meat and home fries with tortillas for $4.95. Dinner was chicken enchiladas with rice and beans for $11 with a free mohito. Both were fantastic. I don't understand why the place was empty as it was the best deal on the strip.
