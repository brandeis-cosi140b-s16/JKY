After reading several outstanding reviews about this place I decided to offer it as a suggestion to spend an office get-together for a combination birthday/administrative professional's day.  I am so very glad that I did.  I am already a huge fan of Mexican food and the place just blew me away.
From the moment you enter, the atmosphere is incredible.  The walls surrounding the kitchen are made of this special salt stone that seem to be back-lit and the other decor was impressive.  The menus have real leather covers and the food sounded delicious.
We ordered the corn and guacamole as our appetizers and when combined with the chips and salsa, was pure heaven.  Each had a bit of spice to it, but I was not at all uncomfortable.
Each of us tried the tacos and none of us were disappointed.  The shrimp tacos were absolutely divine.
For desert we tried the fried bananas and the pumpkin bread pudding and some French Press coffee with cream.  I have not had such a fully satisfying experience in a long time.  If you are looking for a wonderful and delicious experience I would definitely recommend this place.
