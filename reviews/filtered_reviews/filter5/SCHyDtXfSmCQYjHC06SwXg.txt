We recently celebrated my Dad's 75th birthday at Lenero and we had the best experience ever. The staff went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care of (thank you Stacie) But the food made the night, every bite of everything we ordered (Lamb, Lentils, Kale salad, fajitas) was exceptional. This will for sure be a restaurant that we will go to very frequent.
