I've never met a chile relleno I didn't like, and the one at Taqueria Canonita was especially creative and interesting.  The vegetarian entrees at most Mexican restaurants can be dull, but not here.  

My boyfriend and I ordered the chile relleno, served with roasted vegetables and jicama salad, and the wild mushroom enchiladas served with borracho beans and rice.  The chile relleno was stuffed with a mixture of dried fruit, almonds, and cheese, and the contrast between sweet and savory was a party in my mouth.  The salad was light and the orange dressing was a refreshing surprise.  The enchiladas were drenched with a velvety poblano sauce, and combined with the mushrooms, the enchiladas just slid down my throat.  The borracho beans were a smoky kidney beans with a hint of chili powder.  Oh, and don't skip the chips and fire roasted salsa; it's so good that you'll want to drink it straight from the bowl.

For dessert, we shared the Ancho Brownie, garnished with pepita ice cream.  This ancho infused brownie was ooey, gooey, and very fudgy. 

The ambiance is nice for people watching, and the restaurant's location next to the canal gives the illusion that you are dining outside.  It can be a bit noisy, but all in all, I'd eat here again.
