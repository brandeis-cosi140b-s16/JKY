My boyfriends parents suggested we all go here. We live a few blocks away n never heard of it but agreed to go. It was quick to get seated and the server was great. Food came out at a good time and everyone enjoyed their food. The chips were good, salsa just alright. I had the chicken flautas w rice and beans and it was freaking delicious!!! Seating and parking were a little cramped but not really an issue. Would definitely go back!
