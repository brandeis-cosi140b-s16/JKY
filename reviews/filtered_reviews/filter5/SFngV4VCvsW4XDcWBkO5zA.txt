I crave this place on a weekly basis because it is just so good!  It is the perfect place to grab a fulfilling and tasty dinner after shopping at the Biltmore or during, they have a takeout window!  

Two of my friends and I stopped in here around 5 pm after a long day of shopping for an early dinner.  We chose to sit outside and were seated at a low table with some couches.  The table had a cool mosaic design and the couch was a fun place to sit, although probably not the best place for a messy eater (I may or may not have spilled salsa on my shirt haha!).

The waitress brought warm tortilla chips and salsa which we absolutely loved (so much so that we got another basket and slightly spoiled our dinner!)  After looking at the menu for awhile we ordered.  I got the roasted chicken and poblano chile cheese crisp, one friend got the grilled fish tacos and the other got the green chile pork enchilada.

I had never had a cheese crisp before but it is certainly an interesting concept.  It reminds me of a Mexican pizza and had good flavor and a nice crunch to it.  I would definitely order it again but without the pico de gallo which kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and cheese.  The fish tacos looked a bit small and I did not try them but my friend enjoyed them.  The enchilada came out in a dish and looked almost like lasagna but the flavor was amazing.  The tacos and enchilada came with rice and beans and the rice had good flavor and a nice buttery texture.

Next time I go to the Biltmore I'll have to stop at this place or try one of their other locations.
