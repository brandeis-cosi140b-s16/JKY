Finally got to try this place! It's definitely the real deal. I went with the to-go option just because it was a long day and I wanted to head home, but they probably have around 30 seats in the place. The decor definitely takes most of its cues from the Korean side, and the feel is pretty casual overall.

Completely loved the pork fusion taco. Bold flavors all-around (make sure to squeeze lime), with the only drawback being that I didn't order two or more. The chicken fusion taco was pretty good but wasn't as flavorful for me. I want to give a re-do on the bulgogi fusion burrito because I ended up saving it for a late dinner and it might've lost its touch by then.

I'd love to go back soon, bring a friend, and try some fusion nachos or fries. Maybe a fusion chimichanga too, or the flautas that come with fusion guac (what's that?!)
