Great food, decent service, great atmosphere make this a great restaurant for lunch or dinner. Had the carne asada plate and it was great. The beef was grilled over a flame and it made the beef taste great. Soup was delicious and chips and salsa outstanding. A little pricey, but the quality makes it worth the price!
