Right when we walked In we were greeted immediately. We sat down and they brought over a pitcher of water and chips and salsa. 
Can I just say that finally I have found amazing, hot salsa...finally! We mixed the red and green salsas together, try it you will love it. I also got a margarita which was yummy and strong.
We ordered the chicken burrito and I ordered the number 3 combo but I didnt want a beef taco, I would rather have chicken. The server told me that they don't do substitutions but she would ask, I said no big deal, if they will do it then cool, if not then just order everything separate and put it on the same plate. 
The server came back and announced that they would do the substitution. Awesome! 
The food was good. Im not a fan of their beans but I was born and raised in new Mexico so I'm a little bit picky lol. 
All in all this is the best place I've been to in several months. Not only was the food good but the service is amazing! We will definitely be back!
