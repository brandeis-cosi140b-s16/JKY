I have been so excited for this place to open!  What a treat to have a surprise birthday party here last night! Drinks were amazing, food was delish, and service was EXCELLENT! Thank you, Kyle, for your patience with our (probably annoying and obnoxious) table! Get the STEAK (can't remember exact name) TACO. Yum!!!!
