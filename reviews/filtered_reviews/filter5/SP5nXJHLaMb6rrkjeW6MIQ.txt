Holy Burgers and fries! This place really hit the spot. We got in a bit after they opened and ordered. I got the beachhouse and homemade bbq chips. My burger was  delicious the grilled green chili and pico de gallo really complimented the burger. The homemade chips had some amazing bbq seasoning. By noon the restaurant was packed. I would absolutely love to come back here when I'm in Phoenix next!
