This is a really awesome fusion restaurant. The popcorn made with tajin and truffle oil is so worth it for the flavor combination. The chicken and Korean beef tacos are bomb.com. Our bartender/server was Erika, she was very informative and let us know about all of the ingredients and flavors in our choices!  Ps;get the popcorn
