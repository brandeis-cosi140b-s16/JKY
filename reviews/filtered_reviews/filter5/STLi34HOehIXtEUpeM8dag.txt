Great food that was worth waiting for! Long lines but tables continually becoming available so there was somewhere to sit. The chefs are fascinating to watch!
Don't go here for a romantic dinner as seating is mainly outside on the pavement - more of an eat and go place than somewhere to linger. However for great food at a great price this is hard to beat!
