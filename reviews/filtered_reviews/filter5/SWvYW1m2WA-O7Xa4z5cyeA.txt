Did not disappoint!!

First time having fried bread, "sope" style and it offered a different vehicle for the traditional toppings of a tostada- fried to order and as huge as it was, we ate everything-

The chimichanga offered the New Mexico flavors we were hoping for!! It came with a spice red sauce snd there homemade Hatch sauce- first time trying Hatch, and im in love !!
