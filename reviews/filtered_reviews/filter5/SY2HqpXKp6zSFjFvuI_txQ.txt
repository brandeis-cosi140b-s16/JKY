We flew in and arrived in around 2 and I had BG on my list of places.  We (wife and I). Since I am a professional chef and LCB Inatructor, love to get different things so we can sample as much as possible.  Well, so happens the Brunch menu is a nice menu tapas style.  Everything was fresh and VERY Good.  Of you like a texmex kind of thing you will love this.  Only thing, order several things from the start and as soon as you get the order - order some more keep it flowing.  Do this,great place.
