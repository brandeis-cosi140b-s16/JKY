A very unique experience. New favorite place to eat. 

My wife and I went here because we wanted to celebrate her graduation. Corrine was our server and had great recommendations for what we would want. She was so fast to take care of all of our needs and had a lot of great bussers filling water and drinks. Our drinks did not go even half full. 

I had the stacked shrimp enchiladas with red and green sauce and a fried egg on top. It was flavorful and smokey. 

My wife had the mini chimi and mushroom enchilada. She loved it and we we filled so we took some home. 

Chips and salsa were very flavorful. New favorite.
