Fantastic dinning experience, Michael and his staff provided a great  atmosphere and better dinning experience. Sat at the bar, great selection of micro brews.  My meal consisted of the Chilean Sea Bass, with a side of shrimp enchiladas. The bass was nicely blackened, the shrimp flavorful. Even the rice was above average.  I would recommend Blue Adobe to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere, friendly service, and favorable food.
