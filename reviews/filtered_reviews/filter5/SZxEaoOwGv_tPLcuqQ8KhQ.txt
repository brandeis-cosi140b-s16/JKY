So I dont live in Phoenix but I have family out here so I visit when I can and when I do I ALWAYS make sure I stop at Macayo's it is soooooo DELICIOUS! I love their Baja sauce - its like a cream cheese jalapeno juice concotion of blissfull deliciousness and this time I got the "California" burro which being from CA I thought would have Carne Asada and Fries but did not instead it was fillled with beans and guacamole sour cream cheese and pico on the side with an opt in of Chicken for a dollar more and it was so very good I would reccomend it highly!  Any time you are in the Phoenix area please make a stop to Macayo's it will certainly be worth it!!!
