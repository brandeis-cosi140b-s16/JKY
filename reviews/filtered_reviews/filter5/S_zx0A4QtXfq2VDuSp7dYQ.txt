This is probably some of the best fusion food i have ever had.

I will start by saying that i was skeptical at first about Korean and Mexican cuisine mingling together in one dish. It just seemed like an if-y kind of idea to me; but after my first bite into a chicken fusion burrito my mind was completely made up and my taste buds were in awe.

The chips are made by order so they are nice and fresh when they get to your table. (ASK FOR THE GUACAMOLE! IT'S INCREDIBLE)
I have enjoyed the spam mousabi, chicken fusion burrito, the chicken fusion tacos (my boyfriend and his friend absolutely love the fish and shrimp tacos).
 I am a complete fan of any fusion item on the menu. 
BUT....

I am not a fan of the Mexican burrito and the carne asada fries aren't that good either.
BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU!

the food is truly amazing as well as the owners and the people that work in there. the food is beyond reasonably priced and there is no reason why you shouldn't go there RIGHT NOW!
go go go!
