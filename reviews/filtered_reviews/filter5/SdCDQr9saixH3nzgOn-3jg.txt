I don't usually Yelp but thought it would be irresponsible not to tell others about this gem of a place. We came for dinner tonight with a large group. My friend had heard about it from a list of places that Anthony Bourdain recommends. Well it was outstanding. The red sangria, best I've ever had. I had the shrimp el diablo, I could drink the spicy red sauce. And also tried the special hanger steak, perfectly cooked. The place itself is adorable. Newly renovated apparently. The decor was modern yet warm. Jose was our server, what an absolute doll! The service was super friendly and extremely professional and attentive. Half our table was kids and they were so nice to them. Met the owner at the end. Such a cool, wonderful woman. Can't wait to eat here again next time I'm in Vegas!
