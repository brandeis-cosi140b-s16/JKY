I've been going here with my parents since I was a little kid, and it's always been great. The chips and salsa are so good... there have been times when I've ONLY eaten that instead of an actual meal! I like their quesadillas, enchiladas, and especially their fajitas - that's usually what I get now. Both the mixed and veggie fajita plates are good; I like them with black beans. They come with plenty of good tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, lime, lettuce, and pico de gallo if you ask for it. It may not be that fancy, but it's good authentic-tasting Mexican food and I like it a lot. One of my favorites for sit-down Mexican.
