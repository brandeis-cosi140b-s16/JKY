I was so impressed with our meals here! Our waitress (for dinner) and waiter (for breakfast the next day) were great, and the manager who was doing quality control was sooooo nice.  He came to check and make sure we were happy and ended up carrying a great conversation about their food and other Mexican places around the valley.  So great customer service for sure.  The food made it though, oh man we had a GREAT meal, the food was prepared so well, full of flavor, just perfect.  We ordered a lot, burgers, tacos, guac, elote, pancakes, tortillas, eggs, etc.  Everything was just awesome!! We will be back as often as we are on this side of town!!
