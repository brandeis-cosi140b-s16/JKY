Completely worth coming here, not only is the staff extremely friendly and knowledgable about every dish and the ingredients that go into making it, but it's truly phenomenal food. Prices are pretty on par with the food quality, anywhere from $12-$30 but I promise it's worth every penny. If drinks are your thing, the blood orange sangria and the casa-Rita are amazing. 

Tourist or local, this place is every bit the Mexican food experience that I was looking for. Fresh, authentic cuisine, delicious seafood, phenomenal atmosphere and presentation! Will be coming back for sure.
