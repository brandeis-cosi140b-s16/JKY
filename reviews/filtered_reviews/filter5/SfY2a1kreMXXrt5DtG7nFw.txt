Yes, it is sublime. Dined here a few times. Outstanding margaritas. 
The subtle touches one would experience say, sitting in a nice restaurant in Guadalajara, Mexico. Sliced radishes, real cotija cheese, mole, etc. 

Do yourself a favor while the evenings are nice, bring the special someone or family and dine on the patio. Highly recommend the Quesadillas Mexico City style to start off; nothing like it in town and positively delicious with a cold beer or margarita on the rocks.
