I would venture here a lot when I was younger and worked downtown. The wait is very long, be warned. We ordered ahead of time via phone call--so I would tell others to take advantage of that if that if they are pressed for time.

The food is good, savory, and hearty. Also spicy. Which is the bizniz.
