GREAT vegetarian option on the strip! The chile rellano is the BEST I've ever had! They also have a cucumber margarita that is so strong, yet easy to drink. The guacamole is hand made, and a very large portion. Three different salsas keep you in dip heaven. Excellent atmosphere right on the strip, great for people watching. Happy hour is a good deal with cheap salsa and tableside margaritas. Love this place!
