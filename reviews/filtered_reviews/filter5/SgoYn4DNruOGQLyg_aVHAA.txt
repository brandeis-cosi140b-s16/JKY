So after a long and crazy night on the strip. I woke up hungover. So naturally, my hangover cure is Mariscos. So I yelped a few places and Las Islitas was one of them. The mariscos here is fantastic. Very crowded but to me that's a good a thing. Didn't have to wait long at all considering we had a party of 8.  This place takes pride in there mariscos and its noticeable in there service and food. Everything was great here. With my budget hands I would have to say its kind of pricey but typical for outstanding mariscos. I'm not a local just visiting but I now know about this hidden gem. So next time I'm in Vegas I'll be paying this place a visit!
