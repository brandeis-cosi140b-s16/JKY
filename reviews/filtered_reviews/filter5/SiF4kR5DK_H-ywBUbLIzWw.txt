THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Hands down the BEST street tacos I have had - even better than some I have had in Mexico!! So authentic & so much flavor.  I order the Chicken and Steak - comes topped with Cilantros and Onions side of limes and cucumbers. 
They have all the Mexican sodas, the best Horchata, and the delicious salsas. 
Staff is very nice - and very quick! This place is always busy!
