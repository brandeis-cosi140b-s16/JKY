I love Mexican food and have tried almost every Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  Popo's hands down is the winner.  I have been here at least 20 times since we discovered it about a year ago.  Never have I had a bad meal or bad experience.  The portions are huge and the price is VERY reasonable.  The only down side is that there is always a wait during dinner hours, even on the week days.  I defiantly recommend everyone try this place out at least once.
