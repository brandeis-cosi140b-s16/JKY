Wow!  I was in Vegas for a conference at the Hilton and looking for a good place to eat because the casino food was horrible and expensive.  A friend recommended this place.  He also recommended the guacamole that was made at the table. Wow again, the guacamole was amazing!  There were 4 of us and we each had a different item for the main course, each one was delicious.  Can't wait to go back!  The margaritas aren't bad either.. :-)
