This place is absolutely amazing. We came here on a Sunday morning for brunch.  From the outside, it is very unassuming. As soon as we opened the door, we heard the sound of live music and were overtaken by the mouth-watering smells from the kitchen. The waiter was very friendly and helpful. 

We ordered the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was life-changing! Sooo rich and tasty, I would've ordered this is a meal by itself. YOU MUST ORDER THIS! For my meal, I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was a light and tasty dish made with black beans instead of pinto beans... yum! With my meal I had a mango mimosa, which was tasty and refreshing. Even though we were already full, the waiter highly recommended the flan and we just couldn't turn it down. The flan was creamy and delectable! It was served with strawberries and little crunchy chocolate pieces. I highly recommend it!

In addition to the food and live music, the other thing that I LOVED LOVED LOVED about this place was the artwork. The Day of the Dead artwork was absolutely breathtaking. I will definitely be coming back to this place the next time I visit Phoenix.
