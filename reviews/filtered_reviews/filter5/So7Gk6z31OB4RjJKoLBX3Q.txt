Not sure why so many people wrote that this is in a sketchy neighborhood unless they have never been outside of the suburbs. Just because a neighborhood is not all white does not mean it's bad. This great place is on a main road across from a church and near a senior apartment complex and a hospital. Seriously folks. Let's not be so judgy.  

Also, it is not crappy from the outside. In fact it is brightly painted, inviting, and has a patio with lights strung over it. Inside is decorated just as beautifully, with colorful paintings, lush greenery, and cozy tables. We happened to stop by on a Friday night and were entertained by a mariachi band. It did mean that it was a little loud at times, but everyone in the restaurant seemed to be having a great time. It was family oriented--several groups with kids--as well as couples on date nights. 

The food was excellent. Shrimp ceviche -- incredible. The waitress recommended molcajete caliente (cheesy hotpot with fish, shrimp, chicken, carne asada, and octopus). It came with beans, rice, tortillas, and a little salad. Yum yum. Chips were a little greasier than we would like but were free and came with two good salsas. If we lived in Phoenix, we would be regulars!
