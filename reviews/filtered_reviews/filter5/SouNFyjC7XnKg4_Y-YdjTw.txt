Love this place!  Great food, great service, only negative is it is a little overpriced but you pay for what you get.  I have taken a couple of dates here & all went really well.  Also took my parents here when they visited & they loved the place!  Very good southwestern flavored food.  The outdoor seating is awesome, huge waterfall & fireplace during winter.  Inside there is a bar & a dining lounge.  The bar is typically full of neighborhood regulars.  The place has a unique batcave theme, you can make it out when you look around.  The menu is a newspaper which is original & unique.  Definitely recommend this place to any friends wanting to eat a southwestern style meal.
