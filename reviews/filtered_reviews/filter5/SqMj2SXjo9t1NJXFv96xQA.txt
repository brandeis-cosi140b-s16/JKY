For an Asian girl who doesn't eat much Mexican food, someone has to explain to me why I love this place so much.

Is it authentic? Traditional and genuine Mexican cuisine? I have no idea. 

All I do know is:

- I'm so distracted by eating here that I haven't take one picture of my food. Whoa. Serious. 

- Big menu. I love lots of choices, even vegetarian items. Bonus!

- They make a lot of their items from scratch, including their guacamole and re-fried beans. Yummy!

- Location. I get to eat in peace while I watch my boys play in the tree house. Yes, both kids, my toddler and my boyfriend.

- They bring the food to you. I'm sure we've sat at a very far table to see an eye on my son. But they spotted the order number stick thingamabob every time...and fast!

So Pinches has my vote. Their food is what I look forward to when we decide on visiting the park. The chips and guacamole are usually gone by the time my boys come back from the tree house.
