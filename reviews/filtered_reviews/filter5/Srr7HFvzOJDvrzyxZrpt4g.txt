This is NOT a Tex-Mex place so if that is what you are looking for you will not find it here.

This is Authentic food from the Puebla region and this is a HIDDEN GEM which needs to NOT be a secret.

I want to see this place packed every day as the food is the most authentic place.  Look at the pictures & menu, you will NOT see burritos because that is tex-mex, not real Mexican.  

This is my first visit here and the food is AMAZING.  I had the Chanclas which was authentic and awesome and we had the Taco Arabe, both filling and both authentic.

The chips and salsa they serve is some of the best I have had in a long time.  

This place sits in the corner of this shopping center near Office Depot and a place EVERYONE needs to visit if you want real authentic food.  If you don't come here you are missing out and this place will remain my secret and it will be your loss.

I would love to see more reviews from visits....
