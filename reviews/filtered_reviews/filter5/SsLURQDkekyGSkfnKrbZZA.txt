First time at this restaurant and it was a hit. I loved my shrimp cocktail and my husband had the bandera burrito. We also had Horchata and I gotta say its one of the best horchatas I ever had. It's a small restaurant but well worth trying. I will be back soon to try a new thing on there menu. By the way the portions are pretty big.   that's always a plus.
