It was hard to find El Dorado Cantina at first. The sign is there in plain view, but it's attached to the Sapphire Nightclub/strip bar, so at first we missed it. Circle back around by Circus Circus, and yes, there it is, the Cantina's front door is next to the Sapphire front door. It was noon-ish on a Sunday so you could see the guys in the black suits at the door were relaxing before it got busy. 
However, walking into the El Dorado you forget for just a moment that there is a wall separating you from the Sapphire and you are greeted by a pleasant hostess who takes you to one of the many large booths surrounding the circumference of the room, with a few high tops in the middle. There is a large bar with star shaped lanterns above illuminating the wide assortment of liquors and beers. The red rose "wallpaper" and old, rustic mirrors lends a Mexican Bordello theme. 
The waiter brings you a generous amount of tortilla chops and 3 salsas, verde, roja and a yummy orange-habanero that packs an after punch. 
The regular margarita we orders was nice, I asked for less agave and it was just right. 
We ordered street tacos (carne asada) (it comes 3 to a plate with rice and beans), pozole soup and a chicken bowl (marinated chicken with brown rice, black beans, lettuce, pick de gallo and guac). Everything was super good! I'll definitely be returning. Total bill for 3 food items and 2 margaritas was $68 and change. 
What I found most impressive was all the meats, dairy and veggies are GMO free and organic/range free. What a great thing in a city that thrives on gaming, boozing, and strip clubs (luckily there's one right next door).
