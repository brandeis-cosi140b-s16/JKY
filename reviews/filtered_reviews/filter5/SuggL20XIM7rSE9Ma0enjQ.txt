Incredible authentic tacos. Incredibly fresh and homemade ingredients. Their calamari and blackened tacos keep me coming back week after week. Also, very friendly service. I showed up 10 minutes after their posted closing time on a Sunday and they fired up the grill again to make me some take-out tacos.
