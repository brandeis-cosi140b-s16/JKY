What an unbelievable over all experience!  My sister visited me and my girlfriend from out of town and we took her to this nice restaurant here at the MGM.  It is way in the back by the CBS Experience.  From the moment I made the reservation to the time we walked to check in the staff was on top of that VEGAS customer service game!  Very pleasant to work with and appreciative of us dining at their establishment.  The food was very delightful and the home made guacomole was incrediable and it was a bit spicy but the kind lady came back and did some magic to it and toned down the spice for us.  I live in Vegas and now quality service and great food and this is one that I will go to on a frequent basis.  GREAT JOB DIEGO!
