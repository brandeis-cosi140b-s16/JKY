Seriously, as good as it gets!  We've been going to Popo's for well over 15 years and I cannot think of one bad experience, ever.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  The service is fast!  I can take an hour lunch break and still make it back on time.  The food is hot, fresh, and amazingly goof.  Hands down one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the Phoenix area.
