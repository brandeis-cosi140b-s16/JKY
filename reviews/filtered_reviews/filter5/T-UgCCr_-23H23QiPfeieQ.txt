If you're looking for some authentic Mexican food, Tacos el Gordo is the place to go!

The ordering system is a little confusing, since you have to get in line based off which kind of meat you want. Once you get to the front, you place your order and you get your food right then and there. 

Every time I've come to this place, the lines have always been extremely long, which is the only downside to this place. But the taste of the food makes up for it. The carne asada is cooked to perfection, and the adobada is delicious and one of a kind. I've seen many people get frustrated by the lines and the lack of open tables, but I am definitely willing to wait for the smoky nomz-ness that is Tacos el Gordo. The cooks are definitely working at their fastest, not to mention it's super hot in the kitchen and in Vegas in general, so appreciate their efforts and you might get some pineapples to go with your tacos~ The price of Tacos el Gordo is unbeatable too! $2 for one perfect taco? Down. :3
