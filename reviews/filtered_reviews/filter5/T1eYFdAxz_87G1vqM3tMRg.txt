It was pretty dead because it was fight night. The service was friendly and fast. We tried the specials and they were very tasty. I also adored the calamari taco wrapped in lettuce. Oh my it was good!!!. Hubby really enjoyed pork belly taco and pork belly on a stick. He is stuck in a pork belly rut. Nice flavors. We will be back.
