As I've said before, I don't particularly like to write reviews of a place after only one visit, but it's also not every day that you stumble across one of the top 5 or so things you've ever eaten. I was driving around the area of town near Tortas el Guero, looking for Mexican food, when I caught the "Tortas" out of the corner of my eye. I pulled into the parking lot and decided to try it out based on the positive Yelp reviews.

Well, let's just say that those positive reviews and scores were dead on. They mainly offer tortas topped with several different varieties of meat; I opted for the pastor. Every aspect of the sandwich, including the small order of French fries that came on the side, was excellent. The meat was flavorful and tender, the bread was the perfect consistently and did not become mushy, and each half of the sandwich had a hearty slice of avocado on top. They also had a thick, creamy avocado sauce that had a surprising amount of spice to it; I opted to douse it over my sandwich to compliment the mayo and add a little extra bite. There were several other salsas and grilled onions that all looked excellent, but I didn't get a chance to try them this time (well I had the chance I just forgot to get the onions). At $7.99 for a sandwich, I didn't find it to be particularly inexpensive, but the size and quality of the food is certainly worth the asking price. The also offer a mini for $4.99 for smaller appetites and a super for $12.99, which I presume feeds two people. I should also add that the staff, who I took to be the owners, were very friendly and answered my questions with a smile. I would easily give this place a top recommendation and encourage any fan of tortas, or just delicious food in general, to try it out.
