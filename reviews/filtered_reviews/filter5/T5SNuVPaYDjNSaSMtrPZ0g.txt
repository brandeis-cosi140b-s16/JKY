I love their carne asada burrito con todos! The con todos makes it super creamy. The flavor is just amazing. I've been a big fan of their food since early 2000s. One of my coworkers introduced me to this place one day when I asked him where I can get a delicious burrito. The size of the burrito seems to have gotten smaller. I used to have trouble finishing it. But still, I think they are one of the best in town. I recommend using a generous amount of their green (verde) sauce.  I could probably use half a bottle on my burrito. So if they run out, you can blame me. I also like their shrimp & fish ceviche tostadas. There are other locations in town but I feel like this original location is the best.
