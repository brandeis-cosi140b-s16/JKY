We enjoyed our meal and I don't understand why the reviews are so low. 

My mother in law, husband, son and I went last Sunday evening. We only had to wait about 15 minutes (5 shorter than we were quoted). The ladies had aguas frescas - both the cucumber-lime and pineapple-ginger were yummy. My husband also had a beer from the bar while we waited. They quickly served the drinks without issue.

On to the meal: started with the guac as well as salsa with chips. Delicious flavors. Yes, you have to pay for the chips and salsa...but they were very tasty and not too expensive. Honestly we saved more room for the meal without excessive free chips. We then shared the fish and shrimp tacos (4 each order), sides of rice and beans and Mac n cheese, & queso fondito w/ shortribs. Everything was tasty, served timely and at a good temperature. The shrimp tacos and Mac and cheese were the stand out heroes of the meal. We had a few leftovers that were devoured a home within 24 hours.

Finally, the service: I know we're not the easiest table given the feisty 1 year old. I take him out if he fusses, but while eating he is still a handful. Our service was wonderful. They were timely with food, drinks and the check, and dealt with our son nicely.

We will be back - really - already have plans for this week :-)
