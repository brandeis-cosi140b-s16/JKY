Our favorite place to stop in Charlotte -- we always order the guacomole, Sabor Magaritas and the arepas. The latter are absolutely delicious and Sabor offers a variety of interesting accompanying salsas. We've found that 1 arepa is good per adult if you're on a road trip. Definitely worth checking out; we've been back a few times now and never been disappointed.
