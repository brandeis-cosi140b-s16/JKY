The thing I love about this place is that there are so many options with room for modification. I will admit that I'm a picky eater and this restaurant is always willing to modify it's dishes to fit my needs. The staff is great and for the prices these dishes go for, the value can't be beat.  Appetizers like the Salsa, Pico De Gallo, and Beans are always there right after you sit down and ordering is an easy process because the servers are always very knowledgeable about the food on the menu.   There's also a guitar player who plays tunes for the customers and happily takes requests from the audience.  Every time I go there though I want to tune his guitar cause it's waaaaaaaay out of tune haha... maybe it's supposed to be that way I'm not sure.  Kidding aside, it's always nice to hear a song or two while we eat.  Service and food are both exemplary here and definitely recommend Casa Don Juan to everyone.  Two words: Chile Rellenos... 'nuf sed!
