Z how much do I love thee? Let me count the ways... This is not your everyday Mexican food restaurant, they put their own extremely delicous spin on it.  Always good service and more often then not some real eye candy servers too =P Their Margarita's are the best in the valley, very tasty and strong! Well worth the price.  The complimentary corn bread is good but the butter it comes with is the best part, so sweet and delicious, definitely elevates the cornbread.  Shrimp tostada bites, best appetizer ever invented! Some days I just get these as my main meal so I do not have to share.  This is a must on the list when we bring newbies.  Every main dish I've ever had at Z has been great, love the Tortilla Soup, love their Salads, their Trout and Salmon are always so tasty, they do rice and beans perfectly.  I'd have to say where Z really shines though is their weekend brunch.  First you've got the bloody mary bar with all the fixings.  Then brunch comes with cornbread and delicious fresh baked muffins, a delicious sorbet & fruit palette cleanser and the main dish is always so scrumptious.  My favorites are the barbacoa enchiladas, the breakfast enchiladas and the chile quilles.  Sooooooo much food for an extremely reasonable price.  This is why I hit up Z's at least once or twice a month. Love it!
