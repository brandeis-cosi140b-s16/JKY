A hole-in-the-wall on Calle 16, best known for an entirely different class of south-of-the-border fare at Barrio Cafe, Mariscos Playa Hermosa does Mexican-style seafood better than anyone in the Valley. Each meal starts with not only the customary chips and salsa, but an outstanding complimentary ceviche tostada. Favorites include Seven Seas Soup, Camarones Culichi, and of course their ceviche, which comes in several varieties. Most dishes come with beans and rice, but these are not the typical refried pintos and tomato-heavy rice typical of Mexican restaurants. Lovers of scorch-your-mouth spices should try the guacamole, which is heavy on the jalapeno. Portions are huge and service is outstanding.
