We moved to Phoenix from Tucson almost 10 years ago, and had never found a Mexican restaurant we really liked. We have now, and this is it. We had their green corn tamales at a University of AZ sports event and liked them so much we went there the following night and ordered them again. They make their own chips, salsa and refried beans, and they're also excellent.
