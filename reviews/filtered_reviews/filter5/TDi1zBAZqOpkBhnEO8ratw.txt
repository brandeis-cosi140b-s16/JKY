Street tacos!!!! Margaritas!!! Get the Orange Beso Margarita and the street tacos. I get 3 tacos with no beans and rice. So far my favorite tacos are the spicy chicken and the Poblano Chili tacos. I tried the shrimp one. It was kind of bland compared to the other two. Husband had the go-Normous Cobb salad and really liked it.
