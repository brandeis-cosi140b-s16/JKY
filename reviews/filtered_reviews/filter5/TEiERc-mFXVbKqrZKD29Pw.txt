Our favorite local restaurant! Roy at the bar makes you feel welcomed, remembers your drinks, and always happy to recommend a dish based on your preferences or dietary needs.

Jacob is always there. Attentive, friendly, knowledgable and anticipates your needs! The food is always delicious! Try the enchilada with the sunny side egg-beyond words!!! Taco Tuesday? Taco Thursday is amazing!!! 

We always recommend EP to all our friends and usually have another family with us at least once a week! Great service and tonight with Jacob was no different! I can't say enough about this place! Come join us and challenge us at Buzztime trivia. Loser buys next round?
