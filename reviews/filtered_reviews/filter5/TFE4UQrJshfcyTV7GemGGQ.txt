A great little taco spot hidden in Phoenix. The pastor tacos have a nice hit of spice, which contrasts well with the sweetness of the pineapple. Prices are reasonable. This place is seriously small, we went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was empty, though I can see La Santisima filling up quickly during the evening. Our waitress was reserved, but not rude.

It's not in the best neighborhood, which is kind of sad, because there's an elementary school across the street, but I feel like the best eateries are usually in someplace sketchy. Often, you must venture outside your comfort zone to experience the sublime.

Also, I neglected to try the salsa bar, I was so memorized by the pastor tacos. I'll definitely return on my next trip to PHX.
