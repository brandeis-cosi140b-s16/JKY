I'm not normally a huge fan of Mexican food but Abuelas Tacos hit the spot!  Definitely order the tacos, we had the fish and shrimp combos. The shrimp was slightly breaded and the fish was battered. The taco itself was homemade and was thicker but had a light, crispy taste to it.  Even the beans and rice were well seasoned.  Try the shrimp soup too,  it was a red stock, very yummy.  Don't forget to check in for free churros! They were hella big!
