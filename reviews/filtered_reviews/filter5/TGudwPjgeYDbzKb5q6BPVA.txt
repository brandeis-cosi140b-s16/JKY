So authentic!!! It is extremely tasty!! My brother in law brought us here Sunday night quick everything was made right in front of us! Even totillas so that was a plus for sure.  I'm from California n was missing our taco trucks. This is definitely the spot if you're visiting Las Vegas n want some real Mexican food!!
