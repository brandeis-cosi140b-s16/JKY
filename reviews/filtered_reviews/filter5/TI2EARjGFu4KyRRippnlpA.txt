This is our go to sit down mexican restaurant, sorry it's not Lindo Michoacan. 

They have so many different things on their menu along with daily specials.

I really enjoy their CHICKEN TACOS, so delicious, the shell is so crispy. I love the carnitas, probably the best I've ever had.Try anything with their spicy habanero, a couple drops will have your mouth on fire. I've tried the enchiladas which I know is a fave here, to me they are just ok. 

The service here is great. I want to give this place 5 stars because I want people to keep coming here and don't want this place to close, ever!
