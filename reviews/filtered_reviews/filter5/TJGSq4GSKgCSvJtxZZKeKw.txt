Delicious!! Highly recommend this place. The hubby and I filled our faces with chips and salsa/bean dip before our entree came. Chips tasted homemade. We had the two person fajitas chicken, steak & shrimp. It was so yummy. Tortillas were homemade and the rice/beans were tasty. We def will be coming back. Not only was the food delicious but the service was great.
