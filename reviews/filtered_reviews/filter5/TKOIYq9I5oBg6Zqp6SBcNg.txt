For a chain restaurant, this really is as good as it gets. We live in North Las Vegas and drive down every single week for Taco Tuesdays in the Cantina Bar. $1.25 tacos..and they are AMAZING! Every server we've met is just wonderfully helpful and sweet. The manager is very nice and eager to help if there's any problems. It's well worth the 20 min drive.
