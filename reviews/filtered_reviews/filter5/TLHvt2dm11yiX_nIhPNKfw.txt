Oh my! I think that this may be one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Everything about it was...dare I say...perfect? If you're driving down this end of Central Ave., you would never expect to have such fine Mexican cuisine. Let's just face it, it's not the best looking strip of road in Charlotte. If you've ever seen "Bridesmaids", and you remember the part when the ladies go eat at the scetchy mexican restaurant and they all get sick. Yeah, that's not this place! lol I had a deal through Yelp that I've been needing to use. $10 for $15. Great deal! When you sit down, you get these tortilla chips (like at every Mexican restaurant) but these are different! They have some kind of magical spices on them! I almost ate the whole basket, without salsa!!!! I ordered the camarones a la diabla. This is a dish I enjoy at most Mexican restaurants. Three Amigos does it the best. It arrived to my table steaming hot. It was so spicy (not overly spicy), which I loved. I also had a house margarita. It was huge! More than enough. Love this place! Great for lunch or dinner.
