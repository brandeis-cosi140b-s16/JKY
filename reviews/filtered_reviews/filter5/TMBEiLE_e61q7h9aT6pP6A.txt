If you never find another Mexican place in Charlotte, don't worry - you don't have to!

La Unica is fantastic.  Always fresh, quick, and delicious.  They immediately stock your table with two types of salsa (medium and hot!), limes and crispy wonderful chips.  Then you glance over the menu - I always get the tacos - and boom, best Mexican food ever.  They are located in a little strip mall, but just renovated the restaurant and it's gorgeous on the inside.  They made the space bigger, added more tables, and painted murals all over the walls.  I love this restaurant, and am so happy that we found it.  It's not the fanciest place, but it'll keep you coming back.
