I will admit first off that I did not try any of the food here.   

We were almost scared away from this place by the name, but I am sure glad we stopped in because I had the best tasting beverage I have ever had in my life here.  It was the Jalapeno Cucumber Margarita.  I had never heard of such a concoction before so just had to try it.  

After this I tried similar beverage at several other places but never found another that could compare.
