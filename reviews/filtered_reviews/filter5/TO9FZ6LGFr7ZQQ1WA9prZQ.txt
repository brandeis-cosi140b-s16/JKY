This is must try restaurant I guarantee once you try it you will go back. Since the restaurant opened I have been there at least 6 times. This this is my new favorite Mexican restaurant and once you try it it will be your too. You have to try the Fajitas and the Margaritas are amazing. The service at Juan's Flaming Fajitas is second to none! I highly recommend them give them a try.
