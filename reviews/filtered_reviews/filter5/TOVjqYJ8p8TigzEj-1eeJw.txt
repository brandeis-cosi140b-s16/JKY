The place has been cleaned up lately, which is nice, but the real draw are the fish taco's.  It's the only thing I get there.  They are so good i'm afraid anything else just couldn't compare.  Put some extra cilantro, a squeeze of lime, and some tapatio hot sauce on them and you won't be let down.  It's best to go there for lunch and get the tacoholic special
