I just...can't even express how fantastic this place is. It's quite hyped up in the downtown community and for good reason. The food is excellent, fresh and predictable. The salsas are amazing - it would be money well spent just to order the chips and guacamole with a side of those red and green salsas!! There has been more than one joke cracked about hiding a bottle in my purse to take home.

The atmosphere and service are fantastic - especially fun on flamenco nights. It's definitely a noisy place sometimes, and it's likely that there will be a wait to be seated on many nights. It's never been a bother, though, because the bar serves up an amazingly fresh margarita and none of the staff ever seem flustered.

My favorite thing to order is the carne asada burrito. The meat is packed with flavor and it's never tough, chewy or grisly. Always super tender and delicious. Gallo is a great place to enjoy with friends, family or a loved one!
