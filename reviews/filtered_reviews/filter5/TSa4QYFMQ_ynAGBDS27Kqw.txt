This was our first time to this place and we could not be more impressed! Our server Dyllan was a rock star making sure our experience was perfect. We tried the green chili tamale to start with our prickly pear and Acapulco margaritas. The prickly pear was a bit sweet for my taste but my husband LOVED it! I had a combo chili relleno and red chili beef soft taco EXCELLENT. Husband had the burrito enchilada style - also really great. Dyllan came over to offer spicier salsa and make sure everything was wonderful. We were pleasantly taken back  and will certainly be visiting again.
