Gorged on green Chile and machaca meat tacos, but the salsas were what made the meal.  The red salsa that came with chips was outstanding, hot but with a slowly increasing burn.  The salsa available from the dispensers by the soda machines was subtly different with more heat and a more acidic feel.  I love rat hole Mexican and this may be the best I've ever had.
