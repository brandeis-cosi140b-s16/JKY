I think that I have eaten at all the Michoacan locations through out the valley and the original Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn is by far the best. It is worth the drive. One of best Mexican restaurants in the city. I love their chips, beans, and salsa that they bring when you first sit down. It never fails that I finish every bit. The fresh guacamole that they make at the table is a must!! The taquitos are so fresh (they make their own home made tortillas). My husband got the whole fried talapia, and devoured every bit. Their super burrito is the biggest burrito I have ever seen, it is also delicious! We have been several times and never been disappointed.
