I went here with 2 friends las t night and I was very impressed. I loved the order lines that they had blessed on what type of meant you wanted for your tacos. Prices were also very good! They also have a full bar with 8 different beers I tap which is amazing for a beer lover like myself. I had the care asada tacos which were 2$ a piece. So delicious!!
