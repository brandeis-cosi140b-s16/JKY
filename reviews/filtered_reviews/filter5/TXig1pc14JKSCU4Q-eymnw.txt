One of the best meals I have had in Phoenix by far.  Amazing food, great service.  As a vegetarian, some of the higher-end Mexican restaurants leave something to be desired in terms of menu options. I have feel the best flavors are in the meat.  Not that case at all here.  The side veggies themselves were amazing on our fish.
