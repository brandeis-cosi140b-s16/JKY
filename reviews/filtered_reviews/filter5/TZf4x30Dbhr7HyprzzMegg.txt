If this isn't one of the best restaurant's in Vegas, I don't know what is. I've been here twice and wonder why I don't come once a week. The fajitas are to die for, and the street corn (while extremely rich) is possibly one of the best thing's I've ever put in my mouth. This place is slightly pricey, but worth every penny. Plus, it's got one of the best interior design of any restaurant in Vegas.
