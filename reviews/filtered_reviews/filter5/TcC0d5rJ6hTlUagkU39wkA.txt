Absolutely the best tacos I have ever had. Very quick service and the people are very nice. A ton of options and very spicy. There was a bit of a language barrier, but you can pay for the tacos inside if you only have a card and outside in cash. I had the potato taco and I went back for a second that night. The tortillas are soft and handmade and the toppings are fresh. Seriously, go there. $2 a taco cannot be beat for this quality of product.
