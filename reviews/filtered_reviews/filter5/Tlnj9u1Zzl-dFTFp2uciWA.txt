It is not hard to agree with the other reviewers - the food is just outstanding. The owner is very friendly, and happy to explain any of the menu items, and his descriptions are very welcome to hear, even while we were eating. I just returned from lunch with a co-worker, and we are ready to go back! I ordered a trio of tacos (carne asada, chorizo, pastor) and a bean and cheese burrito (made with queso fresco) because I love a good flour tortilla. I washed my food down with a Mexican Coke and a horchata garnished with melon and walnuts (NICE touch, and possibly the best horchata I've tasted).

My co-worker also had tacos, plus the 'molete' (SP?), basically a mini-chimi-looking fritter filled with chorizo and potato, and lightly covered with mole sauce and sour cream. His expression told me to order one next time we go. I'm very happy to find this place so close to work, and the prices are a bargain for the quality of food being served. I tried Tacos Atoyac based on the previous Yelp reviews, so thank you Yelpers for your convincing reviews - this place rocks!
