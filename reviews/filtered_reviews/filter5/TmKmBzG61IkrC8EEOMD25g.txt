Update:

A few of us just went to Escobar's again, and it was awsome!  However, the waiter was indifferent, but the food great.

These are my wishes for any restaurant:

1)  A good waitstaff.  Notice I didn't say GREAT...because I don't believe they exist anymore.  However, this was met.

2)  I want my water full.  I rarely order drinks at restaurants, but I do want my water to be kept full at all times.  This too was met.

3)  I want the food to be at least as good as I could make at home.  It's common sense, but I hate paying $20.00 for a plate of something that I could have made better for $5.00.

4)  I want to leave feeling that I got my money's worth.

I found all of these things at Escobars.  The food was great, I had NO complaints.

Mmmm...
