To preface this, I am a Texan. And I grew up eating at taquerias in the barrio in Houston. Since moving to Pittsburgh, I haven't been able to find good Mexican food. I almost gave up. Then I came across a review for Las Palmas. I drove over and first noticed that the grill was set up outside with six different kinds of meat and a huge salsa bar. The cook was heating corn tortillas by the dozen and the smell was unbelievable. Tried a couple different kinds and was blown away by everything. Awesome street style tacos in the Burgh! I'll be back with the compa√±eros.
