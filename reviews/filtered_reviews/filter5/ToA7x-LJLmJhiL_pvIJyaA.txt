Looking for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas?  Look no further!  Las Cazuelas is an amazing little restaurant located unobtrusively in a strip mall south and east of the Strip.  The proprietors are from Puebla, Mexico and most of the ingredients that go into their food are from there also.
 
Their menu is limited, but what they lack in number of selections they more than make up for in amazing flavors and smells.  It's not just the entrees, but the accompaniment of the homemade sauces that make this little gem of a restaurant remarkable.  Their mole is second to none.

I travel a lot for business, love real Mexican food and search out same at all my destinations.  I would put the food of Las Cazuelas against some of the best Mexican food I've tasted including all of southern California, a bastion of amazing authentic Mexican food experiences.
  
Note, the place is small and doesn't serve alcohol.  A shot or two of a nice plata tequila would complement their food nicely.  I wonder if they have a BYOB policy (forgot to ask).

I will be back...again and again.
