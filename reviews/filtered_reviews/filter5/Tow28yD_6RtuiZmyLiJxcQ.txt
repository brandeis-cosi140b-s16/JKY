ALWAYS GREAT!!!
Went there for just drinks and decided to eat too.  Bar is quick and convenient.  Leslie our server was as sharp as it gets.  She was quick with our delicious chips and salsa and kept them coming.  Everything was spot on.  Macayos is consistent and reasonably priced.  My wife tried their new Texas Margarita and loved it...yum!!! Another great time at Macayos!!!
