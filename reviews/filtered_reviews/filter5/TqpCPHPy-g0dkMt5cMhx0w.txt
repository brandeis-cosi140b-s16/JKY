My family loves Abuelo's! The guacamole is great, lunch specials are awesome, kids meals are perfect, service is always great, chips and salsa are yummy plus you can ask for the spicier salsa which is great, burritos are always good, flour enchilada is good, good margaritas and it's an upscale atmosphere.I am from Chandler so I've tried all mexican places and this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Chandler!
