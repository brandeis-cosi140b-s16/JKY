This is hands down one the best 'berto's restaurant. However they have nothing to do with the other 'berto's, sharing name only. This is the place that was featured in Diners, Drive Ins and Dives on Food Network..

Okay it is in a gas station though really, its super clean, OMG friendly and the food was awesome! They make this red salsa that I could have slathered all over the Mr's body and licked it off.. fresh, tasty and cheap.. whats not to love!

Had the California Burrito.. carna asada, guacamole, pico de gallo.. my mouth is watering thinking about that burrito! Also shared a cheese quesadilla which was all about the salsa dipping! I just wish that Guy Fieri was there, WOOF!

Roberto's in the Shell Gas Station is a hidden gem.. seriously, its awesome!
