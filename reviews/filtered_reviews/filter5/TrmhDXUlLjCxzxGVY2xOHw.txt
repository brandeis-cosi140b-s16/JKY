Ok first greet by the hostess great smile and since we were a party of two didn't want to wait for a table. Dinner rush.  So we sat at the bar.  The bartender was supper awesome sorry forgot his name but very helpful and recommended some nice drinks with our meal.  The drinks were on point and the tacos were bomb!  I must say tho they keep throwing the warm chips at salsa at me and I would have been full of of those!! Great spot! Great atmosphere 3 thumbs up if I had a third hand :)
