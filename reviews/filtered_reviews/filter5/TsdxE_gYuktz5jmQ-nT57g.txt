Went to El Hefe for the first time tonight. Meet a friend for Happy Hour and stayed longer than I expected, because I was having such a good time. Bartendress Taylor was super attentive. She highly recommended the Fried Avocado Taco. Tried it & loved it. Great alternative for vegetarians (or anybody else). Manager Sonny could not have been more customer service oriented. We bugged him to let us watch the Presidential Debate on one of the TV's at the bar. He worked it out and we watched the whole thing from the comfort of our bar stools.
