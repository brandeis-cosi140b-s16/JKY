My mexican family loves tacos. My mom makes tacos at home all the time and we have gone to at least 15 different taco places in Nevada.
I am SO sick of tacos and hate eating them...but..this place is the only exception. 
This place IS the best taco place in Nevada. 
These tacos are like no others. They are just so delicious.
The "El Pastor" tacos are to die for.  These are incredibly good. 
I usually get 3 El pastor tacos..they are a bit spicy and they come with creme yum yum m getting so hungry thinking about them.
I've had carne asada tacos..which are very good. The tacos de lengua (beef tongue) are sooo good too. These are my moms favorite. Dont be afraid to try it because it sounds strange. 
The tacos "de sesos" have to be my second favorite. Yummy these are my dad's favorite.
I love them all but just the el pastor tacos are worth going. 
They also have "aguas frescas" They have horchata which is delicious and i always get it and they have others..there is one drink that taste like oranges and creme which is super good too.
