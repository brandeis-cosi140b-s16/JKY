Okay this review is long overdue. This is my favorite restaurant of all time. I can't believe that I just found out about Abuelo's in November 2012. But I can tell you that I go there on a weekly basis to get my avocado enchiladas, papas and beans. Plus the chips and salsa are to die for. If you like hot ask the waiter or waitress to bring you the inferno sauce, it is the best but only available upon request. I have tried many other items on the menu and they are all awesome. My husband's favorite is the stuffed chicken medallions but he is always trying new specials and they never disappoint. If you have not tried Abuelo's you are missing out on some incredible food.
