My favorite mexican food, bar none, and I've had many a mexican meal throughout the southwest. Salsa Blanca beats Macayos, Ajo Als,Valle Luna, Abuelos, you name 'em. Here's the quick run down:
Food taste: A+
Food quality: A+
Price: $. Very reasonable for the quality & quantity
Service: A. Not full table service. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you (within 5-10 min). Then they check on you relentlessly to make sure you're satisfied or need anything. They hustle but are always helpful and friendly.

I love that you can help yourself at the salsa bar and get as much as you want when you want it. The salsa verde is excellent. My favorite dish is the Chile Relleno and Enchilada or Taco combo but I've had several of their other entrees and was always pleased and satisfied

I'm at a loss as to how some reviewers gave this place 1 star. I've eaten there more than a dozen times and have never gotten anything but hot tasty food with great service.  I'm a repeat customer and will continue to be as long as they keep doing what they're doing.
