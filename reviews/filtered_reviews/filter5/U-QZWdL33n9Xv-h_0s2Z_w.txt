Just like another reviewer, not sure I want anyone else to know about this awesome place.  It is quite small and you have to time it right on a Sunday because it is across the street from the Catholic Church.  Luckily we make to 7am mass and wait for the doors to open at 8am.  But still very cozy when you share a table with someone else.
Every meal we have ordered is delicious.  And not sure but I think the homemade corn tortillas are made to order. Whatever I order, I always add a tripas taco to it. Recently I ordered a caldo de res and was delivered menudo instead. The server quickly replaced it and gave me a to-go container for the now free menudo.  
Try it out, you won't be disappointed.
