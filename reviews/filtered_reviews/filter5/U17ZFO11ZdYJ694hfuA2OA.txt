This is my brothers favorite restaurant in Phoenix and he and his GF took me and my husband here for Easter Brunch when we were visiting.
Who knew the food scene in Phoenix was so hip and classy? They have really great food and the decor is super. Punched copper bar, adobe like ambiance, with a fire pit and outdoor seating that looks really cozy. New Mexican cuisine is one of my favorites so it already had me at hello.
The menu is really classic mexican-ish with a tweek of gourmet. Such as Huevos Rancheros with Crab or what have you.
We had blood orange juice, yum-, a Garlic Plate app. Was out of this world with roasted elephant garlic bulbs and several kind of cheeses melted over red and green fire roasted chile salsa and onions and little crustinis to use like a bruchetta I am guessing, which was clever.
My Chile Relleno was really great, everything cooked perfect. Hubby got chile verde and eggs (forgive me I dont know the exact name of the dishes) he loved it.
My brother and his girlfried said they havent had anything they didnt love.
Its one of those places that makes you wanna stay a while...you can tell the owner really takes pride.
I hope you go check this out when visiting Phoenix because its really worth the trip!
