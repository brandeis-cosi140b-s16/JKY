I come here almost every single week with my dodgeball teammates before our games, and it's consistently awesome. The bartending staff is friendly, super quick, and they make A+ margaritas. All the food I've had here has been great, and the chips and salsa are always plentiful. 

If you're looking for a quick and delightfully cheesy bite to eat, plus some solid drinks, this is always a good choice!
