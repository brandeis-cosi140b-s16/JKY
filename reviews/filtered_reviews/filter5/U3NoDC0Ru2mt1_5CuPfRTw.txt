Great New Mexican food. Definitely some of the best out there. You want spicy? They GOT spicy. Pure fuego if ya catch my drift. Can't go wrong with some bomb-ass tamales or a chimi either. If I were to become president ( el presidente) I would make chips and salsa a mandatory requirement for every food-related establishment to serve...FO FREE. And you know whose chips and salsa I would use?? LOS DOS MOLINOS IN A HEARTBEAT. So think about that for a second and let it soak in. I ain't lying. Go there and experience a fantastical New Mexican food flavor explos√≠on. You'll see, you'll all see....
