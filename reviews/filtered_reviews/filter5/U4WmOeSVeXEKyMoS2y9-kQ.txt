Yummy in my tummy. 

We found this place after looking for a Mexican restaurant on Yelp. I was intrigued by 5 star rating. I'm so glad we went. 

When you go in, they ask if you've ever been there before. If not, then they ask if you want to sample their various meats. Say YES!  They have about 6 different types of delicious meat. The chicken breast was tender and moist. My husband really liked the barbacoa while I really liked the adobado. They both were spicy. 

My husband got a burrito, but it's more like a burro. It was heavy and filling. It had the barbacoa meat,cheese, pinto beans, rice, onions, cilantro, guacamole, roasted corn and sour cream. They give you the option to omit any of the above ingredients. I had the super nachos with the adobado meat, and the same toppings as my husband had in his burro...minus the rice. The spiciness of the meat was tempered evenly with everything in the burro.

Come hungry or be ready to take stuff home for leftovers. The portions sizes were generous for the amount of money we paid. The nachos were filling, and I made my husband stop eating his burro to help me eat my nachos. The nachos were a lot for 2 people. They also selk Mexican cokes.

We're definitely coming back again for sure. I'm already dreaming about the adobado meat.
