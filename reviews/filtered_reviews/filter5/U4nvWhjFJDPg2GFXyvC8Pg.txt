One of the best fajita joints in town! I come here at least twice a week! I come mainly for lunch but also dinner. The lunch menu is awesome!!! I love their chicken fajitas!!!! Ãœber yum! Great service that is fast and friendly!!! I love that with chips n salsa they serve bean dip and grilled japs and onions to snack on! Yummy!!!
