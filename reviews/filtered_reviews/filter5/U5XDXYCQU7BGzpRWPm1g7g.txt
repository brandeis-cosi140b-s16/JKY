This is the first place we eat at every time we are in Vegas.  I am not sure what people are expecting when they give 1 star or really anything under 4 stars.  This Is NOT a fusion restaurant. The menu clearly has Chinese dishes OR Mexican dishes.  Yes it tapas so you will get smaller portions.  If you have done any research  on this place you will know it is a Jose Andres establishment.  This is his style in all ways possible.  My favorite dish is the lengua taco.  So tender and flavorful.  My husband likes the when pigs fly.  I have never had a disappointing dish from here.  The lamb pot stickers are another go to along with the lucky 6 Shu Mai.  Go with friends so you can taste more dishes (hence with the tapas style).  The 20 vegetable fried rice was amazing the second time we ordered it.  The first time seemed to lack flavor but that second time packed a punch SO GOOD!!!!  Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed.
