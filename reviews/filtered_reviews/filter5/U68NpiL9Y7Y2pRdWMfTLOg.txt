Service: The owner was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the kimchi fried rice w/o eggs; when it came out I noticed it had small pieces of what I thought may have been eggs in the mix. I let her know I am allergic to eggs and she gladly took it back to make sure that it was made w/o eggs and reassured me that a new one would be made. The chef came out and confirmed that there were no eggs in the fried rice... so I dug in. It was delicious. so flavorful. and exploding w. kimchi!! 

I also got the free fried wontons for the check in special on yelp. The owner returned to inform me that the wontons were sealed w/ egg yolk. This just showed me how attentive she was! thumbs up to that. 

Boyfriend got the soft tacos in pork, chicken, and beef. The chicken taco was delicious!! It had different dressings than that of a tacoshop ie cabbage. 

I was really skept about trying this restaurant when my boyfriend suggested it. But it completely opened my mind to fusion food. I've had other fusion foods in San Diego which did not compared!! Will definitely be going back! I love it when hole in the wall restaurants blow you away like this one (:
