I feel it necessary to comment on Mark J's review. His girlfriend was probably dropped because she was in the wrong field. A group of us had the opportunity to witness this first hand. Dinner served before the appetizer or salad... had to ask 3 times for our drinks... when we asked about the appetizer and salad she took away our meals and brought the appetizer and salads. Then, when we finished them, she brought our entree's back which had obviousely been sitting under a lamp. I called the next day to make sure the manager knew what happened and we didn't go back for a couple of weeks in hopes that our usual server, Hugo, would be back. He returned from vacation and we have been back twice. No problems, good food, excellent drinks, great service.  Sour grapes should be served appropriately Mark
