WOOOOOWWWWWW! My friends and I were downtown and looking for a place to eat and thank God for Yelp! Off the bat the chips and salsa came out and that fresh homemade salsa was out of this world. I am literally still drooling from it. 

We ordered the fish and shrimp ceviche and the empanadas for appetizers and were blown away. So fresh and just delicious. We then ordered the family sized molcajete which had chicken, steak, shrimp, chorizo, avocado, catcus, onions, so much and literally every single item was better than the next. My friends and I cannot wait to go back again. I had my leftovers the morning after and it was still so ridiculously good. 

The waiter (i didnt get his name) was super friendly, joked with us, recommended food, told us how big the portions were so we could order correctly (which we didn't listen to but he tried). We had a bunch of kids with us and he even put the television back on and put Harry Potter on for them. 

It is not in the best area but do not let that stop you, the food is legit. 

I'm looking forward to my next trip there!
