I wanted to try this the last time I was in town and nobody wanted to go with me :) patience paid off, the food was very yummy! Definitely recommend the blackened chicken taco.  I also had the carne asada taco and it was very good.  The guac was fresh and the margarita was  just what I needed after work. Two of us ate for $21 total.  Great food, great prices, can't wait to go back :)
