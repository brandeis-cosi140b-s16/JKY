Damn, I totally thought I'd be the first one to write about this place, but obviously, I am mistaken.

In a strip mall next to a computer store and a pool supply shoppe stands this intimate venue, which would be great for a date.  However, when life doesn't treat you to a hot date in Phoenix, it will do nicely for a good night with 3 co-worker / friends.  Casual yet nice.  Good music, yet nothing I recognized.  Killer platters -- I recommend the New Mexican Platter (tamale, relleno, chicken burrito, beans, rice).  It was so dark in there, I couldn't exactly tell what I was eating until it got into my mouth.  After I moved the relleno off the other items, I would get a piece of tasty chicken (ahh, the burro).  A piece of meat (love the tamale).  Cheesy beans n' rice (but so much better than the standard combo platter at a Mexican restaurant) rounded off the platter.

Taste-o-rama galore.
