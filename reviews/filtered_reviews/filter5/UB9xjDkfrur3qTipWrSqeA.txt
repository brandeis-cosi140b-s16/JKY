Fantastic food! Gluten-free friendly, too!
My wife and I went there on a whim in between appointments at Carle Hospital. I got two carne asada tacos and she got a chicken taco americano. Good stuff! I grew up in Phoenix, AZ and recently spent 18 mos in Southern California for work and this is the only place in C-U that I have eaten at in which I don't feel like I'm settling for inferior/americanized food. Tasty, authentic and very friendly. 
My only complaint is that there is so little seating we can't take our kids there to eat - we'll have to do takeout.
