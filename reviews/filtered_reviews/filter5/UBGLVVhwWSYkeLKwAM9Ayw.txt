Eat here! 

Came here today for lunch with a friend and our kids. I'd been wanting to try this place after driving past it a few times. It was pretty empty for lunchtime on a Saturday so we sat right down. 

I ordered 3 different tacos: beer battered mahi mahi, pork with pineapples, and a crunchy beef taco with mashed potatoes (yes mashed potatoes). All were amazing but my fav was the pork. It was difficult to narrow it down to just three tacos so I'm definitely coming back for the rest. 

Do not leave here without getting the churros! Next time I'm eating those first. Came with a chocolate dipping sauce and some fresh whipped cream...I almost died it was so good. 

The kids ordered the quesadilla that came fried, they weren't too excited about it and the waiter noticed this without us saying a word and brought out a regular quesadilla on the house for each of them. Overall the service and the food was wonderful! Already planning my next visit.
