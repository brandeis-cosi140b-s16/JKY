Kalua pork rice bowl was fantastic.  This place is like a Hawaiian Chipotle and what a beautiful partnership of food!  I never thought to put sour cream or guac on kale pork, but damn, it works.  

My husband and I also sampled the hula-hula check which was also fantastic, but we went with the pork.  Nicely salted, smooth flavor, just like it was lifted out of the pit with leaves :-)  Well-done and will be back!
