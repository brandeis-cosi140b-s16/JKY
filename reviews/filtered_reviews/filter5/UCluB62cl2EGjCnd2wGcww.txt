Mexican food, my new favorite!!  We got here during the dinner rush and had to wait about 15 minutes but it wasn't too bad.

The service was excellent and the recommendations the server provided blew my socks off. 

The nachos with REAL cheese, not that velveeta crap was tasty. The fundido dish I had was HUGE! And tasted sooo good!!

I will most definitely bring my family here when we vacation here in the near future.
