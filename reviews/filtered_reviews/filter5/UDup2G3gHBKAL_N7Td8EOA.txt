Great mexican food at great prices.  Happy Hour specials all weekend long - try the chicken (or beef or pork) quesadilla for $3, it is flavorful and delicious!  Margaritas only $3; husband and I enjoyed one out on the patio watching the beautiful AZ sunset on a Sunday evening.  Salsa has quite a bite, not that mild stuff like some other dumbed down mexican restaurants nearby.  Staff is super friendly and helpful explaining the menu.   Possibly the 5 star rating is a tad high, but I thought I had to even out the score after that last dweeb who posted an undeserved 2 stars.
