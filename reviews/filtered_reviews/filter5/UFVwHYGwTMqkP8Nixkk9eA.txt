I saw this place on the Food Network show "Diners Drive-ins and Dives", I had been going to the Chinese restaurant a few doors down and never stopped in until yesterday, and I'm glad I did.

 This Family owned Mexican Restaurant has been serving some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix since 1981. Run by five sisters and one brother, they have passed down recipes from their families generations, and serve them up with large portions. Unlike the standard Sonaran style restaurants in the Phoenix area, they have brought flavors from Mexico that will thrill your taste buds. Not too hot but flavorful extraordinaire.

If your in the south east side of Phoenix, you have to try this place, be ready for the wait though, I had a 25 min wait for food, but it is 100% worth it...

Remember to look at the Specials menu, I almost missed one of my favorite dishes chilaquiles, Loved them as a kind and still do, must have with Egg. 

Funny it was not in Yelp when I went to write this review...
