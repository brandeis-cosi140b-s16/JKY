So freaking delicious. Chips and salsas are to die for. Fried ice cream nom nom nom wish I lived in Vegas so I could come here more often. Homemade Mexican food. Had the carne asada and chili releno with beef. Chili releno was good probably get cheese next time and the carne was spicy and soo flavorful! Can't wait to come back!!
