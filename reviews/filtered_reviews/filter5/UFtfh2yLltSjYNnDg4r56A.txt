After coming here for the first time last weekend, I don't really understand the hate that this place gets. This past Sunday evening, my husband and I came in here as our first stop on Mill for the night. The first thing we noticed was that the place smelled AMAZING. Whatever air freshener they have is incredible! We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very attractive bartender who was quick with our drink orders and answered all of our questions. We had a few draft beers and their tequila bombers, which were super tasty and at a good price.
The decor and atmosphere of the bar is great. I loved the pink accent lighting and the pattern on the booths. There was one group that had definitely imbibed a lot of liquor that day and were getting a little rowdy and dancing on top of the booths, but it's Mill, and I wasn't really surprised. 
Overall, we had a blast, and we will definitely stop here every time we go to Mill Avenue!
