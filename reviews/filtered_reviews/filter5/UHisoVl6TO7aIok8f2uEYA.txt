This little hole-in-the-wall restaurant produces Korean-Mexican fusion delights that exude wonderful flavors. Everything is made fresh. The owners concern for quality comes through with every bite. 

The tables are very plain. There is nothing at all fancy. Don't let that stop you from going to KoMex - you will not be disappointed.
