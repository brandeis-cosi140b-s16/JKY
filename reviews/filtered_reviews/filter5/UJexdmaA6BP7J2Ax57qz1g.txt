If you love authentic tacos, Las Palmas is the best-kept secret in all of Pittsburgh. It's actually a taco stand in front of a tiny, genuine Mexican grocery on Atwood Street. The tacos are $2.50 each and probably the best you'll find in a city that is not known for its Mexican cuisine. You can pile on as many toppings as you want. For a sweet treat, pick up some flan or tres leches cake in the store. Delicious! My only complaint is there's nowhere to sit, so you've got to either take the food home, walk over to Schenley Park, or eat it awkwardly while walking down the street. These tacos are so mouth-watering as to make the last option seem reasonable, so be careful -- especially with the hot sauce.
