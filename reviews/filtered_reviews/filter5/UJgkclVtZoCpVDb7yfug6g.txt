The reason to come to Phoenix! I love this place- quite authentic and honest. My favorite is the chorizo and potatoes with tortillas. Spicy, salty deliciousness. We bought tortillas to take home- they are worth the trip alone. Slightly salty with that perfect puerco after bite. And the fountain sodas have that perfect tiny slushy ice and strong coca cola. I give Carolina's two thumbs up.
