I was craving some Mexican food and was delighted to find this place with all the good reviews! There were four of us that ended up going on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we got a table right away. As soon as we sat down we received water and chips and salsa. I have never received such prompt service. We had not even been there thirty seconds! So far, I LOVED this place. Nothing worse then waiting for water in the summertime (ok it was Sept but still felt like summer) in AZ. The waitstaff was fantastic. They were friendly and prompt which is a great combo! Our group ordered two "Garden Variety Burritos" (one with no mushrooms ewwww) and two of "the Beasts.'" It was fantastic. I was worried there would be so too much salt in the food since I have experienced that in the past at other establishments that serve Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned to perfection and no one had any complaints. I will defiantly be back.
