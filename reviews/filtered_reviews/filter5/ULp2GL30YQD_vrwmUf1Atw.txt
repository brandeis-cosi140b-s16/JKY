I truly have no words.. Maybe because Im speaking a mix of Chinese/Spanish/English jibberish upon the exit of this seemingly divey place with an awesome, yet interesting fusion of taste sensation.. 
THIS is truly some of the best service I have received in SOOOO long.. My parents took me here so we could get some fast, cheap, yummy take out for movie nite... While they were being snowbirds from Cali. The place was crowded as heck! Bandidos yo! Several of my friends have  been here a lot..and they rave of the place...my parents said they knew I'd love it.. My dad, acting like a AZ pro, told the cute, friendly girl that I was a newbie to the chi/bando. She had a line.. and amazingly, she started serving up like 8 samples of the most ordered items! I loved it! Jade chicken was my favorite;Carnitas a second.;the rice is the bomb...the black beans remind me of San Juan PR type... and thats authentic!  My sidekick, aka Jeran  ordered a quesadilla, with his Jade Red, and they got a bit interesting with it.. adding the jerk chicken to the quesadilla. Honestly I thought that was weird.. but miscomm somewhere, again..its a different language.. learn it, live it and by all means... yum-yelp-eat it! I am glad my parentals watch so many tele shows and found this on Diners Drive In's and Dives. All the way in Nor Cali! 
PS. Don't be scared of the neighborhood, yes. It is sketchy. And I am not really a fan of the seating area. We got in . We got out. Alive. With our foil wrapped Chino B. Yum
