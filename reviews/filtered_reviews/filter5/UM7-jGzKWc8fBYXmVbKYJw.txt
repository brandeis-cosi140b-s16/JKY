I always get the same thing at Mexican restaurants, a green chili burro enchilada style - boring, I know but tonight it was different. The meat was tender and choice cuts, the sauce smooth and spiced exactly like I like it. Beans and rice on the plate were also excellent. I am always looking for the "old school" Mexican food that I knew as a kid. Well this is the place! 

Me dinner companion had fajitas, a combo of steak and chicken, which were the best that I had tried anywhere  in the Valley. I was surprised because the old style restaurants usually don't do fajitas well, because they are not traditional.

We both had margaritas, very good, and also traditional. Meal topped off with ice cream with cinnamon, pastry, whipped cream - what could be bad about that?

Our service was outstanding by all employees, fast water, chips and salsa, drinks, and dinner. Friendly, professional staff added to an experience that I hope to repeat again and again.
