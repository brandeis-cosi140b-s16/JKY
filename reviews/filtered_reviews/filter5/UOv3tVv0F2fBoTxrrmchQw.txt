I took my 21 year old niece to Vegas. I purchased certificate for T&T (Tacos and Tequila) restaurant at www.restaurant.com. We decided to stop there before seeing Menopause. The restaurant is a stone's throw away from the box office for Menopause and Carrot Top (both shows were excellent!) 

The service was exceptional.  Fast service, tasty food, and friendly staff.  

Great chicken burrito, tilapia tacos (Baja on menu and my first time having fish tacos), and margarita!  

Oh, I must add....two days later, my niece and I decided to go back to T&T to celebrate her birthday and for our last nice meal before leaving our Vegas Trip. We also were eating again before a great show; this time it was to see Carrot Top.

The chips and salsa were to die for and we wanted to buy some to take back to our hotel room.  During both visits, the waiter packed a few (with both salsas) in a Togo back at no charge!
