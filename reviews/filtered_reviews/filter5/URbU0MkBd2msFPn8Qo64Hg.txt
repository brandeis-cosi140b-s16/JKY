I eat here quite a bit...meet with the fella's there on thursday nights.  I usually get the carne soft tacos which are specially priced on Thursdays at $1.50 which is awesome!!  I went off the beaten path and tried a trio-combo which was the "#10" that had two sour cream chicken enchiladas and one shredded beef taco with a side of refried beans and rice.   Wow, it rocked.  The enchilada and the cream sauce had great flavor cooked right on point.  The taco shell was freshly-made crispy and just the right amout of cheese, lettuce and meat mix.  And our server was, as always the professional and beautiful Cecelia.  Overall great Mexican food.
