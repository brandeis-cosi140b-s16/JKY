This place is a real surprise. Would never guess from the looks of it that the food is amazing!! My favorite... the pork tostada! Everything I have had off the fusion side of the menu has been great. The Kim Chi fried rice is an absolute must at every visit. My husband loves their fusion chicken wings. Tacos for $2.... you have got to try their home made salsa. They bring a variety to the table and they are good!! Spicy, and flavor is terrific!
