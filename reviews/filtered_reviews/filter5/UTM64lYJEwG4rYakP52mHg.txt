Don't go anywhere else for Mexican -- this is the best. We eat here for dinner and lunch with everything simply delicious. Salsa is amazing with both HOT and mild versions. Chips are freshly made and served warm. All menu items are typical Tex Mex -- my favorite is the Arroz con Pollo which you should try...Yum!  Oh by the way the prices are low too.
