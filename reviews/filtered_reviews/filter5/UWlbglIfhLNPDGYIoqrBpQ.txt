12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon, end of July... this adventure to Carlsbad Tavern was sheer deliciousness!  Even as we walked to the front door, it was delightful to see water and a waterfall outside... making each of us trying to remember what cooler than 110 degrees is like.  Once inside, it was wonderful, the perfect temperature and a bit dark like a cave, but not so dark as not to be able to read the menu.   
      I ordered the special of the day, Blackened Shrimp on a house salad with deep fried onion crisps on top.  The dressing was a jalapeno ranch.  In the center, under the onion crispies, was a guacamole mash of some sort.  (The official description makes it sound much better!)   I LOVED it!   Just the right amount of flavor and heat.  
     Just before we got our lunch, we realized there is a Yelp Check In special!  So we got Chips and salsa for free!  Got to love that!!!
     My lunch partners really enjoyed their meals too.  One had the Patty Melt.  Ate as much as she could... plenty and yummy!  Betty had the Carne Adovada Plate and in her words, "It was delicious."   
     Tracy was our server and she did absolutely everything right.  Perfect in friendliness, menu knowledge and making sure we had what we needed right away.  We appreciated her very much.
      I look forward to going back to try some more items.   Back to the Bat Cave!
