I'm an Elmer's fanatic. Yes, I went to Chandler High School, but even though I now live in Los Angeles., I make it a point to visit Elmer's EVERY time I visit Phoenix.  

My all-time favorite item is the Machaca Burrito. The best ever!!! It's not like any other Machaca Burrito I've ever had -- this one does not come with eggs, nor is it dry -- the meat is more the consistency of pot roast, stewed in it's own juices w/ onions, and it is so tender, juicy and bursting with flavor. It does tend to get a bit wet/messy, but the flavor is delicious, especially when you add Elmer's sauce.

Also good are the bean n cheese w/sauce, the strips, and the lesser known menu item - "butter tortilla w/sauce". It's all about the sauce!  I drown everything in the sauce. (I dream about the sauce).  Viva Elmers!!!!
