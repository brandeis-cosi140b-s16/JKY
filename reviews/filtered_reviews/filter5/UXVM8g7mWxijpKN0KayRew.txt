Probably the best Vuelve a la Vida I've ever had. Had delicious flavor and plenty of 'meat'. The salsa they bring you is way too hot. I believe it's habanero chile used. It's a very small restaurant and the area is worn down but these holes in the wall really are worth it. Definitely going back to try other items! Oh, the empanada,appetizers were ok, needed salt
