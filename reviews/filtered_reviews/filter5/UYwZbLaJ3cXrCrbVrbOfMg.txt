Stopped in here for lunch and was a great experience! We were seated right away and our waiter, Matthew, came over seconds later with chips & salsa and to take our drink order. Chips were warm and fresh and salsa was delicious with a nice kick. I ordered the no name margarita which was quite yummy. They have a huge tequila offering and margarita specials every day. 

I ordered one paco taco (beef brisket) and one chicken taco. They were both amazing and served quickly. Meat was very fresh and flavorful. Tacos come with beans, rice, and coleslaw on the side. The service was really attentive and definitely made the experience. Constant water refills and more chips & salsa before we even ran out. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
