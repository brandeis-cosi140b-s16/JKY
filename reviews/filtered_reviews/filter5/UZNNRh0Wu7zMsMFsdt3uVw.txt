Can I give them 6 stars!!! This was far from my home but well worth the drive. Right now they are having specials for the hatch chili festival and the chili relleno stuffed with shrimp was soooo yummy that I am going back this weekend for more. The ice tea has a subtle mango flavor which was a nice touch. The salsa, I am still trying to figure out what the spice is that is in it. It is great. Just the right amount of spicy and chunky and flavor. 

Service was great, fast, friendly. Atmosphere is great as well. Everything looked very clean. They have a "family" restroom and I have a daughter who uses a wheelchair so I was impressed that they have the extra bathroom which is always much easier and more convienent when you use a wheelchair.
