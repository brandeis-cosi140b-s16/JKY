We were here last week and had a fantastic experience thanks to our waiter, Arnoldo. He was fabulous and the food was terrific. Arnoldo was extremely attentive and although we had a large party, he took care of everyone's individual needs. We had one member with a strong aversion to cilantro and he made sure none of her food had any in it. It was a great dinner and we will be sure to return.
