This is my second time here. The first time was right after I needed to gluten, soy and dairy free and the waiter couldn't have been nicer about accommodating my dietary needs. The staff was also extremely forthcoming with all of their weekly deals for locals, all of which are bomb! 50% off EVERYTHING on Mondays and Thursdays is $20 all you can eat street tacos. So amazing. The rice is maybe the most amazing rice I've ever had, light and creamy! And it's open 24/7 so wins all around!!!
