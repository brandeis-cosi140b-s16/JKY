I've been craving this place all day today but trying to reduce my visits here down to like only 3-4 days a week.  Instead of going in, I'll give them a great review.  

This place is seriously the bomb diggity of burgers!  If you are looking for a boring burger with the boring traditional condiments then go to a drive thru burger place and enjoy your mediocre life.  This place is where you go when you want an orgasm with every burger.  Not really but that would be super cool!  

Every week they have a fun new burger to try out and it is always a concoction of weird things that when put together taste amazing.  On the "normal" menu they have some fun options too.  My favorite is the booze burger, which has beer battered fried burger patties... who the hell does that?  This place does and it tastes awesome!  It has all sorts of other yummy stuff too.  Their fries are super yummy and have a bit of sweetness to them.  Make sure you try their jalape√±o ranch because it is freaking tits!  Sweet fries dipped in spicy ranch is sooo good.  As others have mentioned, their French toast fries are Hella good.  

This place isn't your trendy gourmet burger restaurant that you often see around here.  This has the "hole in the wall" feel with super nice bearded (good looking) guys working.  

Crap, now that I just wrote this review I want to eat here more than ever.  I am going to try to have self control and not go tonight but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be going tomorrow for lunch.
