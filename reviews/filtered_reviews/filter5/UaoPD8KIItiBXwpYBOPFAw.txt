Unique dishes and such amazing food. The place doesn't look like much at first glance but we've never been disappointed with the food or service. The only thing I'd change is the way they have you order, for a first timer the order slip can be confusing (friends recently came home with a dozen cookies they didn't mean to order, not that I'm complaining, yum!).
