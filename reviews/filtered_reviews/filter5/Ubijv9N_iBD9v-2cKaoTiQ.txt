If you know me at all, you know I love tequila and I love margaritas. Since turning 21, I have been on a mission to seek out and find the best tequila and margarita spots in the East Valley and Central Phoenix areas.

This place is the epitome of "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" as the 5 stars I gave this restaurant suggests. I am also a happy hour hound, and this place also gets 5 stars for that.

To begin, they have 100+ tequilas on the menu, all half off (except like 2) during happy hour. For $2 more, you can make any tequila on the menu a margarita (during HH, of course). They have blanco, joven, reposado, anejo, extra anejo, sotol, mezcal, and a couple other obscure agave-based liquors. They also have cheap beer if you're lame. (WHY DID YOU COME TO A TEQUILA BAR?!)

Anyway, their house margaritas are their only half-off drink during happy hour, but I'm not complaining. That's the only thing worth drinking there, unless you like your tequila straight in a sifter (my hero!).

4 of their 6 varieties of delicious street tacos are half off ($4) during happy hour along with their guacamole and salsa trio, both delicious choices. They also have a couple of appetizers half off that are pretty good, too.

WARNING: DO NOT GO HERE AFTER 10 PM

......unless you want to see and partake in a complete and utter a sh*t show. The poor serving staff is way overloaded at night and it causes a ton of bad reviews for this place. It's really unfortunate, because during the day and early evenings this place is calm, relaxing and has wonderfully attentive and sociable service.
