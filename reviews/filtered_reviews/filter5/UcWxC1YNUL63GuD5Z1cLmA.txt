My wife and I finally tried Leticia's for lunch at the recommendation of our friends.  First I must start by saying that my wife makes the best authentic Mexican food around and we tavel to Mexico a lot as well so we are quite picky in this area.  After all the dissappointing experiences and attempts at finding good Mexican food in Vegas we had all but given up...until now!  Leticia's was a pleasant surprise with great food and awesome lunch prices.  It took a little bit to get noticed and seated, but after that the service was great.  There were a lot of items on the restaurant that you just don't see at other Mexican restaurants, and my wife commented about seeing dishes that her mom used to make...and her mom is where she got her skills from so great sign!  The chips and salsa were great, and lots of roasted options and good selection of heat.  My wife had Sopes and I had Carne Asada and Carnitas combo and both were great.  It is a great place for a lunch date or family and friends...we will definitely be back when we don't feel like cooking at home!
