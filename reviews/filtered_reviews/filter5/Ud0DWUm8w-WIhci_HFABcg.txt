My favorite Mexican food! I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro. The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too. I like to wash it down with some of their horchata. I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean. I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.
