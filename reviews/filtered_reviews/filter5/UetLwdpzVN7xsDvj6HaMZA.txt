This is our favorite Mexican joint in town. The food and service is consistently good. The sauces seem to have gotten spicier over time, or so it seems!  Definitely try the green sauce- it's delicious and super spicy at the same time. The wait can seem long at times but its usually no longer than 15 minutes.
