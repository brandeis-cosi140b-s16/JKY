This is truly a foodie fusion heaven.

Everything from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable waitstaff to the meal was perfection.  Every person we interacted with shared insights on the food, was incredibly friendly, and made me feel right at home.  I wanted to ask our server (Stephanie, I think) to join us for dessert - I liked her that much!

For lunch, my mom and I shared two orders of tacos (chicken and fish).  Both were completely different, but bursting with unique flavor.  We also loved the chili-garlic noodles.  Perfect amount of heat.  

We had a delicious chocolate bread pudding for dessert, which was a solid way to round out this fabulous meal.

Go here.  Soon.  You'll thank me.
