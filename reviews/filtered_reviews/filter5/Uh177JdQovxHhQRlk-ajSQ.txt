Does admitting to the fact that we went to this place twice in one day tell you anything? 
The Carne Asada ... blew my mind. It was a 8 oz (ish) piece of meat that was cooked to my liking. I have not had meat that tender and flavorful, maybe ever? The bartender John made a drink pairing selection, a Habanero infused Blackberry Margarita... kinda made you want to smack people!
Then the bacon wrapped shrimp on a skewer with grilled veggies.. another home run. These were big shrimp skewered with Jalapeno spears and acrispy bacon shell. This was lunch and dinner!!
