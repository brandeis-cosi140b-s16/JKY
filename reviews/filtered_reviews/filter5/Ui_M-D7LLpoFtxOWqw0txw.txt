Whoa. We have been coming here for over 10 years. I mean... whoa.

But this restaurant is actually one of the reasons we moved to Arizona. Her sister took us here the very first time we flew out to visit. We were so blown away by this strange place with bright murals on the ceiling and huge wooden chairs - and that was before the chips and 4 salsas came out. And the chile rellenos.

There is nothing outstanding about this restaurant. Except for the fact that for the last ten years, they have been consistently excellent 100% of the time. Who does that? Nobody. This is the only *company*, let alone the only restaurant, that has never let me down, and I go weekly. Is that important to you? If not, keep driving. Maybe there's a Taco Bell in your future.

What else can I say? You won't like every dish, nor should you. But you will crave the ones you do like, and there are many. And during the darkest times of your life, you'll go have an 1800 Margarita (or three) with good company. And you will order extra chips. Lots and lots of extra chips.
