Another great find in town. Ambiance and wait staff were nice. The chicken tacos were yummy.  Lauryn was our server and she provided us great customer service. Definitely a place to go out with friends or family. Love the outdoor seating. Only recommendation would be to change the music selection. It didn't match the feel or ambiance of the restaurant and could be an easy change.
