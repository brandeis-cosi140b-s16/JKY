The best, most authentic Mexican food!

I have eaten at most of the Mexican places in the valley during my life and while there are equals and many wanna be's, Carolina's is one of the greats!! I started at their original location many years ago, went to the east side location when I moved that way, and now I try to get to the west side location 2-3 times a month. As has been said before, the tortillas are fantastic!! The tacos are large, fresh and full of flavor. I get the beef or machaca (you have to ask) tacos and a red chili burrito when I visit. The red chili has the tart, earthy, smokey flavor that authentic chili sauce should have. The re-fried beans are fresh and made with lard the way they should be. Don't let the word lard scare you!! Real re-fried beans are made with it and that is what gives them the creaminess and flavor that all fried beans should have!

The staff has always been friendly, and while I cannot speak for others, there are tons of people working behind the counters and I have never had anything but quick, friendly service. The ordering line ALWAYS stretches to the door (or out the door) and the 'to go' area is ALWAYS packed. That says something about the place's quality.
