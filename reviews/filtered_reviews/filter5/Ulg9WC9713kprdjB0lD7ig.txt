Thank you yelpers for recommending this place!  Had a cheeseburger with Havarti and corn on the cob. I said "yum!" After every bite!  Perfect sized burger, especially the meat to bun ratio!  It was just as satisfying watching other newbies having their first bites!  The employees were also super nice and proud of their product!
