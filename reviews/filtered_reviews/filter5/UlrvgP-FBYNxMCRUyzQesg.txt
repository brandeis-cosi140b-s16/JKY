Stopped in on Sunday afternoon after taking in canal arts festival. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and a quesadilla. The bartender was very personable and made a fun afternoon better. Chips, salsa and the quesadilla were all great. We even got some sightseeing suggestions and look forward to enjoying our trip to Scottsdale and stopping back at Barrio Queen for happy hour.
