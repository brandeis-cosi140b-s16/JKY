Insanely good fajitas.  My mom wanted to go here because she read it was the latest rage for movie stars.  Have to admit, I was quite skeptical.  The menu did not look authentic and it seemed super loud.  It was quite loud, but I have to say I have been dreaming of these fajitas ever since we went.  It will be the FIRST stop we make next time we are back in Vegas.
