Hands down this is our go to Mexican restaurant in North Phoenix.  I highly recommend getting the "Fiesta Platter" which is a combo of all sorts of great stuff.  Chips and salsa are great, and they usually have some sort of drink special like $2.50 Corona's all summer long.  Whether you want to eat in the restaurant, or have some drinks with friends in the Cantina, it's a great atmosphere.  Staff is always friendly, and when something isn't right, they do go out of their way to make it right, from lower staff to management.  All around fantastic place that will remain in business for many years due to their quality and friendliness.
