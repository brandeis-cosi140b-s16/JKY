Such a guilty pleasure.

I had heard about this strange little fusion eatery long before some friends finally dragged me there.  Now I make up for lost time by spreading the wealth... oh, and returning often.

A unique a-la-carte selection of Chinese, Korean, Mexican, Cuban treats served in almost as many styles.  A machaca rice bowl? Yes.  A sweet & spicy chicken burrito?  Yes.  A jerk chicken quesadilla?  My favorite.  Basically, worldwide Dim Sum on a foil plate.

The ordering process can be quite intimidating to the unintiated.  The staff is more than willing to help and even offers a tutorial with samples, but they're got their hands full during the lunch rush.  Take a repeater with you, or target a slower period for your first time.

Unfortunately Chino has had to raise prices a bit.  I've scaled back some of my orders, but I occassionally cross into that $$ mark.

Oh, yeah.  I'd go for the snickerdoodle any day of the week.
