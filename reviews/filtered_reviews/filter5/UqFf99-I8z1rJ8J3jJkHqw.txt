Probably one of the top five family Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  I can't get past their enchiladas to try anything else on the menu.  The ground beef is perfectly seasoned and each side with them has its own unique flavor which can be discerned in your mouth.  The portions are large for the price paid.  Service is excellent.  I recommend asking for Mauricio.  He's funny but professional and very accommodating.  This location is on my "A" list for sure and I highly recommend it for your dining pleasure as well.
