This has always been one of our favorite Mexican spots since moving to charlotte - tacos and margaritas are both great! Last night during dinner, we were sat next to the most obnoxious group of women looking for as much attention as possible by screaming at the top of their lungs the entire dinner.....at 7pm on a Tuesday. When the waiter asked if we'd like another drink after dinner I told him I couldn't stand to sit next to these women another minute and we had our next round of drinks at the bar instead to try and distance ourselves from the screaming ladies. After we ordered our drinks, the owner came over to personally apologize for the ladies ludicrous behavior and even bought us that round of drink....definitely unnecessary but an amazing gesture; especially because one bad table wouldn't be enough to keep us away from their pollo rojo tacos and spicy margs! Will continue to be a regular spot for us in Charlotte when looking for fast, great Mexican.
