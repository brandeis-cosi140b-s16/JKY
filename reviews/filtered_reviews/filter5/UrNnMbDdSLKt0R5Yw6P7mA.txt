A friend of mine took me here because it was her favorite Mexican Restaurant. After meeting up with her and trying out the food, i can see why. And she's got great taste

I had the Camarones a la Diabla and she had Camarones Sarandeados.

Despite mine being the spicy dish it wasn't all that spicy. It was more of a flavorful heat vice a mace to the face zomg heat. The sides were nice as well, beans were top notch and flavorful as well as home made. 

I picked my friend's left overs and the Camarones Sarandeados are simply amazing. VERY flavorful and complex almost layered in it's taste

Overall the service and food were top notch and i will definitely come back to this place to try out other things on the menu
