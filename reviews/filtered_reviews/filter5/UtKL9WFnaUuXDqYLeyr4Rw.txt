OMG, I love this place!  Perfect place to take a date.  It's tucked away, not yet mainstream, and promises an outstanding experience.  Food is authentic, excellent, and presented with a pleasing eclectic flair.

To truly appreciate this place you have to realize that this is THE OLDEST, CONTINUOUSLY OPERATING MEXICAN RESTAURANT in Las Vegas.  

I interviewed the previous owner a couple of years ago for a local magazine and simply admired his ability to stay in business.  He quipped the the billboard over the roof made more money than did the restaurant.  Not necessarily a glowing appraisal of his own place.

But the new owners, wow.  They deeply love the business and it shows.  

They completely revamped the interior to give a "millennial" kind of new age feel.  I don't get the feeling I'm walking into a Mexican Restaurant, rather, I feel like I'm walking into a really cool place that serves REAL GOOD Mexican food.

I give it give five stars because it exceeded my expectations in food, service, and atmosphere.
