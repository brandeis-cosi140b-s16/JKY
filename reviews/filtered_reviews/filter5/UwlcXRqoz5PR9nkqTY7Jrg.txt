Been here a couple times, ordering something different each time, and all dishes have been delicious. Large restaurant with a bar, cool art on the walls along with some old school posters. My Dad took me here, said it was one of the best older mexican joints here in Vegas. He swears by the menudo here, cant get enough. Full range of dishes to choose from and the horchata is on tap!
