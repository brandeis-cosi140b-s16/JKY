Sorry to hear this location is closed, I will have to go to one of the other ones. I wanted to write a review (better late than never) for when I was last there July 23rd, 2014. I ordered tacos, and I took away my order only to discover it was wrong when I got to the location where I  was going to eat my lunch. The staff made it RIGHT! Instead of 2 tacs, they gave me 3! And threw in an little extra side. The staff at this location had always rocked and made things right whenever something went sideways. 
I will, of course, search out their other locations so I can continue to patronize them - the food is great and the service always makes me feel welcome and wanted - this was a great location to kick back with a cold drink, good food and good company.
