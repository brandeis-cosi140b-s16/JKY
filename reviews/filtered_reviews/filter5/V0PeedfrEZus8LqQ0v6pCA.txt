Bomb from start to finish, super crowded lively atmosphere, super friendly staff, affordable tacos, make sure you know your Spanish cow/pork translated parts before u order. Horchatas are free refills, tacos are made on the spot and the meat is chopped stove hot and fresh. Definitely come here again and recommend to anyone in town.
