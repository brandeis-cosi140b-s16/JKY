Went here with a groupon (yes i'm addicted). Loved the atmosphere & decor. The food was really delicious. My first time having Cuban food. I had the beef ropa vieja (shredded beef simmered with tomatoes, peppers & onions) It was tender and flavorful. My boyfriend had the beef Vaca Frita, which was also very flavorful but a bit dry (didnt stop him from eating it all though). Both were served with white rice and red beans which were a nice accompaniment. We both had one of their specialty cocktails. They were very tasty & fruity & STRONG :D We were not disappointed in the food & service and will definitely come back again.
