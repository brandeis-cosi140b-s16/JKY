Wow, where do I even start. We had an experience to remember at this place. My expectations were beyond met at this hidden gem. Started with tableside guacamole from our awesome server mark. It was honestly delicious, followed by a couple more appetizers which were also to die for I especially enjoyed the quest fundido.

We decided to go for a family style meal and just get a bunch of stuff and share, first off the portions are awesome, and the street tacos delicious. We had cochinita which I thought was AMAZING and that's saying alot being from Mexico City which is also where chef Paco was from so I could really identify myself with this menu that brought back nostalgia of the cooking from my home city. 

Overall rating of my experience was superb. To top it all off we had dessert. Churros is what we opted for since it was easy to share but flan was really where my heart was. This is the chefs recipe passed down from his grandmother and I don't say this often but he gives my mothers flan a run for its money. 

Top this all off with awesome locals, industry discount plus a happy hour and you got yourself a winner. Chef Paco and Mark our waiter really go out of there way to make sure your dining experience is great. For this you have my business on which I'm sure will be the first of many visits to this awesome place.
