I live just a few minutes away, and this place had been recommended by Jim from Market Bistro.  Finally got a chance to get in tonight and try it and I will definitely be back!  Best burger I have had in years!  I had the Beach Burger and added Avocado and Bacon,.  My son had the Brulee Burger and we shared some fries.  The burgers were cooked perfectly and the seasoning on the fries was spot-on.  What I really appreciated was the bun.  As you all know, there is nothing worse than a great burger that gets lost in a huge dry bun.  You won't have that problem here with the brioche burger buns.  If you are looking for a great burger, or if you want to support our local small businesses, stop by Paradise Valley Burger Company.  You won't be disappointed.
