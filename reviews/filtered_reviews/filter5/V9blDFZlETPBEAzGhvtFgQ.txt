Best burger joint I've had in Vegas (which is, admittedly, few), but it stands up to the best in LA.  The fare is effectively a riff on Fatburger, but they've done a much better job and introduced a Mexican food twist to the cuisine if you desire.  Not only can you get one of the best and most affordable burgers in Vegas, but you can get a take out pizza for $6.  Unheard of.
