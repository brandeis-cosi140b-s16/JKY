Group of 6 on a 4 day vacay in LV
Sunday, 11am, made reservations (didn't seem necessary that early)

Our waiter (so sorry I don't remember his name) was awesome and did an excellent job of guiding us through the all-you-can-eat small plate brunch menu option ($35).  Add in the $5 bottomless mimosas and this was a great dining experience.  Out of our table of 6, 4 of us did the AYCE small plates and we shared them, family-style.  Our waiter suggested that they bring out everything on the AYCE menu for us to try in waves.  I was in 7th heaven!  All the small plates were awesome; my favorites being the pork brisket, fritatta, churro tots, and several others that I can't recall.  And each round of mimosas were something new for us to try: pomegranate, peach, prickly pear, etc.  It was a great experience with an opportunity to try a lot of different items.  I called it a lazy man's buffet because they bring it all to your table!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting so yummy Mexican brunch food.
