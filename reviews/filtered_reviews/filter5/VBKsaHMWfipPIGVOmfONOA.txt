We've been to the Ballantyne version of this restaurant before, but this was our first time at the Dilworth location. I think the menu is similar or nearly identical, but this time we had some items we'd never had before and it was all absolutely fabulous. I had not been expecting it. The appetizer we ordered was something about Pig Wings and it was out of this world. The grilled and glazed pork pieces were exceedingly tender, flavorful and rich. The richness was gorgeously balanced by the acidity of the slaw and pickled red onions. Then I had their fish of the day (mahi mahi) cooked in a unique Spanish style casserole with garlic, pine nuts artichokes and Spanish sweet potato. Incredible. My husband loved his roasted carnitas (pork).  Best food in a LONG time, for a great price
