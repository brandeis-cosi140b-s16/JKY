Mad Mex is my FAVORITE restaurant in Pittsburgh. I go to Mad Mex at least once a month for half-price. Last month I finally finished ordering every vegetarian item on the menu :) I highly recommend you get the pickadippa as your appetizer! And if you're vegetarian I recommend the Thai Curry Burrito or the Veggie Enchilada. The Thai Curry Burrito tastes amazing and is probably the most unique item on the menu. Everything on the menu tastes great EXCEPT for the Jersey Chips. Don't get the chips and I guarantee you'll have a good time.
