I went back today because I was craving the chips and salsa! I stumbled upon a beautiful little money saving sign at the table for a lunch deal :) Any two tacos and half a salad or soup for $9.95. I ordered the shrimp and ahi taco. Both delicious of course. But I am here to praise about the fila salad. The fila salad blew my mouth and mind, it has kale as a base  with jicama, oranges, tomato, avocado, pinto beans, corn, crunchy peas + queso fresco in a quince vinaigrette. It's definitely worth a try! 

I had fantastic service. My water was not even a quarter empty and it was refilled, twice! The place had people in there but it was not during peak times or super busy by any means. I am already planning my next trip but next time starting with dessert.
