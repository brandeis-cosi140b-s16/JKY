This delightful little hole-in-the-wall was wonderful!! Traveling on business, I brought out my trusted friend Yelp to help me decide on lunch.  Mexican sounded good, and the reviews had me excited to try it.

At first, I almost didn't go here, because as I was driving by I questioned whether it was the kind of place safe for a single woman (surrounded by car repair shops, etc) but I decided that nothing on the reviews said anything about it not being a safe neighborhood so I decided to go for it. And so glad I did!!!  

The inside is small, but you really felt transported to south of the border.  I had the diablo shrimp burrito and a tamale.  I always get a tamale at Mexican restaurants to use as my measure of comparison- there's did not disappoint!  The meat was plentiful, and it had good flavor.  And the shrimp inside the burrito was maybe the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  It was plump, moist, cooked perfectly and there were plenty of them!  I couldn't finish the burrito but I did dig through with my fork to make sure I didn't miss any shrimp.  The "diablo" aspect of the burrito definitely made it spicy, but a good spicy.  It wasn't burn your lips off hot, but it was enough to need a refill on my water.  

I also really enjoyed the salsa bar.  It was incredibly fresh, and very clean!  I really liked their tomatillo salsa- it was creamy, tangy, and had the slightest kick of spice.

The service here was friendly and prompt.  The restaurant was clean, though the bathroom door near the knob could stand a quick scrub.  

All in all, this place was incredible!!!  If I'm ever back this way again, I will absolutely be back.
