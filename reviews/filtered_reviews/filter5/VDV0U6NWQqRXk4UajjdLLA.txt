So good!  We went on Mother's Day and the place was packed, but we only waited about 6-8 minutes and the hostess was very apologetic.  The food was wonderful - i got Green Chile Pork Enchiladas and by husband branched out and ordered the Crab Enchiladas which were sweet and savory and so delish.  We well definitely go back soon!
