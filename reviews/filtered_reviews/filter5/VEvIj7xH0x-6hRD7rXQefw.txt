I've been in Vegas for a bit over 2 months. While I haven' t made the effort to go to the strip and try the festivities, I have made the effort to order a margarita at the non strip restaurants along the west side of Vegas with no satisfaction. But I came here on a suggestion by a friend and I have to say that I have found my new margarita place. That's not to say that their drinks are their only point of recognition. There food is delicious and a fairly diverse menu. But what really impressed me, outside of the drink, was the service. All of the service staff was attentive and friendly. I wasn't stuck with my server, everyone made an effort to check up on the table. Whenever we needed something, it was addressed right away. I would highly recommend this to any locals or tourists wanting to try something outside of the strip. Come on in, order some food, and have a drink!
