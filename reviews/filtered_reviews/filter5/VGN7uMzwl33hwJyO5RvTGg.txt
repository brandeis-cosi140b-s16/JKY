This place was wonderful in so many ways! I went with my family and we did the tasting dinner. It was exciting and delicious. Each dish was absolutely delectable.

The service was also very good. This is a 4-star restaurant that is NOT pretentious and makes you feel comfortable and casual. I love it! 

Definitely try to queso fundito. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
