Happy Hour in the bar has crazy good appetizers in huge portions at $3,$5 & $6.00!  Great tasting house margaritas for $2.50 but the best part is this restaurant offers green cilantro rice besides the standard red and you can request your pinto beans whole instead of refried.  Their house salsa has a great roasted tomato flavor too...so much more interesting than the usual around town.  We loved this place as Super-Mex before the name change and were delighted to see they kept the mainstays of the place the same.  It's all good!
