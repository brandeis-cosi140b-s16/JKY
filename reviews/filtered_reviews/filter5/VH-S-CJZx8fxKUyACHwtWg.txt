Amazing hidden gem. This place might look ordinary from the outside, but when you walk in, it's well decorated and very modern. When we went, the owner was there. She was really cool; came to our table and spoke to us. The food is amazing, starting from the chips with salsa. Their menus are very simple, not like other Mexican restaurants that have 1,000 things on the menu but they only do about 10 of the items on the menu. The food has an authentic taste and the beer is served very elegantly. We tasted the  Tres Leche dessert. It's the best cake I have ever tasted in my life! I highly
recommend this place.
