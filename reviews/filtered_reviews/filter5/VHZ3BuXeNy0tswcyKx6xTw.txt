Absolutely awesome food and service. Their Valentines menu was thoughtfully prepared and wonderfully served. The filet with Cabernet sauce should be a regular item on the menu. Hugo is attentive to all the guests and does a great job of describing the specials for the evening. Great place for a romantic dinner!
