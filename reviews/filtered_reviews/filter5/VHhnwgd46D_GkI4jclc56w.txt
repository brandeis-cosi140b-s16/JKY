I had driven by Padre's so many times... and, truly, never even gave it much thought. But, my friend Tiffany had been talking about how much she enjoyed the band that performed there, and that they were doing a 3 Amigos tequila tasting... so we settled upon Padre's for a late dinner last night. I'm so glad we did!!

It was everything Tiffany had said and more! I'm a big fan of carne adovada (grew up in New Mexico) and theirs was the best I've had in a long, long time! Cubes of pork marinated and slow roasted in red chile... It was so tender, it was hard to stab it with your fork and when you did what a reward for your mouth! It just melts! The chile was good (although, I prefer it a little hotter). The portion was generous: a flour tortilla prepares the plate for a heap of the adovada, some ranch style beans and a bit of rice.  I have a feeling I'm going to be craving that again very soon... thank goodness for left overs! (Maybe breakfast?)
