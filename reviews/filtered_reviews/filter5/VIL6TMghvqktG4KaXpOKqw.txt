This is my favorite location of my favorite Mexican restaurant! The food here, like every Lindo is Amazing!!! Like seriously it's so tasty! I believe all of their locations are family owned, and that shows in the quality of the food. Everything feels very homemade, especially the tortillas which you can watch them make through a window. The views from this location are breathtaking! It was a huge glass wall with incredible views of the strip. You will need to make a reservation if you want a table with a view, however, as I've been here countless times and only had a view the one time I made a reservation. The staff here is always curious and I like the music here, they always have musicians, but they aren't too loud or distracting like at some other Lindo locations I've been to. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant, and specifically this location to anyone who would listen!
