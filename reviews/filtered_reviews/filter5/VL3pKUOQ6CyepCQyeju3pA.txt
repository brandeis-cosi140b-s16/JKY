Have been here twice and holy moly, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants for sure. First time I went, there was supposed to be a 45 minute wait, it was very busy, but we were seated much faster than that. The staff was friendly both times I went. Great service.

The food was great, the chips and salsa are tasty, but the margaritas and tacos..oh my goodness. I went for happy hour, which includes half off margaritas, and I think these win as my favorite margaritas. I had the white peach and hibiscus, and have also tried the pomagranate/grapefruit. My boyfriend has tried the blood orange and mango jalepeno and enjoyed them as well. As a vegetarian it is always nice to see a veggie taco on the menu. The ingredients taste fresh and the tacos were very flavorful. I always leave very full and satisfied!

Surprised this place only has three and a half stars, it deserves five in my opinion!
