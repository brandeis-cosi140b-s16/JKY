I've come here at least once a week for some time now and have never had a bad experience.  There's a different crowd from night to night to liven things up, but there's is also a decent amount of regulars.  The staff and patrons alike are great people and there's always good times to be had.  Their menu is varied in style and all delicious. definitely a radd place to spend any night of the week at because here's always some sort of special going on.
