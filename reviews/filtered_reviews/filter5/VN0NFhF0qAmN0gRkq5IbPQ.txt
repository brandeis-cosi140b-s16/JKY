i love El Torito so much. We go here every week, and we get margaritas and food. I usually eat almost all the chips and salsa, an extra bowl of guacamole, and the tortilla shell salad. I love it here. The service is super fast, and friendly. This place is always packed and the service stays on top of things. There will be a wait on busy evenings, but it moves fast. The people who work there are very nice, and always running. They make great margaritas and salsa. The to-go food is great for parties too. Don't shy away from the full parking lot, they will get you in as fast as they humanly can.
