Great place to eat if you want something fast, cheap, and delicious on the Las Vegas Strip.  The fianc√© liked it here so much we had DJ's twice in one day!  From the two visits, we got a chance to try their tacos, nachos, burrito, and churros.  ALL the meats were cooked to tender perfection and flavored wonderfully.  LOVE the churros--they're cooked to order so you get them piping hot!  Awesome value in Vegas (especially if you lost a few Benjamins gambling like I did)!
