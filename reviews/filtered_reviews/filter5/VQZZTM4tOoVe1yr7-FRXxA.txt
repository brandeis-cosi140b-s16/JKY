I loved the food here, I'm a vegetarian and enjoyed the  veggie burrito, veg taco and the flan.. We loved every bite.. They use organic veggies. The ambience is good and service friendly. They offer free tortillas n salsa for appetizers and fill it unlimited. Given the organic ingredients it is reasonably priced. We look forward to them opening a store in Denver, Colorado.
