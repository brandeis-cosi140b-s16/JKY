I love Nando's!

The staff is quick and attentive. The restaurant itself does a lot of work in the community by donating portions of their sales to various nonprofits in the Valley. Last time I was there is was Sunshine Acres Children Home. 

If you are going with a friend I recommend that you get the Mini Combo Platter, you get a little bit of everything and they serve their delicious Jalapeno Cream Cheese, sour cream mix with it, which is not on the menu, so if you want to order something and try it you have to ask for it. 

Their drinks are delicious, Prickly Pear Margarita is one my favorites. There is indoor and outdoor seating and its never noisy.
