I go here a bit as it's in walking distance of my home. I generally always do the same thing so I'm really on speaking towards that. I sit at the bar which is generally never full during the day. They have decent Mexican beers on tap so that keeps me happy - Dos Equis, Victoria, Pacifico, Modelo off the top of my head. I can't speak towards the cocktails. I'm not a big cocktail drinker, but I've heard their's are a bit underwhelming given the price. 

Food - I stick with the tacos. I get two and a side. Never disappointed and highly recommend any of them. Salmon may be my favorite. 

Also, it would be very remiss of you to not try their coconut soft serve. I get the tropical fruit one and add fruity pebbles. It's pretty damn delicious.
