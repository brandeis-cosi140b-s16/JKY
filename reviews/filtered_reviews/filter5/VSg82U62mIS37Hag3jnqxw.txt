By far one of the best restaurants in the city, if you are looking for a one of a kind spot, this is it.  There is a great authentic mexican flavor to their food and they have amazing Tequila's that keeps you coming back for more.  

The staff are friendly and the service is always remarkable.  I have been going there for years, and I still can't leave without having their Shrimp Tacos  as an appetizer.  Their Filet is a must on your first visit if you like steak and definitely order the Guacamole which is prepared at your table!  

Great Sunday Brunch!

The rest I will leave to your experience and I hope you will agree.
