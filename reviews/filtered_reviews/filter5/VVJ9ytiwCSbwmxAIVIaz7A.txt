I have lived in Scottsdale for more than 20 years, but I first became acquainted with SOL while visiting relatives in Newport Beach, CA. Much to my surprise, SOL was opened in the upscale shopping center--Scottsdale Quarter--just minutes from my home. What a find and nice surprise. 
Not a traditional Mexican Restaurant but a vibrant establishment which serves a variety of food with Mexican food as its base. We had the steak and shrimp combination and the duck as our two entrees along with excellent guacamole and chips. All three menu items were recommended by our excellent sever, Tracy.  She been at SOL since opening day--two years ago--and knows the menu inside and out.
So, for service, food and ambiance we couldn't have had a better experience. By the way, the quantity of food allowed us to take home some of each plate for an excellent at home dinner the next evening.
