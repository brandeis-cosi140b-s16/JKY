Oh my, What a great meal!
I would suggest reservations, or go early
Our server was great he gave us great ideas from the menu.  We had 2 margs each. The were both yummy, 12 to 16 bucks each, they better be be huh. 
We had the guacamole, excellent and simple recipe. Then we split the azul plate crab enchalda, relleno, and taco, i also ordered a chicken taco on the side. Because Im always afraid of leaving hungry. The food was so rich and delicious we could barely finish. Yeah, its a little pricey, but great food, great service,  great experience. What more could you ask for on the strip. Cant wait to visit again
