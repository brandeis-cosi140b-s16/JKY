Just great authentic Mexican food! Also I didn't know that you could have your flour tortillas made chimichanga style..don't laugh, I apparently lived a sheltered life about this. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The dining area was clean and plenty of parking. Check this place out if you have the craving.
