This was recommended to me by a fellow Las Crucen who knows what good mexican food should be.  I am very picky with my mexican food in Arizona, so I was doubtful about Frank & Lupe's, but it did not disappoint!  If you can & it's not too hot, try to sit on the back patio.   You will feel as if you have been transported to Mexico.   The red chile is flavorful, about as close to mine & my mom's.  They have Victoria beer on tap, which you don't find anywhere.  This is legit New Mexican food!
