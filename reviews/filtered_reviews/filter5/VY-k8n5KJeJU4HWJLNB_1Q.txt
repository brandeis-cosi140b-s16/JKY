We've been going to this place for a couple years now, and things are changing, though not necessarily for the better/worse. The menu is now pared down to Fusion, Korean, or Mexican, where it used to be more expansive. Your fusion favorites are still on the menu, and that's the real reason to go to this restaurant, anyway!

Free chips & salsa/guacamole still exists, and I love it. The guac is simple and delicious, and is a perfect appetizer. 

This time I had the Fusion Enchilada Plate w/ Chicken Bulgogi ($7.50 - great pricing). Meat wrapped in fried corn tortillas topped w/ red sauce, cheese, rice, and fresh produce. Tasty and filling, but not the best item on their menu. For that I would go with...

The Fusion Burrito w/ Beef Bulgogi ($6.75). I feel like the entire restaurant revolves around the aura of this burrito. It is spicy, it is fresh, it has green and caramelized onions, pico de gallo, and cilantro in it. It is incredible. I highly recommend making use of the hot sauces they have (sweet chili and green tomatillo are my favorites). If you're looking for the true Korean-Mexican fusion experience, go with this menu item. 

Sober, hungover, and anywhere in between, we'll be back!
