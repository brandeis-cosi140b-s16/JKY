I started looking for Mexican food restaurants in my new neighborhood and found what looked like a good bet.  One that has a cozy dining room, friendly staff and great food.  I tried the Stack  with a house margarita.  The margarita had to be really good for me to order a second one.  The Stack is on the Happy Hour menu with a whole lot of other tasty offerings.  Chips and salsa was fresh and great with the drink while waiting a short time for the Stack to be cooked to order.  Everything is cooked from scratch, which is what I look for.  Looking over the reviews beforehand, I felt it would be a great choice because new owners came in and worked hard to turn Secreto around, nearly all the not so great reviews were pretty much coming from the previous owner who must have lost heart in making it be the best it could be.  There's a great difference in quality when the whole staff has their heart into it, doing everything they can to earn repeat business.  I'm certainly going to be a repeat customer as the variety, cleanliness, cheerfulness makes Secreto very special.  Now to catch as many of their specialties I can.  Enjoy!
