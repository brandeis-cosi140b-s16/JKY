I went to Yayo Taco for the first time today on a recommendation from a friend. He told me to expect fusion style tacos, I was like "what?" Yayo Taco specializes in Mexican classics with an ethnic twist. I don't really know how to explain it in any other sense. Anyway, I'm a student at UNLV. Which is great because five dollars buys me 4 tacos, cantina style, and two sides with my rebel card. Great deal even if the food was sub-par...

I walk in, I'm greeted by this loco cashier named Jonathan. He's a friendly guy who seems to know at least a fact or two about every beer in the fridge; there are hundreds... He set me up with a DogFish Midas Touch after we talked for a minute; great choice man! But it's a sweet beer and not for everyone. I ordered two pollo tacos and two veggie tacos, sweet p fries and quinoa salad. A touch choice considering the menu has pretty good variety.

Pollo tacos: braised chicken with a mole marinade topped with a tomatillo salsa, amazing depth of flavor, I typically don't like the bold taste or a traditional mole, but it wasn't a traditional mole, just mild enough for me. I'll order these every time I come back. Next time though, I'll omit the salsa. I didn't like it but it was easy enough to push aside.

Veggie tacos: spinach, peppers, onions and other ish served with a cream sauce. Very delicious, consistent option. Fresh veggies, good sauce, etc.

Quinoa salad was fresh, sweet p fries were good if not just a little bit on the salty side...

This place was features on diners drive-ins and dives, which didn't factor into my decision but it's worth mentioning. I took a peek in the kitchen and the owner (who was on the show) was working side by side with his staff, a quality I look for in $ - $$$ restaurants. 

Overall: five stars, no complaints, I'll amend my review as I try more dishes...

Great...
-Service, eating within fifteen minutes, front of house knows their ish
-Atmosphere, cool beach cantina theme, surf boards cover the ceiling
-Food, look above
-beer,wine,tequila: how may I help you?

In conclusion, I'll be back, maybe every day...
