I've been coming here for years and I just love Valle Luna.  I am probably being generous with the stars, but over the years it has never let me down for a tasty Mexican meal.  It's casual dining and the bar is pretty fun to grab a bite on the weekends. This will always be an old stand by for me. 

Okay, so I do have to mention one negative.  On my last visit the waiter was actually text messaging at the table!  It was weird to try and talk to a waiter while he was text messaging, not to mention that when he walked up to the table he greeted us with "Oh, shit...hi."  Since this is the only time I've experienced bad service, I am not too worried.  Actually, it was more funny than it was bad.
