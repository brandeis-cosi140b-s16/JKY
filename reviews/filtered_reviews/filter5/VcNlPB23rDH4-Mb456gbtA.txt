Fantastic!!! *********** 
The biggest sales point about Taco Guild is the cool building.  Its everything you've heard about on other reviews.  A wonderful inner city rehab. & preservation of a Church building that has been made into a beautiful restaurant!  The very unique features from the stained glass window and old woodwork with large overhead chandelier are very nice and different than other food places serving traditional az/mexican fare.  Super bar setup with tons of local beers specialized margaritas & a tequila menu to be challenged by only a few!!  

The food is great. The price even better with the daily taco 1.99 special each along with the drink specials it's a great meal at a shockingly reasonable priced chow!!  Large selection of specialized taco's  that are made like high end culinary tacos.  They all have unique and wonderful flavors with the combinations.  When was the last time you had a lamb or duck taco's.  They serve 4 types of salsa all hand made in the kitchen that are all very unique and excellent!  We had the Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef taco.  The Corn on the Cobb was off the hook as Guy would say on TV. Very classed up place too. Justin was the manager and he was super with us as first timers and offered a lot of help and conversation on the menu and tequila's in the guild.  Super friendly staff. The ambiance is top-notch and they have a very nice outside patio that has a cool mist setup too.They have sourced AZ things like beer and raw items from local farmers for their current produce! That alone makes me come back for the tacos all the time
Justin has a great management style and I would suggest coming during a happy hour off time when less crowded like a Sunday afternoon!  Can wait to bring my Norwegian family here for this outstanding well priced food and drinks!!!
