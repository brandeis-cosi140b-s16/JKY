I have to say, this is probably my favorite restaurant ever. The service is always amazing, the food is sooooo good, and me and my family have been coming here for at least 10 years and we always pick this as our birthday dinner. When its your birthday they give you a free tequila shot and churros. I have only gotten the same thing every time I've been there which is gulf shrimp, wrapped in bacon and deep fried, holy heaven... And the sauce they give you to dip the shrimp is addictive, i dip everything in it, i would dip my shoe in there and it would be delicious. They give you this soup in the beginning with tiny noodles, and a chicken/tomato broth that's so awesome. And also the chips, salsa and bean dip they start you off with is so good, be careful or you'll get filled up before your food comes. All in all you never have to wait for your drink to be filled, great service and awesome food. Maybe a little expensive but worth it!
