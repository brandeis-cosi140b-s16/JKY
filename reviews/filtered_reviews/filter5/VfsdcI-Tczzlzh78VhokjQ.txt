Saw on vegaseaters.com that Jaburritos was coming to Vegas and couldn't wait to go try this restaurant! I love eating sushi and they did not disappoint! The prices are fair and the fish was fresh. We tried the long beach, rock port, & janachos with redondo special. I'd definitely recommend my friends to go here and will be coming back as a frequent customer.
