Loved everything about the tacos, especially the sweet pulled pork. Fresh handmade tortillas also taste delectable. If I had any drawbacks it would be that they are sort of stingy with toppings/sauces. Otherwise you are best advised to come here on Taco Tuesdays for $1.50 tacos and buy a lot of them! Sweet pulled pork is out of this world!
