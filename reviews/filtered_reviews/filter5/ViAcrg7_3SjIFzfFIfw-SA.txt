BEST TACO PLACE IN VEGAS THUS FAR!

Yes, I think it's better than El Gordo's. It's the same concept, but cleaner and trendier. Lines are shorter, and the food is not as salty. So definitely better in every way shape and form.

First of all, I love the ambiance. It's young, hip, trendy, fun. Totally casual date worthy

Food is excellent!  You have to get in different lines for different meats but the lines are reasonable and service is efficient and friendly. It's also nice that the meat dudes all speak reasonable English since my Spanish isn't the best and it's nice to be able to ask questions. 

EVERYTHING I've had has been delicious. Personal favorites are al pastor with extra pineapples, and carne asada. and the MEXICAN CORN!!! LOVE.

This is my new favorite taco joint in town. Thanks Taco y Taco.
