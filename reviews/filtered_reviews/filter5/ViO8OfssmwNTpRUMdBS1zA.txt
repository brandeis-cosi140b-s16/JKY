Probably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Certainly better than anything I have had in recent memory. 

The complimentary chips and salsa with bean dip were all excellent. They also brought a plate of grilled jalape√±os and onions, which were also a nice accompaniment. 

I normally don't care for Fideo soup, but it was great! And entrees were equally as tasty.

Drinks were reasonably priced and dinner was finished off with cinnamon "chips" covered in chocolate and caramel.  

Excellent! Ate here at 6pm on a Sunday night. Very busy when we arrived, but cleared out by 7pm.  Will DEFINITELY be back.
