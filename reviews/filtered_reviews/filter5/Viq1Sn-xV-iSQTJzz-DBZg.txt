Found this place by accident and loved it! Looks like a little hacienda, friendly staff and, oh yes, the food. I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob having grown in Texas, but the food here is awesome! Love the bean dip, love the fresh salsa, love the guacamole...after all that I only had room for a cheese enchilada plate...that was great. Will be back soon!
