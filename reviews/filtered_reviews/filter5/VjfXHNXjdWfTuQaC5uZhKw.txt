Love this place.  If I wasn't on the opposite side of the continent I'd go there all the time.  They start you out with a basket of smoking-hot fresh chips and salsa that's spicy enough to hurt but so tasty you can't stop eating it.  Everything I've eaten there has been good.  My favorite thing to get is a machaca burrito.  Excellent rice and beans come with it.  I go every time I'm in Arizona and I wish I was there right now!
