Been going here for a long time, and am completely enamored with the food, service, prices and family-run atmosphere every time.  I take everyone that visits there for a taste of 'real mexican food' and it's one of the only places I love enough to review.  

The prices are great, and the food is both incredibly tasty and remarkably consistent from visit-to-visit.  I honestly don't know why, but it's also the only Mexcan restaurant where I always leave feeling full in a good way - I've never felt the typical pains associated with overeating after leaving, even when I've certainly gotten too full. 

I recommend the Enchiladas, beef tacos and tamale in their #12, or the steak gorditas in #13.  They're slammed during lunch on weekdays so get there by 11AM or after 1PM.
