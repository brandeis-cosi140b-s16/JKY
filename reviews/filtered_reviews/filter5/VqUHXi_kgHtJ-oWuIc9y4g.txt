This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to. It's like entering a cave, or cavern. The menu has lots of New Mexico inspired dishes. I went for happy hour. The drinks were great! I had some happy hour appetizers including the potstickers and they were devine. They had a wonderful sauce to dip them in. I also had a shredded chicken quesadilla. It was packed with chicken and cheese. The service was great and the food was too! This is a cool spot to hang out.
