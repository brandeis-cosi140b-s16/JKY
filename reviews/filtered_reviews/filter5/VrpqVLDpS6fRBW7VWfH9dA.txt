All of my co-workers raved about this place and I finally had the opportunity to try it at lunch.  Wow, this was the most amazing burrito I have ever had.  For me, the flavor was out of this world.  There are other chain restaurants that make burritos that should shudder.  This place rocks.  I have only been two times and am entirely hooked.  the green pork burrito is my favorite so far.  

One piece of advice, if you plan on stopping in for your lunch break (12 p.m.), I would order in advance to save you time in line and waiting for your order.  Seating is all outside, Beach House says it all.
