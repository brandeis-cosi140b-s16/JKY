Good food, standard pricing for tapas, good selection, great service. Server assumed we hadn't had tapas before and gave us some general ideas about ordering a selection of different items and sharing. I think they brought us one item that we didn't order, but it looked so good we ate it anyway. Really good sliders & Spanish coffee (alcoholic.)
