We chose to go the unconventional route and had our 30+ person wedding rehearsal dinner at Komex. Lynda was a pleasure to work with and made things so easy for us. We sent her a menu of what we wanted and an explanation of how we wanted the tables/chairs configured and her and the staff executed things perfectly. They did an amazing job staying on top of any additional orders we had to put in, clearing away plates, and keeping our buffet table clean and organized. 

I frequent Komex regularly and what I was most impressed by was their ability to present us with the same high quality food throughout the night since our party was so large, and they had other guests inside the restaurant that they were serving. We got a lot of bang for our buck here and I'm so glad we could share something we love about Vegas with our out-of-town guests. 

Bonus: they now have a TV inside and since the NBA playoffs were going on, guests didn't have to miss out on the games. 

Now that the wedding is over, I'll definitely be back to Komex for my favorite fusion cheesesteaks!
