I'm pissed. Now that Man vs. Food has shown my favorite little hole-in-the-wall spot to the world, word is officially out!  I've actually had to -gasp!- wait for a table. Twice. Ugh. ;)

Seriously though - how could someone not love Los Reyes?  They have prompt, courteous service and the food is awesome.  Portions are large, and we always end up with food for the next day.  I love that the waitresses always remember to put extra salsa in the take-out bag.  It is some tasty stuff!

Favorites of ours include:

Mexicana Torta
Chicken Tinga Quesadilla del Estilo
Hawaiian tacos - I love pineapple and ham in anything! 
Carne Asada tacos
Lime Agua Frescas
Mango/Coconut Licuados 

Do yourself a favor and get yourself down to Sunnyslope to check this spot out.  The prices are ridiculously good, and the food is authentic and just freakin' delicious.  Don't miss it.
