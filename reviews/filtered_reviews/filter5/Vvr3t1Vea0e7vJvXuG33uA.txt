My wife and I grew up in Mesa and so we, like everybody else, ate Mexican food at the same few, well known restaurants, but now that we know about Casa Ramos, we really don't visit the old places much. From the chips and salsa (try asking for the green salsa), to every single different item we have tried on their menu we have been totally satisfied. Great food, great service, great prices.
