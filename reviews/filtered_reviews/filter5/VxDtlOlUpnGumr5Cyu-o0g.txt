Visited Nacho Daddy on a very hot summer day. Ordered the quest dip (fantastic) and two of us had the Mexican Cobb Salad (refreshing and filling). The dressing on the salads was delicious. The hostess and, Kim, our server were both friendly and excellent. We will definitely return to try other menu items. Or, order the Mexican Cobb again!
