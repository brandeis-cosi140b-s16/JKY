I went here on a whim with my co-workers and made the mistake of eating a free quesadilla from my workplace. My co-worker Tucker had been talking very highly of this place since I had met him and how awesome the food was and he didn't disappoint. The Manager introduced herself and made us feel at home she was very friendly and knowledgeable of the food. I got some chicken tacos and sparkling strawberry lemonade. We had order after order of food it seemed like the food didn't stop. First the guacamole came it was the most amazing guacamole I had. I almost cried from happiness. It was fresh and delicious..I'm salivating as I think about it.
