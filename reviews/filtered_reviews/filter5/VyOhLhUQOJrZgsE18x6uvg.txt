Wanted to try something new. Site seems tucked away in the touristy old town, which made me happy we discovered it. Atmosphere was great, had dinner and sat on the patio with the open sky and gas fire going. Service was wonderful. The guacamole was delicious along with the pork appetizer. We also recommend the beef skewer appetizer. We added the foie gras but didn't see it added so the waitress brought out a whole new app with it at no charge. The house margarita is the best I have had in old town. Everything tastes savory, fresh and delicious.
