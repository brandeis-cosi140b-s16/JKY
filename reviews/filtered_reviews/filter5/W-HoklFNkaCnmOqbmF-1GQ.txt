Hit this place up with a large group of friends on New Years Eve. It's become our tradition to have Mexican food before we hit the town on NYE, so we've tried many places on the strip. We were all very pleased with everything we ordered. Last year we went to Boarder Grill @ Mandalay, which was also very good, but I have to say T&T has them beat in my book! 

No one could stop eating the fresh made chips & guac. The watermelon cooler I ordered to drink was dangerously good. Most of us cleaned our plates & those who stopped short only did so out of fear of looking bloated in their NYE best. :-)

Our waiter was great fun & very friendly. 

We stayed at the Luxor & so I noticed they had live Mariachees (sp?) for Sunday brunch. Would love to try it again the next time I'm in town.
