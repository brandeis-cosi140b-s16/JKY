Excellent food.  We ordered 4 different kinds of tacos and all were simply superb.  You must hit the salsa bar in the back wow there are some great creations back there.  We must have made 5 trips.  Service is super friendly and fun.  Margaritas not bad.  Come for the food the decor is fun but overall not over impressive. When back in Phoenix I'll be back soooo good!
