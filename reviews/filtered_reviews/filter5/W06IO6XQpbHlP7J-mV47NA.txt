Just stopped eating meat, and not because I don't like the taste... believe me, I miss this carne asada a lot... but it gave me a reason to try the bean and cheese burrito - DELICIOUS!  And it says there's no lard it in... I didn't know what to expect (I thought the lard was what gave the beans that buttery good flavor), but WOW - best bean and cheese burrito I've ever tasted!  Slightly different flavor, but it's wooonderful.  

That burrito, with the salsa that comes when you order chips, and a mexican bottled coke... preeetty much as good as it gets.
