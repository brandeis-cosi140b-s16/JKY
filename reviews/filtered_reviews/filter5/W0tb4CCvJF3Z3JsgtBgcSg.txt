Heaven, thy name is El Dorado. 
Like its namesake, the food is golden. 

Everything we had (and we ate A LOT) was incredible. 
The margaritas were hand crafted & some of the best I've ever had, anywhere. 
(Whaaaa? Yes. I speak the truth.) 

The fact that it shares a wall & parking lot with Sapphires adult entertainment/strip club, might turn some people off (or on...whatever you're into, not here to judge).
Keep an open mind, though. 
The food is incredible. Totally worth it. 

And, (but wait, there's more!) there are always cabs in the parking lot for the strip club patrons, so there's no shortage of rides (cab rides...can't promise you anything as far as the club goes) back to your hotel or next destination.
