We thoroughly enjoyed our Tasting Dinner at Border Grill LV!  The entire team is terrific.  Our server was Ryan.  His service was as delightful as his British accent. One of the managers, Melanie, also  came to our table.  During our visit, she  said she loves her job and it definitely showed.  

Chef Juan came out to chat with us numerous times during the  8 courses.  We loved them all...from the Smoked Brisket Taquitos  with layers of flavors and the plantain empanadas that were crispy on the edges and sweet inside...to the Surf & Turf with Kobe beef.  What a special treat!!!  We also appreciated the beautiful presentation of the Steelhead salmon placed atop saut√©ed greens on one side and the mashed potatoes with whimsical tortilla strips on the other.  (The tortilla chips looked like candles in the mashed potatoes.)  For dessert, the carrot cake with passionfruit puree was scrumptious but we just had to take that home so as to not explode right there in the restaurant. 

My husband is a teaching chef and I am often his sous chef.  As such, we know our foods.  The Tasting Menu at Border Grill is a flavorful gourmet experience.  Come hungry because although the servings are small, you will be stuffed at the end.  

Bon Appetit!
