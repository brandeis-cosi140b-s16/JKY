I am very pleased with Hacienda's, especially for a restaurant that just opened about a month ago. The interior is very new and clean and the bar in the middle is very nice. They also have another bar at the front that can serve the patio which wraps around the front. The chips are good, especially the little green ones and their salsa is very tasty. They even made an extra hot sauce for me.

The bar staff is excellent and very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with $2.50 drafts and $5 appetizers (love the street tacos).  M-Sat 3-6. The margarita tasted fresh and like a marg should.

Dining there is nice and we have had good service each time. Authentic mexican music plays in the background and makes the experience feel right. The sizzling fajitas are very tasty. I will continue to have good times here.  Not sure what some of the low reviewers are talking about. I suggest giving the place another chance now that they have had some time to settle in.
