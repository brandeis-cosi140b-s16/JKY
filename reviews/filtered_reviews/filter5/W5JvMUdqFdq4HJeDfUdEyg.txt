I love this Ricardo's. It has been around since I was a little kid! They have great chips, salsa and they serve bean dip for free. And the Margaritas are the bomb! 

They have a lunch buffet, but I also go with the enchiladas or the combo plate. I love love the pork tamales. The corn isnt too dry and the meat is nice and tender. The shredded chicken tacos are also very yummy. Good solid Mexican food any day of the week.
