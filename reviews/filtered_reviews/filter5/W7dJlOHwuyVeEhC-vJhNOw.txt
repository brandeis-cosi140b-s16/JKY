We come here quiet often for taco Tuesday and LOVE it! Tried just about everything on the menu and haven't had anything we didn't like! They're fast when they're not busy and when it is busy it's just a little bit longer wait. Free chips and salsa when you check in on yelp. Good vibe and nice clean restaurant!
