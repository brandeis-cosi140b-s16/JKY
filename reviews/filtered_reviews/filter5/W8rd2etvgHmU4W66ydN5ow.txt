Wow! Very happy to have stopped here. Had the green chile plate and it was delicious. Tender pork, tangy and slightly spicy green sauce, giant flour tortilla made only seconds before, rice and beans for $8. Don't expect to get your food as quickly as you might at an average taco spot. It's a busy place and they put a lot of care into the food. Worth the wait.
