I bought the Carne Asada Torta at Phat Phrank's and it was amazing. Everything tasted super fresh and flavorful. It's cafe style where you order at the counter, but the service was awesome. The owner came out and personally got us more drinks and stood and talked with us for a moment. The rest of the staff was super friendly and you can tell a lot of love is poured into this food. We were there celebrating a birthday so the owner brought out a dessert he called a Chimicheescake that was soooo good. A flaky shell filled with warm cream cheese drizzled with cinnamon sugar and honey. I will definitely be going back!
