Hands down, the greatest place to spend your Taco Tuesday...or really any day that ends in y.  

The place is casual and charming - very chill vibe and the selection of different tacos is extensive - they're always adding new menu items to try.  My personal faves are the chicken and potato tacos and the chicken or steak nachos, very fresh ingredients.  

The pricing is fair - you're able to eat 3/4 tacos + drink a beer under $10. 

Right by UNLV with plenty of parking and easily accessible.   Perfect place to pre-game a UNLV basketball game.

The owner, Art, is a friendly guy and always down for conversation. Recently threw a friends going away party there and it was a great time.  The new bar side is also great for a group of friends to sit around a catch up.
