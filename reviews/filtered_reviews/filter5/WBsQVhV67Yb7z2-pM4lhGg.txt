This is one of my favorite places to go to! I always order Sweet Pork Barbacoa Quesadilla... it's absolutely wonderful! The pico de gallo and guacamole is always fresh and the little dollop of sour cream they add with it completes the whole meal. The atmosphere is so fun and vibrant. It's a little pricey than other places but well worth it.
