We had an after our rehearsal dinner meet up here with all of our friends who were in town and weren't invited to the dinner. We called ahead and reserved (although not exclusively) the top floor for our party. A bunch of friends decided to stop by before hand for food and were raving about it! The rest of us came over in huge groups from the dinner and the staff was ready for us.

Upstairs, we had two bartenders and the manager informed me that she had chips and salsa out for everyone to snack on...even though we just ate, everyone appreciated the thought and they were gobbled up! The bartenders were bad ass! They handled the massive wave of people like pros and had smiles on their faces the whole time. Thank you guys so much for doing such a great job with our party!

I had actually been here 3 years ago when I first moved and remember really enjoying the food as well, but the decor and service is what reminded me of how great this place is both for just hanging out and having a huge get together. I would highly recommend the top floor for a group like ours as long as you plan ahead and coordinate with their team because they are happy to accommodate and I would recommend stopping in even for a drink since they have some killer margaritas!
