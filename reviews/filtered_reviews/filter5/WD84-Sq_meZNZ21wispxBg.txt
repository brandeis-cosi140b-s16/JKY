I read the article in the PHX New Times and although it wasn't stellar, it peaked my interest. Let me just say, I'm so glad I stopped in for lunch today. I completely disagree with the commentary and urge everyone to try this genuinely cool & hip place that doesn't try to be. The carne asada torta had layers and textures of flavor similar to the ones I've had in Mexico City. I asked for the extra hot salsa and not only was it spicy, but it opened up my taste buds urging me to try something else on their menu. I topped off the torta with a PAZ margarita and it was the right blend of citrus, tequila and umph! One word describes my experience....SABOR! Will PAZitively be back...and spreading the word around town. On top of that, the host and server were top notch. Plus the art is available for purchase!
