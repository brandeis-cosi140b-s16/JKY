A unique Korean twist on Mexican food with a Chinese fortune cookie at the end :P

We had the fried wontons(can't be beat at 5 for $1.50!!), spam masubi with fried egg(comes with 2 masubis), the bulgogi burrito, and bulgogi plate. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly and only cost $25 for everything!! We even had leftovers! 

Free chips with guac and salsa(which is made daily in-house). That guac had to have been my favorite ever! And I eat a lot of guac.

Location is not as convenient but hey, not everything in life is going to be right around the corner from me :)

Definitely will be back and definitely recommend it to all my fellow Yelpers!!
