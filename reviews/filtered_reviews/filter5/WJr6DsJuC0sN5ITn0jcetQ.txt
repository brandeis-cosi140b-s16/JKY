This place is amazing!!  The staff is awesome and the food is out of this world. I have been a life long lover of chipotle but this place is on a level of its own. I suggest doing the steak and pig combo burrito. Their sauces are delicious as well.  I ended up buying a package of their hot sauces to take home. I do not see myself ever going back to chipotle again as long as this is an option.
