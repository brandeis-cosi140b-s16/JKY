I stumbled up to the strip from Motel 6 just to try one of these tacos.  It was well worth the steps and stumbles.  You get 3 tacos and the choices are amazing.  I ordered 1 al pastor and told the nice lady to give me the most popular for the other 2.  There are about 9 choices of fillings, 8 or 9 salsas, and then any popular taco topping.  The best part is that they do have cervesa (beer).  I pulled up to a table out in the common area and enjoyed.  I really forgot what other flavor tacos I had, but I can tell you that they were all fresh, and spiced very well.  I will be back on my next trip.  P.S.- Don't go to the foot massage place there in the plaza, its creepy!
