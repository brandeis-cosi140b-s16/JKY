I love this restaurant!  I love the way it looks outside.  It's a beautiful building and that sign really stands out and makes it easy to find!  The food is great and the staff is very friendly.  It seems like they have a really good rapport with each other which is a great feature to have with staff in the event it is busy.  Server was very knowledgeable and made my experience exceptional.  His name is Wil.
