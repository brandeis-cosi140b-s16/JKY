Let me start by saying the service was fantastic. Our waiter was attentive and funny. Food was great and the portions were quite large. The is a staff member making fresh tortillas in a corner of the room so I know that their food is fresh. I was so full on the appetizer that I didn't need a full dinner. I am fussy about Mexican food and I was very satisified here and will return. The managment staff is present during the evening and I received a very pleasant follow up note from the Owner. This is definately a restaurant that  cares about their customers. This makes for an all around good experience.
In my opinion, once you have found gem like this there is no reason to look elsewhere.
