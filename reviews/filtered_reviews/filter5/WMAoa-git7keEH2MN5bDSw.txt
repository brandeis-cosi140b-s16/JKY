Whoa, get the breakfast burrito with chorizo!

This place is just up the road from one of our offices in Tempe.  On Taco Tuesday's, you can get street tacos for $1.  The line apparently wraps around the building.

Located in a strip mall, the restaurant itself is very clean and modern.  Awesome paintings and decor throughout.

It took about 10 minute for 2 breakfast burritos to be made and served, but it was well worth the wait.

Upon unwrapping the steamy beast, it just looked like a regular burrito.  Biting into the flour tortilla released a perfect blend of cheese, chorizo, egg, and potatoes that sent the taste buds into a wild Jarabe Tapatio.

The heat from the chorizo lingered long enough to warrant another few bites.  Within three minutes, the burrito vanished into the neglected pits of my stomach.

This place warrants a pit stop if you're cruising into or out of Phoenix.
