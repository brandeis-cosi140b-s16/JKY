Went with the family for dinner. Had the bean dips and salsas all very good. Salsas were spicy for me but most others liked them. I had the cucumber and avocado torta and is was awesome!! Black beans also awesome! Everyone else had tacos and they liked them along with their beans and rice! Kids loved the cinnamon icecream! Very cute atmosphere!! We will all be back:)
