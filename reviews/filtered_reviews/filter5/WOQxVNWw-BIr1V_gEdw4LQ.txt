I am a Houston native and let me tell you I know Mexican good and this place is fantastic. If you are looking for spicy salsa order the Roma Habanero salsa. I had the burrito con pollo and the burrito with steak the two times we went and it was so delicious plus I loved the ranchero salsa they topped the burrito with. My husband had the torta the first time we went and it was amazing. Maybe a little more Cuban than Mexican because of the jam but still one of the best I have ever had and came with homemade potato chips absolutely to die for. The second time we went he had the nachos linkable and the chips were thick and baked to perfection so they did not get soggy. The cheese and sauce the chicken. Was cooked in was also fabulous. We did not have any of the drinks however what we saw they looked amazing and I definitely will have to.go try a prickly pear margarita before we head back home. The restaurant was very cute hole in the wall like something you would see in Austin. Loved every bite of it!
