Went here for cinco de mayo today and was overwhelmed with excitement that this location is finally open in Gilbert!!! 
We were greeted by a super hip and friendly hostess that seated us inside at one of the roomy booths. I ordered an unsweetened passion fruit iced tea that needed no sweeter at all. Yum! The waiter told us that they have one of the largest tequila selections in the country so if you are in the market for a margarita, this is definitely your spot. 
Started with the guacamole. It had a wide variety of ingredients that were unique to your normal run of the mill guac. They could add an extra avocado half to the mix to increase the portion size, but the flavor was packed in! 
We had the tacos and to my pleasant surprise, they were on sale because it was "taco Tuesday"! Bonus! So I split an order with my Dad. He got the barrio pollo and I got the shrimp and grilled fish. All delicious in their own distinct ways. Be warned that they are small, about the size of your palm. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and black bean kids meal for my son and it was plenty of food. 

Since they just opened, they don't have the full menu available yet, so I am looking forward to coming back and updating my review after trying an entree!
