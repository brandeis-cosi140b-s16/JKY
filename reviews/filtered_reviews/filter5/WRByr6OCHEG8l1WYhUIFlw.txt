After looking at other reviews I was skeptic of how this place would be, but gave it a try based on the menu. I'm glad I went despite others bad experiences because this was fantastic. We had the 18 noodle and the Mongolian Beef Lettuce, both incredible. If you're looking to get full it's going to cost you a lot, but if you're looking to try a few things tapas style it's fantastic. I highly recommend it.
