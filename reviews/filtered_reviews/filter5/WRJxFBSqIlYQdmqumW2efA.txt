Nothing in Phoenix compares to Dick's. Although it might be too small to be called intimate, there is nothing small about their cooking skills. Big League!  

The New Mexican menu is authentic and the flavors indescribable. Their daily specials are not to be ignored. They have a rotating assortment of craft beer, killer Bloody Marys, and a good wine list.  The bartenders are great too.

Brunch, Happy Hour, special dinner plans, Dick's Hideaway is a triple threat treat.
