The service & food here are great. I have always gotten the salad but have tried the chicken, pig and beef. All are excellent. I love the corn salsa and the guacamole is excellent. I am in love with the coconut bark. The name is misleading, because I don't like coconut, but it's this caramel & chocolate bar with a touch of coconut on it. It is quite amazing and I have to keep myself from eating the whole bag. They always have groupons too, so anytime I can save $$, it makes it even better! Mahalo.
