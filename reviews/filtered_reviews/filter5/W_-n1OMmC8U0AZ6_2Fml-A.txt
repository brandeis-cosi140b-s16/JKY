New to the area and I'm pretty picky with my Mexican food. Prefer Tex-Mex to Authentic Mexican. This place is pretty awesome. They serve different options for the guac dip and your server makes it right in front of your table. Very fresh! We came for brunch and it was delicious. I had the Spanish Ham and Egg Torte with Adobo seasoned fries. Reminded me of home (NJ/Puerto Rico). 2.50$ tap beers on Sundays. I just had a great time overall. Server was awesome. Chips and salsa fresh and fantastic. Will be my new bookmark Mexican restaurant.
