This is our family's favorite restaurant for a number of reasons.  First the food is very fresh and always consistent.  My kids get the blackened chicken nachos, which they crave at least once a week.  I typically order the blackened fish tacos, which are outstanding.  My husband recommends the blackened chicken tacos or burrito.  The guacamole is always fresh and delicious.  In addition, they have draft beer and margaritas.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  What more could you ask for!

We always have Gabby as our server.  She is super friendly and remembers exactly what we like to order!
