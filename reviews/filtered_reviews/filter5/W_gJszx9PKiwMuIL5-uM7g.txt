This place has been a favorite spot for my entire family for 27 years now. The family favorite dish here has always been the green corn tamales with super spicy jalape√±o green chilies on top. Other favorites include the cheese enchiladas with green sauce, chicken and beef fajitas, soft tacos, beans and rice w/most dinner orders. Flan for desert. Freshly fried up chips and the spiciest salsa both red and green. If you're into very spicy mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. Truly a cornerstone of traditional PHX mexican food. Delicious!
