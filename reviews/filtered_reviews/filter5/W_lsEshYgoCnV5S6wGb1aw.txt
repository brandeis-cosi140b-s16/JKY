Breakfast burrito's are pretty much my favorite food in the whole world. Fiesta's Country Burrito definitely contributes to this. Fresh tortilla, eggs, potatoes, cheese - add refried beans and their amazing green salsa... it's a beautiful thing, really.   Plus they have the best Dr Pepper ever, the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup. 

It's also friendly, cheap, fast and a three minute drive from my house. LOVE
