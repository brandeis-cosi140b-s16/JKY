From out of town the Bay Area was visiting and went there for the first w/ my friend. We were both very satisfied w/ the service and food. 

We were seated in the bar area.  It was a live atmosphere had Spanish music playing as you watched sport events on big flat TV screens.  There wasn't that many people at first. You don't want the place to be to crowded either.  

We definitely will be coming back again. The food was real good and the prices were reasonable.  Recommend eating at this place.
