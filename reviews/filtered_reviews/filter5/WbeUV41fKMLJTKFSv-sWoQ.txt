I have lived in Phoenix for some 40 years and was not aware of this place until just a short while ago. I have been 4 times in the last three months and have had something new each time, there is nothing i have ordered that i would not order again and it is mighty good chow.  The staff is quite wonderful so I will recommend this place to any and all.
