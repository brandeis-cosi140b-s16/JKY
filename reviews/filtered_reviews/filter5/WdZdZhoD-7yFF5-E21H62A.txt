This is THE BEST Mexican food in the whole world! I literally have been eating there for the past 36 years. The food is different than the greasy cheddar cheese Mexican food that most restaurants serve. This food is fresh, flavorful, and homemade. Mexico City style with the best retried beans. Their beans have won best of Phoenix awards. There is free parking in the lot north of the restaurant (3rd and Mill) even though the lot says to pay. Restaurant customers can park free YOU DO NOT NEED VALIDATION.
