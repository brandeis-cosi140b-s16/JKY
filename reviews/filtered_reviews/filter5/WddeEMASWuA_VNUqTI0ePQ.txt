I love places like Restaurant Mexico!

First of all, the food is amazing!  they have a lighter hand when it comes to the use of flavor conducting fats, not greasy at all!

I have eaten here twice now and it's always great!  the portions are actually people sized not gorilla or elephant size.  You leave feeling full and satisfied without the guilt of gluttony.

I ordered a carne asada taco dinner which was just what I wanted.  It hit the spot.  The tortillas were grilled and had a good toast on them but still soft and chewy.  The carne asada was well seasoned without masking the taste of beef.  The beans were excellent as well as the rice.  I love the horchata but I could have it less sweet.

The second time, i just had the carne asada dinner!  If you are hungry for beef but not need a full on 8 oz of meat...this is the meal!

My rec is to go and enjoy your favorite Mexican meal!
