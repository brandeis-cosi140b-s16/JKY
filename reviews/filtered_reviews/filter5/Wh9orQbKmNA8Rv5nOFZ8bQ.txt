Seafood enchilada and beef fajitas! True, they use imitation crab in the enchilada, but it's really good anyhow.  The red sauce is great.  This sounds a little odd, but the assistant waiters are super great.  Staff on a whole is excellent.  Chips are a little thick and overfried, but salsa is  favorite in town.  Beef fajitas are super duper fresh and best I've ever had. Even compared to places in L.A.  They were out of homemade flour tortillas one night which was disappointing as I'd brought several people from out of town, but fajitas are so good it didn't much matter.  I like to get extra veggies because they are so flavorful, peppers and onions.  Hope y'all enjoy as much as my li'l group of fans do.  Space is big and welcoming.  Desserts are fun too.
