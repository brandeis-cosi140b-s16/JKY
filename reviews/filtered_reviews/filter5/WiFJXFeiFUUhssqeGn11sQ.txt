Awesome tacos! I was one of three white guys in the place and I was wondering what some of stuff on the menu was. If you squirm when out of your comfort zone, this may not be for you...as the Beef Tongue and Beef Head tacos spanked the pork taco!  PS. It is only the Asada line that is to the left...I finally figured that one out.  Everything else is available in the right-side line. I could have gone here everyday I was in Las Vegas. I hope to get back.
