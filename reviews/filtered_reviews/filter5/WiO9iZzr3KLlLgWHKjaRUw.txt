It took me a long time to try this place.  I do have to admit, I am not a big fan of food trucks.  In the back of my mind I wonder how sanitary they are.  Do they have adequate hand washing facilities?  One evening sometime ago I ignored my pre conceived ideas and gave them a shot.  The menu is small; tacos, nachos, burritos and I think maybe hotdogs and hamburgers.  What really caught my eye was the carne asada taco. Maybe one of the best tacos I have tasted and only one dollar each.  Be warned these are on the spicy hot side and I don't usually like spicy hot.  The flavor really is terrific and I quickly forget that my mouth is on fire.
