All the students from UNLV need to get on their longboards and cruise over to this place across the street..Pass by Cafe Rio for some REALLY GOOD food with different style seasonings! The manager Josh..is very friendly and cares about the food and the business..No More boring mexican food for me ...I'm going to Braddah's! ..People need to try this place...the food snd atmosphere are amazing!
