I'm a huge huge fan of Nacho Daddy's first location down on Eastern and was beyond stoked when I saw they opened one downtown. The new location definitely lived up to my expectations. The bartenders and servers were nothing but helpful. I was a little bummed that the nacho selection was missing some of my favorites (Enchilada Nachos), but overall the food was on point and the service was perfect. The girl with the treestar tattoo rocked!.
