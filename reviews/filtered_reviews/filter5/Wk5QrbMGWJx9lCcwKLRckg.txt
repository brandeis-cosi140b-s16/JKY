My friends and I came here for my birthday and loved it. It is a little pricey, but you get quality food that tastes delicious. I highly recommend the tableside guacamole and corn (on the cob). If you're a foie gras fan like me, the duck carnitas empanadas are not to be missed. We finished it all off with the pork shoulder tacos and mahi mahi tacos. It was all great for sharing and I would definitely go back to explore more of the menu.
