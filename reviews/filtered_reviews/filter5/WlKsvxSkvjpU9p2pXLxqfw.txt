Outstanding food! Great service! Super excited for the new Summerlin location!

I would recommend the Cadillac margaritas. BEST MARGARITAS IN VEGAS PEOPLE!
And as for food, I would have to say the Carnitas (#10) is what I usually order and it never fails. Me and my family will definitely be returning soon!!!!
