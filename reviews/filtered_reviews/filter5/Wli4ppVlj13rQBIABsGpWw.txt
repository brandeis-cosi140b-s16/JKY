The Mission is wham, bam, thank you ma'am.  I absolutely love this place.  It's perfect SW food and even more so for the spicy food lover.  When you go for dinner, make sure you get there a little bit early and imbibe in a couple of drinks from their very experienced and knowledgable bartenders.  Yes, they can even make you an Avocado Margarita.  Sounds gross doesn't it?  Give it a try. 

A couple of must-try's on the appetizer menu include the Street Corn (it's a bit sweet but very flavorful) and the Lamb Ribs, which is one of the tastiest things you will ever eat.  The entree menu is filled with several excellent choices- my two favorites are the Chilean Salmon and the Chorizo Pork Shoulder.  Both are melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  Make sure you add the poblano grits for a side.  

As for dessert, well I'm usually back at the bar drinking mine.
