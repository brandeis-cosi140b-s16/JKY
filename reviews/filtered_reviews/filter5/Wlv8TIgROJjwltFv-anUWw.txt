The place is not very impressive, just a small space in a strip mall, but the food was fantastic! I tried barbacoa, carnitas, and carne asada tacos - all were good but the carne asada was my least favorite. There are several options for topping your burritos and tacos, very similar to Chipotle. They also have a small salsa bar with fresh lime wedges, which was a nice touch. I will definitely eat here again!
