After eating Fiesta Burrito, Filiberto's, Los Fav, and all others don't compare. Carne asada burritos from Fiesta are hands down the best I've had in Phoenix after 11 years. Drunk or sober, the food here is craveable to the point where I would give an arm and a leg to eat here one more time.

I've never dined in, nor ordered anything other than carne asada burritos. I've never had a reason to. The tortilla fresh, the meat is tasty, the perfect amount of onion and guacamole, then pour on the green sauce until your heart desires! Do not, I repeat, do not bring a date here unless you have some food fetish and want him/her to know it.

A friend of mine tried telling me that the burritos are bigger if you order in Spanish, but I disagree. Carne Asada is the same in Spanish or English... Super bueno!

Thank you Fiesta Burrito for opening my eyes to what great Mexican carne asada is all about. And also, thank you for ruining my taste buds to lesser quality Mexican restaurants. I am now going through a 12 step program to relieve the addiction you have caused. Writing this review is step 2 and I feel a relapse coming on.
