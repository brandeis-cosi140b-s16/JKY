My new favorite taco shop.  Everything is fresh cooked to order.  The el pastor taco is delicious.  The mexican street corn with mayo, cojita cheese and chili powder is excellent.  They have a salsa bar with pinto and black beans and alot of fresh salsas.  My favorite is the avocado creme which I am addicted too.  The ordering is a little confusing the first time, but after that no problem.  This place is a must try for authentic street tacos.  Never had a bad meal here.
