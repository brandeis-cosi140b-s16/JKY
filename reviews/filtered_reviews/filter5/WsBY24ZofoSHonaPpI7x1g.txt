Other than the fact that I should have brushed up on my Rosetta Stone Spanish Edition before trying to find La Condessa I can honestly say I haven't had better tacos in PHX. 
The place is a little hard to find if it's your first time so after multiple turn arounds and a stop at the Panaderia to ask for directions my colleague and I arrived at taco bliss. 

The meal starts off with an endless bowl of fresh tortilla chips and a salsa bar that would make Bobby Flay  jealous. They had some of the best homemade salsas with a large variety. From your classic Pico De Gallo to a Creamy Cilantro salsa. 

I ordered the two taco platter with a tinga taco and a carne asada Taco. These were both great. The carne asada was a little dry for my taste but with the assist of the homemade salsa's it was a perfect combo. The tinga taco was a perfect combination of slowly cooked shredded chicken and seasoning. My colleague got a carne asada burrito and a tinga taco and was satisfied by both. 

In short if I am looking for a great taco for a good price I am going back to La Condesa.
