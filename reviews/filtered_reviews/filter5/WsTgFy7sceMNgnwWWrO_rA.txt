It may be hard to snag a table at Tako still but if you do it is well worth it. 

The Al Pastor tacos and the Tako taco are my favorite in the city. The flavors are intense, different and most importantly delicious.

While the tacos are the highlight, the guacamole is a strong second. The guac with tuna belly is so fresh and o so addicting. I have easily eaten half of a bowl of it on numerous occasions and I'm not ashamed of that at all, it's just that good.
