I read the reviews before going in and was still couldn't figure out really what to do--seat yourself (because you're not greeted in any way), order at the counter (yet we didn't see menus by the register).... So we stood around awkwardly trying to decide to sit at one of the dirty 2 tops or take a bigger one. There were only two occupied tables when we arrived on a Saturday night. Finally someone came out and waved us to a table, and, in the end, we ordered seated (no "order here" sign either).

When people say it's tiny, they really mean, "this is almost NYC style sit on top of each other or at least have a hard time winding your way between tables".

But let's get down to the food... I had the fish taco and the carne taco. Both were ok. If you're looking for fancy toppings, move along. You get some shredded cabbage from a bag on top of your tacos. That's it. So you have to take advantage of the salsa bar, which is fine. I got the combo, so the rice and beans were included. And they were awesome. The rice was light and fluffy and the beans were amazing.

Hubby had the cochinita pibil burro. We joked that it wouldn't taste nearly as good as the stuff cooked underground in banana leaves but we were so wrong. If food could give you an orgasm, this would do it. Just beans (those super smooth beans again!) and meat in here, and the meat is to die for. Super juicy and flavorful.

And everyone drinking out of giant cups? Yah, it's the horchata. And yah, at $3.99 it's pricey, but it's also the best I've had anywhere. Save it for dessert, because it is that good.

So the service was "eh" (they were scraping chairs along the floor and bumping into me constantly as they rearranged for a large party coming in) and the music was loud but kept cutting out. So why five stars? It was the pork, man, and the horchata. I would stop by for just those two things, and then die happy.
