This is actually the only Mexican place I have been to in Phoenix. Partly because I love this place so much I wouldn't want to find another place. Partly because I fear I won't find another good place I like. 

My BF introduced me to this place (as he introduced me to everything in Phoenix) him and co workers would come here sometimes. It is very good. I have no complaints. I love the setting, the food and the good service! I swear the drink/chip server comes along SO often! He is on top of it ALL the time! Never had a problem with service... one time salt was actually in my margarita (which is weird because I brought a friend here and the same thing happen to her so I'm not sure if they make them like that) but it was fixed pronto. 

The food is good, I am very confident in trying different things on their menu because I have never had anything bad. This is VERY RARE for me. I usually get the same thing when I go to a place more than once. 

I lived in San Antonio for several years so I know good Mexican food, and this place is pretty comparable. :)
