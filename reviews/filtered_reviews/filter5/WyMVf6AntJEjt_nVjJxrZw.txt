If you want great food, atmosphere and a friendly spot, then The Mission is the place to go. 

I happened to stumble upon this intimate restaurant one evening in old town Scottsdale and was so surprised to find this hot spot. It's literally in a old mission and chef Matt Carter from Zinc Bistro serves up great tasting Latin American cuisine. The atmosphere is cozy and the decor is impressive. 

I would classify their menu items as more tapa style and it's a little pricey but worth it. I'm a huge fan of their table-side guacamole and their smokey flavored salsa is to die for. The shrimp anticuchos (skewered shrimp) are excellent. I would recommend the tecate skirt steak tacos served on hand made corn tortillas but the pulled-pork is also excellent. The portions are small and if you are used to large, hearty portions, then I would not recommend this place; however, I enjoy more tapa style because you can sample more of their delicious menu items. 

Don't forget to check out their extensive tequila selection and their Spanish wine list; the sangria is excellent as well. 

I would definitely recommend this quaint spot for any event, date or outing and the staff are friendly and remembered my name the second time I walked in. Everyone is very friendly and it's well worth every penny.
