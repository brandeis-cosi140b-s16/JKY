I have seen some pretty bad reviews about this place, but I am not going to be writing one of "those". This restaurant left me happy, well fed and highly impressed. I will however point out the few things that may turn certain types of eaters off. First off, it is very loud inside, not just because of the live music (which was upbeat and entertaining, although maybe a little corny at times) but also because this restaurant seems to be very popular, and for good reason! The parking is a little tight too, so I recommend going at a normal dinner time (5 or 6 o'clock), rather than the classic "8 o'clock" time that one might normally take a date to dinner. Insignificant gripes aside, Lindo Michoacan is a fantastic restaurant! The servers were attentive, helpful in every way, were happy to help explain the dishes and also accommodating (had one person in my party who had specific needs) in an understanding and respectful manner. The menu is gargantuan, which some people may not like, but I personally appreciate having options. You can go to their website and review the menu in advance if you want to save time. 
Now for the food... I was in a party of five, we all had different dishes, everything came fairly quickly and every member of my party made ZERO complaints (believe me, I was with people who would have complained had they had reason to)! Tortilla chips and an assortment of dips were provided very shortly after being seated. Upon request (do so immediately!) they will make guacamole right at your table, I think it was $6 for the guac dip but I tell you it was worth every penny. I cannot speak for my companions' dishes but my dish, the chipotle chicken was cooked perfectly, portioned well and hot damned delicious!
But alas, my review has dragged on too long. If you are still reading, please ignore the whiners and nay-sayers. Give this place a try. It is highly unlikely that you will regret it, unless you are one of "those" ;)
