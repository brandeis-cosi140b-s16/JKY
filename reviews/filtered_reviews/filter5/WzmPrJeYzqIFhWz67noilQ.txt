YUM!  You must go here to eat if you are in the mood for any of the 4/5/8 items on the menu.  My only wish is that they offered a vegetarian burger.

We tried:
The Stand burger with fried jalapenos, bacon and gluten free bun.  My husband LOVED it.

Veggie taco was amazing.  The yellow squash topped with pickled cabbage, cilantro and cojita cheese.  Squeeze the fresh lime on top.  Mmmmmm.... I didn't receive any salsa which I wish I had but it was still very good.

French fries were outstanding.  I was worried since some reviews stated pepper on them.  I do not like pepper but these were perfectly sliced and perfectly fried and seasoned.  So good.  I wish I could have eaten more of them.  Was to full for the two of us to finish the serving.

Chocolate Chili milkshake was strange.  A Mexican hot chocolate flavor with cinnamon.  I don't care for cinnamon.  The burn when it went down your throat was exciting though.  Hubby wouldn't put it down.  He was in heaven.

Salted Dulce De Leche milkshake was so so so good.  Can't wait for another one.

We had a groupon or deal chicken or something and hope to see another one soon but will be back either way.

It was HOT and we were forced to sit outside on the air conditioned patio because the 4 tables inside were taken.  The air conditioning blowing straight on you helped but it still wasn't comfortable.

Service was very attentive and the owner or manager seemed very friendly.
