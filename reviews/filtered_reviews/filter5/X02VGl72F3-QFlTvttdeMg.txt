Love this place! Today's visit was the second time i have been here. WOW! 

Appetizer: Guacamole ****MY FAVORITE GUACAMOLE EVER!****
Taco's: Barrio Pollo & Chorizo taco was amazing, Arrachera con Relleno was great and the Carnitas taco was good. 

Service was great, food was extremely tasty and i will definitely be going back. 

(Side note: They have outdoor seating and are dog friendly.)
