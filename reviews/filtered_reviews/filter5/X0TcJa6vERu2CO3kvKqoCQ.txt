I love this funky, eclectic little hole in the wall. When I lived in Charlotte I'd drop in for lunch or dinner. It's not necessarily 'Mexican', but it is amazingly delicious! Portions are large and prices are reasonable for the area.

I usually just order the tacos so I can get a few different flavors, but the burritos and quesadillas are well worth your time, too. You can personalize all the items(eg: you hate beans with a passion surpassing reason, rice reminds you of larvae...whatever your deal is) and then pick your order up at the counter and meander over to the salsa bar and pick up some salsa verde or extra hot...or even mild, if you like. It's fresh and ready to drown your food in a flavor explosion.

If you're heading downtown to go to a concert, I'd recommend eating here and then taking the lightrail to avoid a parking mess. If it's a nice night, there are tables out on the patio/corner to enjoy.
