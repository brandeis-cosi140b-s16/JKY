Love this place! FINALLY some good food. I've passed by this place a few times, but never tried it.  So out of curiosity I came to yelp and based on the great reviews I went in for lunch the next day. I was so impressed with the menu, food taste, price, concept and owner. Chris was so friendly and truly has the Aloha Spirit within him. They offered samples, explained everything and gave suggestions. The Huli Huli chicken and Kalua pig tastes authentic. That was a great plus. The concept of having those delicious meats (Hawaiian Style) in a burrito or salad bowl is brilliant and healthy. IF you like Mexican you'll love it. If you're from Hawaii you'll love it. IF you eat healthy you'll love it. They also have a drive thru and also make their own hot sauces. This is my new favorite spot and I will let all my family and friends from Hawaii know about this place. I'm hoping it will be a stop for them, like Trader Joe's. This place seriously rocks, It's different!
