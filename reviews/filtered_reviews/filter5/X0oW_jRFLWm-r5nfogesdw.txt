We LUUUUV this restaurant. Where do I start......fresh fruit margaritas and I am not taking about boring Strawberry Margs. We had Watermelon, Basil and Lime Marg and also tried the Spicy Banana Blueberry Marg! WOW!!! 

Everyone in the Restaurant was ordering the Guacamole, made fresh at your table ( my husband is not an avocado fan, so I just watched everyone else enjoy with envy ) 

We ordered the Pork Shoulder Tacos, Crispy Pork Belly Appetizer, and could not resist ordering two desserts. The Pumpkin Bread Pudding and the Chocolate Churros with a Espresso Milkshake! Our next plan is to join them for Sunday Brunch! 

I was told my the waitress that they also own the Zinc Bistro in Keirland so I cant wait to try Zinc out too!
