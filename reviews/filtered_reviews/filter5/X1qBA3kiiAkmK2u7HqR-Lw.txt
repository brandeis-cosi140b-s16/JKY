Went here for the first time. Thought I would give it a try I mean I am a chinese food fan and a mexican fan. So. What's the worst that could happen. 

The place is pretty non descript making me moderately question For a split second the quality of the establishment. But before I could bat an eyelash the service people there were fantastic and nice, just wonderful. Couple that with free samples of amazing food and we have a winner. (The fastest way to a mans heart they say). 

Now the food was in a realm of its own. The chicken was good quality it wasn't that 18lbs of breading crap some chinese restaurants claim to be actual meat. The black beans were also something that reminded me of home. But with a little extra zing. The jerk rice was fantastic with spices of asian flavor with Caribbean yummy ness. 

All things considered I ordered food. And more to go. 

SHOUT OUT TO THE EMERALD CHICKEN IN MY TOGO BOX RIGHT NOW. I'm gonna eat you. And I'm gonna love you.... Don't wince. It's gonna happen.... Nomnomnom
