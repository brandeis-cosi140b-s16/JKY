Was at ASU for grad day. Walking Mill deciding on lunch, a buddy and I decided to pop in here on reference of a bartending friend. Did not disappoint! We both got the tres tacos. The duck was by far my fav. Corn and fries were amazing. Think more sweet than spicy. Another guy next to me had the huge salad while his friend had the hefe dog.  Think they left happy too. The ladies couldn't have been more attentive. Only 'bad' thing was pretty average tap selection, when other places around offer more local. I think this place has definately made our lunch rotation.
