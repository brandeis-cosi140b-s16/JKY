When you search VegasYelp for Tamales Dona Maria's is the first to come up. Good reason too these hot Tamales are straight up the best. Everyone out here seems to have "a Tamale guy." As fore mentioned Tamale's have always fallen short of my expectations. 
 I was lucky enough to have stopped by the downtown area over the weekend. I knew I was going and I need to have some sort of a sub plot and decided a Tamale mission would be the right thing to do. It was.
 Dona Maria's is one of the few places that I've been to Vegas that has an "established feel" to it. You know you are in for something good when you get in the place. We rocked the whole Tamale scene there. The Red, The green, the cheese, and the desert all are above and beyond. You can't miss Dona Maria's.
