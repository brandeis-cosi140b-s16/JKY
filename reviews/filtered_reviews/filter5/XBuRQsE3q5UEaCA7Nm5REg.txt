My family and I randomly decided to take a walk from our apartment to get tacos. We decided to try this place because we always pass this place and wonder. 

As we came in, it seemed crowded (4:30pm on a Saturday), but soon noticed that we had to order in the corner immediately to the right. I understood then, that the unfortunate placing of the register, gives for the impression that this place is always packed. When in reality, it's not. 

We ordered a few tacos asadas and adobado and my hubby went for the "fries asada" or "asada fries." After giving the cooks their copy of the receipt, we took our seats and the food was ready almost immediately. 

EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME. I squeezed some lime over everything and dove right in. The guacamole on the fries along with bits for juicy steak pieces, sour cream and a cheese blend sprinkled on top WERE SUPER DELICIOUS AND PERFECTLY TEXTURED, FOR EVERY SINGLE BITE. 

Of the two variety of tacos we got, the adobado was the best. So good in fact I'm not even going to bother ordering any other kind of taco. 

This is our new fave taco place. We will try others, but the standards have been set by Taco Tijuana.
