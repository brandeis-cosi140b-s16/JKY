I literally saved this place to be my 100th review on Yelp I love it so much. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix. I have been coming here for 16 years and while the restaurant has changed tremendously over the years, the food has not. The family that still runs this place treats everyone like they are part of their extended family. If you are in the Phoenix area and are looking for some quality Mexican food, I would definitely encourage you to visit. It will be well worth your time.
