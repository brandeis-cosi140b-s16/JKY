Let me preface this review on my background. I own a audio and lighting company in the valley. We do concerts and other events at venues around town and for corporate gigs. 

Phoenix has needed a venue to the size and scope for WAY to long. I went and say Iron and Wine on december 2nd. The venue is what to be expected for a small room. The audio is great, the lighting is basic but meets the needs of a venue like this.

I like how they added the raised places to sit in the back, gives people somewhere to sit if they can get to the show early enough. 

The bar staff was friendly, spoke with the Audio Engineer, great guy and all and all a great experience. 

I will be frequenting Crescent a lot more. And Sean Watson is an amazing DJ. So there!
