This place was SO AMAZING. Went for dinner with some coworkers and we were all blown away by the food. Do not let the location fool you, just because it is next door to a strip club...literally RIGHT next to it...you have to go! Our waitress was so friendly and sweet! There was also live Spanish music, awesome.

First off, you MUST order the table side guac. We ordered it medium spicy and it was delicious. I ordered a jalapeno margarita which was not too spicy surprisingly. As a table we ordered: fish tacos (delicious! try them!), chicken enchiladas (very big in size!), and a special slow roasted pork taco concoction with a banana leaf which my coworker said was the best thing he's ever tasted. 

We're probably going back in a few days...

My ONLY complaint (very small) was there was basically no lighting for our table. I don't really enjoy eating in the dark and can't read my menu very well but overall the ambiance and atmosphere of the place was great. EL DORADO FOR THE WIN!
