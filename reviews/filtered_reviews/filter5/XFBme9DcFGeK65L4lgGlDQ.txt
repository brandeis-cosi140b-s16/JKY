Yelp family you've done me right yet again. I had friends in from Texas and wanted to find a Mexican restaurant that was authentic!!  The restaurant is tucked on a corner of the strip mall and decor is cheesy. Painted scenes of the beach. The service and food are 5 star.  amazing and delicious.  Well done!!!!
