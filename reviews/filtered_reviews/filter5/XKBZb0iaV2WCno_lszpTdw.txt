I rarely give out 5 stars but this Mexican restaurant is worth every star!

The service and food is both 5 stars. 

Right when we sat down, we got chips and salsa right away. Also the manager came around and greeted us. But he kinda scared me when he said hi because he pop his head around the wall lol!

The salsa was bomb!!!!!!!!! We got the green  salsa and some kind if brown one. The brown salsa was so good! Wish the green salsa wasn't that salty but it would of been really good! We also got beans as out dip too! I mixed the green salsa and bean together so it won't be so salty so that was good.

It took me forever to order cuz I didn't know what to get! Everything sounded so good! 

I got the make your own burrito! I got confused of the meat part cuz it i wanted shredded beef so the menu said "shredded chicken or beef & carnitas" so I thought they give you both beef and carnitas cuz it didn't say OR . Right? You pick one meat and its a dollar extra if you want another one. So I got charged . Idk what sauce to get for my burrito so I got something red lol and cheese! It was good too! Haha but damn was that burrito huge ;)  haha! 


My hubby got 2 tacos they were able to let him choose 2 different meat with no extra charge! Shredded beef and shrimp!

Out waitress also got us a super super spicy salsa! Habanero!! Omg was that spicy!!!!!! I'm on fire!!!! Hahaha! 

Soo full after a third of my burrito! Well..Probably cuz all that yummy chips and salsa! 

Last but not least! I almost forgot my churro that I saw on yelp that someone posted a picture! And that looked bomb! And guess what! It's so darn fresh!!!! So when our waitress brought it out, I noticed I didn't get any sauce like raspberry and Carmel. She said its order on ask so I was aww oka but then  she still got it for me!! :) yaya! Couldn't eat the churro there :( but it had to be eaten that night ! And it was warm still when I got home! It was still so good! Drooool have to come here again!!! :)))))))
