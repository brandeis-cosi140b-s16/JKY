I've have been coming here since '98 and I must say that it is one of my faves. (not to be confused with the other locations) For the longest time I ALWAYS have gotten the chicken chimichangas and the enchilada sauce they top it with is on point! I have also tried the taco steak which is really good as well as the green chili-both entr√©es come with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. The salsa and chips are usually pretty good too and you can easily get carried away and get full just from that while waiting for your food. I never have had to wait too long between first walking in to the restaurant and getting my meal, they usually provide pretty prompt service.
