Where's the beach? I love this place. The exterior is fun and exudes a real Santa Monica, Huntington Beach, hippy vibe. I love it. The interior is great too, having an eclectic blend of old posters and record albums. The downside is... there is no inside seating with the A/C. That aside, who cares, John and Nacho were great. Very friendly guys. Nacho had my burrito done within, it seemed like seconds. I sat on the East Side deck and devoured my little donkey, (yes burrito means little donkey). I had the Red Chili burrito with Volcano Salsa. I loved it! The burrito was filled with meat that is marinated to perfection, the beans and rice and other tasty offerings all rolled up and grilled. I love the taste of the grilled tortilla, enabling me to man-handle this one pound mexi-masterpiece. I will be back. They're menu is fairly simple making it easy to decide what to get. Next time... The green chili burrito. I can't wait.
