Forget about all the traditional main stream cuts of pork and cow when you enter Tacos El Gordo.  It's time to man up, adjust your nut sack, hike up your trousers and get down with some more unfamiliarable less desirable "of courses I mean by American standards" fleshy fatty gems of the animal kingdom.  Cabasa and buche are king at Tacos El Gordo.  Melt in your mouth tender gelatiness nasty bits that will turn your wanna be foodie ass on it's side. I mean it's all good but these two cuts are out of this world.  Lets just put it this way, If Tacos El Gordo was Oceans 11 the cabasa would be George Clooney and the buche is Brad Pitt the other tacos, like the rest of the supporting cast, kick ass however there can only be one Clooney. OK, I know its not your typical analogy however, I'm sure you follow me. Well follow me or not all you need to know is that this place is crazy good.  If I had to point out anything negative it would be that it's a little pricey, however this is definitely one of those you get what you pay for situations.
