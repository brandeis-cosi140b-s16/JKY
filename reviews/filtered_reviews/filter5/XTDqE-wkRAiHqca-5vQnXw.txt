I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Believe me when I say I have thought about it OFTEN since my last trip to Vegas.

Food, prices, service--a true five star place found in an unassuming strip mall off the strip.  Free chips and salsa upon arrival, and a check-in deal for some tasty dumplings.

I had three tacos with Kimchi (one pork, one chicken, one beef).  They were $1.50ish each.  All three were extremely generous in size, flavor, and taste.  I probably liked the beef one best.

It was one of those meals that I didn't want to finish because I'd be too sad when it was over, but I decided to eat it all because I was worried the tacos would lose their magic once Primm was in the rear-view mirror.

CHECK OUT OF YOUR HOTEL AND THEN GO HERE for lunch before driving back to LA.  My riding partner saved one of her tacos and it was still wonderful in Barstow, so you could even load up on to-go.

This place has minor issues with lack of fountain drinks (they have cans), a location that is a bit remote, and a strange bathroom; however, none of these conditions can even threaten these five stars.

A memorable meal for two at under $10.  If you haven't been here, you're making a mistake.  Sorry about all the hype.
