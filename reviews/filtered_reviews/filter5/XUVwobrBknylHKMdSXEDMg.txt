Delicious food, great service. You can't go wrong no matter what you order. The steak bowl is great as is the fish. The sauces are all quite good I like the raspberry jalapeno and the spicy salsa the best. I dream about the seaweed rice mixed with everything. The kids meals are cheap and tons of food and the coconut bark is a great dessert think almond roca but instead of the almonds light coconut.
