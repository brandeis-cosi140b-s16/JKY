Recommend this place because of their service, food, and drinks. Everything was delicious. Ordered the cheese crisp with guacamole and my boyfriend ordered the quesadilla and enchiladas. Everything came out to a good price including the drinks. Worth the $70. Enchiladas were the best I have ever tried besides the ones we make at home (:
