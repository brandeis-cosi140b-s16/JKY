One of my absolute favorite restaurants! I usually go to the one on Sahara but I finally moved over by UNLV and was so privileged enough to have one newly opened here! The staff are soooo nice and friendly, and the restaurant renovations are so gorgeous and such a comfortable environment! Amazing prices for amazing food!! :)
