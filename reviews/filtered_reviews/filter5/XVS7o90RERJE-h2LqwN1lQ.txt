Ranch Market... nothing like it in Arizona.  Even better than Lee Lee's!  This place is an EMPORIUM of great, high-quality, inexpensive food.  The produce is exceptional and once you into the spirit of the butcher (ie. any part of the animal you want, you can get) the quality is also very high.  Fresh tortillas made all day long and a really festive atmosphere round it out.
