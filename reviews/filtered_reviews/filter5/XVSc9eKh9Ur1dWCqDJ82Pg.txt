First off, Boarder Grill has the coldest bottled beer my wife and I had to drink during our entire time in Las Vegas.  Our waitress took the time to completly describe every peice of food prior us making our order and seemed totally interested in whether we enjoyed it or not.  The service was great and the food was even better.  I'm a pretty picky eater and I would not have been so adventerous if it wouldn't have been for our great waitress.
