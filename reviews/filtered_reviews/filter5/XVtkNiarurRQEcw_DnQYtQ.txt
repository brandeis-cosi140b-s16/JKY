Three of us had dinner here Friday July 11, 2014.  We had a reservation and after having read several reviews mentioning the great view we asked for a table with the view.  It was spectacular.  We were seated immediately and chips, salsa and bean dip arrived immediately.  All were good.  I prefer a lighter a chip - but these were fine.  I prefer a less hot salsa but this was fine.  Truthfully, I love all chips and salsa so it's not possible to disappoint me here.  Normally I order a cheese dip / queso but didn't get around to it this time so I can't give an opinion.  We requested the quacamole be made table side as I had seen mentioned on other Yelp reviews.  It was delicious.  I would never not order it at this restaurant.  One comment I'll make is I've had other tableside guac before and they have fresh garlic which I really love.  I would love it if Lindo Michoacan added garlic as an option with their guac.  But again, it was awesome as served.  I had cheese chile rellenos with rice and beans and my companions shared a pork carnitos dish.  We were all pleased.  I had two margaritas with Grand Marnier.  While pricey they were excellent.  Their service is excellent and attentive.  There was no delay in any part of the dinner.  I noticed tables being seated, served and cleared with speed.  As for the comments about the noise - we had no problem carrying on our conversations.  Granted, we were seated behind the band.  It seems as though the band plays a couple of songs and breaks so it's not a constant thing.  I think they handle the balance of the sound of the large open room, with sporadic band playing and enjoying dinner and conversation very well.
