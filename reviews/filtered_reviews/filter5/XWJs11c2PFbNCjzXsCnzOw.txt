Love this place! I have eaten here many times with my family.  The service is always great.  The owner takes notice of repeat customers and frequently stops by the table to say hello.  The Pork Street Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas and Chicken Burritos are all amazing.  I have tried all of the salsas in their "Salsa Bar" and they are great as well.  

I also really enjoy the casual laid back atmosphere with TV's that play various sports.  They have a great outdoor patio area that is nice when the weather is cooler (although I think the furniture out there could be upgraded a bit).

On the weekends there is a cool vibe and it turns into a busy "watering hole" with great food.

We will definitely eat here again... and again...  :)
