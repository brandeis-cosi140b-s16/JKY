This restaurant had some of the best food at a reasonable price I have had on the strip. The complimentary chips and salsa were so delicious, I couldn't stop munching on them; they told me it was made from grilled tomatoes and mesquite seasoning. We ordered the Gonzalez nachos and carnitas tacos, and both exceeded our expectations for food along the strip, and even our expectation for Mexican food in this area. To top it all off, the wait staff was incredibly attentive and very friendly. I will definitely be coming back here when we play in Vegas again.
