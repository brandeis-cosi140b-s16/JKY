This place never fails me. 

Location: Right in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino! 

Food: Amazing, simply amazing. I've been to the one in LA before and the food is always incredible. The guacamole has a nice lime kick to it and is incredibly creamy. I ordered the chicken tamale which was cooked perfectly - the corn masa was very soft, moist and tasted as if it was just made. The chicken wasn't dried out at all. It came with salsa that completed the dish. Highly suggested ordering a tamale (or two). 

Service: Eh, our waitress wasn't the best but I can't say I blame her since I imagine working in Vegas is difficult.
