I love these tacos! The carne asada is the best one I've ever had. It has a nice grilled flavor. All the tacos here are great so it depends what kind of mood I'm in. 

They use flour tortillas and are bigger than your typical street taco corn tortillas, so they're slightly more expensive. Two tacos here = about 3 or 4 tacos at El Gordo, so they're about the same price.  

The red salsa is also a must, It's different than most places, it's seedless and has a nice hint of garlic. Everything I've tried here has been great, and the Ceviche is very refreshing on a hot day.

Another plus for Los Tacos is that ordering here is much easier than Tacos El Gordo for non Spanish speaking gringos.

My favorite bites from Los Tacos so far have been the carne asada tacos with everything on it.
