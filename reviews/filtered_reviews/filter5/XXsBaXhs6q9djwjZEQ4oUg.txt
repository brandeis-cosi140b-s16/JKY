We landed in Las Vegas and started driving towards our hotel in rush hour traffic. Being pregnant and hungry, my goal was to find a place to eat. Fast. We happened upon Phat Phrank's and walked in just as they were closing. Frank, the owner, offered to serve us anyway, so I ordered the trainer salad (with a lot of modifications) and my husband ordered three different flavors of tacos. The service was excellent, the food arrived quickly, and everything was delicious. We enjoyed the food and the service so well that we would have come back for breakfast, but it would have taken 20+ minutes and I needed to be somewhere at 8am. We'll definitely head back to Phat Phrank's the next time we're in Vegas.
