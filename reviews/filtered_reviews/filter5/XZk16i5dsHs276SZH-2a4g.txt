Best place for fast, cheap tacos! They're a bit on the small side, so it takes about 3-4 to fill me up. Nevertheless, we always come here every time we're in Vegas. 

Tripa (Tripe) = DELICIOUS! Crunchy and a blast of flavor. I always get this. 

Carne Asada = pretty decent, but I've had better. The guac tastes a bit weird to me. 

Adoboda (Spicy pork) = so yummy and juicy. Get this if you want to be on the safe side.

Lengua (Tongue) = tasty, tender, soft. 

Sesos (Brain) = Didn't like. Has a consistency of oatmeal with a strange meat taste.
 
Cabeza (Head) = bland...

Suadero (Shoulder) = good, but doesn't compare to the ones above. 

Quesadilla = amazing!! Good option for your vegetarian friends. 

Make sure you get grilled green onions and chilis (warning, it's extremely hot) on the side!  And don't forget Horchata!
