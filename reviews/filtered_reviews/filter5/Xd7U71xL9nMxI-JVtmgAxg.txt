Once upon a time, there lived a happily married couple, young and in love, Julio and Olivia Garcia.  While they were happy and successful, Olivia decided she wanted to go out on a limb and open a restaurant. Julio supported her of course as did other members of the family.  This grew from barely more than a taco stand, to having several large locations around the valley.  They finally grew so large, a member of the family could no longer be at each location ensuring it was being run to their standards, so they sold the business to a franchise chain.  But Julio and Olivia were far from done.  They wanted to go back to what had made them so successful in the beginning, so they created The Original Garcia's Las Avenidas.  

The above is a Readers Digest version of the story on-line.  It was important to open with that because this is NOT another Garcia's restaurant.  This is how they started - what made them successful.  And SO much more.  

There are 2 buildings.  One large building that houses the restaurant and (my favorite part) an "Express" restaurant that makes a limited menu, but all the basics, that are available through DRIVE THOUGH!  Oh yea.  Drive through.  It's amazing!  Or you can park and walk into the small waiting area.  Either way.  

But the main restaurant is SO amazing.  It's like you are going to a nice restaurant in Mexico.  Plants, flowers, fountains, tons of saltillo tile, cool art.  And all sorts of fun little nooks to sit.

And did I mention it's less expensive than the chain?  Oh yea.  You're getting Original level Garcia's food, overseen by Garcia's family members in an amazing location, and it will actually cost you less.  It's really amazing.  And did I mention we've always had great service?  Even with a large party  (and some of those people who never know what they want) everything was polite and managed as smoothly as if we'd been a party of 4.

It's such a fun place.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
