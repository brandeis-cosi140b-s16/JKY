Who'd have thought that my first excuse to try this place would be because they happen to have the PAC-12 Network on TV.

To explain, I planned to watch the ASU - Arizona Football Game on TV at my house and about an hour before the game started realized that it was being aired on a station my DirecTV doesn't get. 

I initially headed over to Zipps at 16th and Bethany Home to catch the game, but quickly realized that everyone in the area had the same idea. So I decided to walk around and see where else I could watch the game. After checking several places I ended up walking by the door to Dick's and noticing that the game was on its TVs.

I had run into a couple of other guys while walking and so I grabbed them and we headed in. However, because the bar was already full, the host said that he could put us in the back room that also had a TV.

The three of us ended up getting our own table next to the fireplace and located within easy site of a big, flat screen, TV in the back room where we got personalized service from the waiter. The service was great and the food and drinks were excellent. What a better experience than being crammed like a sardine into a sports bar! In fact, this may be my new place to watch games when I'm not at the stadium.

Dick's Hideaway, I hope you don't mind if I call you Brad's Hideaway!
