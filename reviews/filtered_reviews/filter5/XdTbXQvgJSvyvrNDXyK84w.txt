Heading to this restaurant in downtown Phoenix from far north Scottsdale was definitely worth the trip! This is one of the best, authentic Mexican restaurants we've eaten at in the Valley. The place is small but they do take reservations and it's noisy. The atmosphere brings you back to a vacation in Mexico. The menu  is mostly fish with lots of choices to choose from.  Everything smells great and is very favorable with reasonable pricing. My husband and I shared the Molcajete Caliente which was so tasty and not spicy, I don't do spicy. They give you their homemade tortilla chips with a red and green salsa the green is the mild but to me that was spicy! My mom had the shrimp with caramelized onions and peppers basically a shrimp fajita, which she thoroughly enjoyed, Everything is fresh and handmade even the corn and flour tortillas. We were given a complimentary dessert by checking in on Yelp and we shared the Chocolate layer cake which was rich and decadent. The only disappointment was the Margaritas, we have had better. Great service and on Fridays they have Mariachis. We will certainly return again.
