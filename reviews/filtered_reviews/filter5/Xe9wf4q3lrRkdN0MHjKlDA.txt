Dang! This place is good.
We stayed at the adjoining hotel for a couple of nights recently. The long line of locals queuing up to use this restaurant gave us our first clue that this was something special.

Breakfast of Saturday and Sunday is served up to 1pm and we took advantage to try their breakfast. Recommended by the waitress we tried the Chilaquiles Verdes with Chicken and had the Elote Callejero as an appetizer. Both were fantastic. Washed down with a great Bloody Mary, this place set us up well for the whole day.

Wonderful
