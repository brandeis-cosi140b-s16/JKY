Met up with my fellow Lyft drivers last night, 8/27/14. 
Probably close to 30 in our party. The staff didn't have any issues with a group this big. They were very attentive, cool, and quick with the orders.

Server recommended the nachos, they were awesome!!

The best part was the music. I don't know if they're using Pandora or Slacker but it was bad ass!

From what I heard we'll be having our meetings there weekly :-)
