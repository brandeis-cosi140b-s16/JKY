No matter the dining experience you want to have, you'll find it one of the spaces this old mission offers.  From the front patio, to the inside space and the back patio, each one offers a unique experience.  Being on the back patio reminds of my years living in Mexico City with the high walls, the very same marble surrounding the fountain, right down to the shade structure.  It feels like at any moment they could move the tables and start dancing.
The food is ridiculous and the staff knows too much about all of it ;-)
I could sit on that back patio and relax (read, drink) for days.  You forget you're in Scottsdale.
