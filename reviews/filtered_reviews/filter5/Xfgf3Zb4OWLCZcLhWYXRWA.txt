Simply amazing! i have no idea why I've never been here before! to start off the guy at the register was super cool and laid back, great customer service. once we gave out order we got our food fast. it was absolutely delicious! 

I went with my friends and two kids, we had the 4 'boyger" and fries special and a '14 inch pizza, fat chencho fries and hot chicken wings, and didn't wait as long as we thought. Two of the four boygers were the Hawaiian style, omg simply delicious! the originals were also veeery good, home made style! The pizza was also amazing! not too greasy and good ratio of cheese and sauce! The chencho fries, no words on how amazing they were, never thought salsa verde, cheese, and chicken would be sooo good!

We will definitely be come back!
