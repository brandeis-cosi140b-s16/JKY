Outstanding as usual!

We have been enjoying the food at this location for years and have never commented. Well, we have not been disappointed.

The 10oz Ribeye & enchiladas is fantastic. 
Los Mejores de la casa - another favorite!
Stuffed Chicken Medallions are crunchy with a hint of spice!

The sangaria swirl and $3 house wine are also make us smile everytime.

Gets really busy - worth the wait!
