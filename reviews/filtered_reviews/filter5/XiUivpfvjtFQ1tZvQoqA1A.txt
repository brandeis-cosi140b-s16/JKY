A favorite for dinner.  Scores with the trifecta of great food, good service, and killer ambiance.  Dark and romantic.  Really good moody alternative music playing in the background.  Comfy booths that make you want to linger over dinner for hours.  I guess the story is that it is supposed to resemble the smokehouses of the Netherlands?  I can't comment about that because I have never been to the Netherlands, but I love the vibe here.   Upscale.  American/New American food.  Meat intensive, so don't bring your vegetarian date here.  Don't over-order, the portions are quite big.  That's it.  Go.
