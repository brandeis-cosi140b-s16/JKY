An absolute delightful meal. Having lived in California for some time, I have just assumed that there is great Mexican food everywhere. I couldn't be more wrong, and I've really struggled to find good sit-down Mexican in the Las Vegas valley.

...well the struggle is over. The food quality is excellent (the table-side guacamole is top-notch) and the service is quite good.  I come back often, and have forsaken all other Mexican joints.
