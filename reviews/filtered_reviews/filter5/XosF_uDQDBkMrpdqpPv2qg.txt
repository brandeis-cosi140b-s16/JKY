I live nearby and was excited to try this place out. An incredible amount of work was done to renovate this urban blight. 
I ordered a "Papa Loca" which I was told is their specialty, and a couple carne tacos. The tacos were just like Rocky Point and I've been craving them ever since I left. The Papa Loca was a grilled potato with meat, cheese, sour cream and salsa and was awesome!!
It's cool you can see them grill in front of you.  They were pretty nice and the salsa bar was really fresh. 
I'll definitely be back soon.
