I love this place. High end Asian/Latin fusion. When you walk in, they have awesome decor, with a giant picture of a sumo wrestler next to Zapata.

Their Maya rolls are great and flavorful. We made a reservation through Open Table so no wait. We were a bit early so grabbed some drinks at the bar which were also delicious. The fried rice dish was great as were the Korean tacos. Would gladly come back here any day of the week.
