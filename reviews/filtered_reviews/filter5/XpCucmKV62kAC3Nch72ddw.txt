Great food and salsa bar. Personally, I love the strawberry, 7 chiles, & Mexicana salsa. I had the crane asada (ok) and Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos (very flavorful!) combo with rice (mixed with corn - soft and yummy!). My friend order the burro with beef and chimicuri sauce which was soooo delicious. Prices are reasonable $10/plate.
