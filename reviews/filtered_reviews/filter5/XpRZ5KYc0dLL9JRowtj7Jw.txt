I've always enjoyed the Taco Guild but last night we celebrated my dirty thirty.  I had made reservations for 12 on Tuesday and then when we arrived our reservation was not on the list.  I immediately thought my birthday was ruined and was so sad that one of my favorite restaurants was a let down.     

However we sat at the bar for a bit and they had a table within 30 minutes for us.  For the miscommunication they provided our party guacamole and cheese fondue! I love the taco guild more than even before! 

Thank you so much for making my birthday so memorable and starting my dirty thirty with melted cheese and guacamole!

Much love!
