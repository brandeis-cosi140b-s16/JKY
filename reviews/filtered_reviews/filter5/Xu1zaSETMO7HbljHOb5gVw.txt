Great service from Olga! She even tracked us down in the casino to give me the sunglasses I forgot...so nice and definetly not expected in a place like Vegas. Fish tacos and blackened chicken sandwich were both good. Nice view from the patio. Groupon worked fine. Everybody was really friendly and I would definetly recommend it to a friend.
