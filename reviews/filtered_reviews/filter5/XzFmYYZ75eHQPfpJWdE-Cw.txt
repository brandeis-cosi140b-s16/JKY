This review is for Margaritas only - by far some of the best I've ever tasted!  The food on the other hand ... go someplace else for that unless you're only gong for drinks and bar eats. Dinner .... I'll totally pass on!  I, along with the 3 ppl I bought here enjoyed the appetizers wayyyyyyyyyyy more than the entrees!
