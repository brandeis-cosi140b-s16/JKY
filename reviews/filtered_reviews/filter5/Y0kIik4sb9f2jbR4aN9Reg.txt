Great place! The tacos are authentic! The basics are covered (Steak, Beef, Prok) so anyone can go and enjoy a fantastic taco, but what adds to the experience is that there are more adventurous options available as well. For example tongue, head meat, and brain!  They are all worth trying.  Make sure you get a plate of veggies! You get grilled spicy peppers and onions that you just eat with your hands as you eat the tacos! If you live in vegas it is a must to try and if you are visiting it is well worth the 5 minute cab ride from the strip.
