I stopped by the Mandalay Bay Border Grill yesterday about 4:30 pm at a pretty busy time and ate in the lounge. Service was prompt and efficient. He swung by with a "how you doing, hun" every once in a while that only needed a nod in response not some round of applause you think they expect at other places.  

I was looking for something light and ordered a ceasars with no meat and a side of black beans. With tip left at $17. Servings are huge. Chips and salsa the best; fresh, not too thick, not too salty, and whoever made  the salsa deserves a medal. How can I make (all three) at home?  I totally recommend this place for excellent and affordable food. In a hotel!
