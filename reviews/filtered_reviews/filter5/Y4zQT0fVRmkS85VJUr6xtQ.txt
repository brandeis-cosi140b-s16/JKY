I like authentic Mexican Food since I am Hispanic. I have to say that Barrio Queen exceeded my expectations. I had the chile relleno and I absolutely loved that they didn't bread the chile poblano. It was filled with veggies and the flavors were a delicious combination. Atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding. We will continue to go there.
