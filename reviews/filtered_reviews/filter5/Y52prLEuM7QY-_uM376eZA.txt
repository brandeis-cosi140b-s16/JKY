What a cute place, one step off the beaten path but oh so worth it.  On this super hot day the staff was great!  They gave our kiddo a coloring may and some mustaches which we of course wore!  
Nice waitress and suggested the Guava Margarita and its was spot on yum!  
Food was good too, I'm from NM and struggle to find ground beef in Mexican joints but your enchiladas were fantastic!
Oh and I totally want to come back for the cute t-shirt that said Buenos Nachos!  Funny!!!!
