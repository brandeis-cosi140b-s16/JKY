Airport food can be a gamble, but this spot has great, flavorful food. We had the guacamole (pretty dang good), I had a burrito (asked for shrimp instead of pork/chicken and it was no problem at all) with rice and beans, and everything was delicious. Our waitress was really sweet and the host was also really cool! Good food and a cool spot to hang out. Definitely recommend.
