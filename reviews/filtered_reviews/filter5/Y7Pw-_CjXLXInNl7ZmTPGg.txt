First of all, we got a check-in offer of free fried wontons!

Second of all, when I told the lady (she seemed like the owner) about how I've eaten at the Kogi truck in L.A., she already knew the difference between their food and her food and was able to tell me. She was honest saying some people like KoMex more and others still like Kogi more.

Third of all, our bill for 3 people was only $11.80. Granted, 2/3 of us didn't order very much... but still.

Ok so the food...

The chips w/ salsa & guacamole was very good. The chips were homemade and I think the salsa & guac are too. I have had better homemade salsa, but the guacamole was very good.

I had the (insert korean name here) pork taco and bulgogi beef taco.
I am not sure how to even describe it, but it was very good. Everything was made fresh. The meat was hot, tortillas were soft and the vegetables were crisp.
I would say that I liked the pork one more than the bulgogi one.

After the dinner rush had begun to slow down, the lady who seemed like the owner came to our table not only to check on us, but to talk to us. She was telling us how on weeknights the busy rushes are kind of unpredictable. She was apologizing for the wait since there was only 1 cook that (wednesday) night, but honestly, we didn't even wait that long. If we did, we didn't notice because we were so caught up in conversation.

This place is far from us and they said they would be opening another location closer to 215 & rainbow.

OH and this location has so much character! It is a true hole-in-the-wall. It's the kind of place that looks like you should question eating there, but when you do, it is so delicious! LOVE IT!
