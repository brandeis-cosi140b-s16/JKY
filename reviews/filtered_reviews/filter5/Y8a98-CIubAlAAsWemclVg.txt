Had lunch here. It has a great location, mid strip right outside Planet Hollywood. I had the shredded beef tacos & the sangarita. The drink was awesome, a mix of a sangria & a margarita. I got it in the big souvenir cup, which is a large glass cup with cabo wabo Las Vegas on it. The tacos were also really good. 2 large tacos in a crispy she'll with plenty of juicy meat & fresh toppings. I got extra salsa, I suggest doing that because it doesn't come with much on it. The service was really good & fast. They were very polite & new the menu very well. I would come back here.
