Found this place because it had a happy hour and I was hungry. 

service: 5/5. The food came out fast. Waiters were friendly with recommendations. They refilled my drinks!

Food: 5/5. Yummy in my tummy. Boyfriend ordered the tacos and I ordered the quesadilla ($5). I love happy hour here. The prices are so reasonable/good which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars. But they don't skimp out on quality just because it's happy hour. I'm from Texas so tex mex/mexican food in any other place usually can't beat Texas places but this place had pretty good tacos and quesadillas! Flavorful and the meat was good. The oysters were the highlight of our meal. So refreshing and perfect in flavor. Fresh!

The free chips and salsa (3 different ones) were also on par with Texan restaurants...Wow! This place is a gem in Vegas and a must go. 

Our bill turned out to be only like ~$18 for two tacos, one quesadilla, and two oysters. we came here for a short snack before a buffet.

BOTTOM LINE: Must go! Go during happy hour! Use the free check in offer. My favorite place in Vegas hands down this past March when I went.
