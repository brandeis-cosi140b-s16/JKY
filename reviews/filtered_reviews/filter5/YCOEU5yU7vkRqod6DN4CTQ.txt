Since I moved to San Francisco, I have sometimes contemplated going to Phoenix, buying as many Rito's burritos as I could afford, and bringing them back to my freezer for emergencies.  I LOVE this place.  This is real Mexican food.  They serve salad with the Mexican food here in the bay.  If this place opened up on Geary in SF, there would be lines around the block!  Have a Red Chili and bean burrito enchilada style with a taco.  You will come back.
