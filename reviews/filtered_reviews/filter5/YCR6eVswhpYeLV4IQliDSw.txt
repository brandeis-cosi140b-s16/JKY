Excellent. Marvelous. Amazing. These are all words that I would use to describe the food and service here. So far, I have had a carne asada taco salad and the quesadilla. Both were delicious but I especially loved the taco salad. They cook the meat in front of you and there are a lot of toppings. The cheese, cilantro, corn, guacamole, and salsa was fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming back here.
