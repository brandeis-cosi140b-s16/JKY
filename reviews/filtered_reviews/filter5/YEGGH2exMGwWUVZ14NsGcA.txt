My favorite Mexican food joint in Las Vegas.  YUMM  Okay, this is one of the ways I judge a Mexican food place, the chips and salsa.  If the chips are good, I will ALWAYS be back.  Below is a typical order that I get with friends.  In case we someday meet, you'll know what to prepare yourself for.

Appetizers:  Queso Dip and Beer Battered Rock Shrimp.  Entrees:  Mexican Turkey Chopped Salad, Carnitas Platter, or Sabana de Pollo.  Stick with these favorites and you won't go wrong!
