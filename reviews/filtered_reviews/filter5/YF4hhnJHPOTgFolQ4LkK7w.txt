The other day I stopped in at La Tolteca for a monster taco. How bad can it be right?  Told the lady I wanted it "To Go". The first 20 minutes was pure heaven and bliss. Every bite filled with beef, lettuce, tomatoes and full of flavor. Another 20 minutes passed and I suddenly realize the lady must have misunderstood my meaning of the words "To Go" because OMG, it went. Like Godzilla in a foot race in downtown Japan, that monster taco flew out of me with tremendous force and a supersonic BOOM!  Needless to say, I got lightheaded from the sudden evacuation of all my bodily fluids along with, what I am sure was some vital organs. All I can remember as I started to pass out was that catchy song, "I Will Survive" running over and over in my head.

Thank you La Tolteca for a wonderful dining experience. The anticipation and excitement leading up to the meal was a prelude to the roller coaster of a ride presented afterwards. I give you 5 stars because no where else can you get so much fun and excitement for $5.99.
