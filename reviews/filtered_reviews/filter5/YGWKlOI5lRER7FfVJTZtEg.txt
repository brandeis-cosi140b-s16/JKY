This restaurant is a long time favorite place for tasty food.  Granted, it isn't a swanky kind of place.  I am not bothered by the place, but I do get my order for takeout. 

My regular order is a 2 meat combo which includes jade chicken quesadilla and a serving of jade chicken with black beans and chicken fried rice. While I have tried other combinations, this is my go to meal.  The portions are large enough that I always have enough for lunch the next day.  This is the reason I get one serving of jade chicken (no quesadilla) because it reheats best.  

As if all the wonderful food wasn't enough, a snickerdoodle cookie is always included.  H-e-l-l-o my little snickerdoodle, come to mama!

The staff is always happy to help newcomers and are quite fast at clearing a long line. I truly hope this restaurant never changes a thing.
