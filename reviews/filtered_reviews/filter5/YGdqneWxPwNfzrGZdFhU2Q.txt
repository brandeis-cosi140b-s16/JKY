We've been meaning to stop in for some time, luckily we came for Father's Day (dad's eat for free). Our party of four ordered two platters of fajitas, got the mixed two (shrimp & steak and steak & chicken) and we were not disappointed. Platters came with pico, guac, beans and rice and everything just had great flavor. To top it off we had the churro's for dessert which were delicious (plated with Mexican chocolate & banana foster), which the restaurant chef Paco personally delivered to our table. We are definitely glad we stopped in today and will again sometime soon.
