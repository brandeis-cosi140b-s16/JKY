This place is still good eats!!! I'm from San Diego and this Mexican food was just as good as we have in diego . I'd highly recommend this place again to any one . 

It had been several years since I was last here like 5-6 yeas ago and I wasn't sure at first but they didn't disappoint us at all . 

If you want good Mexican food , close to the strip, and reasonably prices here's your place go check them out I know I will be goin back when I visit again !!!
