Friendliest wait staff in a long time. Good food and reasonable prices. For a casual evening with friends ask to sit outside on the patio as the atmosphere back there is the best. We recently had a fun time there with a group of friends. The portions are large enough to share or take some home and the pitcher of margaritas the best.
