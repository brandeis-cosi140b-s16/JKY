This is for the bar scene only.  

I stopped by pre-nightlife around 9:30 with some friends to grab a couple of drinks.  The bartenders were all very quick, one of my girlfriends ordered one of their specialty margaritas and it was yummy!!!  I stuck to a boring vodka soda but all of our drinks were nice and strong and when it came time for our second round more than one bartender was offering to pour it for you.  It's always nice when the bartender fights to get your attention rather than the other way around, hehehehe.  

We checked out the outside porch also which I give them props for.   I always love any place that has a patio option. It was fun people watching outside on a weekend at town square and I would definitely come back to check them out again for a bite to eat while shopping.
