This place is AWESOME!! The owner John and his staff are so friendly, and really get to know their customers! Everything is super fresh and packed full of flavor! I have yet to order anything that doesn't exceed my expectations. Their shrimp tacos are THE BOMB, and my entire salon is ecstatic there served daily now!
