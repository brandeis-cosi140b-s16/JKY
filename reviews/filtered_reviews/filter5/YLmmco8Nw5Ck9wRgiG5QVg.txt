Two hippies has been a guilty pleasure of mine for a while now. The customer service is as high quality as the food. My favorite menu item are the Fish tacos ( 3 for only $6!!!) which contain beans, fresh cabbage and rice among other quality ingredients. Two hippies has a relaxing little dinning area and a community post board filled with information about, jobs, services and upcoming events. If you're looking for a wholesome, unique twist on mexican cusine, I highly recommend Two Hippies.
