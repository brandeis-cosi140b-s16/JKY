We were very skeptical about trying La Comida from all the reviews.  We were seated and actually didn't get greeted by a server for 15 min on a busy Saturday night.  The busser did bring us chips and waters first thing though which was nice to have something while waiting for the server.  
The manager noticed we had been waiting awhile and apologized.  He sent a server over and the night went from mediocre to fantastic!  The server apologized and was very attentive from there on.  Although he was busy, he made sure to explain the food items and make suggestions.  To our surprise, the manager comped us our first round of drinks and their house made guacamole! Which was awesome!! 

I won't make this long and drawn out but besides waiting for a bit in the beginning, our first experience at La Comida was a good one.  The pozole was fanastic (especially with the guacamole in it,) as was the street corn appetizer! 

The vibe was fun and energetic.  They put a lot of effort into the aesthetics so it was fun to glance around and see all the details around the restaurant.

We will definitely be going back!
