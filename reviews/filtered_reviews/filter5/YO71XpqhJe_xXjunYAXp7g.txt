This place has some really good food. I got the Bombero burrito with chicken (you can choose your meat) and some carnitas tacos. Both were excellent, but the Bombero burrito is what made this experience great for me. It has some unique flavor and good textures and taste. Highly recommended. Also, the prices are reasonable. I think it was $5.25 for the burrito and $1 for the tacos (but the tacos had special summer pricing.)
