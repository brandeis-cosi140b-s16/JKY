I had the Maui and shark tacos with mango salsa. This place is awesome!!  I'm originally from Nebraska and found this place today. The management was awesome too!!  I had 30 in nutes before I had to be to work and I was in and out in 15 minutes and they are very busy! Price is awesome too. And I'm cheap!  $12 for two great sized tacos, rice, beans and a soda.
