Absolutely love this place every time I stop in. This past visit was a girl's night out and of course Paco's impressed again. We ordered the freshly made guacamole and it was incredible. For dinner, I ordered the Paco's Taco which is one of my favorites and the chicken taco. The sauce on the chicken taco has a bit of heat to it but it adds just enough to really enhance the flavors of the meal. We topped our meal off with a pitcher of Margaritas... which of course were amazing! Paco's has a great atmosphere and we really enjoyed our evening out.
