So there I was, unknowingly scaling the sometimes greasy, sometimes nasty, always treacherous mountain known as the pinnacle of Mexican Food in Phoenix. And when I finally trudged past the swill near the bottom, (you know who you are, Garcia's, Macayo's, etc) Past the others that were"good" but not memorable or noteworthy.

There you were, alone at the apex of my appetite of desire... Hello my jewel Rosita's.

Fresh traditional Mexican prepared fast and warm...

Like the menu claims "Their specialty is good tasting food." I would swap good with great. And have a margarita too.
