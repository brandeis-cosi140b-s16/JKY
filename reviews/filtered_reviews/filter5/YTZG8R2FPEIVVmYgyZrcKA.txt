I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon for lunch with my father.  I had noticed this place the week before whenever we went by and became eager to try it whenever I noticed its high rating on yelp.  Since I didn't go into the store, the only real thing I can comment on is the taco stand outside.  There was a guy behind the stand cooking everything as well as a condiment bar next to it.  Whenever we walked up he was just finishing up grilling some tortillas.  He greeted us in Spanish before giving us a run down of the taco fillers in English.  I ended getting three, one each of steak, chorizo and chicken.  He quickly made the tacos stuffing them very full.  They consisted of two tortillas with the filling which reminded me of truly authentic tacos.  Whenever I asked about paying he informed that I could pay cash outside or credit inside.  Since I had cash I quickly payed him and moved over to the condiment bar.  They had a number of sauces as well as some onions and a few other veggies.  I ultimately ended up choosing what I think was an avocado based sauce.  Once we were done with the condiments my father and I walked down the boulevard to find a public bench to eat our tacos on.  After sitting down I quickly dug in.  All three of them were delicious!  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the steak, followed by the chicken and lastly the chorizo.  The chorizo was the lone disappointment of the meal as I feel it lacked any spice at all but it was still pretty tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I will absolutely head back here again in the future.  The tacos were all really good and I think that they were a great value at $2.50 each.
