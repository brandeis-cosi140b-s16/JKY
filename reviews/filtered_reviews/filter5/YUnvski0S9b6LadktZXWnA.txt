This is the real deal, drive across town for it, mom and pop kind of Mexican food place you won't find too often.. I dream about the salsa bar and free chips which come gratis with just the right amount of refried beans and Mexican cheese drizzled across the tops.. My go to plate is the camarones Diablo which is a real mouth pleaser.. Fresh grilled shrimp smothered with a delicious spicy red sauce and "just like your buelita used to make" beans and rice! And don't even get me started on the house made white corn tortillas!!!! Trust this will be your new favorite Mexican food in the valley
