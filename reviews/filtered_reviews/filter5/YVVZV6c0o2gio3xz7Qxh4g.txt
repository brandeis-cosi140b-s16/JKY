I really could not find one thing wrong with this place. We went here on a Friday night about 7:00 for a birthday celebration. There was a short wait, but it was a nice night so we did not mind standing outside until our table was ready. We all had a cocktail, mine being a Margarita which was on the rocks, and very tasty. We also had chips and salsa for an appetizer. I like that they have a salsa bar where you choose your salsa from several options. Three of the four we tried had lot of heat (which I love!!) but some may find them too hot. We consumed two baskets of chips while waiting for our meals. I ordered the El Cubano Taco platter, and it was delicious!  You can get it with two or three tacos, two were plenty for me.  The tacos were pork on corn tortillas, full of flavor. The platter comes with a choice of sides, but I went with black beans and rice. They both tasted fresh, and the black beans were exceptionally good. You may say "how good can black beans be?" but these had taste, were not mushy, and definitely not from a can. I ate every bite on my plate. My husband had the Frito Burrito with chicken, which he let me sample.  I always use the "I need to try it for the Yelp review" excuse to taste other's food!  First of all it was MASSIVE in size, and very tasty. He had no complaints either and the burrito was gone at the end of dinner.  Since it was my son's birthday, we asked about birthday treats and they offered him a shot of tequila, which I thought was a nice touch.  Our waitress was on top of her game, checking on us and refilling water.  The water was much appreciated after sampling the salsa!  The place was packed the entire time we were there.  Bottom line...a good time was had by all, tasty food was eaten and we cannot wait to go back!
