Talk about authentic, this place is the real deal! Amazing food that was fresh, authentic, flavorful and rich. Awesome atmosphere with live music on weekends and the uniforms are great and make you feell like you're in mexico! The fountain in the back is really nice! The staff was attentive, very polite and FAST! My drink was never empty and thats saying a lot because I drank like 10 glasses of iced tea. (WALTER MY WAITER DESERVES A RAISE!) The food was such a great value. LOVE THE FREE CHIPS, SALSA AND FREIOS!  There is obviously a reason this place is on the best of las vegas. I give it a 10 out of 10 in basically every category.
