I recently had a situation where the wrong tip was allocated and we were charged incorrectly for the tip after leaving a cash tip. Although we initially tried to go through our cc company, my wife called China Poblano directly and spoke to the manager there and they confirmed that they would return the amount that shouldn't have been charged. My wife and I loved this place when it first opened and will be going back the next couple times we are in Vegas later this year. We love the guacamole (get tortillas with them) and the salsa along with many of the dishes both Chinese and Mexican. Make sure and make a reservation and enjoy the great food and margaritas.
