Jet lag and tight schedule in Phoenix wouldn't  keep me away from my favorite Mexican restaurant in the US. Yes, it's HOT but the flavors are amazing. Did the Green chile plate. It is outstanding. 
I've never noticed a lower quality at the Mesa location as indicated in a previous review.   They couldn't have topped the dish tonight. 
Don't miss it. Wish their remote branch in Manhattan was still open :-(
