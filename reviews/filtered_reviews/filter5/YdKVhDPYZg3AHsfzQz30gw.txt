Whoa. This place was good.

I went here today with a friend after my dad told me that it was so good. I went in at around 2:30 which is happy hour (but I didn't know that!) So stupidly I didn't order anything off the happy hour menu... not their fault, but man I felt dumb. Anyway, I ordered a carne asada burrito and a mexican coke. It was expensive! When the food came out a few minutes later I was really happy cuz I was really hungry. The burrito was great! The meat was so flavorful and tender and the guac was delicious. When I go back, I will for sure note the happy hour and get tacos (1$ !!!) and chips and salsa (my friend got them and they were good... .50!!) and maybe a beer or margarita. I definitely will be back, it was super yum.
