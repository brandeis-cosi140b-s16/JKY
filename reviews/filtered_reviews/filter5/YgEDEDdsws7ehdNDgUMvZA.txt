Best Mexican Gourmet Expensive made by a Latino chef who knows what she's doing and where she comes from place in Phoenix hands down! From the guacamole and chips, to their enchiladas and my personal favorite, the cochinita pibil, Barrio Cafe is a true gem to be experienced and enjoyed.

 I have spent two birthdays there and it always makes me feel as though I have been transported back to Mexico. Better yet, they even have Coca-Cola from Mexico in a bottle, THE BEST! This actually makes them look more down to earth and humble compared to other wannabe upscale Mexican food places. Needless to say, I am such a fan that I purchased one of their t-shirts that say COMIDA CHINGONA, because it really is BADASS FOOD.
