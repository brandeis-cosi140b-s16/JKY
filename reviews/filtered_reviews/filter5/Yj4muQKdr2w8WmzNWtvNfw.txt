We have been going to Loco lime for a long time now.  Tacos are great here and also have great vegetarian options. The manager Jeff pleasantly surprised us with on the house fried ice cream. ( they should put this on menu). Salsa verde here is one of the best. Service is always good and quick. 

Just go here and you won't be disappointed.
