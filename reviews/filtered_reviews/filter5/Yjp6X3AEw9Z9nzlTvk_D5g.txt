my rating is specific to the tuesday taco special. It was tacos for $1.50 each now $1.75 but well worth the extra 25c. Option of pulled chicken, grilled chicken or beef. I always get the pulled chicken. The flavor is fantastic, like it's been cooking all day. Moist & full of flavor. My absolute favorite part is the tortilla. I almost always order extra as a side. They are made fresh minutes before being used & are perfect! I am a self proclaimed tortilla snob & love these- somebody please get me the receipe!! just love watching the girls roll them out & heat them while I wait in line.
