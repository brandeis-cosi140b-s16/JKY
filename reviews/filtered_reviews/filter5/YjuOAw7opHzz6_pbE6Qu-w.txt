Arriba Mexican Grill is consistently good. The weekday specials make it even better. You can't beat Taco Tuesday where regular ground beef tacos are only 99 cents. Chicken Chimichangas on Thursdays are another delicious deal at just $2.99 each. Chips, salsa, and bean dip come as soon as you sit down. The staff is friendly and fast.

If you do choose to order from the menu, there's plenty to choose from. The prices are a bit high but the meals I have had were all worth it. Do note that most sides also cost extra, which again can add up. Just be aware of this and decide if you are REALLY gonna eat that beans and rice, eh?
