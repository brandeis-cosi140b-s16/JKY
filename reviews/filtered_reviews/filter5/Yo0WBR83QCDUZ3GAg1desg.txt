I love the food and service at this restaurant. Very different food than a traditional Mexican restaurant. More New Mexican flare. The chips and salsa are great and it is easy to fill up on them but don't as the main courses are fabulous. I always have the Land of Enchantment which is a play on surf and turf. A steak, shrimp and an enchilada. A great price for the quality of the food.
