Awesome.  I guess it's a New Mexican hot, and New Mexican variation of Mexican food that is suppose to burn more in your throat than on your tongue?  That's what my friends we're saying but I was to busy being blown away to notice where the hot was coming from.

Definitely Hot, we were all destroyed, we know that dairy is the only thing that combats hot, and so my husband who's not quite the toughest at spice asked for two orders of sour cream, we thought we saw the waiter chuckle but we're not sure.  :)  Oh and my friend who hates sour cream said that she liked their sour cream, and it was really good.

Fresh just made Guacamole, amazing.  Adovada was amazing.  Sangria Margarita so good.

Almost everything served here is hot, they say on their menu they have  no mild, so just a heads up.  Even my beans were hot!

Casual dining in a strip mall festively decorated, including decorated suspended ceiling tiles.  The kind of local place that you know is going to be good.
