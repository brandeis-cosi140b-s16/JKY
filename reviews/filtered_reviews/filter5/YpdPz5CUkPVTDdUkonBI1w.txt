The first time I went to Los Reyes I ordered the Del Rey (before Man Vs Food)...  That was the last time I ordered it.  I was unaware of what I was getting myself into and was pretty embarrassed when it came to the table.  I definitely should not have ordered 2 of the ceviche tostadas to start!  That being said, the ceviche tostadas were great and for $.99 can't be beat.  The platillo de pechuga asada estan muy bueno, it's really, really good.  I have never been let down by anything I have ordered here.  From the quesadillas to the burritos to the mariscos, everything has been great.
