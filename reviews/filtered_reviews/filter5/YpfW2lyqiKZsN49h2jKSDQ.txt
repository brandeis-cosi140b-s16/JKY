This place is the perfect place for what you expect from a Mexican grill....great tacos, margaritas & cold beers. I love their chips & salsa, and they wait staff is always good about making sure you have plenty of it. After the chips & salsa I usually get the black & pepper wings, which are excellent. You wouldn't expect good wings at a Mexican food place, but they're really good here. For my main dish their hard shelled tacos are the best, but I've had several other things and it's always consistent. Lunch or dinner this is a great quick casual Mexican food spot.

Although I do like their food the best thing about this place is the atmosphere or more specifically the patio. If it's Spring Training time or if it's nice out during the day it's hard to beat this place. Grab a cold Corona & kick it on the patio in the sun!
