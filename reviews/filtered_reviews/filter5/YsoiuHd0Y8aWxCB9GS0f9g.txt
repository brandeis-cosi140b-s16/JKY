Besides the booze, clubs, gambling, and all the other glitz and glamour that makes me want to come back to Vegas, this place is up there!

As a Californian, I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican food (hello bool, Kogi, and Calbi trucks).  When I found out there was a dedicated Korean-Mexican food place on yelp in Vegas, I couldn't help but have to try it.  Dare I say, it is better than all the Korean-Mexican food trucks in LA?! 

I recommend ordering bulgogi as your meat choice in whatever you order. We ended up ordering the bulgogi quesadilla, bulgogi flautas, and the half order bulgogi fries.  All were absolutely delicious.  Their bulgogi is moist and full of flavor.  The portions were huge, better than what I expected.  For the two of us, we barely finished most of those three dishes even though we were starving. The bulgogi fries are basically a carne asada fries but WAY better since they use bulgogi and the Korean hot sauce complements it well. A half order of fries is enough for three people to share.

Although it is located away from the Strip, trust me it is worth the drive out of the glitzy area to this place.  It is located off of Buffalo and Flamingo and is inside the same plaza as BabyStacks.  There is a decent amount of sitting and prices were reasonable with most dishes being under $10.  This location closes on Mondays while the other on Decatur Blvd closes on Sundays.

Needless to say, this place is on my must go to eats list in Vegas!
