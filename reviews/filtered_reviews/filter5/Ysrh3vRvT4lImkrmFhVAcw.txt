Pink taco. Cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Friendly staff, great Mexican style food, cool decor and atmosphere. Pink taco is a laid back restaurant (no dress code) showing sports on the flat screens all over. I was here at March madness and was quite loud but didn't bother me and was still able to have a conversation. I ordered the chicken burrito and it was delicious and arrived to me in a timely manner. I would come back for sure.
