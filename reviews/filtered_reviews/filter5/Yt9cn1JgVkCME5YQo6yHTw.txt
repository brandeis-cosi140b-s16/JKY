The food here is really terrific! I ordered the Machaca breakfast plate and traded out Chorizo for the shredded beef. What a great choice. The little potatoes and refried beans and great tasting coffee were the perfect combination.

My wive had the Huevos Rancheros and she said it was amazing!

The food here is very fresh and prepared with care. The tortillas a the only thing not prepared in house, but the recipe used is that of the owners mom. They were really good.

I am SO happy that we finally found a great Mexican restaurant place near by to head to on the weekends for breakfast!
