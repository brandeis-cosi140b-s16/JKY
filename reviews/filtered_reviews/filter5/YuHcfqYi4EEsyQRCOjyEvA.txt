Love love love me some good Mexican food - and Border Grill is a great spot that I try to eat at every time I am in Vegas.  I usually prefer it for lunch (or the take out counter for an in-room or at the MB beach treat) - and the outside patio is very beautiful.  The portions are very large, and they serve great salads, gauc, and holy moly - the tamales are the best!

Try the sangria or a house margarita - and as a side note, if you do take out they will put your drink in a To-Go cup (gotta love that :)

We have always had great service - I would highly recommend this spot if you are staying in Mandalay Bay (or somewhere nearby) as a delicious, reasonably priced spot with great food and drink.
