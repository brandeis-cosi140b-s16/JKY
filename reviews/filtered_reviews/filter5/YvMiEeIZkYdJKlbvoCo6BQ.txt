My friends and I had breakfast at Leticia's, and we were very satisfied with the food and customer service. From the moment we walked in, the hostess greeted us and quickly took us to our table. Three salsas and chips were served as complimentary appetizer. The quality and taste of the salsa said a lot about the expectation of the entr√©es. My friend and I ordered menudo, it wasn't the best I've tasted but it was a hood portion. My girlfriend ordered a wet green burrito, and loved it. Our server was extremely professional and friendly, and so was the rest of the staff. I will definitely be back. :)
