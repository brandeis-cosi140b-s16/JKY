I had my 40th birthday party here after going there a couple times.  It was fantastic!  They handled 36 people on a Saturday night, and were tripping over themselves to serve us.  Food was delicious and my friends, all foodies couldn't get over how there was never an empty Margarita glass the whole night.

Diana, the manager, simply rocks!!!
