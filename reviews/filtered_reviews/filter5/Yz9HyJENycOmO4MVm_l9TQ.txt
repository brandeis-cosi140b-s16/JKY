One my favorite Mexican fast food. Good price, friendly service, fresh tortilla, even the lemonade is fresh squeezed :) New Port Beach was the one closet location from what i life but its tottaly qorth the drive. Now we were in Gilbert, AZ and thoughts of trying. Still the same goodness of it. Barbacoa Pork and Queso were our family fav!
