What a great fresh mex restaurant. This weekend they are having happy hour drinks and food all weekend long. I can't complain, food is not bland and not to spicy but just right, actually awesome and  the service was outstanding. Our server Kristy, was prompt. I never had to think twice about when my next cocktail was arriving. She was courteous and kind, as well as asking me what i needed before I could tell her. The entire staff, from hostess at the front door to the bussers were awesome as well as the service and attention we had from the owner. The ambience is an upscale casual vibe with 5 flat screen Tv's showing any sport of your choice. They have a variety of drinks to choose from, including margaritta drinks from frozen to iced. Great family place, date nite, to social gatherings. I can't wait to go back. Price is very fair and well worth it.
