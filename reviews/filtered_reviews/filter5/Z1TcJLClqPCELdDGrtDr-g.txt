We passed by this place twice once on Tuesday, once on Wednesday and both times they had just closed past midnight. We were jonesing for some Mexican food and margaritas so we finally hit the place up on our way out of town Thursday for lunch. My hubby ordered the salmon and I had a veggie taco. The chips and salsa were awesome! Our server was a beautiful brunette named Jasmine, she was friendly and super attentive! She even let me snap a picture of her with my hubby.
The salmon steak was huge and the asparagus and sauce that came with it was equally delicious. My veggie tacos were superb and best of all the margaritas were to die for! This place was worth the wait. Located right on the strip near Ny Ny with a great view to people watch while enjoying the great food and great service, I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Mexican food, good music, great drinks and friendly gorgeous waitresses! You can't go wrong here!
