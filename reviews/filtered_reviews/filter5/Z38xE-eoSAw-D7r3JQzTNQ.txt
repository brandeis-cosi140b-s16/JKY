I was very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. They had limited seating the night we arrived, but the manager went out of his way to get us a seat. His customer service is unparalleled and he truly made us feel welcome in this restaurant. Not only that, but he had the food to back it all up. The portions were just the right side and I left satisfied and full. I would definitely go back again, add it was an overall wonderful experience.
