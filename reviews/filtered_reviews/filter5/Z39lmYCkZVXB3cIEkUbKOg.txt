Lo mas mejor!!!

I haven't had TJ style tacos since probably 2001 and that's a long freaking time! Born and raised in LA with frequent trips to Mexico all throughout childhood and well into adulthood, borderline/street tacos was our breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. So it's only natural that this place is what hits home!

Super cheap tacos and aguas frescas to wash it all down; I was in heaven. You can get full with $20 as tacos are $2 each! We ordered 6 tacos; 4 de carne asada, 1 de lengua, and 1 de sesos. Lime wedges as well as radish slices were available to complete your meal. No long lines, fast service, ample seating indoors and outdoors, and music playing while you eat! 

There's nothing else to say than it felt like home the moment I walked in. We'll be coming back before we leave. I need my Mexican fix before I leave Vegas. You will be missed!!!
