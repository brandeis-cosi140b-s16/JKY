What can I say about Komex?

Small hole-in-the-wall in a plaza with an extremely small parking lot, be sure to expect it to be packed on weekends. The restaurant itself is pretty small. For groups larger than 4, it might be a bit hard to get seating during rush hours on the weekend. 
What other place can you get the check for under $15 for two people? This place is awesome. Tacos are amazing with plenty of choices. You can get them on corn or flour and you get three choices of meat--pork, chicken, or beef. If you want it with kimchi, you can get it for a bit extra! Tacos are around $2-$3-something. If you're watching your figure (you shouldn't, you look fabulous), you can get it on lettuce leaf instead of corn or flour tortilla. 

Meats are all flavorful. My favorite is the pork. These tacos come loaded with slaw and meat. You definitely won't leave hungry. Service is usually good. There was a time they had a couple of new servers kind of slacking, but lately, they've been on it. 
Fried rice here is bomb, especially when you're drunk or hungover. The half sizes for their fries, fried rice etc. are huge here!  Enough to feed a few small children. Even when you order one taco and get a half-size of their teriyaki chicken, you're going to have to share with people. Imagine how bog their full-size is! Yeah, that big. And not the kind that girls are happy with.
 
Komex is always the best place to get food on the cheap. My bill between my friend and I is normally between $12-$17 (if we're just doing tacos). Perfect spot for lunch or dinner. Wish it was open later than 8pm daily, but it's not. It's a great local find!
