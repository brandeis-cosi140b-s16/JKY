Stopped in for a drink and an appetizer. We had a bottle of wine and the beef skewers. On mon and tue I think he said that the wine is 50% off a bottle so it made a bottle the same price as two glasses. U can't beat that deal anywhere in town. I highly recommend the 14 hands. It was delicious. 

The beef skewers were also very good. They come in 4 different sauces. They were cooked to perfection and I would definitely eat them again. I just wish they gave u more. It really wasn't enough for what u pay.
