i would not have gone here if my friend had not yelped this place. we stayed at the encore and this place was right across the street, literally a 2 minute walk. since i lost all my money playing roulette, I didn't have that much to spend on food. Thankfully Tacos El Godo has all their tacos for 2 bucks, their quesadillas for 4 and horchata for 1.40. Usually shady taco places skimp on their meat, but no way jose, this place gives you enough carne asada in one taco to make two tacos. My friends got their famous pork adoabab tacos, which they couldn't stop raving about. From about 1-4 am on the weekend, this place has huge lines, but they move quickly. They have separate lines for the types of tacos you want, so make sure you get in the right one. I ate here 5 times during my 4 day stay in Vegas, and it never got old. The guac/tomoatoes/onion combo that they put on your tacos is superb. Also they have steamed vegetables/onions/peppers that are free, but you have to as for it with your meal. And you might as well get the horchata while you are here - because the food is spicy as it gets...you will need something to cool off.
