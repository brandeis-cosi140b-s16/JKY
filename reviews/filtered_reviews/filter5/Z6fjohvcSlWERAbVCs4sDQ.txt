While exploring around Vegas on our recent trip we stopped by this great place for a bite to eat. It was highly recommened to us by friends and  we had to try it out for ourselves. The chicken enchiladas and rice and beans were great along with the steak burrito. The churros I must say were quiet delicious. I would definately come back again when I'm in the area. The prices were quiet reasonable also. Good experience.
