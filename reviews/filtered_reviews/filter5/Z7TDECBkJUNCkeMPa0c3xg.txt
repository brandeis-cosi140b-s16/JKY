Same comments as many already here.  ThIs place is the real deal.  We went last night.  Service was excellent... And it will only get better as they get their systems down.  I had the 9-1-1 Hot Plate, which is now just called the Chuy's Special... Same great taste as Dallas, Austin, Houston locations that I've been dining in since the 80's.  Hatch Green Chile sauce on the side was great.  Wife had tacos al carbon which were great, and son had kids beef tacos... Of which I sampled and approved.  

Two things i look for that set Tex Mex wannabe's from the real deal are tortillas (corn and flour), and the beans (charro and refried).  Both are spot-on at Chuy's in Charlotte.  The flour tortillas are handmade... And you absolutely can taste the difference between handmade tortillas and those that come in a stack of 150 in a plastic bag... (On The Border, Qdoba, Moe's, Salsarita's, Taco Bell... Etc... I'm looking at you!)

Very few Tex Mex establishments in Texas serve black beans.... I hear you... They may be healthier... But it just isn't part of the ingredients.  Try the charro beans when you are in Chuy's... You'll see what I mean.

Anyway, ecstatic that Tex Mex has arrived in Charlotte.  As this place catches on, it is going to be crowded!
