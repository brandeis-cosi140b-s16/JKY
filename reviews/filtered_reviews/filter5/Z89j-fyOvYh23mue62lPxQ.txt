Just so you know...my dad first brought me here when I was in grade school and I have been coming back ever since.(I'm 48 now) The best tamales ever!!!! I moved away to Oregon for 13 years and was on a quest... telling people of the awesome tamales I knew in Vegas, I got lots of suggestions but nothing compared to the pork tamales I grew up with, and now that I'm back in Vegas this is a regular stop for me. The rest of their food is OK but nothing beats those Tamales
