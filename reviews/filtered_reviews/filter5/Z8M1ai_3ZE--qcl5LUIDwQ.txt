FINALLY!!!!! 

I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.

First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.

About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla. 

Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4. 

My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.

This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50.
