I went to Taco Guild for my birthday, and the food was absolutely wonderful.  They have a simple menu, but what they have is exceptional!  I am a bit of a guacamole snob, and theres is the best I have tasted anywhere, period.  The server, Jesse, was exceptional, friendly, and made sure everything was up to par.  One of the owners came over, introduced herself, and was very friendly.  The service was just to the point that you weren't annoyed with them constantly checking on you (face it, we all know what that's like), but checked enough to be sure we were completely comfortable. (and full!).  The restaraunt is near downtown (ish), so it isn't a long trip.  Service was fast too.  They took an old church and made a restaraunt that is functional and works.  Stained glass windows, and even have old church buletins on one wall.  I will be going back.
