What an amazing experience!!! Talk about feeling right at home. Paquime "Street Food of Mexico" not only satisfied my need for authentic flavor but blew my mind with a beautiful setting and hygienic restrooms. 
Had a rough time picking a dish due to the fact that everything sounded and looked soooooo good! But went with my gut feeling and indulged into the chicken flautas. (4 hand rolled taquitos, fried to a golden brown and delicious state,topped off with Mexican cream tomato onion avocado an avocado pur√©e to die for and some queso fresco) 
Paquime thank you for making my first experience an unforgettable one. The flan Napolitano took me back to my grandmas kitchen making me a firm believer that "Paquime" is true authentic Mexican food. 
I will definitely be back with company in hand.
