Why more [places like this don't exist in AZ, I'll never know.  If you're looking for that old Europe feel, this is an excellent choice.  Although this spot is awesome at any time of the year, I think when the weather turns cooler, this is like a trip to your fantasy of an Olde English Public House.  There is an upstairs restaurant and a downstairs cellar bar. I'll be focusing on the Cellar bar.

Downstairs is amazing. There are/were only a couple bars in PHX that I can think of that were underground and this is one of them. It's swanky, candle-lit, and it has some of the best happy hour specials I've ever experienced. Their "small plate's" are truly some of the finest creations I've ever had for the price.  I would recommend trying them all out eventually, but start with one or two. For $5 during happy hour, they can't be beat.

As for the drinks, there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday all bottles of wine are 1/2 price.  And they have some excellent wines. The other time is regular happy hour all week from 3-6.  For me, it's all about going on a Sun, Mon or Tues during HH! 1/2 of bottles of wine, cocktail specials AND $5 small plates. I'll call it budget-swank. Excellent experience for not too much money./Art
