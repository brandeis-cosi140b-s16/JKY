Great Place for Mexican food and to watch or listen to the football games.  Everything was great, service, quality taste, portion size.  I do recommend you order their hotter sauce, much more flavorful than their standard sauce.  I had the Fajitas (steak and shrimp combo) and my wife had the fish tacos.  The Yelp deal made it even better.
