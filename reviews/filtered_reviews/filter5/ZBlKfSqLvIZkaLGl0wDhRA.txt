Like others, I too drive by this place and it's always packed with cars in its lot. Drove by many times to eat here and always had a line out the door, until tonight and there was a free spot  up front. I took it and went in. The food was very unlike many other Mexican Places in town which i find refreshing! LOVE IT! The waitress was very nice and NOTHING was wrong with my food. Large portions and very yummy! Will be back if i can find a free spot!!!!
