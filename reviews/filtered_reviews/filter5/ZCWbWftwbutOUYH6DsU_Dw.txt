I love this place so much that I get take out from here on a weekly basis.  If I have company that want to go to authentic local food (nothing fancy), then I head to La Fonda.  Easy to get in.  Nothing fancy, but good food and good service.  Their servers have been there a while and always remember me which is a nice touch.  Their tamales are made fresh and are DELICIOUS.  Their salsa is fresh and yummy.  The place is "old Scottsdale" for sure, but you will enjoy it.  There are always a lot of people eating, but I never seem to have to wait.
