This is by far the best Mexican food I have ever eaten! This is huge for me to say because I am from California and consider myself to be quite a Mexican food snob. I love the salsa selections. The guacamole is amazing! Their tacos are extremely unique and unbelievably good. I have no idea what these people are ordering that say the food is flavorless. I was quite shocked when I read those reviews. The only thing that maybe could use a little more seasoning is the chips if you like salt (they are still delicious). Everything tastes fresh, flavorful and high quality. I do prefer to go to happy hour or ladies night out to save some cash. The food is a little pricey outside of these specials. Ladies night out is extra fun because you have the best odds in Las Vegas to actually win a good prize (Although one time they forgot to give me a raffle ticket so that was a bummer)! I live in Henderson and I desperately wish that they would open the Green Valley location. They have been teasing us for over a year now saying that they would. It is probably better that they haven't because I would be there all the time! For now I will happily drive across town to eat here. I rarely take my time to review any businesses but I have to say this one is amazing!
