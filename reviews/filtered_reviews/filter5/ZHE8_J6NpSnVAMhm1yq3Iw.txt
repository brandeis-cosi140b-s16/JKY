Look... it's a dive shop.  It's small, and you'd miss it if you weren't looking for it.  But the food is awesome.  The food is fresh.  The food alone deserves the 5 stars.  What sweetens the pot here is how cheap everything is.  The food and drinks are as cheap as you'll find and the employees are sweet as well.  The owner, Art, he is a doll.  He is normally always there, or he was there every time I have gone.  This is really a great well kept secret.  It's worth the visit and all the follow up visits after that.
