Carolina's is our new favorite for fast, cheap, spicy, awesome Mexican food.  How can you go wrong with homemade tortillas (they sell them by the dozen, cheap, and way better than what you'll get at the grocery store), chips, salsa, and my favorite, a red chile burro?  You can't.  The spice is perfect, hot but not overpowering of the flavor.  And 3 of us can eat for $20.  Where else can you get that kind of price with this kind of quality?  There's a reason we're regulars here!
