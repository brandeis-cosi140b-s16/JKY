I am still thinking about my Chile relleno and it has been hours since I ate it.
The menu here is giant, with more items than you could ever hope to try in your lifetime. I would love to try all of the family recipes most of all because those are truly unique. The live music, the wait staff, and overall service are top notch. It is a louder restaurant, especially when someone has a birthday, but great for families and groups, while still maintaining enough intimacy for a possible date night environment. 
The food itself shows devotion to small finishing touches and detail. Instead of plain rice as a side, veggies are mixed in. My dining companion ordered a burrito and it was nearly the size of a loaf of bread. For real, you will get enough food to take home, so be prepared to have a second and possibly third meal out of what you order!
