Whenever I am home visiting family in Phoenix I make sure to stop at Carolina's.  This is definitely my favorite place for Mexican food in Phoenix.  Its appearance may scare a first-timer...it is in a rough neighborhood and the building looks like it's on its last leg, but don't be fooled!  It has been my experience that the rougher a place looks, the tastier the food is.  

We recently brought 3 dozen tortillas back with us to MA to eat and share with friends.  Everyone was impressed.  I usually order the taco & enchilada combo plate, which is absolutely delish.  If you get nothing else, be sure you get a buttered tortilla!
