Juan's is hands down my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix. Everything I've had has been delicious and the prices are very reasonable. Staff is always friendly as well! I work at a large agency not too far from Juan's and everyone is obsessed with the shredded beef tacos. Try the #2 beef. You shall not regret it!
