We  have been back to Dick's twice recently.  We went both times for breakfast.  Both times were amazing.  The first time I had the green chile meatloaf and eggs.  The second time I had scrambled eggs.  Huge portions and excellent taste.  The service on both visits were perfect.  We will be back again soon.  

Do yourself a favor and try it out.  You wont be sorry.
