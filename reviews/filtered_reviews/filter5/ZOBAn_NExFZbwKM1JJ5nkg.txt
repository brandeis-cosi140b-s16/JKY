Went there for the first time this Saturday.
Went back again last night.

What can I say.....this place is good.  DAMN GOOD.

On the first trip, I had the Bulgogi Burrito and a Pork Fusion Taco.
It was love at first bite.
Every single bite was savored from beginning to end.

On the second trip, I had the Pork Burrito and a Chicken Fusion Taco.
I thought that I would be over the taste already, but I lied to myself.  I was still able to savor every single bite.

The food portions were huge and super cheap.
We were also served chips, guac, and salsa while we waited for our food.

I live in Henderson and this place is near Downtown Vegas.  It's kind of far from me but well worth the drive.

I plan on becoming a regular patron of this establishment, as well as telling everyone I know to support this business.


5 well deserved stars!  Keep up the good work!
