I may be a bit too enthusiastic about Gallo Blanco because I've been craving a genuine taqueria with great food and reasonable prices.  Gallo Blanco delivers on both fronts.  The owner was the founding chef at LGO and his attention to quality ingredients shows.  We started with the Chicharron de Queso - sort of a fried cheese crisp - with a terrific aioli dipping sauce.  The Queso wasn't my favorite but my wife loved it.  Things picked up with the vegetable of the day - baked asparagus.  Well seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The highlight for me was the Carne Asada Torta ($6.00), a delicious sandwich with a fried egg on top.  Truly spectacular.  I'll come back for this dish alone but don't let that stop you from trying the rest of the menu.
The Vegetarian taco (Verduras de Temporada) was spectacular and at only $2.00, you should order a few to fill up.  We finished our meal with the Postre de Chocolate, a pudding, marshmallow and graham cracker dessert that is to smores what creme boule is to caramel.  
We also tried several of GB's drinks.  The Michelada ($5.00) was refreshing and tasty and the Horchata very tasty (and much less sweet than the saccharin types served too often).  I also tried a Vodka Aguas Frescas ($7.00) - in this case, watermelon, not my favorite fruit but still darn tasty.  When I commented that I'd order it again with a bit more lime and alcohol another appeared gratis.  These people care about their customers.  With great food and a great location (how about a cocktail on the rooftop afterward?) Gallo Blanco is a great addition to the CenPho dining scene.
