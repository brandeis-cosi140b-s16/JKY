I am sad to see Fin-n-feather go, which was the previous restaurant at  this location.  They had my favorite fried fish in town..

But I decided to make the best of it and try the new place.  I've now been twice, very pleased each time.  My girlfriend and I have tried the carnitas huarache, a torta alpastor special, the tongue tacos, and the carnitas burrito.  They've all been great.  Fresh vegetables and flavorful, tender meat.

The huarache came with a grilled pineapple to put on it.  I was a little skeptical but it was delicious.  Everything comes with cilantro and onion, and most come with lettuce and tomato.  Our take-out meals came with a bag of fresh fried chips and three little plastic containers of sauce - one salsa verde, one fruity salsa, and one more spicy orange salsa.  They were all excellent.  (The second time we went, the chips were a little more greasy, but they had definitely been recently fried.)

They're fast on take-out, and if they stay this good, it may be hard to eat in at one of the tables.

My only complaint is that they do not have horchata at the moment.

My two favorite places for Mexican in town now are Mas Amigos and this place - and both are excellent.  The prices on most entrees is around $6-7 - which is actually comparable to what it costs to get enough fast food to fill us up.  Between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or here, the choice is clear.
