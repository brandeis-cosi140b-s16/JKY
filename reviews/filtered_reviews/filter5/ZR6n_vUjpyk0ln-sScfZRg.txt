Incredibly good tasting food and top notch service by Neil. We hail from SoCal, so we know Mexican cuisine and food claiming to be Mexican. This is the real deal. You know that you are headed for a fantastic dinner when the chips and 3 varieties of salsa are literally perfect. We added the table side made guacamole that was in a word perfect. My daughters had the taquitos (best ever tasted), wife had the burrito (couldn't rave enough about it) and I tried the Cochinita Pibil. There wasn't a single plate that wasn't true perfect and authentic Mexican cuisine. Whoever came up with the recipes and to the man in the back who's job is to make these recipes daily, I am truly impressed. Thank you so much for everything!!!
