I have lived in La Vegas since 1994 and I have NEVER had a fish taco like Phat Pranks.  Awesome, fresh food, not greasy.   Frank works behind the counter and greets people with hospitality that is unheard of in Las Vegas.  The tortas are also delish.   Prices are great, you can get  lunch for about $7-$10.  Give it a try, I have added Phat Phranks to my list of yumminess.
