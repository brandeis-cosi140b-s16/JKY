ISLA serves what I call fancy-pants Mexican food (anyone who did time in the O.C. like me will recognize the distinction in terms of El Torito vs. El Torito Grill). My hubs had raved about eating here on another trip, so naturally I insisted on checking it out for myself. 

We started off with nice big drinks: a top-shelf or whatever margarita for himself, and the blackberry/merlot sangria for me (bar was unfortunately out of my first choice of peach/chardonnay). The the house chips and salsa showed up, a large bowl of warm chips with three distinct dips, a green and a red (both smooth), and a chunky pico. For an appetizer we shared the masa quesadilla, two corny and cheesy half-moons drizzled with crema and cojita. I vacillated between chicken tinga tacos and the short rib enchilada, but went with the beef dish and was glad I did. The sauce was tangy and smoky, the corn tortilla roll-ups had a nice crispiness around the edges, and the short rib was tender and flavorful. Hubby had the pork posole dish, and he said it was excellent. 

The service was good, wavering a little only at the end (wait for check), but by then it was after 11 so I can understand somewhat. Also, my meat and salsa coma put me in a benevolent mood.
