YUM! Best place I've found so far in phoenix.

This place packs flavor into their tacos. I went with my boyfriend last night and ordered the chicken street tacos. He got tacos al pastor. Both were so frikin good. My mouth was watering. And the green and red sauce they give you really take things to the next level. The tacos are pretty small so my boyfriend had to order some more food to fill him up and he got one of his personal favorites, tamales. He said they were some of the best he ever had. The prices are great too. Very inexpensive for such good quality.

We moved here two weeks ago and this is the one of two places that we have loved. Other places we have tried out lack flavor and seem to love to pile on the cheese and sour cream to make up for it. 

Writing this review is making me relive the joy of eating there I might just go back tonight!
