So glad we found a mexican restaurant on this side of town!  Was pleasantly surprised...cute shopping center and decor. The place was busy for lunch on Saturday with no waiting time.  The chips and salsa/bean dip were good.... The husband got the Street Tacos (chicken and carnitas) which was excellent served along side beans and rice.  I got the Mexican style Hamburguesa (because we just had mexican the night before!) and this was like a torta, but so tasty!  Not like a regular hamburger and big enough to share!  They have a  great happy hour M-F which I can't wait to try when I'm not pregnant and can enjoy some margaritas!  :)  Can't wait to go back. Fun atmosphere and would love to sit outside next time.
