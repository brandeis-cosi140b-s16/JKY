This has become our favorite Mexican place in Charlotte (really no comparison). This is the only place we can go, get a couple beers, app, and 2 entrees plus tip and come out under $25 bucks (and have leftovers!). They have great beer specials almost any day of the week. The queso fundido with chorizo and carmelized onions is a don't-miss. Used to always order a la carte (try the beef tongue tacos!!) until I discovered the Shrimp Quesadilla. It's AMAZING!! Shrimp is high in quality and quantity and buttery delicious. Super cheesy also!!
