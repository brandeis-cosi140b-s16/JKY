My friend wanted to try Mavericks when it had just opened so we went- Our server Katie was really cool and we felt at home immediately.   We tried the tacos, we also ordered some of the sides to pass around the table.  The street corn was awesome.  The food was full of bold flavors all around.  We have been back a bunch of times.  The chimichuri beef has settled as my favorite on the menu.  (try it in a taco, or on the Maverick Salad) The salsa trio is from flavor country for sure!!  That alone would keep me coming back, but then there's the staff- Reem and Niki in the bar like happy customers and full glasses.  Blood Orange Margaritas?   Blackberry margaritas?  Cool drink specials.  
One of my friends from California was just visiting- we had dinner at Mavericks.  I think 5 staff came over to check in for hellos.   Everyone has been really friendly and welcoming- since I'm new in Charlotte this has been just as satisfying for me as the food.  My visitor (a vegetarian) also gave it his stamp of approval- he had the fried avocado tacos with black eye peas.  
The Rock and Roll aspects are cool too- murals, collage and sculptures, not to mention the soundtrack- Nirvana, Zeppelin and Tribe Called Quest....the genre is broad.  Your server might be wearing a Beatles or Bob Marley shirt.  It's casual and playful.  Now if they would only open a pop up at the Music Factory so they would have some live music to add to the mix... I'd buy tacos at the Filmore. For some of the games we have watched at Maverick's, there's been a DJ mixing on a Saturday night. It makes for a great hangout...and they really do try to keep your glasses full!  Everything they do keeps me coming back for more.
