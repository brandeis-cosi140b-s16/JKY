Like everyone else, I saw it on DDD. 

I love good mexican food, and this was GOOD. I was really curious about their carnitas that they cook with sweetened condensed milk (or maybe it's evaporated) and I was surprised how tender and flavorful they were. 

The carne asada was super good. I don't know what it was marinated in, but it seemed to have way more flavor than I am used to in carne asada, and I mean that in a good way. I loved it. I loved it more than the carnitas that I was looking forward to! 

Their horchata is also really good. Rich and creamy with visible spices. Definitely not the typical fountain drink style horchata. 

I would go back in a heartbeat and look forward to returning to Phoenix to do so =)
