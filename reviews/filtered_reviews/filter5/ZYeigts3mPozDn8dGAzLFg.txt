If you find yourself stuck at PDX and are in need of food, you could do much worse than eating at America's Taco Shop at Terminal 5. 

The staff here are friendly and professional. I had a chicken quesadilla and they loaded it with very delicious cubed chicken from their griddle. Also, they have totally kickass habanero sauce. Come here, eat lots of delicious food before getting on your big flying germ tube to whatever your destination might be.
