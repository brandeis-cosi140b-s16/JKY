Their fresh chips and salsa alone are worth going for! Three Amigos is cheap and delicious Mexican food. I unfortunately live up the street from it so I find myself here for dollar tacos on weekdays 1-5pm far too often haha. 

I can never remember the name of my favorite dish but it's Pollo something and it comes in a stewed red sauce with tortillas and full jalape√±os. One of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had and it's like 8 bucks. Typically I get two meals out of a lo of their entrees; the portions are huge. Not complaining. Their nacho plate is fit for a small village as well!

Tequila Tuesdays are surely dangerous and Their margaritas specials are the same. This place gets packed on Fridays and Saturdays!
