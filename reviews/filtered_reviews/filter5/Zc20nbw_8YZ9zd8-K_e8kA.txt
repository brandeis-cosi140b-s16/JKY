This is my neighborhood favorite.  My wife and I go a couple times a week and generally just sit at the bar for food and drinks.   The bartenders are awesome.  Rob, Haylee, and Lupita are all fantastic and friendly.  They make us feel right at home and are half the reason we keep coming back so often.  The other half is the great food.  Never disappoints, and they are always willing to customize an order for us if we ask.

Fun atmosphere.  Great for family, night out with friends or even a date night.
