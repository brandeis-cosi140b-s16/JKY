A small, inexpensive mexican restaurant in Phoenix that you must try if you are into spicy food. It's not one of those posh restaurants, so expect that kind of service. If you care about the food more (and you should, unless the service is horrible), you won't be dissapointed.

The hot salsa they bring with chips is superb. I tried their chicharrones burro and machaca burro. Both were really good; especially the gree chili flavor the chicharrones had was awesome!
