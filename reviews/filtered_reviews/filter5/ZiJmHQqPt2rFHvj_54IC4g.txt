WOW! All I can say is WOW!

My husband and I went out to the new local bar in our neighborhood, and what a gem we found!

The host pointed us towards the bar, we sat at the bar on the side closest to the door, not knowing that it was a huge bar. Sat down and right away a bartender greeted us with a big smile, told us about the $3 Tequila shot and $2 PBR. She gave us some pointers on how to order from the menu, and answered all of our questions while making drinks for us.

We shared the guacamole, short rib and mole taco...... So fresh!!!! the guacamole is probably the best we have ever had!

We love this place! We will come back for the food, but most of all for the service!!!

Cobra made our first night in Bakersfield AMAZING! Great attitude, personality, and conversation! This place is a A but Cobra made this place an A+++++++
