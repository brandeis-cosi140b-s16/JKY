This place has bomb carne asada tacos. How the heck do they get so much flava in that tiny taco? And the Tortas are delicious too. We usually go in the evening but I've heard there are lines out the door for lunch. Highly recommended. Oh and if you want a flan be sure to ask for it when you order or else it just might be gone :)
