Great place for salsa, tacos and quesadillas. I had street tacos, very good, different and fresh. My friend had a quesadilla that looked more like a calzone. It was superb. Tried about 10 salsas, fun to try then all. Loved the cilantro salsa. Small place and lots of people so try to go outside of the noon hour.
