My husband and I tried Joyride on Saturday for date night. It exceeded my expectations! From tasty unique cocktails to authentic and delicious street tacos and street corn, we we very pleased. Many restaurants in the Heritage District are busy on Saturday night at 7pm, but we found seats quickly at the bar and didn't mind. I am guessing a little earlier would have garnered us a table. I can't wait to take family there when they visit town next month.
