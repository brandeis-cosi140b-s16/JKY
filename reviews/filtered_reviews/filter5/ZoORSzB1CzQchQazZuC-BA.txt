5 stars for Pinches Tacos. Today was a great day to walk around Fremont Street and visit the fun Container Park. There's a variable bevy of stores and Restaurants and having a hankering for Mexican, Pinches Tacos sweet and subtle name was just the ticket. 
I ordered the 3 taco plate (chicken) with rice and beans, delicious. Fresh and tasty. My husband got the chicken burrito with rice and beans, he said it was great. The guac and chips were really good, the guacamole was fresh and the texture was just right. The friends we were with got taqitos and fish tacos, which they commented were very good, as well. 
Service was friendly and accommodating, the place was clean and organized. They find you seated outside and bring you the food. 
Bill for us was $25 and change.
I'll be visiting Pinches Tacos again.
