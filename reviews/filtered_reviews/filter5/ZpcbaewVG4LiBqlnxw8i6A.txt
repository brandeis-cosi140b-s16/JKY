The restaurant is clean and bright and each time I have been the staff have been more than welcoming. They engage in conversation with you and genuinely seem happy that you came.

I've been three times now, and had different items each time. Everything is great! The fish tacos, the shrimp burrito, the steak tacos, the breakfast tacos, everything! The tortillas had a great texture and flavour. Loved the cartinas!

You should go check it out!
