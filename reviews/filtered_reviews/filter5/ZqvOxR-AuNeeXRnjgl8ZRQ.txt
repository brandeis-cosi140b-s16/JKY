I've been here twice now, both times with friends and our kids. We love sitting outside and letting them run around and play. 

The kids meals are tasty and only $5 or $6. Since they are pretty large portions, it's enough food for us to share a meal with them... Score! 

There are lots of specialty cocktail options, beer, and wine. It's a nice place to sit, talk, and enjoy an adult beverage... or two!

The servers are attentive, the food comes out quick, no complaints on customer service here!
