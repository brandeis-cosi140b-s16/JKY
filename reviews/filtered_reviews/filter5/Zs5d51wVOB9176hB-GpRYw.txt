There is no traditional Mexican food even close to the "life changing" feeling your body and soul experiences at Rito's!!!!!  I suggest any burrito made enchilada style with two mouth watering tacos!!!!! This place is LIFE CHANGING!!!! Owners all the way down to the individual who thankfully accepts your money is all family!! I felt at home!!!!!
