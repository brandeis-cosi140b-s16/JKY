My definition of Central Phoenix ended at around the 12ths on both sides, but this place and Urban Beans have taught me the folly of my ways.  Condessa is a simple and beautiful spot, serving a different, more expansive menu than most of the other Mexican restaurants I've been sampling.

First impressions won me over on first step in, I am in love with the Dios los Muertos art aesthetic and they have some beautiful works adorning their walls and doors.  The self-described gourmet menu was enticing, many selections I've never seen in person, only read about in my food travel readings, so I was intrigued.  I really wish I was more hungry, I settled on the Queso which was recommended by my server.

The food takes a bit of time to prepare, but that does give you time to enjoy the salsa bar, which this day included 10 varieties including strawberry, chipolte, a creamy cilantro, guac, pico, can't remember them all.  When my Queso came I was a bit shocked by it's size and relativity to fry-bread, not that this is a bad thing.  The pork inside was unbelievable, comparable in portion size and taste to that of much more expensive places.  Fried cheesy porky goodness, topped with rotating different salsas, each bite was another slice of heaven.

My gripes:  I have much respect for the work they put in to make this food outstanding, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with the plastic silverware,  cheap baskets and togo cups.  I know doing dishes is annoying, but you need to match your great food with great accoutrement.

After writing this, I'm going back today.  Yum.
