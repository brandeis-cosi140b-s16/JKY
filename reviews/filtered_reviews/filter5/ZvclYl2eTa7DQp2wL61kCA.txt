If there is anything I'd miss if I were to leave Phoenix, it would have to be the Mexican food.  That's what we're good for (and to think we're trying to get rid of the Mexicans!).  There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall, everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's, Garcia's, and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places.

La Condesa is one of those niche places, and one of my favorites.  Here, their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos, salsa, and quesadillas.  

The tacos come in several varieties, with meats including chicken, beef, pork, whitefish, and even dogfish shark, and different spices and toppings on each one.  My favorites are, of course, the shark, as well as the black mole, and one of the beef ones (not the Sonoran).

The salsas are also a big draw: prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa, strawberry salsa, cilantro salsa, or even my personal favorite, pecan salsa.  There are typically about 20 choices, so if you want to try them all, come with a few friends (it does get crowded, though).

The quesadillas are also delicious; they're a southern Mexican fried style.  They're quite heavy, so don't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos *and* a quesadilla.

Oh...and GET THE HORCHATA.  You won't regret it.  I won't describe it, just because I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But it will blow your mind.  Whenever I get it, which is always, someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is.
