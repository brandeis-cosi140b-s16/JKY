I had the Ensalada Fila.  It was a delicious salad, and I know my salads!  The others in my party loved their food as well.  Delicious!  I live far away but will come again when I next visit.  It is a fun place with great food and friendly service.  It has a loud atmosphere so not the place for a quiet dinner, but fun and even kid friendly.
