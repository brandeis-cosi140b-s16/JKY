Best Mexican food in. Vegas bar none. They authentic and the table side guacamole is excellent. They have a few dishes in this restaurant that I have only seen in Mexico. I would recommend either of their mole selections because both are excellent, but my absolute favorite is the Tia Esther chicken plate. It's a little spicy but it's amazing. Be careful not to fill up on chips
