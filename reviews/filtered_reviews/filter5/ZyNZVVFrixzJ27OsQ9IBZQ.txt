Oh my goodness!!!!! How could I have forgotten to review Los Favs?!?!?!?!? This is the absolute BEST little taco shop in the Tempe/Phoenix area. I cannot explain it, but they make the most wonderful food. It doesn't taste like every other Mexican food joint; it is legit!!!! The customer service is 100% on game every time. 
Some of the top choices include the Carne Asada Fries (you can have them make this into a burrito for you too), vegetarian burrito, super nachos, and they have the BEST cheeseburgers. I don't know what it is, but they are just pure yumminess. You cannot go wrong with any of the breakfast burritos either. I just moved to Oregon and this place is one of things I miss most about AZ. Enjoy!!!!!!
