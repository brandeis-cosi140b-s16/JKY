The ambiance is wonderful, I could have easily been in a higher end restaurant in Mexico. The weight staff was very attentive in a good way and made fabulous suggestions.  I had a Shrimp dish that was out of this world and it was served over amazing fresh veggies.  Everyone at the table agreed this was a fabulous find in downtown.  I'd even make the trip over from the main strip to go here.
