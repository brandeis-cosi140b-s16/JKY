We went to Los Reyes de la Torta last weekend for the first time. I was excited about the food, but wondered if it would be difficult to order and about the standards of cleanliness. 

Both concerns were completely unfounded. The staff there were English-speaking and very friendly. The place appeared to be quite clean, too! 

We ordered two agua frescas. One was mango and the other was cantaloupe/watermelon on the waitress' recommendation. Wow! Both were so fresh and delicious. Not too sweet, either. 

Our sandwiches were the del Rey and the Arizona. They were both huge and served on some really good sandwich buns. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw all the stuff they squeezed into both sandwiches! Ham, pork sirloin, chorizo, sausage, egg, avocado, jalapenos, breaded beef-- probably some things I'm forgetting. 

Somehow the flavors meld together to create the most savory combination with just a little heat. I had to stop after eating half my sammy due to threat of gastric explosion. Hubby ate the entire del Rey. Guess skinny guys must have a hollow leg where they put giant meals. 

I loved my meal. It's the kind of thing you'd see on "thisiswhyyourefat.com" but soooooo worth it. We will be going back and plan to blow our out-of-town guests' minds with this place next time they visit! I forgot to mention our meal was less than $30 including tip.
