I've been eating Carlos O'Brien's for over 15 years now and it's always awesome every time! I love the Pollo Fundito, pretty much what I get every time! Enchiladas are awesome too! If you order to go - I swear they give you more beans and rice than if you dine in... it's crazy!  Very good bar selection as well and they seem to always have some sort of sports on TV in there.
