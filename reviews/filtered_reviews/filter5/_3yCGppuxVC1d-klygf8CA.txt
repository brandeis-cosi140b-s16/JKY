Great service, solid selection on menu for a "TexMex" place -delicious corn bread was complimentary. Very reasonable prices - will definitely come back for happy hour - service was phenomenal. Decent beer selection but they're known for their margaritas. Full liquor selection. Overall a really solid experience!
