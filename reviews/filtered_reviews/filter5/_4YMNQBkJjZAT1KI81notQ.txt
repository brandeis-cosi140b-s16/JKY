I'm going to give this place five stars because it is in surprise. So far the best Mexican food I've tried here which isn't saying much considering I've been to Macayos and that place is awful. Any other place like southern Cali I'd still give it a 4. Ordered the rio Rico burrito( I think that's what it's called) with shrimp for 16.50 and oh my yum was it delicious!! Every bite had big juicy shrimp, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and the sauce was amazing. It came with refried beans and rice which were good as well. The chips and salsa were delicious too. All in all everything was delicious and we will be back again. It's better than a-ok. 
Service- great and attentive.
Cleanliness- good. 
I know good Mexican food and what I had tonight was it.
