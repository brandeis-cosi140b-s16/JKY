Damn this place is tasty! I make a point to stop in Los Algodones en route to California often just to get some street taco's and these guys have nailed it. They seem subscribe to the K.I.S.S. motto (keep it simple stupid) by just making really good carne asada and now empanadas (pork) for there taco's and burritos. Easy authentic street taco's love it.

The margaritas come in 3 flavors, I'm a fan of the standard but the hibiscus was pretty tasty as well. They have an awesome outside patio to knock down a few and have a pretty good happy hour at $4 a pop.

All the small touches make this place great from the tortillas to the gauc and salsas, its definitely my new favorite joint downtown and not a bad bike ride up to Melrose District from Palm-croft.
