This place puts the ROCK in rock taco! 

I went for lunch this past Tuesday and enjoyed one of their signature beer-ritas with a girl friend who, to her delight, was able to have her favorite beer on draft. We shared an amazing pineapple guacamole dip and I devoured a delicious and fresh shrimp taco (hand-delivered by a chef, too- nice touch!)

We truly enjoyed looking around at all the decor, especially the beautiful and giant handmade American flag wall! Also, the painted posters in the bathroom are awesome. 

The service was great, the manager was super friendly and welcoming, and my whole experience was truly wonderful. We can't wait to return for a taste of the nightlife! It's about a 30 min drive from the Huntersville area, but well worth the drive!

PS. I'm no Nancy Drew, but it seems to me that the user Jeff B. might just be the owner of nearby Brazwells. If I were you I'd skip that review ;)
