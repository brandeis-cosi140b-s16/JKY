Excellent food and an unbelievable price. Made the trek to this restaurant from the east side of Henderson based on the reviews and wanting good Mexican food. I ate the Carnitas burrito which was delicious. The churros and ice cream was a perfect way to finish off the meal. Will definitely make the trek out to Mama Maria's once again!
