Absolutely fantastic meal! Shawna the Manager on shift was amazing. She visited our table at least three times and at exactly the right time. Wait staff was as good as any that we have experienced including high end restaurants. 
 Now to the food - guacamole was simple but excellent- margarita with no name was simple but excellent - Paco's tacos - shrimp - turkey were the best. 
 We will definitely be back.
