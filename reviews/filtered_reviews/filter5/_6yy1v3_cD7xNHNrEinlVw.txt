Being a Hispanic from Wyoming and Colorado In Las Vegas options for New Mexican food come far between, the only other location I know of is Carlitos but is completely on the other side of town. It's great that there is an option just down the street. This restaurant is very clean and the server was extremely nice.!! I look forward to coming back.
