Great breakfast burritos! I stopped in here one morning on a whim and ordered the house special breakfast burrito and it was delicious! Very fresh ingredients (potatoes, scrambled eggs, grilled onions and grilled jalape√±os-with optional meat for extra $) all cooked very well. I stopped in the next day with my husband and now he's hooked. We've  since tried carne asada, ham, chorizo and veggies in the burrito, all were great.  The restaurant itself is cleaner and seems roomier than when it was Fry Bread House.  Give yourself 10-15 minutes for the order to be prepared; if you are taking to go and  want it faster, call ahead.
