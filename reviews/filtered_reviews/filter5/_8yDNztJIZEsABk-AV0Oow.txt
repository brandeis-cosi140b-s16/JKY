Read the reviews and just had to try this place, although I was a little skeptical about a restaurant in a butcher shop.  It was fabulous.  So many reviewers recommended the shrimp and corn tamale that I ordered it.  It was delicious.  The drinks are generous and it was comfortable sitting inside - plenty of room.
