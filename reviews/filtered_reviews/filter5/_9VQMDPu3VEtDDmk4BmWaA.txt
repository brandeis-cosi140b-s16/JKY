Pretty cool new spot at the Red Rock.  If you work in the industry you can sign up for their 50% off industry card (hell yeah!).  Every drink my server, Matt, recommended was delicious and actually tasted pretty strong, even the sangria! Yes! 

My server was on point.  I loved everything I got with the exception of some of the salsas.... They actually charge for their itty bitty salsas. 

Definitely get the queso with the mushrooms and ask for Matt if you want good service and to be led in the right direction. Definitely be back for industry night.
