I have lived in Charlotte for the last 18 years, and this is my go-to place, and would highly recommend this to any out of towners just looking for a good meal for not a lot of money. Sure, its not your "authentic southern cuisine" but it is incredible food. 

If you don't know what to get, ALWAYS get the tacos. You get 2 tacos and can even pick 2 different kinds. The tacos are served on this delicious flour tortilla with your choice of fish (or meat), avocado, cilantro lime sauce, and tomatoes. My default is always the blackened mahi and BBQ mahi, but would also highly recommend the beer battered fish, salmon, or shrimp. Your tacos are served with a choice of side: beans and rice, refried beans, avocado pasta salad, or a seasonal side. The avocado pasta salad is INSANE and is served cold with a spicy kick.

The drinks are very reasonably priced and the atmosphere is great. There are usually some street musicians playing outside and the artwork all around is really creative. Cabo can get crowded if you come at the dinner rush on Friday nights, but once you are seated your food only takes about 10 minutes until it is hot and on the table. 

Whenever my friends are trying to figure a place to meet for dinner, they can always count on me to suggest Cabo because in the 50+ times I've eaten here I have never had a bad meal or bad experience. 5/5 stars all around.
