Definitely the best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had - previous review likened the cheese to crack - that is no joke (not that I know what crack is like, but still).
Hole in the wall - easy to drive by if you aren't looking for it.
Carne asada taco was great, too.  Was just ok on the rice and refritos that came on the side.
Will definitely be back!
