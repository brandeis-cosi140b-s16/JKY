Love Restaurant Mexico. I have been eating here for over 10 years, actually more like20 years, in three different locations. Clare burro is terrific, beans, avocado and green sauce. The guacamole is fresh and chopped rather than the green puree they serve at most restaurants. I also love that they don't melt a giant wad of american cheese over the top of everything they make, like most Mexican restaurants seem to these days. They only down side is the chips are terrible, always have been. But everything else is great.
