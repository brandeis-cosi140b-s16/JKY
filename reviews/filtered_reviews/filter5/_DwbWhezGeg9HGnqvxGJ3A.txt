Ive been coming to Guadalajara for about 20 years now....Im 23. I remember my entire family would com here to eat all the time. I use to order the nuggets when i was a kid, lol. But seriously every since i can remember the food has always been authentic and delicious. The service has always been great too. They accommodate to large parties as well. Make sure you get here early on the weekends tho, It get SUPER BUSY and will most likely have to wait for a table. But trust me, you want to wait. Over the years this place got more and more popular and has gone through alot of extensions and renovations but has always remained the same as far as the food goes. I remember they use to have live mariachis coming table to table asking if they would like a song. They were great as well, but i can see why they arent there anymore. Alot of business people come here now since its downtown but This place is hands down my favorite and only Mexican restaurant i eat at, and ive been Mexican my entire life. Trust me. EAT HERE!
