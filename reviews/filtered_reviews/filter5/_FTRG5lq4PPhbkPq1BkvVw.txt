I went into Cien Agave last week because I've heard so much about the margaritas. My server, Anne, gave me an excellent recommendation! She suggested the Cadillac margarita which knocked my socks off it was so good! The food was okay but I would definitely come back for the well crafted margaritas and the fun, perky service! Anne insisted that I try the avocado margarita next time so of course I have to come back!
