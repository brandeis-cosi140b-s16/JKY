Found this restaurant on Yelp.  Visiting AZ for Spring Training.   You have got to try this place.   Absolutely delicious!  Great food, tons of choices and yummy house margaritas.  Loved the salsa bar. 

I ordered the street tacos.  3 different flavors with beans and rice.  I had the tinga, el pastor and chicken.  Super delicious.  Rice and beans perfect with the tacos.   We had a couple of the house margaritas during happy hour and they were sweet but tart.  Food arrived quickly.   Wish I lived here so I could try everything on the menu. 

Beautiful art on the walls and very friendly staff.
