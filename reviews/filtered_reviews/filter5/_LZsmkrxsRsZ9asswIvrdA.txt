I've lived all over California, I would literally fly to Phoenix for these tacos and burritos, though this hasn't happened yet. The carne asada tacos and burritos are probably some of the best I've ever had, except for one socal taco shop. The guacamole is tops too.   

I have to admit the place is a little out of the way unless you are already near the airport.
