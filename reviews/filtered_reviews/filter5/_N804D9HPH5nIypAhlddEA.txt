The perfect blend of quality meats and spices; El Dorado Cantina nails it.  Sampled their empanadas and street tacos; chicken, pork and carne asada. Everything was flavorful, fresh and the quality of the ingredients was evident throughout. Not to be forgotten, their bartenders can prep and serve a drink! The jalape√±o and cucumber margarita is hands-down the best...anywhere. Seriously folks, check this place out. Authentic Mexican fair at its finest. Along with attentive, engaging service. Thank you, Jesse!
