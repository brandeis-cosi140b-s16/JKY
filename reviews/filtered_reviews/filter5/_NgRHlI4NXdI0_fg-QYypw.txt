Cuisine has ALWAYS been excellent. Presentation - great.  Service also excellent.
We like to come in for lunch and have their luncheon special at $8.95 a plate.  Usually have to take home some of the left overs - as they are very generous with their portions.
We used to go to the original Casa Don Juan downtown near strip - still will if we are in the area - but are so happy to see that they have opened up in Summerlin!  Ask for Jose as your server - you will be very pleased by his quality.  ALTHOUGH, everyone there REALLY TRIES
THEIR BEST TO GIVE YOU A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.  Try it - you will not regret it!!
The new restaurant has been nicely decorated and has great options for seating also.
We love the carnitas, fish tacos & their La Mexicana CDJ  salad.  Their salsa is fantastic, as is the bean dip. Freshly made tortillas and great fresh not-greasy tortilla chips for a starter.
