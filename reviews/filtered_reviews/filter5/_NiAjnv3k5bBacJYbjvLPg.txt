This place will not leave you disappointed.

First walking in, I thought I was going to be in trouble as the bar part was unusually hot. Didn't know if that was part of the Mexican charm of the place but the table seating was much cooler. You have to be careful with the chips and salsa they give you, as you will definitely eat more than you should. They are delicious.

The Cadillac margaritas were magical. It wasn't so pounded with sugar that it would make you diabetic, but it wasn't deprived of sugar to make you think you were just drinking straight tequila. It was the perfect blend and I drank a few of them. 

There are a lot of interesting dishes to try out as it appears the owner is really into putting a twist on normal Mexican food. I ordered a bone-in rib eye that had a coca-cola sauce. This was by far the most tender rib-eye I've ever had. The coca-cola sauce added a subtle flavor to the rib eye and it did a magnificent job tenderizing the steak. It's something you should really try out. 

The other nice thing they had there was entertainment. We had just missed the mariachi band, but we did get there for a guy singing karaoke. He was pretty decent and it added a nice touch to the meal. The other great thing is that, if it is your birthday (or close enough), if you tell the server, they will come out, put a sombrero on you and sing to you. The song is finished with the birthday person taking a shot of tequila and getting a birthday churro. Honestly, the churro was probably just for decoration as it was the hardest grossest churro I've ever had, but it's the thought that counts. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the place. I didn't feel like it was hokey, it felt pretty authentic with the decorations and with the faucets in the bathroom being like a water pump. The food is a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for Mexican food, but since it was really delicious with the great atmosphere, it was definitely worth it.
