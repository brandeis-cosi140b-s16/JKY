Just came here yesterday for the first time ever. Hard to find a parking space at lunch time and crowded as hell inside. Got the last table.

Had a pork barbacoa burrito, "enchilada style." The pork was a little too sweet, but the fresh home made tortilla was amazing and made up for it. Their fresh hot salsa required no additional Tapatillo. Huge selection of sodas and ice teas. 

Sort of a Tex-mex flair, but pretty much "sit down quality" mexican food at a walk-up price. If these chains evolved from Rubio's to Baja Fresh to Chiplotle, there is now a new champion, and its name is Cafe Rio. Fortunately there's one somewhat close to me in Manhattan Beach, but everyone knows that you can't get there from RPV :(
