Disappointed in the Mexican food choices in Champaign? El Sombrero, Dos Unrealness, fiesta of mexico!?. You should be disappointed because the food is mostly just reheated.

Ready to level up? Enter Maize. All ingredients are fresh and made on the spot. Seriously you can see the tortilla making presses in the back. I sometimes wonder if they have lettuce and tomato plants back there because it tastes that fresh.

I eat here minimum 3 times a week. Not only is this the best Mexican food in town but probably the best food in town.

Favorite items? Burrito + Avocado, Fish Tacos, Guacamole, Steak Tacos, Tostadas, Chicken Volcanes... seriously tho... everything on the menu is best. Level Up to Maize.
