This is the first time I have tried horchata, and it was delicious. I love the cinnamon taste of it. They serve the drink in a plastic cup, so you can conveniently take it togo. 

Before the main course, they give out complimentary chips you can munch on. The chips are quality chips - they're not the thin ones like from Rubio's. The best part is the salsa bar! They have a wide selection. Watch out for the extra spicy ones. I'm definitely returning to this cute hole in the wall place for good tacos and horchata.  

A heads up that parking in front of the restaurant is limited.
