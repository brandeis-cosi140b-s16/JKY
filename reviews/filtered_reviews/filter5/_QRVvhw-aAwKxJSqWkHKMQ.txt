Tried to eat here last Saturday. No go. Completely booked. Here in Monday -  by the way, an excellent time to come - and everything is terrific. 

One of the best things about non-corporate, owner- or chef-driven restaurants is that they can (and do, if they're good) adjust as necessary.  The chicken tanal (which I've had before and lived) was even better, with a better presentation. The pork ribs were flavorful, tender and accompanied by a delicious tomatillo sauce. 

The table salsa, delicious every time, was even better, perfect blended and seasoned; the fondue ap warm and tasty. The flan for dessert, super. 

An excellent dinner and excellent evening.
