This may just be our new favorite Mexican restaurant! Hubby and I were seated immediately, got drinks and chips right away, and settled in to look at the large menu. Hubby immediately saw the Pollo Fundido and when I told him a fellow Yelper had recommended it (thanks, Alexander!) he was done looking. Indeed, he was not steered wrong- it was an absolutely delicious combination of tender and moist chicken mixed with seasonings and topped with cream cheese and melted cheddar. I love carnitas, and so decided to give theirs a try. Holy wow- so well seasoned and savory and yet magically, you could still really taste the pork. Super tender, as well- it must have been cooked for many many hours. The beans that came on both of our molten hot plates were really good. I like it when there is actual texture to refried beans rather than a puree, and these were chunky and flavorful with melted cheese on top. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican rice, but this at least had pieces of vegetable in it and a good flavor.

We got a fried ice cream to share (thanks, Julie!) and it was huge and delicious, topped with strawberries and whipped cream. The service was warm, friendly and attentive- like being taken care of by an aunt. To top it all off, and what tipped my rating from 4 to 5 stars, was the price- $32 for two hearty entrees, beer, sodas, and dessert?!? Easily one of the best values in a quality sit-down restaurant we've had in a long time. Garcia's is going in our regular rotation.
