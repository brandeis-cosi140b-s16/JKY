I decided to pick a new place for my daughter and I to try on Oct. 30th. Being I'm nervous in public I asked for a booth which they were happy to help with even though it was the busy dinner rush. The waiter was very helpful, he even was nice enough to take a few moments to answer a few questions about the quieter times. From 9pm till 10pm on weekends it tends to be quieter!

Chips were served with 3 different salsas( mild, a green pineapple based and hot)
My daughter and I started with a cup of the tortillas soap which was lovely, the chicken melted in our mouths. We then choose to share 3 cheese enchiladas with ranchro sauce,re-fried beans and Papa con Chile. For an extra special treat we shared a Chocolate Eruption.... When it arrived it was a nice size with vanilla ice cream on one side and a nice dollop of whip cream on the other.
