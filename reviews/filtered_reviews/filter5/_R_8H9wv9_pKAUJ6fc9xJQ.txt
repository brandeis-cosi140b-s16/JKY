Carnitas, carnitas, carnitas.

I have to give a place props when they make carnitas so tender and yet the meat is not fatty.  I respect that!  Portions are so big, you can easily share this dish with someone else.  

The restaurant has a singer, our server was very attentive and upbeat, you get this addictive re-fried bean dip with the appetizer, it's easy to get full before your food comes.

I have yet to try the guac, everyone is talking about it in the yelp reviews.
