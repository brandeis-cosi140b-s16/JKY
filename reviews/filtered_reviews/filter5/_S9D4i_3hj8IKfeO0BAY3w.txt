My friend took me here and man their food was delicious! I got the fried tilapia w beans and rice and flour tortillas. The fish was fried to perfection! Lightly seasoned which is perfect because I like to add hot sauce. The server was super sweet. And omg their beer w the mango bits and chile salt rim- yum! Definitely recommended for quality authentic Mexican food! I wish it was closer to my side of town but it's worth the drive.
