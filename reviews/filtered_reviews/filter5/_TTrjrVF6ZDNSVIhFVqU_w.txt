Absolutely love this place. Food is fresh and made well. I do find that occasionally it is over salted. But if you ask for no salt they are okay with that request. 
Order the King Tacos. Super delicious and the fresh veggies that come on the plate are so welcome to an already great meal. The Agua Frescas are always yummy. 
It is very busy. But if you go at a off time it's easy to get in.
