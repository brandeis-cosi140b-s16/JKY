I think you'll notice in many of the reviews you see comments on how exceptional the service is at this location and I completely agree! Our server, Richard, was totally awesome and boosted this from a 4 star to a 5 star review. He was super friendly, helpful, attentive and made some bad-ass guacamole! The food was delicious and very authentic according to my latin boyfriend. The homemade tortillas were sooo good, the steak & chicken fajitas very tasty also. We had a great time and will definitely be back for more.
