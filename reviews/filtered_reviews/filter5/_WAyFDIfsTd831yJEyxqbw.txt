This is a great restaurant. We arrived at 6 PM and we're seated immediately. The service was quick and very professional. The food was brilliant. The avocado appetizer was perfect guacamole. Our entrees - chicken mole and a chicken tosta - were excellently prepared and presented. We each had a beer - there are good Mexican options - both priced reasonably. Easy to find, on 16th just off Thomas.
