I really enjoyed the atmosphere! We did not make reservations and the wait was not long at all, about five minutes max. The restrooms were really clean also, which is always nice. Our waitress was very sweet and I got positive vibes from all of the staff. Our food came out really fast, and I would say the portions were fair. I would definitely eat her again if I happen to be in the area.
