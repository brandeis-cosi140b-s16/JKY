There's nothing that can be said in this review that hasn't been said a million times on this Yelp page already. Everything is fantastically delicious (better than In-N-Out, even) in the "this is good food" way, NOT in the "I will pretentiously like this because it is different and seemingly fancy/low-class, even though it's actually not very good" way.  The guy at the counter when I've been has been friendly, helpful, and polite.  The place is clean. The prices are beyond reasonable.

Look, if you see a place with an overwhelming quantity of five-star reviews, you're going to either (A) jump in headfirst, or (B) be super-suspicious. But when the worst review is that only SOME of the food was really good (which is what I saw in the three low-star reviews on here, and I'm counting three stars as low to bring that count up from the one person who, for some reason that I can't comprehend, gave this place a two), it's worth a try.

And when you walk in and stand gawking at the menu and three patrons who are happily wolfing down their meals tell you, unsolicited, to try the brulee burger, the sweet potato tots, or anything else on the menu, listen to them.  You'll be glad you did.
