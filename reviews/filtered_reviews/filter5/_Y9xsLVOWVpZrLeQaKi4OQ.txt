So my wife and I have been here 4 times.  We originally had brunch here on a visit prior to moving.  I love sushi and my wife likes tacos so it works out for us.  The sushi is great and the guacamole is killer, we have had the traditional, bacon and lump crab guac.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and were okay with us slowing down service to enjoy ourselves.  The ambiance is very relaxing.
