I had no idea Tacos El Gordo was also in Vegas! I went to San Diego for college and discovered Tacos El Gordo there. So, when I found out there's two locations in Vegas too, I was pretty stoked.

I've been to this location and to the one right on the strip. I went to this one recently because one of the cab drivers we had that day said this location was way better. Anyhow, it's all about them adobada tacos! I always eat 3 of these when I go. Gets me pretty full, too! And this time, my friends and I shared the carne asada fries. I thought they were good, too. The fries were crispy and not soggy, so that was a plus for me! If you want some pretty bomb tacos that you'll ever have in your life, you have to hit up Tacos El Gordo (in Vegas OR San Diego!).
