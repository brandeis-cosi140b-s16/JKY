I love Comedor Guadalajara.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

I have rarely been disappointed, but  when I have been disappointed it was when I tied something different from what I normally order.   I typically order the same items over and over again (because I know what I like) and those selections are always fabulous.

The salsa is hot (some times it is really HOT) and the soup is soooo good.  

If you have not been and you like good Mexican food; you must try it.
