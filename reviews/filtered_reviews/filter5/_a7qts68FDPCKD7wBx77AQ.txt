Taco Tuesdays cannot be beat...$1 shredded beef tacos and $2 Tecates all day!  

If you're there on any other day, the food is delicious and in decent proportions.  Aside from having authentic Mexican dishes, the Margaritas are sensational.  This place doesn't cut corners when it comes to making top notch margaritas.

If you are a connoisseur of tequila or just prefer tasty stiff drinks then Cien Agaves is the best place in town!

Definitely try to go on a Tuesday, but if tacos aren't your thing then I suggest the Fajita Salad.
