I am always on freemont street for vacation and wanted to try something other than the hotel restaurant or Denny's. This place is so good it's crazy! I got the BBQ chicken nachos, and OMG! They said they were spicy, and yup! They were spicy! Didn't disappoint at all. Chicken, celery, buffalo sauce. And it's a big portion so I was totally stoked. My boyfriend got the BBQ chicken nachos and those were almost better! Chicken, beans, corn, pico. So great! And the customer service is great! Our server made sure we had everything we needed at all times. I will definitely be coming  here again and would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!
