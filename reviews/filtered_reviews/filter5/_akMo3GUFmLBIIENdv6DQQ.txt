Best Mexican food I've ever had in Phoenix (probably anywhere to be honest).  This is my family's go to Mexican restaurant.  I get the Carne Asada burro everytime, my wife gets the Chimichanga.

I love their chips and salsa. Usually great service, although every once in a while it's a miss. They have a good happy hour too, good margaritas.

Prices are very fair, easy to eat under $10 regardless of time of day. Of course you can spend more if you'd like.

This restaurant has been here for decades which speaks volumes to the quality of the restaurant.
