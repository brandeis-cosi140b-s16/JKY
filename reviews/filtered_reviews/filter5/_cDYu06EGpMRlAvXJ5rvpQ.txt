In the history of histories, this place has to be Ahwatukee's best kept secret. Best food in town!!!  I've been living here for over a year and we finally made our way over to Los Dos Molinos. I am from New Mexico and the salsa reminded me of my grandma. It actually made me cry. Not tears of pain but tears of joy!  Finally. Someone knows how to do it right. I got a tostada which was to die for and my main squeeze got an enchilada stack with a fried egg with beans and rice AND A chile relleno. Perfection.
