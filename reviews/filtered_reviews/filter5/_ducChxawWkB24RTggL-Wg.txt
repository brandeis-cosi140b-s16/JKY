Tried out Nacho Daddy tonight near Fremont street. 

4 thumbs way up. We started with chips n salsa and the salsa was freaking delicious. The ceviche appetizer was awesome as well and fresh. Drinks came out right away and were STRONG!!! 

The pulled pork nachos and street tacos were must haves. Our white friend ordered the gringo tacos and loved them of course. 

Our bartender Alex was on point and if you go ask to sit in her area. Super nice and busted jokes and took amazing care of us SoCal folks. We will be going back every time we are in Vegas.
