So amazing. My friend and I went here on Saturday afternoon it was our second choice after the Diablo Cantina had us waiting for over 20 minutes because they were really busy. We walked up to the hostess and sat right down and had our drinks and chips within 5 minutes. I had a two item combo of chiles rilleno and chicken enchaladas and it was incredible so yummy and my friend had the sizzling fajitas which she would not share, but smelled and looked really yummy. I will definitely be going here again.
