Thanks for the hook-up, Yelp!  This place rocks.  I had three small tacos, chips & salsa, and a drink for under $10.  The carnitas were tender, the carne asada was great, and the pastor was intensely seasoned (the way I like it.)  Second time I got the azteca special taco with nopales, and a pastor burrito.  Again, with chips, guac, and a drink for under $10.  Buying chips for a dollar is a great bargain with that huge salsa bar.  And unlimited fountain drink refills with Coke Zero -- high five!!  The seating area is huge, and clean, and the music is blaring -- which isn't awesome for intimate discussions, but entertaining nonetheless.  The order system is definitely confusing, I never know who to ask for what -- they all talk to you while you're looking at the menu, so you feel like you can order from anybody, but I guess you're supposed to order the items at the station they're assigned?  *Shrug*
