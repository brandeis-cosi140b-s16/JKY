The chips and salsa, margaritas, and every dish I've ordered here has been fantastic.  

I use to travel to Phoenix for work every now and again and would make a point teach trip to visit the Blue Adobe.  Fabulous New Mexican and Tex-Mex, and the service is very friendly.

The occupancy varies.  Some nights, we'd be one of only a few parties, and other nights it would be quite crowded.  I've never had to wait for a table and have never made a reservation.
