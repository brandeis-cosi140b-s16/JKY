Great food- great service! I love and highly recommend their barbacoa- it is sweet and not very spicy. My husband loves their house dressing and always orders an extra. I usually get my orders to go and the cashiers have always been very careful of how they pack up the food for the drive home. The restaurant is always clean, and so are the restrooms.
