I went here with my son a few days ago who will be attending the University of Pittsburgh in the fall.   Wanted Mexican but didn't want the national chain stuff like Chipotle and Qdoba (which are right on Forbes Avenue,  basically Eatery Row).   We took a four block walk from the main drag and saw the neighborhood get a little seedier as we walked.   The outside of Mad Mex looks scantily enticing and the inside of the place just a little but better (I loved the Mexican Day of the Dead artwork, though).   Our waitress was prompt and friendly but never overboard.   My son order a vegetarian dish and I ordered a house special enchilada.   Both were excellent.  My dish had spinach & zucchini,  two things I didn't expect in a chicken enchilada.   But it definitely added to the entree which was perfectly spiced.   The place also has a very good bottle &  draft menu.  Prices were compatible to other Mexican restaurants.   All in all,  a worthwhile trip off the beaten path.   I will definitely.  I will definitely be making g another trip here when I return in August with my son & wife.
