Sombreros is the place to go for authentic, high-quality, and delicious Mexican food. I usually order the street tacos: 4 double-wrapped little tacos topped with whatever you choose. (I highly recommend the pickled onions- they're the purple ones.) The carne asada is to die for, and they do not skimp on the portion sizes, either. From the decor to the many menu options, you will not be disappointed.
