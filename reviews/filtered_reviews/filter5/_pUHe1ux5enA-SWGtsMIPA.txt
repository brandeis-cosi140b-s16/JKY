This may be the best fast-food place in the valley. It's amazing that Chino Bandido has been around for almost 2 decades and it hasn't been franchised across the country. I guess the location has something to do with it... it's out of the way and just perfect to keep it somewhat of a secret.  Somehow their Mexican, Chinese, Caribbean, and other Asian choices all seem to blend together beautifully. Finish it off with a Snickerdoodle and you've had yourself one delicious, albeit not so healthy, meal.
