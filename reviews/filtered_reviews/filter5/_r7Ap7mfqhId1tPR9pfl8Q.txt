I had barbocoa (sp?) enchiladas & my husband had pork carnitas. Both meals were excellent!! The meats were fresh and homemade. The guacamole was excellent, fresh! chips & salsa..amazing. We both had the Ultimate margarita which was fabulous until we found out they were $15 each! All in all....we will definitely go back next time we're in Vegas. Oh...the service? was amazing!!!
