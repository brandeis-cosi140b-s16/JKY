This was pretty darn awesome!!!  I went here with my roomie a couple months ago, and this place rocks!!  I was full from the free chips and salsa before I ate my enchilladas, though...  :P  My roomie ordered the Margarita for two people, and when our server brought it to our table, my eyes were so wide from how large the drink was!!!  We couldn't even drink the whole thing, because my roommate had to drive, and I couldn't drink the whole thing myself!  I think it was only $8.00 for that large Margarita, too, unlike the $12.00 you spend for a tiny drink in Old Town Scottsdale (yes, there is a time for Old Town Scottsdale too, though.  :P).  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean, the staff is friendly, and I left full and happy.  This is definitely a place that you should go and check out!
