The tongue taco was like going on a vision quest. I now know the future and the future is tongue.

if its good enough to make dinners drive-ins and dives its good enough for this lizard.

I've had breakfast after a long swim from odo island. I've had lunch after a splash in Tokyo Bay. and its always been good. like make you forget what you were talking about good.

everyone is like, "they be rude! they be rude!" maybe you be to serious and need to slow da role.

All of these office mommies ( you know that annoying woman you work with) with hurt feelings because the girl at the counter didn't act like she was on a mommy daughter date. Honey, did you come to talk to a nice young lady or to eat the best tongue taco of your life? 

All of these babies complaining about how dirty it is. "oh no, oh no,oh no, I can't eat off the floor." B-A-B-I-E-S! I'll eat you because I know I won't get sick. RAWR!
