The food was excellent. I had the pozole and 2 tacos, and my husband had the green chile and 3 tacos.  I will say again...the food was absolutely excellent. The margaritas were also light and refreshing.  Some of the other reviews here have been poor due to bad service. Our service was actually pretty good, but I can see that the restaurant either seemed to be understaffed or have servers new to the service industry.  Regardless, the food was incredible and our overall experience here was great.
