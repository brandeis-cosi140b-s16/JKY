Ok. I will now sound like everyone else.....fantastic, delicious, must eat here. 
I ordered vegetarian fajitas and my partner ordered tacos. I can easily say these are the best fajitas I have ever ordered. My partner really enjoyed the beans and rice. Salsa was nice and spicy. We ordered Margaritas and though they had a different taste then we were expecting (they had a fizzy twang to them)..they were good. 
We are from out of town, but would DEFINITELY eat here again. 
Price was average.
