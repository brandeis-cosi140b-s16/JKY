The best is back! After the closure of the previous location on Rainbow (a sad day when I drove up to an empty restaurant), management has found the will and the way to reopen in a new location.
While now quite distant from the usual Vegas haunts, it's worth the trek and I hope means more locals will come to appreciate this quality dining option.
This version doesn't seem to have the same seating capacity as the previous two. The decor isn't quite the same, either. But the menu, the food, the flavor and the friendly, helpful service are still top-notch. 
I felt welcome from the moment I stepped in the restaurant. My drink order was taken quickly, my server kept a close eye on things - I never waited or wanted, but he also didn't hover around the table. And my glass was never empty for longer than a minute before being refilled.
The food - just as good as ever! Quality and quantity make for a fine and filling repast. I had the two-item combo, and with the accompanying beans, rice and fideo soup, I came away satisfied and smiling.
I will return to Viva Mercado again and again whenever I'm back in town. It's nice to know you can still find a commitment to good food and fine service from Bobby Mercado.
