Small joint, but GREAT! Service. The waiter was attentive and even cater to our desire for micheladas for our hangover (they ran out of tomato juice, but made a quick trip and got us some). There is plenty of parking. This place is in a "low key" shopping center behind Taco de Mexico. We went to the Premium Outlets and got hungry, couldn't desire what to eat....sea food sounded great! 
Definitely WIll be back on my next trip!
