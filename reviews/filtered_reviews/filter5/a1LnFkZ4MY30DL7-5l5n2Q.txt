WOW. WOW. WOW. I frequent the actual original location in TJ and this place has a bigger menu and OMG it is even better than TJ! Salsa is delicious, juicy limes, quesadillas and mulitas de al pastor is the ONLY way to go. I also tasted the carne asada which was flavorful and juicy, the chorizo was GROSS. I had much better chorizo from the TJ location for sure. $2 for tacos, $4 for mulitas and quesadillas and $10 for carne asada fries that feed an army of 5 or  a few very drunk people. I think that Tacos Mexico down the street will go out of business any day now since this place came into town.
