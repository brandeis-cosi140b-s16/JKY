mmmmmmm yummie

If the weather is nice sit outside. They also share a kitchen w/ the restaurant next store so you can order off 2 different menus in case you don't feel like Mexican.

Table side Guac is my friend :) Their fajitas are huge and very tasty [I uploaded some pix].

Fried fish tacos are off the chain and not in the diet but definitely a cheat food!  

Everyone was very happy with their meals and sitting outside on a nice day can't be beat!!!!
