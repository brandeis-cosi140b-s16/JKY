Third time is a charm!  The first two times we were at Los Dos in ahwatukee, it was aweful!  The third time, was wonderful.  I guess they had to work out all the kinks.  The service was great, the food was excellent and everything was enjoyable.  I will continue to go to this location to support the ahwatukee community.  Good Job Los Dos!  Keep it up!!!!
