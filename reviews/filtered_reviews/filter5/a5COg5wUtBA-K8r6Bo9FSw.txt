Total hole-in-the-wall but absolutely delicious.  We were concerned considering the location in a very run down almost empty strip mall. We found this on a fluke.

Tall caucasion guy (whom I think owns the place) speaks Spanish fluently and is super nice and totally helped us out with deciding what we should eat.  

The Oaxacan hot dog - phenomenal.  

The street tacos were also a delight.  We tried so many things on the menu that night and none of them disappointed.  

Only downside is there is no a/c besides those ones that you stick into a window.  So summer time can get pretty toasty in there.

Cheap eats! A must try!
