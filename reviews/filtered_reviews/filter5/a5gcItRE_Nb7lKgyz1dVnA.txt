Hubs and I have been coming here for 15 years - even when it was formerly named Andale - and have never been disappointed. If you like spicy Mexican food, you must check this place out. Our standard fare that we share is the hatch chili cheese crisp and the rio grande enchiladas with carne adobada. Plenty of heat but very flavorful. Enjoy!
