I had a great meal at Manuel's!  I ordered their three amigos enchiladas.  This was a great way to try three different enchiladas.  My friends and I went their after and event.  We ate, drank and hung out for hours (while drinking).  The staff was very welcoming and friendly!  Would go back here in a heart beat!
