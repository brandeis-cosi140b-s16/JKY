Oh my gosh..  This restaurant is amazing.  Love the patio and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The blue corn tortillas are totally yum.  (Mouthwatering just thinking about it.).  They have great margaritas and menu. 

If you have not been here, go like NOW!!! If you are ever in the Phoenix area, you need to try this place out.

It is a casual place with a higher end price (otherwise if you are on a limited budget, this is a special occasion place).
