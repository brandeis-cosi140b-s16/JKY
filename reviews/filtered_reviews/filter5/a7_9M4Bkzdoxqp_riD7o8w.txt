I've began frequenting this place recently and I'm really glad I was told about it. flavorful food and large portions at a good price! Dining in is definitely the way to go here. Relax to the island music with a Hawaiian scratch made meal and delicious Hawaiian drinks!  I've tried all their items, the bowl in my opinion is the best!
