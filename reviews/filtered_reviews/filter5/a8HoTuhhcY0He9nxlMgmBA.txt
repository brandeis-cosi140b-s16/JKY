As a first timer here, I was pretty excited to hear about this place from my friends talking all about it. Dropped by with a couple friends to eat after having class in the morning. We were greeted and asked if it was our first time here. We then got to try out the different meats as samples! Kalua pig, Pulehu steak, Huli Huli chicken. Kalua pig was the best considering the flavor! I got a bowl as opposed to a burrito so I can get more of everything. Double Meat on Kalua Pig, every topping available. Certain toppings cost extra. 
Drink and tortillas on the side.

Josh and the rest of the crew took care of us! Sample of Coconut Bark to end it off. Too fuego!
