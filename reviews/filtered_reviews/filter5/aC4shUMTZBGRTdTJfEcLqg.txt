The best mexican food ever!

This place is really cheap for the type of food on your plate. There burritos are huge! but my favorite is their chicken enchilada, everything works so perfectly and the sauce is just the finishing touches. The tacos are also something to die for. 

I would really recommend this place to any wanting good mexican food. This place is really legit compared to others around the area. Prob the only mexican food in the area that doesn't make you take a mean sh!t after.
