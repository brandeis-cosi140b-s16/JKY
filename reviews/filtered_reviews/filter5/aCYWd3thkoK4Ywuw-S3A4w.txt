This was my very first time ever coming to Cafe Rio.  We were talking about dinner and she wanted their tortilla soup and I was in the mood  for a burrito.  So, Cafe Rio was the choice.  I have wanted to try this place for sometime.  I know it's a chain, but I've never heard of it until recently.  Anyhow, I park relatively close to Cafe Rio and walk in.  Easy enough to figure out the steps to order your food.  I hop in line and look at the menu that is written on a couple of signs.  As you're waiting you can see the employees making tortillas and other goodies.  I place my order of the Pork Burrito, and it was incredible.  Great portion and kept warm all the way back home.  I also ordered the soup with a side of chips and salsa.  They took care when putting my things in my to go bag.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  I'm sure I'll be back as both the food and the price were great.
