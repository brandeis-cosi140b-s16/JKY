You guys. 
Stop taking this place so seriously. 
They have amazing frozen margaritas. You will get drunk. Fast. 
The food is good, usually. The plates are so hot that it turns the food into molten lava. Be careful. 
The employees are really nice and down to earth. 
There is a nasty duck pond that is really gross but my kid loves looking at the ducks and turtles and other birds. One time my friend said she saw a bobcat in there. Awesome. 
Free chips and salsa. 
A huge place with lots of options for seating. 
They got new wooden chairs that are A MILLION TIMES BETTER than the old metal ones. I really reaalllllllly hope they replace the bar stools next. Those things are the worst!
When it's the height of season, don't even try to get a table. It's so busy. Just sit in the bar. The bartenders will take care of you! 
A wonderful place to go in the summer when you don't have to wait for a table.
