Teepee is my go-to Mexican place in AZ...it's one of those places that makes me wish I still lived in Phoenix even though I hate the heat there!  I love the retro decor, the food is amazing (green enchiladas, all rice, no garnish, and a flour tortilla is the way to go), the drinks are tasty (and cheap, especially to an LA girl), and the staff is friendly.  I would recommend to anyone looking for delish Mexican food in the valley!
