Come here for a drink and a break from the sun... and from high casino prices. This place is a Tequila bar and has a selection of margaritas to choose from. Cassidy was really really nice with a pretty little face. We enjoyed chatting with her about how living in LV was. Looks like this place literally is a little slice of cheesy Tijuana beach bar. The food was Meh... so Cassidy and her smile really won it for us. 

Come here for drinks... not so much for food.
