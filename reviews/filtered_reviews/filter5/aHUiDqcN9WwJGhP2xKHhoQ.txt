I can honestly say I have tried everything on their menu.
I can honestly say that everything on their menu is awesome.
Even the stuff I would no normally order again was pretty good.
You cannot go wrong with the Jade and Jerk chicken.
Love the Snickerdoodles too.

The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is the ordering system...and that is all I am going to say about it...oh and maybe the long lines...because Chino's is so freaking good!
