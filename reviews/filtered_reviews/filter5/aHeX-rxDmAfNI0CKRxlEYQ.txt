The reviewers giving this place 2-3 stars are morons. Why are you complaining about the noise levels WHEN IT SAYS ON THE DOOR THERE IS LIVE MUSIC certain nights?! WTF? As for the rest of the time, they aren't 'blasting club music' all the time at all, they will play a wide variety of music and on soccer/NFL days they will switch to the audio feed so you can enjoy the game. In addition, if you can't figure out how to order, or if you don't know what something is, ASK! The staff is very nice and accommodating, even thought the lines leave a little to be desired, admittedly. Must try the al pastor tacos, don't be afraid to try the cabeza, lengua, or tripas also. Corn on the cob street-style is delicious as well. 
If you're expecting Taco-Bell and are going to order a quesadilla and a chicken taco, save a few bucks and a yelp review complaining about something you don't know and just get your Taco Bell. If you're into trying new things and stepping out of your comfort zone, this is a place for you. 
With seats at the bar almost always available and the managers/owners(?) always around, this is a new favorite place to frequent. Happy Hour is nice, but you don't need to break the bank to eat here even during regular hours. 
Must visit!!!
