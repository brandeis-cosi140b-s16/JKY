Amazing dining experience! The menu was perfect and had a great selection of authentic Mexican food. The staff was attentive and . Sean, one of the managers, stopped by to check on the table and was extremely welcoming. After talking to Sean about the delicious food, their chef Paco came to our table. He was so sweet and definitely a very talented chef. I will definitely be going back!
