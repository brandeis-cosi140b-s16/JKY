Usually I run a mile when faced with inexpensive Mexican food, but the overall rating on Yelp for Phat Phrank's convinced me to give it a try. I'm glad I did.

This is good, honest Mexican fare at a really respectable price. It won't burn a hole in your wallet and it's also not as unpredictable as the stuff served up and places like Roberto's, Don Tortaco, Cafe Rio, and others. Everything has the feel of being freshly prepared rather than slopped together out of vats and it tastes just as good. I really appreciated the texture of the tortillas which were warm and satisfying, dense and chewy enough so they don't split open in your hands, but not gluey and overwhelming, either.

The man himself, Frank, is among the most welcoming proprietors I have encountered anywhere in the Las Vegas valley. He took a genuine interest in me and my wife and remembered my name upon my next visit - admittedly this was the very next day, but that should stand as testimony to the impact of his hospitality and cooking.

This isn't one of those fancy, designer Mexican restaurants, and should not be held up against that sort of establishment - these two sub-categories of Mexican cuisine can barely even be considered the same type of food. For what he is aiming for, Frank scores a bullseye. He deserves his high Yelp rating.
