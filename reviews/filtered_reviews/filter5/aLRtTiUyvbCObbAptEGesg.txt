Just what Red Rock and Summerlin needed!  Awesome food and outstanding cocktails. True Mexican flavors,not tex-mex, is a small plate format. It is refreshing to be able to go out with friends and have a well rounded experience. Instead of ordering a dish and wishing you got something else. Order a bunch and let your taste buds enjoy. The venue is beautiful and festive with a patio to boot. I went at 4:30 and it was packed. Seeing that they opened at 4:00 that is awesome!  Also, they take care of industry people, a nice touch that the strip has tossed to the wayside now that the economy is "healing". Locals I recommend going, you will enjoy.
