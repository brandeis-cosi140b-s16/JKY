I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Everything I have eaten here has been delicious!

It's basically take out only, and cash only, with a small menu and a daily special.  As many have said before, GET THERE EARLY!!   Unless you get there before, or right at 11, you will wait, but it is well worth it!
