Oh good lord.  I just saw on Faceook that they were trying some bulgolgi and spicy pork hot dogs.  Holy moly lamma jamma!  Listen, I didn't ask what came on them.  I just ordered two bulgolgi beef and one spicy pork.  I have a 6 year old.  Kids go apeshit for hot dogs.  Generally, though, he is anti-new flavors.  Kids are morons when it comes to tasting new and strange things.

HE LOVED IT!  SO DID I!  Caps off.

The hot dogs are on large buns and topped with all sorts of deliciousness (pico de gallo, jalapenos, bacon, asian slaw, etc.).  Two dogs is more than enough for one massive man with a lumberjack appetite.  I had two... But I'll hit the gym in a while to work off the deliciousness!
