It's called THE STAND for a reason.  It's a burger stand. So taking that into account, this place is doing that concept right. No frills, clean ("A" rating), and a hip twist with high quality ingredients, sauces, drinks, etc.  Food was very tasty and I will be back again when in the area and want a charbroiled burger/fries!
