I have known Javier, Senior (and Junior) since 1997 and their restaurant in Laguna Beach was always my favorite in the world. I have been to Javier's in Newport and Irvine, CA and now tried Las Vegas! The quality remains superb. The mariscos de camerones are to die for and the Jalape√±o margarita is fantastically unique. I am impressed. It's more expensive in Vegas but that's Vegas!
