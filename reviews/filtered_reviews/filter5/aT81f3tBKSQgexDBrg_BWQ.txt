What can I say that has not already been stated?  This place serves up some of the freshest Mexican food in Las Vegas.  When I say fresh, I mean crisp lettuce, firm avacodo's, ripe tomatoes, perfectly cooked meats...and the list goes on.

The portions out of this joint are the things that make Weight Watchers cringe.  For what you pay, you get an ass-load of food.  One Carne Asada Taco is about a pound of beef, before all the other items.

I don't eat here often, but when I do I am usually very hungry and I got a real craving for some authentic, fresh Mexican food.  on Apetit!
