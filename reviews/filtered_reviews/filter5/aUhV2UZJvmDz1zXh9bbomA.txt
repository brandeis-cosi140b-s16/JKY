Best burritos in town- IMHO.  I like the tofu burrito, but everything I've had there is good.  Very friendly staff, they are happy to have business and the service was great every time I've been.  Huge portions, and the homemade salsa bar is a must try.  The guallilo and tomatillo salsas are my favorites.  I still eat Chipotle and Qdoba but this is high in my rotation.  Stop by once to try it, and you'll come back again- excellent!!
