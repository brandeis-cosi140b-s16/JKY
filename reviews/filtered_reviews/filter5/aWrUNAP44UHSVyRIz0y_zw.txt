I have had thousands and thousands of tacos in Las Vegas. . . the carne asada taco here is hands down the best I've had in the Las Vegas valley and surrounding areas! The steak was seasoned and grilled to perfection. I found myself talking about them the next day and every time I think of Container Park.  I also LOVE the "Mexican Corn". The corn was HUGE and served with cream, cheese, lime and chili. I've only had corn like this served out of a shopping cart on the streets of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. I remember hoping the corn guy would come around so I could have some. This was ten times better than the shopping cart corn (and that was pretty good too). In fact people walking by kept asking where I got the corn.  My boyfriend had the lengua torta and loved it. He gets lengua all of the time for tacos and said this was really good.
