Phat Burrito makes an impressive burrito...I'll be honest...I've been over 5 times and I always get mine with chicken, black beans, rice, cheese, spinach and fresh jalepeno...kind of lame but I like what I like.  I recommend dining outside if weather is permitting.  Inside is cool too...a little funky and cramped but all together good.  I'm a big fan of their "serve yourself with a laddle" salsa bar too.  Best consumed after a night on the town.
