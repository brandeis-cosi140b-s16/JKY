This place is amazing!  Went there last night with three of my girlfriends.  The Pozole is incredible.  You must order this!  It's robust flavors will make your taste buds dance with glee!  Their tacos may be small, but they have BIG flavor.  If you order tacos as your main course, be sure to add a collection of sides.  I suggest the white and black bean puree, the chipotle honey creamy grits and the street corn.  For desert, you absolutely need to order the pumpkin bread pudding.  Don't leave without ordering the pumpkin bread pudding.  I mean it!  Call ahead for a reservation because this place gets busy and you may not get a table otherwise.  Love The Mission!
