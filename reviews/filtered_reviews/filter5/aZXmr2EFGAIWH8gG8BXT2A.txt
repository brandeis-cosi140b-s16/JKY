El Palacio is by far our favorite local spot. My wife and I, along with friends, dine at least once per week. The food is what you would expect from any good Mexican restaurant, but there are a few standouts. The service is one. Very friendly, fast service, despite the usual large crowd. The second is the chips and salsa. Chips are obviously homemade, served fresh and warm- not chips from a bag like you see in many restaurants. The salsa is home made as well, and REALLY good compared to the tomato sauce  from a can you also get at other restaurants. The tacos are also really good. They load the tacos with your choice of meat- this isn't one of those skimp on the meat and load up on lettuce tacos. We have never been disappointed here and wouldn't eat Mexican food anywhere else in Gilbert.
