A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  I can't say enough good things about this place!  I first discovered this lil gem barhopping with a friend of mine and was completely in awe of the whole ambiance of the place.  The entrance is a narrow stone stairway that leads down to a small bar area with a couple of booths and seats in front of a fireplace.  Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!  The prime ribs were huge!  We had a great time.  It's a quiet lil hole in the wall bar/restaurant.  Great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night!  I can't wait to go again!
