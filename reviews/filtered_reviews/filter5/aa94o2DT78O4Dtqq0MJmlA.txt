I was craving some grilled fish tacos and decided to try this place because of their Groupon deal. So glad I did! Even without the deal, their prices are very fair and they give generous portions and don't stinge on the napkins at all for takeout orders.

But of course, the most important thing is the food is absolutely delicious! Super fresh veggies with the most flavorful grilled fish. Don't know what they use to marinate with or how they do it but I would love to learn!

Awesomely satisfying cheat meal that is still pretty healthy. Cheating clean never tasted so good!! Needless to say, I will be back!
