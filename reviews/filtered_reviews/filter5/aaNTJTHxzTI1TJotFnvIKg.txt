Amazing atmosphere, food and drink. Rokerij is one of those special places in Phoenix to bring friends and family to impress. 

Escorted thru the kitchen and then down the stairs (by my very excited host) I wasn't sure what to expect. Greeted by warm candlelight I was surprised. Even though it was incredibly late on a Tuesday the bar was full. A server enthusiastically reassured us the kitchen was open, and that yes, we'd be able to order oysters to our hearts content.

And boy did we. Regular raw oysters. Meatball oysters. More regular oysters. And then we had, quite possibly, the best sliders in the world. Three prime rib sliders served with creamy horse radish sauce and au jus. You haven't lived until these have crossed your lips.

The service is incredible here. Sitting at the bar is wonderful. Sitting in a booth would offer privacy. The fireplace is perfect when Phoenix has a touch of chill in the air. This is a stunning place to come for a date.
