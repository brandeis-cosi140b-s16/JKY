Love! Love! Love this place! Where else can you get $4 margaritas and $3 beers EVERYDAY before 6pm? The fajitas are amazing, but we always ask for them a bit more caramelized, cooked just a tad longer, as the sauce gets very rich this way. Best Chimichanga in all of Phoenix and their spicy salsa is seriously the bomb. I go here every time I'm in Phoenix. We don't have Mexican like this in San Francisco. So very good!
