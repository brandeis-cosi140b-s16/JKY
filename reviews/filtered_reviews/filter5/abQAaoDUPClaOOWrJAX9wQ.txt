First time eating here. Won't be the last.
Came in with my lady. Ordered carne asada fries, adobada burrito, barbacoa tacos and cheesecake chimis.

Asada fries were good, nothing that sets it apart from other asada fries.

Adobada burrito was the best pork I've had at a Mexican restaurant within this price range.

Barbacoa tacos were exceptional, well flavored and fresh veggies.

Cheesecake chimis were the bomb. Ate mine in 2 bites.

This is one of the best Mexican restaurants at its price range. I will be coming here again for sure.

Owner is super nice too.
