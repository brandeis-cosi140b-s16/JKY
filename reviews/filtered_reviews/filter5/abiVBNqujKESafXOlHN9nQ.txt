A few girlfriends and I received a $3 house margarita coupon from a person handing them out on the strip.  I was a little apprehensive to go, but we opted to check it out anyway.  What did we have to lose... $3?  

There was a cool "take out" window facing the street, and that was where we grabbed our margarita.  The drink was very smooth and worth more than the $3 we paid!  

We also grabbed a table for a late lunch, and the place had a fun atmosphere, even at 3pm.  I can only imagine how packed it must get during the lunch and dinner hours.   The staff were very nice, the place was clean, and we were well taken care of with drink refills, extra napkin requests, etc.

I ordered the steak tacos, and even though they appeared to be street style, they were packed with steak & cheese!  I don't know if it was the margarita, my grumbling stomach, or the tacos themselves, but they were some of the tacos I have ever had, and I highly recommend them!!!

My two friends shared a plate of nachos, and it was loaded with every appropriate topping imaginable.  I sampled a few of them and WOW!  The chips were light and crispy, and the toppings did not make them all mushy.  There was so much on that plate that my friends finished about half of it.  The price of food was moderate, but you definitely get your money's worth!!!
