This place is amazing! The service was impeccable! Our waitress knew the menu and offered suggestions- she was right on! I enjoyed the grilled hearts of romaine salad with chicken and it was literally the best salad I have ever had! The ambiance was beautiful, but it felt a little awkward drinking margaritas in a church. The decor is very simple, yet elegant. We had the HH margaritas and REALLY enjoyed them. I'll return in my next visit to the area.
