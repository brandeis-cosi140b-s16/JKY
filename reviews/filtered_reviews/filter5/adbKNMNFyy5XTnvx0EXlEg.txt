With 126 other reviews, there's not much to add. I did want to mention that in addition to great food, the staff is like a well-oiled machine. 

Arriving just before shift change on a Saturday meant that there were literally a dozen girls on the floor. Servers, bussers, and hostesses. None, not one, of them stood around idle or glanced at a cell phone/PDA. They were a whirlwind of efficiency. Wiping tables, one would move a table - another would sweep under it, while yet another would "turn it" with new condiments/napkins/hot suaces, et al. 

Same goes for the guys behind the line. A flurry of activity to crank out dish after dish. Awesome job! Awesome.

I did ask for a takeout menu, but they don't have any - which is why none exist on the web, I guess. And, I did not snap a photo of the 4-pager myself. Sorry. We did grab a couple of food shots though - check those out.
