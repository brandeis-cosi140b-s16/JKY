Can you say PORK ADOBADA?!! Baboy introduced me to this place. Hands down THE BEST tacos I have EVER had!! They have the right amount of spice, they have slab on a rotating THINGY and the freshly slice the meat off into your perfectly sized taco! Get the pineapple added on there... a side of their HOT PEPPERS --They will leave your mouth on FIYAAAAAAAH and I LOVE me some HEAT in my food! Those peppers kick my ass and I LOOOOVE it! Also, the Adobada Fries!! Get a half order and it's still HUGE! The dollop of fresh guacamole makes it MMMMM FREAKIN GOOD!!
