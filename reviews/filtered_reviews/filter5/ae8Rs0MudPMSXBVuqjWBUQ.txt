I am a super busy person, so it's been difficult for me to find an opportunity to go to this place. I was curious ever since I heard that they specialize in really spicy food.

Los Dos Molinos did't fail to please. The outside looks a little generic, so when I walked in I was almost surprised to see such a beautiful and hip, yet traditional cantina style atmosphere with modern (electronica) music playing. The staff was friendly and down to earth. 

The complimentary chips and salsas (one red, one green tomatillo) were very tasty. The green salsa was pretty serious...definitely hotter than the hottest salsa you get at the Taco Guild, but still flavorful and enjoyable. I am very happy that I finally found a place where I do not have to beg to get something that I consider spicy-hot.

I ordered a house margarita, blue corn tamale, and a side of rice and beans. I was amazed by the unique, smoky flavor of the tamale. The rice (yellow) and beans were very saucy, topped with a touch of melted shredded cheese, and delicious. I like that Los Dos is hip, but not above serving rice and beans. Best of all, the tamale had a spicy kick on its own. 

Everything was delicious and what i considered to be spicy done right. People looking to have tears stream out of their eyes might be disappointed...but people who sneeze after just looking at a bottle of Frank's Red Hot would't be able to handle most of the dishes there (there is a little pepper icon next to the spicy stuff to help those with tender tongues find something palatable). I'll be going back soon.
