The only reason I shy away is because I can never finish a meal there!  I love this hidden gem of a place.  Torta's are ginormous and delish.  I did not find the place dirty, one of the first things I judge a place by.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  They cook their food to order so it is definitely not Chipotle fast, thats what makes it so good!  Not your average run of the mill Mexican food place so don't expect the usual boring fare, expect A LOT of awesome tasting food at great prices, and they have kid friendly choices to boot!
