My girlfriend and I spent a whole month in the States exploring some of the best BBQ joints that there was to offer along with lots of burgers and any roller coasters we found on our way too. Predominantly our trip was based on a BBQ pilgrimage to the holy lands of BBQ but we had our fair share of Mexican along the way.

Tacos el Gordo came recommended from a friend who said that it was hard to get Mexican food like this outside of Mexico and we weren't let down.

Everything was awesome and it was a cheap feed and we'd recommend it as something different to the run of the mill Tex Mex fare that is more often passed off as Mexican.
