Kick ass tacos, open late into the night, and cheap.  This place is doing it right!

We walked our way over here on our first night in Vegas, around 2 AM.  They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.

The Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order 

My next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.

You have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!
