Terrific Margaritas and you have to ask for Antonio! Best Server! He knows the menu, checks I with you regularly and can change up any menu item to be exactly what you want. Vinnie is a great Bartender and pours up some spectacular concoctions from the drink menu. We'll definitely be  back. Great food and great evening!
