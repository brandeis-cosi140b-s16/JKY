The food is exceptional, especially the pork green chile stew and anything with pork adovada.  The flavors are rich and complex, and you'll never leave feeling like you could easily recreate it at home (I know, I've tried)!  The owners are active and involved with the staff, and it really shows.

P.S....we wish there were a few more options on the appetizer menu that could make a small meal.  The entrees are really huge, so some "small plate" options would be nice.
