I was fortunate enough to have a birthday celebration at the Spotted Donkey Cantina.  What a great place to get together with friends.  The atmosphere was a delight, the service was spectacular and the food was out of this world delicious.  

A delicious Blood Orange Margarita to start, followed by a huge helping of Guacamole.  I'm a bit of a guacamole junkie, and they have a guacamole that is superb.  The fried banana dessert thingy... yes please!

I do recommend it... it's a drive from phoenix, but if you're content with a great view along the way (we saw a deer), then you'll be just fine.  Have fun!
