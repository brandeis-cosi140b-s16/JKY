WOW, my meal was fantastic, atmosphere was great, kinda small, relaxed, their food was stellar!!!! I am SUPER picky when it comes to food, absolutely loved my chicken burrito, I literally gobbled it. They should however have warning labels on their Margaritas....I had the Mango Margarita and about midway through my meal realized that goblet got me trashed. By then I had already ordered a Prickley Pear Margarita...ooops...def really good drinks, but they sneak up on you. Great place tho and kid friendly!
