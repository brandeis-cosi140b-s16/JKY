This remains one of our favorite restaurants. We try and go late-night on Fridays and head to the basement so we can see our favorite bartender Steve.  The food is even better now that we can get the Richardsons menu!  I can't wait until the Richardsons restaurant opens up next door...and I hope there is a patio in our future.
