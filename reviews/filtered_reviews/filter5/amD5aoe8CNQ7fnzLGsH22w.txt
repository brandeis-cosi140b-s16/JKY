My friend wanted Margaritas & Nachos. This place is just what we were looking for. It was busy when we went which we thought was a good sign.
Service was excellent. Fast & Courteous. As soon as we sat, the chips, salsa & beans where on the table. Next came water.  Then the  waiter came and was very helpful when we were deciding what to order.  I was craving fruity, so I order the large Mango Margarita & my friend ordered a large Strawberry. I like the fact that they use real fruit in there margaritas. They where large and not weak, perfect! We ordered the nachos. They where served on a very large platter drowned in real cheese w/ beans and shredded chicken. YUM!!!! There was live music & the atmosphere in the place was festive like a real mexican restaurant should be!!!! Will definitely be back to try more food & of course drink more margaritas.
