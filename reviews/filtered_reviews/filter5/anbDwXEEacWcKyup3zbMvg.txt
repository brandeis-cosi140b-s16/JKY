Best Mexican food in Pittsburgh. That I've found anyways. Coming from Los Angeles, from time to time, I get a major craving for a good taco. 

Las Palmas has everything from chicken to beef to barbacoa and I'm probably missing some options. It's $2.50 for a taco. $2.50?!?!?! Do you realize how ridiculous that is??? You walk up to the grill on the sidewalk and tell them what kind of meat you want. They then take raw meat, slap it on the grill, cook it in front of you, and then hand it to you in a corn tortilla. You then have the option of slathering as many different toppings on the tacos as you please. 

I would say a meal is 2 tacos and they have really cool drinks inside to choose from. From coconut juice to various kinds of Mexican sodas.  

As a student, I walked. And I can see it being a bit hard to find parking around there. 

Las Palmas is my little piece of Los Angeles. 

(Plus there's a great Mexican grocery store that has tons of stuff. I like to indulge in the sugar coated mangoes and papayas...)
