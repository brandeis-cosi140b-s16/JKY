Came here on Cinco De Mayo around 4:30 and service started out really slow because there was only one server on. We ordered some margaritas and appetizers and we were starting to doubt why this place had such good ratings. Once the bartender showed up around 4:50 service picked up and the food started coming out and we fully understood! Food was amazing! Got the queso fundido, chile relleno, and street taco with lamb barbacoa. All of it was amazing! We will definitely be back!
