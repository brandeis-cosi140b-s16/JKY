Orale!!! I went from Las Vegas to TJ real quick!  This is a definite must when in Vegas. 

We are huge taco foodies and are always looking for the next taco place to keep visiting and this has made the list. Authentic Tijuana-taste in the carne Asada tacos as well as the adobada. 

If you close your eyes and taste that smoky carne asada... You will be transcended to blvd. la revolucion. 

When ordering: 
-find a tray or you'll end up carrying your food 
-stand in the correct line (separated by meat type)
-be patient as the tortillas are being made in front of you and the lines can be lengthy after hours 
-though not mentioned flour tortillas are an option and I strongly suggest you try them!
-do tip the taqueros if possible, as they are quick and efficient and can digest multiple orders as given; we had an order of 20 tacos all prepared differently and they completed them with effectiveness and a smile!
