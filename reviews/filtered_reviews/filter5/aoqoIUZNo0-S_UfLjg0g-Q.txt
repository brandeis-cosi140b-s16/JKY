This place is just as great as Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burgers!!!  I got the Loaded Chicken Quesidilla.  It was fresh, taste great, and was very filling.  The atmosphere was also pretty cool.  Lets just say it was such a fun inviting place, I weathered the 50 degree temps to sit on the back patio!!!
