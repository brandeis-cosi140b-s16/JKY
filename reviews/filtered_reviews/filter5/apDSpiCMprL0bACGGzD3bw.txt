nice, peaceful atmosphere . We came here for a early dinner around 6ish and it was the best. I got the chicken bowl & let me tell you, it was so amazing compared to ANY other chicken bowls I've ever had....the chicken is so tender and you can tell that they prepare the food to serve quality and quantity . The price is totally worth what you get.  Paco, the Chef, was so friendly and visited every table to make sure that people were satisfied with the food..what chef does that! He actually cares. the waitresses are also very friendly !  thank you Rosemarie for being a awesome waiter! I do suggest you TRY this restaurant ... you won't regret it!!
