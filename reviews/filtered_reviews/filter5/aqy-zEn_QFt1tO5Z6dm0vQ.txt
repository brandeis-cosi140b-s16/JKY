The Mission is one of my favorite restaurants!  I LOVE the food!!!!

I have been here several times and have never had a bad experience. I have had almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed.  How does one go wrong with the atmosphere/decor, friendly staff and last but not least the best food. 

Must haves: Prima rita, table side guacamole, steak tacos (my fav!!!), bread pudding:) 

If you are looking for a great atmosphere, fun night, date night , or just a place with flavor...look no further!! I recommend this place!!! If only there were more places like this....

Love for the mission!!!
