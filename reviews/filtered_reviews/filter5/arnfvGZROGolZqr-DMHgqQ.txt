Ok, had a groupon so I decided to take my best friend tonite and all I can say is YUM! We both got carne asada burritos and chips and salsa...then the sweet/beautiful owner brought us a side if beans for our chips...complimentary! We both absolutely loved all of it and then I also bought us churos... Scalding hot but couldn't stop eating lol.. Love fresh hot yummy food and dessert! And everything was super clean especially the bathroom! Sooo going back soon to try the shrimp tacos...oh and they are very reasonable priced!
