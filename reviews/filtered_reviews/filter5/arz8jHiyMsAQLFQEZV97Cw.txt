We absolutely LOVED Carlsbad Tavern! We weren't sure what to expect by the name, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was late in the evening and we sat on the patio, which has a really cool ambience with the fireplace, palm trees and water features. We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching! (Lol) The only downfall is that we found this place on the LAST night of our vacation, otherwise we would've been back at least one more time. The atmosphere, service and food here is simply outstanding. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!
