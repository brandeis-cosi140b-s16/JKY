One of my favorite vegas places. Giant margaritas, crazy clown decorations, live music, wacky servers. If you are looking for fancy Mexican food this is not the place for you. I always bring out of town guests here for food and fun. Once the server got up on the booth behind us and danced as he made guacamole ha! The food is good and the menu has lots of choices so you are sure to find something you like. Even though its casual the service is always great. Refill waters BOOM, refill chips BOOM. Birthdays are hilarious, they come out and sing to you and put a sombrero on you haha. It's fun and funky familiar Mexican fair.
