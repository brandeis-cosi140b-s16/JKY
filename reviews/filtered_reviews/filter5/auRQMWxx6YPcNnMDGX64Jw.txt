What can you say about this place!! It is fantastic, delish, cheap, clean....all of the above!
 I have been coming here for about 35 years now. I keep coming back and look forward to every visit. We came here today for a late lunch, early dinner.
We were greeted by a really happy crew, (so nice).They made us new fresh coffee and i great Ice Tea, with big fresh lemons.
The Beef and the Chicken were great as well as the Pork. The Tacos are probaly the best i have ever had. We were happy we ate early because, you are full for the rest of the night. Free refills on the Coffee and the Ice Tea.
Location is an old house on 7th Ave, which is a really great idea, with lots of parking in the lot. If you have never tried it, you really should. You would not be sorry, plus it is a great price, you have nothing to loose.
