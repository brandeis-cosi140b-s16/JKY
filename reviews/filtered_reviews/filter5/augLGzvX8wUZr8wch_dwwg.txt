I can honestly say this is hands down the best chicken taco I have had outside of Mexico. The set up when you walk into this place is a little confusing but holy shit is it worth it!!!! For 2$ and some change you get the most packed with meat taco on a fresh made corn tortilla. The lady was literally pressing out and cooking fresh off the grill tortillas for all the people in line. Makes a huge difference in the taste compared to pre made shitty corn tortillas. I got the regular taco which is just your choice of meat, salsa, onions, and cilantro. Simple yet delicious!! Personally I like them more simple (street taco style) If you want the beans and guac and sour cream and all the other shit ,you should probably just get a burrito. If you are one to like a little more flavor they also offer a salsa bar with a large variety of salsas to add. Another perk of this place is the street corn or elotes. Not a lot of taco spots in town offer it. It's not the best I've had here but it's pretty good. The best I've had was out of the back of a van in a parking Lott. Sketchy and delicious. So in conclusion If you are in the mood for some tacos that taste like they came out of a taco shack in Mexico this is your place. If your looking for some fancy Tex mex or Americanized taco fusion or whatever else is out there you probably won't be happy with the simple deliciousness of this place. Either way try it. You probably won't be disappointed.
