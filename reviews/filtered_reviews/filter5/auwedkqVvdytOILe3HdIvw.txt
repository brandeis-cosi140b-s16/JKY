If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  

Another great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior.
