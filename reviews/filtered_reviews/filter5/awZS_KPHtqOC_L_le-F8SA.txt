This place is amazing and right next to my apartment. The gentleman who helped me was extremely friendly and helpful. He let me try the different meats and made suggestions of what condiments to pair with my tacos. The horchata is fresh made by the matriarch of the family, and it is amazing. So many meat choices and the ingredients are so fresh. I will for sure be back again and again, and I have been telling everyone who wants exceptional, authentic Mexican food to go here.
