A Las Vegas staple, this is definitely the go to place when you want some good Mexican cooking. It goes way beyond the taco, burrito, enchilada fare and has a menu full of of excellent dishes made with steak, chicken, shrimp or fish. So many to choose from you won't even get through the full menu on your first visit. 

One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Homemade tortillas, chips and hot sauce, great atmosphere, great service, there is nothing about Lindo that disappoints. Highly recommended!
