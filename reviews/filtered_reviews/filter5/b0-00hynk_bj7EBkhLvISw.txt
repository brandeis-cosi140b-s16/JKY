This place is amazing! It has become a haunt of mine and my boyfriends. They have great drinks, great happy hour, great tacos, and quesadillas that I'm pretty sure are made with voodoo magic because they're AMAZING. Beyond that, the service is always excellent and the staff is so welcoming. 

We come specifically for Jeremy who mixes amazing drinks and provides the best experience every time. If he's not around Karn always takes such great care of us!

Overall, great crew and always a fun, laid back time. A must check out!
