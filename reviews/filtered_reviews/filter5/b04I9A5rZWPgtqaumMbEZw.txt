Love, love it. We have been back so many times. My husband loves this place and even dreams about it. Carne asada tacos are so good. I love the cucumbers and the guacamole. Have not tried the burritos yet. You know the food is awesome if you see a diversity of people there. There can be a bit of wait but it's worth it.
