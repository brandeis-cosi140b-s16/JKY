At first appearance the place looks awesome.
Quick and prompt service.  Our salsa bowls were constantly refilled by the server assistants.
Then came the food....We were thereforSunday lunch and ordered off the lunch menu.  I ordered the enchilada and tostada which was quite the deal.  My wife ordered the lunch fajitas.  The flavor was good and enjoyable.   We will be back for happy hour!
