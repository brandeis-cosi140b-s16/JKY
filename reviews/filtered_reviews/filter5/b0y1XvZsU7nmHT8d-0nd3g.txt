Quite simply, the best authentic tacos in Vegas. Be sure to try them "with everything" - house made guac, cilantro, and grilled veggies. The flan they sell by the register isn't bad, either! This place is ideal for grab 'n' go; I'm a fan of ordering a dozen tacos and bringing them home to share with my roommates.
