I have been looking for my go to place in Phoenix for a while...you know those days when you want something good to eat, but nothing sounds good? I am happy to say that I have now I have found my go to place...when the question comes up of where I want to eat...they don't even have to ask! Gallo Blanco here I come! 
To start, the appetizers are amazing, the chicharron de queso....i mean if you love cheese, hello! and the amazing Aiolo, my only complaint...there isn't enough aioli! And the guac...who would have thought that fruit in my guac would be good, but it was amazing also! 
The Naco Torta....is honestly one of the most flavorful and orgasmic experiences i have ever had....just get it once and you will be hooked. Quite frankly I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't eat beef, because you are seriously missing out!! 
They have amazing tacos, and their burger rocks too....but until i am totally sick of the torta...i will not be going back.....
If you are a yelper... trust me!?!?!? You must eat here!!!!!!!!
