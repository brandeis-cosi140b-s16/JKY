My mom and dad were visiting me in Vegas and saw this place on the Travel Channel. We came in around 6pm on a Thursday- not too busy. Staff was SUPER friendly and funny. He helped us with the order to give us a great variety. Even explained the history of the joint to us. 

The food was complex. Eating a burrito or taco and tasting the tang & spice of Asian cuisine was intense . Easily could eat this every day. The komex salsa has a nice hot spice to it but can be easily added to top every dish. 

Highly recommend .
