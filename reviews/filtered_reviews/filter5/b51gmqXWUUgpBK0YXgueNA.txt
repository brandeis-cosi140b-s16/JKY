This place is awesome! It was my first time here, me and my friend decided to try it out besides all the restaurants on Maryland parkway. Costumer service was great, they gave us sample of their meats, so yummy with so much flavor you can just taste Hawaii & I never even been there. I got the bowl with chips & guacamole. So yummy!!! The atmosphere was perfect, clean with Hawaiian music. We also met the owner he was rad & made sure to thank us twice for coming in. Definitely a must try!! I will surly be back for some more deliciousness.
