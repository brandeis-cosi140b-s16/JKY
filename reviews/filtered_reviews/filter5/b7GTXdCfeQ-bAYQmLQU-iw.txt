Same great food as their original location, but a much more convenient location. The place is bigger and they now have their liquor license. 

Anything from the fusion side of the menu is great. I have yet to try anything on the Mexican side. The beef fusion tacos are my fav. If you're going to dine in try any of the deep fried options like the chimichanga or flautas. 

Prices are still reasonable. You can feed a family of three for less than twenty bucks. It may not be as cheap as their original spot when they became popular a few years ago, but at least I don't feel guilty about paying the minuscule prices anymore. Some of the best cheap eats in town.

Don't forget to download the Epoxy app for their frequent diner card. It'll save you a few dollars down the road.
