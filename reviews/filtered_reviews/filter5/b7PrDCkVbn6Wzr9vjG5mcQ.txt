Great place to get some great quality mexican food in vegas. This restaurant is located inside the Aria hptel.and casino right I'm the middle of the casino. I ordered the tablita for 2 people, it was more than enough food for both of us. The jalape√±o Margarita was nice and spicy, you have to try it. Luis, our waiter was very attentive and on top of everything. Will definitely be coming back next time we're in Vegas!
