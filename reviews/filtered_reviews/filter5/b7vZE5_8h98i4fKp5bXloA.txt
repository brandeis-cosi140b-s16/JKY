Delightful. Very interesting large & diverse menu that pleased my whole family, from the finicky 7 year old (he gives KoMex "10 stars! "), to the grumpy teenager ("ugh") to the very selective wifey, who liked how clean it is despite being not new, she liked that the entire menu could be made vegetarian (tofu or veggies), she liked the hustle & competence of our waiter/host, and she liked how everybody really liked their food.

I loved all of the above, plus that I could feed my whole family of six for about $40, or about $6.50 each.

They also had half orders of everything, perfect for my 7 & 10 year old.

Without asking our host noticed that we'd not finished our plates and he brought over takeout clamshells & bags. On the ball! 

Bonus Trivia: their "tap water" is in fact bottled water. The "tap water" they serve at your table in a large clear carafe is bottled. The water they use to rinse & cook the rice is bottled. The water they use to cook everything is bottled, at the insistence of the owner. My wife noticed that this made everything taste "fresh".

I liked that everything we ordered was more Mex, with a hint of Korean, yet I'm sure if you wanted a spicier Korean fare they would oblige, in fact Kimchee is on the menu. For example, my son's fusion nachos looked like awesome macho nachos, but the meat was marinated in Korean spices.

We will be back!
