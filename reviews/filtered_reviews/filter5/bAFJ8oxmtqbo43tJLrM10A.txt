The best spot in town!!!
I am spending here a lot of hours a day. 
You guys must try the pojarsky cutlets. 
I love this dish!!
The hookah in this place is amazing. 
The atmosphere is amazing. The crowd in here is awesome. 
Karaoke nights are the best. I think this is the only place with Russian karaoke. 

Everybody must try this place at lease once!!!

Thank you green dacha !!!!
