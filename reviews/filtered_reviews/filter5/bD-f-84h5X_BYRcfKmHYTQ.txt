LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I come here often, but I forget to check in! 
All I can think about is eating the food and drinking the Mojitos! The margaritas are good too, but I am the Mojito Momma!
Easy in and out downtown location! Great for lunch or dinner! Meet friends, have a couple of drinks! CHips and salsa are fantastic, but ne sure to try the cheese dip! THAT IS THE BEST!

Everything there is amazing and I am TICKLED that a new location is opening out Northwest closer to me! 

The most amazing thing I have noticed at Casa is that no matter what you order or when, they bring fresh, HOT food to the table QUICKLY! Must be some magic going on back in that kitchen!
