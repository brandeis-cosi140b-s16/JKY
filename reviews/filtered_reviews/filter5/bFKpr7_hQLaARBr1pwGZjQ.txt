GREAT FOOD!


Don Poncho  is a great restaurant with very little pretense, stellar food and excellent service.  So if you are looking for really good Mexican cuisine look no more. Don Poncho  is one of  the best Mexican food places in the valley. 

There are plenty of choices for appetizers, entrees and desserts. 
Every dish is visually enticing. The pastor sopes are wonderful some of  the best I've ever tasted and the Chile Rellenos are off the charts delicious! 

Highly recommended to all looking for authentic Mexican food in a town consumed with chain "Mexican Restaurants".
