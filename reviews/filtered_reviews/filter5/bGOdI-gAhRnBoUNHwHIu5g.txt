I went with my husband to a work event here and you can tell if a place has it together if the staff can accommodate people. The hostess told us a couple of guys from the party arrived and directed us to the bar. Then we had some appetizers and drinks while we waited for the rest. My don Pablo Malbec was delicious. Bold and complex. 

The group consisted of about twenty people and they seated us under the ancient-looking Mexican carving along the side. Those interesting sculptures along with the beautiful cave like adobe walls and wooden beams made a very intimate setting within the bustling world of the Aria casino.

To start we had chips, salsa and tres ceviche. The seafood was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of citrus. Loved the octopus. It's easy to become rubbery but ours was very tender-as were my scallops! Impeccably cooked and seasoned, they were a wonderful blend of flavors. 

Looking forward to my next visit here!
