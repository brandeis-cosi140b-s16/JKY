Super deluxe, delicious taco centric fare with a modern healthy take and margaritas.  Waited outside for about thirty minutes on a busty Saturday night.  No problem, because the Host takes drink orders and there's ample seating to wait.  Busy night overall and a definite hot spot.  Service was great carried by a hosting staff that supports the floor with deliveries, drinks and table turns.  Awesome food. Tacos excellent. Cucumber Serrano Margarita, the bomb.  Can't believe our three year old slept through it all. Note: noise level due to busy dining room and bar.
