This place is the bomb! I mean everything in the menu is very tasty. The way they cook the carne asada you can really taste the charcoal!! It's authentic mexican food. I can't say enough about this place. Kudos to the ladies in the kitchen who make it happen every day. Sometimes they don't get the recognition they deserve so I want to thank them for their excelent service! The salsa verde is perfect. I mean nothing negative about this place.
