What more can be said about Las Palmas that isn't already listed here? Not much. Everyone is on point with their reviews of Las Palmas as offering cheap (2.50), authentic, Mexican tacos (gringo-style lovers beware). Three of these bad boys makes for a large meal for one person. 

Pay inside the store and they will give you a receipt to hand to the people operating the taco stand outside. Pick your meat, which will then be placed on an incredibly fresh corn tortilla, load up your tacos with some condiments and salsa, and enjoy.

When you finish stuffing that last meat filled corn tortilla into your face, you'll realize that you will be back again and again to repeat your newfound feeding ritual.

Grab a Mexican soda from the fridge inside to wash down the meaty goodness.
