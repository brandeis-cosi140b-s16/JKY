My wife and I have been coming to JJ's since about 3 months after it opened, a little more than 3 years ago and we love it here.   They have great happy hour prices (no watered down margaritas for only $3) and they have the best salsa in town.  With two small children (3 and 1 1/2), this is a great place that we can come and experience a happy hour environment (responsibly, of course) with the children.  We always have great service and that make Juan Jaime's our favorite Friday night hang out.
