Stopped by for lunch today, I was immediately greeted by bartender Mike Babin who recommended I try their "SuperMacho Bowl". It was a great choice, very healthy and tasted great! I also then tried the House Margarita which went very well with the meal he recommended I try. Overall I would definitely come back again to this place! Thanks for the great service Mike!
