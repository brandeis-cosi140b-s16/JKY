Checked this place out after seeing all the positive reviews and I'm glad I did. Super fresh shrimp and fish tacos made to order, an amazing assortment of daily-made sauces and salsas, incredibly engaging owners and employees, and a nice clean dining experience. Seemed odd to me that they'd offer French fries instead of tortilla chips but I certainly can't complain-- the fries were outstanding, gold and crispy on the outside and downy soft on the inside. Try them with the house made ranch dressing! My husband is a salsa hound so he fell in love with the extensive salsa bar. He eats habanero peppers raw, too, so when he told me that the extra hot salsa was HOT, I believed him.

Thanks, Yelp, for letting me know about this place. I love supporting local restaurants that are trying hard and doing a great job. I'll definitely be back.
