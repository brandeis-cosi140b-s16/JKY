I could easily eat 50 of these fish tacos... they're that good, and that affordable.

My wife and I both agreed that these fish tacos were as good as anything we've had in Baja California.

We ordered two fish tacos, one shrimp taco, a carne asada taco, a bean and cheese burrito, and also had a Diet Coke. The grand total for all of this deliciousness? $12. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

Service was quick, the gentleman at the counter was unbelievably friendly and you can't beat the food.

Easy five stars for Tacos Atoyac. We've kept this restaurant on our list of places to try for the last two years. We finally went this past weekend and, without a doubt, we'll be back next weekend. As close to perfect a dining experience you will ever find!
