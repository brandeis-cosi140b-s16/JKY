You've never lived until you've been to The Stand. Burger: The Stanard with a grilled jalepeno is by far the best hamburger in Arizona. The Tacos are to die for. If you like corn on the cob, imagine it grilled and slathered in a cheesy herb sauce. Yeah... it's that good. Milk shakes are fantastic. The staff is friendly and peppy. You'll never go wrong here. Just try not to order everything off the menu. It's tempting.
