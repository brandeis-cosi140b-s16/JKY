Love Frijoles! Much cleaner and less hectic than Los Tacos. Very delicious and recognize much of the staff from Los Tacos. The prices are fair and the beans are fantastic. The atmosphere is very nice and love the pallet slat ceiling that was installed, definitely does not resemble the pizza hut it used to be at this location. Tacos are great, the street corn is fantastic and don't have to worry where the street car has been. I have been several times and has yet to disappoint. A must for traditional Tacos and burritos!
