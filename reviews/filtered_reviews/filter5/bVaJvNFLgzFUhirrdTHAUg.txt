You know, every time I come here I'm impressed! The food has been consistently exceptional. I get fish tacos a lot, and these are the best I've had. Service, too, has always been great, even when it's crowded. The place isn't fancy, but the staff keeps it very clean. Anyway, I come for the food, not the atmosphere!
