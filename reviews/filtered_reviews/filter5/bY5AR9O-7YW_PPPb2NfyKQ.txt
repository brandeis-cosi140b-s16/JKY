My new spot to eat and drink while in Vegas!  Came in on a Friday for a late eat and ordered the combo nachos...delicious! Great choice for a good eat before hitting the strip. The casa margarita was good as well...nothing special about it but a good drink.  
 We stayed there for the night for some dancing and drinking. Our big group had a great time and the music was good. 

Combo nachos...great 
Casa cocktail...okay 
Chupacabra...spicy and great 
Sexy vixen...really good..everyone enjoyed this drink the most. 

Will be back!
