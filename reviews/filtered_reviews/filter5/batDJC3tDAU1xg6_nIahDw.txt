This place is amazing! Both the food and service were A+. Both my girlfriend and I did the three taco entree. It's really cool they let you mix and match and get any three tacos. The Chicken Fried Steak and Smoked Brisket were the best, but really can't go wrong. The tacos are a very good size and the soft shell is nice and thick. I added a bacon stuffed jalapeno which is a must if you like spicy.

The service was just as great as the food. They refilled our chips before we were even done. Not just putting new chips on top of the ones still in the basket, but giving us a full basket of fresh ones. Also, the manager came around and refilled waters. I would say we had a total of three plus our waitress serve us.

Overall we can't wait to come back to Charlotte and for Paco's to be our first stop!
