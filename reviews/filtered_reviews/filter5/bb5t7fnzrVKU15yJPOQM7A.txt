I went back to this place last night after writing this review and the restaurant reached out to me to apologize for their service. Mike has since taken over as a manager and they have done a lot of changes there. He came over and apologized for my last visit and we did have a great experience there. So j would recommend going back to this place because their food is really good and they have taken steps to improve their service. You can see my previous visit below that they made up for. 


I'm not one to usually post a bad review but we come here pretty often for dinner because we really enjoy their food, but tonight was our worst experience we have had at this place. When we received our water it was served to us in plastic cups with no ice for dinner at 9:30pm. When we asked the manager she told us it was because they can't have people stealing their glassware with the night crowd. Didn't know we looked like we were going to steal anything, especially since we were sitting down for dinner and the two tables that sat down behind us got regular glassware. Then I asked for a margarita, which was served water down horribly and wit no salt which he ran off before he could even ask me if I wanted it. Then out meal came out before our table side guacamole which I server was serving himself. Not to mention he have it to us without chips or anything. I guess you are supposed to eat it with a fork. Then it took forever to find our server again just to get out of the place. Never felt so unwanted in a restaurant before. Even the manager didn't care. Stood up for her terrible server who had a terrible attitude the whole time. Sad to say it will be a while before we go there again.  Might sit at the bar next time. At least there you always have someone in front of you and they give good service.
