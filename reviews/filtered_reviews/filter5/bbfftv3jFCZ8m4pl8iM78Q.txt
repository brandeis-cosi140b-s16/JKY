I've gone here a couple of times with co workers and every time has been great! 
The food is piping hot fresh, great flavors, and many options with with salsa bar and a large selection of hot sauce bottles.
They will even do custom orders if you ask, I got nachos but fries instead of chips.
The place is very colorful with lots of fun custom decor as well.
I was told the only other serranos is in alaska by one of the workers.
