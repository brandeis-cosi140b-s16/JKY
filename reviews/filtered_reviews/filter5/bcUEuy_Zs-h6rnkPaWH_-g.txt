I had spied this restaurant when my husband and I were in town for a concert, but I didn't get to try it until 2 weeks later when I returned to Vegas for a work conference.  As luck would have it, my bff lives in town so we met up for dinner.  We had no reservation, but walked in on a Sunday night with no wait.  I had no idea that this place had vegan alternatives until I flipped the menu over.  I'm always game to try healthy alternatives to fatty favorites, so the vegan tacos were very appealing.  We ordered the street corn that was so yummy we had to order another to go.  And honestly, we could've eaten that at the table as soon as it arrived and had to order another one to try and make it to the parking lot. It's that good.  I ordered chick'n tacos with some sort of vegan style cheese that were so delicious I was licking my lips.  I washed it down with a skinny margarita.  My bff had an enchilada that she loved so much she was sure she'd have to order another one.  

I couldn't believe this little place was that delicious. It may not look like much, but it is HUGE on FLAVOR. I'm not vegan, although I like the lower calorie fake meats that honestly taste pretty much like the real thing.  I will definitely return and can't wait to taste the corn and chik'n tacos again. So yummy. Get in my belly!
