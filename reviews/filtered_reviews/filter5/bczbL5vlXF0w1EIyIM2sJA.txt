We've used SumoMaya twice so far (within a week) for Business meetings.  The food was excellent, everyone who ate with us has been raving about it, and the service was top notch.  They went far over and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed to host a successful business meeting, and not only do we plan to return for future business meetings, I plan to eat here personally as the food was so wonderful, as I'm sure everyone else that ate with us will do.  Best service in town.  Jason, the General Manager, went way over and beyond to accommodate us (very successfully so), Chef Jo (Joanna) was a delight to chat with and listen to describing the amazing dishes they served us, and Lucia was absolutely amazing and so helpful.  The presentation of the food was carefully put together making everyone's mouths water before even taking a bite (and then it tasted even better than it looked).  Fantastic all around, we definitely HIGHLY recommend using SumoMaya for your personal AND business lunch or dinner meetings.
