Hola, Paco. Gracias por la buena experiencia. 

Besides the food being good, their customer service is fantastic! My mom and her friend were in town and we wanted them to try Paco's Tacos. My mom ordered the brisket taco, but after a couple bites decided that it wasn't what she expected. Our server was very gracious and made the night out wonderful and got something my mom would enjoy...tres leches cake. 

I've been there a couple times and each time I've had a terrific experience. The staff are super friendly and the managers aim to please. The chips and salsa are delicioso and I have to force myself to stop eating them so I won't ruin my dinner. I've ordered the shrimp and veggie fajitas each time and they are yummy! 

Great location in the SouthPark neighborhood with a great atmosphere! When the weather is warm, it's nice to sit on the patio. The offer great specials during the week...por ejemplo, I think Mondays after 8pm their fajitas are half off.  

Thanks Paco's and staff for making our night out enjoyable!
