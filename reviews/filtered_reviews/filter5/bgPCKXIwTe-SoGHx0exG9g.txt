The queso fundido appetizer is one of my favorite dishes on this planet. I always leave Emiliano's uncomfortably stuffed (in a good way) because the food is so flavorful and portions are generous. I usually get something off the seafood portion of the menu and I'm never disappointed. if you're with a group, get a margarita pitcher instead of individual drinks  to save a few bucks.

My servers have always been pleasant and attentive, and the free chips and salsa are obviously a bonus as well.
