Had Tyler as our server again and he was just as great. This place has become a new favorite of mine. The queso dip is so delicious! So is the Patron XO flan. Oh, and I could put that green salsa on everything. So far, my favorite entree has been the pepita crusted salmon with fried green tomatoes. I'll definitely be back often.
