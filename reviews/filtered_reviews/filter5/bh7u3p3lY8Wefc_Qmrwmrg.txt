During a recent search for a new, unique, and fun brunch location, I stumbled upon Border Grill.  This restaurant met my expectations and more! The majority of my paper members indulged in the $35.00 all you can eat brunch.  The brunch consisted of small tapas style plates, such as (a Gluten Free Yogurt Parfait, BBQ Brisket Sliders, Tomatillo Egg Benedict, Serrano Ham Waffle and more).  For an additional $10 you can add the bottomless mimosas to your order.  If you think these prices are to high, then you will be missing out on SUCH amazing food!  
The food was so good, we ended up staying four hours.  During our visit, we continued to see various brunch items walk past us and we tried almost everything from the menu and continued to seek more.  This is a restaurant I will be visiting again, and again.  I can't wait for my family to arrive for the holiday's so that they are able to try out this establishment.
