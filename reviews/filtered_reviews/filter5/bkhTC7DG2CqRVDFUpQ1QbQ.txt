We were in Vegas for my friends Bachelor party last weekend and we went here for Mexican food based on reviews here ...let me tell you guys something I have traveled the world and been in many nice restaurants in my life , as far as service I have never been to a better place than this one .The service was more than amazing .The food was fresh and delicious and on par with the top Mexican food I have had .The inside decor is great and easy on the eyes .If I could give them 10 stars I would . Great place
