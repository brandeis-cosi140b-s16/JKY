Another amazing dining experience, thanks to Jose Andres.

Customer Service is through the roof. Our waiter was cool and helpful. We had no clue what to order and he picked some amazing courses for us. 

We ordered steam buns, mango sticky rice, pork tacos, and sui mai from what I can remember. The steam buns were light and full of flavor, perfectly soft. The pork tacos had this amazing heat to them without being spicy. The mango sticky rice was an incredibly light and playful paler pleaser. 

I have nothing but great things to say about Chino Poblano. It's definitely made my list of "must stop" locations when visiting Vegas.
