The restaurant is so hip and cool and the cuisine is outstanding.  We started with the duck carnitas empanada which was truly savory.  Then, we had the Malbec braised short ribs which were melt-in-the-mouth tender with wonderful flavor.  I love the location being in the old town part of Scottsdale.

The only negative was the sweet but overly descriptive waitress.  If the owner/manager is reading, it is unnecessary to describe the minute detail of every single dish.  I have had lectures on black holes and the big bang theory that were less involved and shorter.

This is a great place to take out of towners to show them that AZ has some talented chefs.
