Juan's is our favorite go to Mexican place in town.  The service is always outstanding.  My husband enjoys being greeted by the manager who will help him with his Spanish.  The bartender always recognizes us.  The cups are never empty.  The chips, beans, and salsa are always refilled.  Food always comes out Flamin' fresh.  My husband and I always get an iced tea, a coke, and chicken fajitas for 2...  We love getting the two plates of grilled veggies rather than the rice and beans. With tip it comes to $36.  How can you beat that?  That is enough to take home to add to lunch salads for two days as well!  For great food, friendly service, and fun atmosphere, check this place out!
