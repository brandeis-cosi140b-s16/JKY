BEST HORCHATA EVER!  I've never liked horchata, but I was told this was the best of the best and I absolutely had to try it.  So, I did and I am SO glad that I did.  I would go back for the horchata alone.  Amazing.  I'm already planning a trip back just for the horchata!

I get the 3 street taco combo with rice and beans.  I've had the carne asada, al pastor and cochinita.  The carne asada was delicious and the cochinita was good, but my absolute favorite was the al pastor.  It's the best al pastor taco I've ever had!

The salsa bar is awesome.  My favorite is the tomatillo and my friend loved the chipotle.  It has something for everything and it's all fresh.

All in all - a great little place (emphasis on little - probably not great for a large ground of people).  The food is authentic and very, very good - I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong here.
