Me and my family absolutely love this place! ever since 3 margaritas went down a few years back, we were looking for a good replacement for Mexican food. Their food is always piping hot, their drinks are good and prices are fair. My suggestion would be to get the spinach con queso or the spicy queso dip. They always come out hot. The flour chips can be a little on the raw side...
The service here is kind of fickle. Usually we get good servers, but the last time we went here the guy wasn't as attentive and seemed... lost.
The food is worth going back for again and again. Definitely recommend this place!
