I've lived in AZ for almost 20 years and this place is one of my favorite Mexican joints. Huge parking lot and the restaurant seems to get bigger every time we go. Yummy salsa & chips. Cheap margaritas. Delicious food. Machaca is amazing, garlic shrimp is my stand by, and everything else in between. I've never had a bad meal here & service is usually quick.
