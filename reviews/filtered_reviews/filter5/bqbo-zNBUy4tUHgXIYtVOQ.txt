It was a Friday night around 6:30pm when I placed my order and it was busy. So busy that it was a true 15 minute wait after placing my order, but it means made to order.  They were out of the of Barbacoa taco so I settled on the fish and the shrimp taco.  Tasty fish/batter and it was even nice to pile on the salsa/dressing bar which it made it more filling.  Cabbage both green and red, limes, pico de gallo, and onions tasted fresh.  I paid $7 for both and I thought it was a nice treat.  Better than Rubios, I think. I like that it is around other national chain restaurants so I think supporting a local one is good amongst the Walmart/Costco, Subway, Panda, Burger King.
