My first review on this place was not 5 stars but this time experience was for 10 stars. 

It is true when people say service is as important as the food is. 

Me and my boyfriend took his parents, grandparents and his brother for lunch. It was a first time for all of them 

From the start everything was great. 

We got really nice table and the best sever ever. Yes, his name is Eric. 
Eric was exceptional. The best sever I came a cross in a long time. 

Food was amazing, from appetizers to entrees, to drinks...etc.

Everybody was so happy with the choice. Grandparents enjoyed the ambiance and loved how the church was transformed and made into this nice restaurant.  

Eric made sure we were taking care of at all times. No question we are going back, but calling ahead and making sure Eric is working if we have a bigger party again. 

Thank you Eric! You are amazing!
