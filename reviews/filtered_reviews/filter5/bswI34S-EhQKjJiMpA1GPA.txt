I LOVE this place. I ate here on a weekly basis when I lived nearby and I still look for any excuse to go to Mesa just so I can hit up the drive-thru. Their fish tacos are the best I've ever had and anything else I've ever ordered has been nothing less than delicious. 

They're very decently priced and the ladies who take the orders and work the registers are super nice and friendly. The service is also pretty quick. 

They also have a fresh salsa bar inside! If you live in Mesa and haven't tried this place, you're missing out.
