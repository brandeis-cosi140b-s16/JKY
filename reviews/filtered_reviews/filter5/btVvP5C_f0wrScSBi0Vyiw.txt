Best enchiladas--ever! The enchiladas were as good as any I have ever tasted in San Antonio or Los Angeles.  Simple but delicious: Corn tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and onions (optional). That's it.  And, that's all it takes.  It is rumored that I am the only person to have touched more cookies than a Keebler Elf. That might be true. The claims that Comedor Guadalajara has the best enchiladas in Phoenix. Well, simply put, that's true. These enchiladas are so good that if Comedor Guadalajara was in a rap battle it would simply pull back the foil on a plate of these hellafide gangsta enchildas and drop the Mic!
