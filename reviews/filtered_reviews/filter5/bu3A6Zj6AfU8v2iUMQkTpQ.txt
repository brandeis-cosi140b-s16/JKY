Ive been coming here for years and they deserve 5 stars because they have tasty and consistent mexican food. The food is a cut above your standard mexican fare. I recomend the any of the lunch specials but I especially like the chicken enchiladas with green tamatillo sauce, comes with rice and beans. 8.50$ Also everyone that works their is very friendly.
