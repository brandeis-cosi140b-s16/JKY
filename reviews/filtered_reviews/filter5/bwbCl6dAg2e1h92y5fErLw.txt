This place saved me. I struggled to find a good authentic Mexican restaurant near campus. The burritos and tacos are outstanding, and the presentation - complete with lime wedges and two types of salsa - makes for a wonderful experience. There is not much seating, but if you order and wait a moment you're sure to find a spot at the counter or at the window.
