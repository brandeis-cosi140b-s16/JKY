Absolutely, the best guacamole ever -- I've lived in Phoenix over 45 years and consumed a great deal of Mexican food.  The pomegranates were a great addition!

My only criticism is there are not enough vegetarian options.  In the future, I'll stick with the guacamole and a side dish since the guacamole is super filling.  In fact, its so good I will get an order just for me so that I don't have to share.  The portion sizes of the entrees my husband and I ordered were huge!  We needed to take half of our meals home.

A word of caution, the menu is a bit pricey but well worth it.  BTW - the horchata was terrific, next time I will try the aqua frescas.
