I had brunch here yesterday and it was the best meal I had on the trip (especially considering I had a restaurant.com certificate to use).  The brunch is all-u-can eat and all you can drink mimosas.  Its not a buffet, there is actually a menu w/ 17 different items on it from tacos to empanadas to fresh fruit, eggs benedict, etc.. all the items are tapas so 1 person could literally eat the whole menu if he/she were hungry enough... I only made it through 10 items but was full beyond belief.  Each dish is unique, full of flavor, and just down right delicious (unlike many of the traditional buffets); the food also comes out fresh-er than under a heated lamp.  Our waitress was super nice; only I had the brunch, my wife/son ordered off their regular menu yet they took bites and shared some of my food.  The guava empanada was so good we actually asked if we could take one to go (and our waitress made it happen!)  I would totally go again and will probably plan on it, on our next trip to Vegas (I've been to Bouchon for brunch, and have to say Border Grill is much better in terms of food, choices, and value)!
