I've been waiting for someone to crack the code to make a restaurant or bar work out in this space for a while now, and Bakersfield has done it! This is maybe more of a bar than it is a restaurant, but it works great on both levels and is pretty authentic mexican street food...don't expect cheddar cheese and sour cream and lettuce on your taco. The specialty drinks are top notch and worth the price, but you can drink more cheaply from the decent beer list or daily specials. There is a great tequila and whiskey selection.

Don't be a baby about the lack of parking. It's a densifying neighborhood only a mile from downtown in a growing city, you're not entitled to free plentiful parking everywhere. Take a cab/uber, walk, bike, or park on a side street a few blocks away.
