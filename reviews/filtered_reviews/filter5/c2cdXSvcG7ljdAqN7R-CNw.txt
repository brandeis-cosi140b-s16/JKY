This place is great. We have eaten here twice and gone there for just the milkshakes about six times. Each and every time the product is good as well as the service. 

The burgers are good (Similar to In & Out, but a little more flavor), the fries are great, the short rib tacos aren't bad, and the milkshakes are unbeatable. The Dulce De Leche milkshake may be the best I've ever had, the banana is awesome, the chocolate is good, and the chocolate/banana is great. They will mix any flavors you want.

The decor is nice and the patio is close off and has a good feel. They are ALWAYS well staffed and the owner has been there working hard every single time we've been in. They seem to hire a lot of young kids who look to be excited to work and have great attitudes as well. 

Great place and it is in my frequent rotation of restaurants. 

Would it be possible to add BYOB? I don't know the rules on that.
