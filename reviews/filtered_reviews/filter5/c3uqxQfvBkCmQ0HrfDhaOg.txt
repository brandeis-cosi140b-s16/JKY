Omg when I am craving fish tacos, Nacho Daddy is my go-to. The fish tacos here are grilled and they come with a delicious homemade mango salsa. Everything tastes really fresh and the waitstaff is very nice but also casual.

The location is right up the road from my office and they were very efficient with their take out service. But when you dine-in, I would definitely recommend the margaritas. My favorite is the Daddy's. Order it.

I wish they were closer to Summerlin but I heard they are opening a second location in downtown Las Vegas, so I will definitely be visiting that one soon ;)
