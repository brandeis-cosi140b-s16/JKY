I highly recommend this place.  Tied for most authentic Mexican restaurant in town.  Prices are great and never had anything bad.  

I will be a bit more adventurous and get the beef tongue next time.  

They provide two salsas.  Both are good.  They are slightly stingy on how much they pour but will pour more for you.   

One minor knock is that the way the main dining area is built it can be a bit loud from the various conversations.  I almost knocked the rating to 4 for that reason.   I choose not to because I don't expect it to be easy to converse here.  Meaning, not a great place for an I'm getting to know you date.
