We ate here our second night in Vegas after suffering through the first night eating at RM Seafood (also located in Mandalay Bay). 

I had the skirt steak which was excellent! Very tender and marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin and lime. My fiance and I shared the Tres Leches for dessert. yummy! 

Reasonably priced and excellent service! We felt completely ripped off after eating at RM Seafood the night before so we were very happy to receive the level of customer service you'd expect in Las Vegas. 

Looking forward to going back and eating here again!
