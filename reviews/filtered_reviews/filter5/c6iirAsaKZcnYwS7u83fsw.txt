I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte. 

The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas. 

The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees. 

Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sautéed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors. 

Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were "Dos" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado. 

Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. ¡Ole!
