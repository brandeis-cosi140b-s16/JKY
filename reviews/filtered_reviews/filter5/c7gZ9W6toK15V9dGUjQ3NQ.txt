"What is cabeza?"  I stupidly question my bud (an American via Mexico).

"It's you know." he says, using two hands to point to his crotch.

"What the?  I'm not eating penis tacos!" I say to an explosion of laughter.

"No, no, no." he chokes, now pointing to his head.

Having been many times before with Spanish speaking buds who handle all the ordering and just watch me eat their handiwork, I decided on this fateful visit to learn for myself what it's about.

That said, Tacos El Gordo serves up incredible, if not the best tacos in Vegas. 

House made tortillas.  Generous portions of flavorful house made beef and pork.  Tacos made to order on the spot.  Fresh veg and a great extra (grilled peppers and onions that are so good, they can be eaten alone).

Outstanding  "normal" proteins including:

- Carne Asada - well marinated, juicy, deeply flavored flank or skirt.  Hint of acidity.
- Adobada - The venerable pillar of meat, carved by a weapon.  Mildly spicy, juicy, seared finish adding a good bitter edge.

Offal selections include:

- Cabeza (face) - The best of all the protein selections.  Fatty, liquefied gelatin, moist beefy goodness.  
- Lengua (tongue) - very good beef flavor with a mineral finish.  Excellent, slightly chewy texture.
- Tripa (tripe) - Clean, almost milky with a slight bitter, organ meat finish.  Chewy and tasty.
- Buche (pig stomach) - Not for everyone.  Mild hint of mineral bitterness.
- Sesos (cow brain) - Definitely not for everyone.  Creamy, aggressively seasoned, strong mineral flavor.  In your face flavors.  (it lacks the mild flavor and finesse of a calf brain).

Straight forward, efficient counter service.  Strange multi line ordering system (one line for this, another for that).  Very low prices ($2 - $2.25 per taco).

In a word:  outstanding.
