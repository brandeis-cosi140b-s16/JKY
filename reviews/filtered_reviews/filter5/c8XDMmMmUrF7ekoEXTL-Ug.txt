Tonight was my third time coming to Sol Cocina. Each time the service has been so good and spot on! It really makes for a quite enjoyable experience. The food was so fresh and full of flavor! We had the ceviche Sol as well as several tacos. The taco vampiro is definitely my favorite as well as the jalape√±o margarita! Overall I highly recommend this restaurant  I haven't had this good of service and level of attentiveness even on a busy friday in a long time!
