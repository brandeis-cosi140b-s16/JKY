LOVE Phat Burrito. They have fantastic food here... I almost always get a quesadilla and chips w/ queso. They have, hands down, the BEST queso I can remember eating. I don't care that their chips are bagged, although I do wish there were a few more in the bag.

Their soup is great, too. I'm also a sweet tea snob and they have great sweet tea!

This is a place I frequent for lunch, and I'm never disappointed. Not a long wait, staff is friendly... oh! And they have really good brownies!
