Our very favorite place for Mexican seafood in Vegas !!! All you tourist and locals need to try this place out !!! Very reasonable prices and the Michaladas are to die for !!! Save your hard earned money , stay off the rip -off  strip and head to East Charleston and Maryland !!! Back in the corner on North side of Road !!!
