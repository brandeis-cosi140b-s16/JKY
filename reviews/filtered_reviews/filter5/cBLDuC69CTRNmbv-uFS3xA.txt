During a work outing after a hard week, we stopped by to grab dinner on the boss and boy would I have payed double whatever the bill was!  Everything was awesome!! The server seemed quiet but it was a larger group so the need to stop by was frequent and I think she didn't want to keep interrupting which I find to be a great quality.  Nothing worse than a server popping in Avery 5 minutes asking if everyone is ok.... Except a server that never pops in I suppose lol.  But she was great.  The food was awesome. The place wasn't too loud and someone else paid for the meal!  Can't go wrong with any of that!!
