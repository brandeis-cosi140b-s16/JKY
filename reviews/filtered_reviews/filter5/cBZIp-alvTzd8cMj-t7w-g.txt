This place is always a favorite of mine. Having lived in lake Las Vegas since 2006, the entire team at Sonrisa has always been attentive to all guests and their needs. 

They have amazing wines and margaritas. Chanthy the owner is always greeting and making sure her guests are satisfied.

Omar, the bartender and the rest of the team are so fun and really pay attention to your needs.

Camarones mojo de ajo is an awesome dish! Taco Tuesday is fun too and weekends they have a DJ!
