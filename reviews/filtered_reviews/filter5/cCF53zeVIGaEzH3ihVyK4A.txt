This has to be one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food and I recommend it to many people. Growing up in Arizona, I have found many places claiming they do authentic Mexican food. Not the case for many places. Nandos definitely serves great authentic Mexican food! They get really busy at times but its worth the wait. We try to go a little bit early to avoid a big waiting time. The staff is very outgoing and the servers seem to remember you if they have waited on you before. Nice to go to a place that serves exactly what they advertise.
