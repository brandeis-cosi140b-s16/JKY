I was a little skeptical about this restaurant at first. I hadn't heard much about it before going for the first time. After spending an evening dining here I am surprised I haven't heard more about this restaurant. First off the staff because they were incredible. We had the same waiter both times we have come here. He was very friendly and personable. He always made sure we were stocked up on soda as well as chips and salsa. We spoke with the owner for literally about 30 minutes about how he wants to make this restaurant great. He spoke about how the customer is always right and how he wanted to make sure everyone is always happy with service. He is open to feedback and encourages it. When you receive chips and salsa they give you three salsas which are all unique. The food came out timely and was delicious. The portions were perfect. You definitely get what you pay for. They have a tequila club where you can try 100s of different types of shots and give you your own glass that you can grab every time you come in. The bar is pretty big. Both the bar and restaurant are aesthetically pleasing.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a shot.
