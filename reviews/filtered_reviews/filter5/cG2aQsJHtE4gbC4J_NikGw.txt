Fun neighborhood restaurant w great happy hour & ice cold margaritas. The appetizer specials are always delicious: ahi tuni, street tacos, and pork chile verde. Ahh, the hot cornbread is a must. We really enjoy sitting in the bar area b/c this Z'Tejas offers live entertainment on Thursday nights ~ two very talented young guys playing guitars and singing our favorite tunes!
