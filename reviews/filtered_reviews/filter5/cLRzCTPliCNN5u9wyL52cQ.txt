Let's start with the chips & salsa!!! They were SO good!!!! And lots of different types too! The green salsa was a little sweet, but it was really interesting! The queso is out of this world good! 

I had the chicken tacos- they were pretty good. I also had the potatoes that were recommended & they were delicious! Very different! 

We finished the meal with the flan they have- and it's TASTY!!! We had the nicest server, which of course I can't remember his name now- but he was awesome & brought us extra queso. 

I very much recommend this for dinner! Nice outdoor seating area as well!
