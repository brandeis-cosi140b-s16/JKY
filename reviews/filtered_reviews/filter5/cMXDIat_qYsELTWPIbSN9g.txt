Been here a ton of times. Great outdoor atmosphere. I always try to get Kassandra to be our waitress, really friendly and attentive! All the girls are nice though. Love the chips and salsa even though you have to pay for it. People who complain about dust should never go to an outdoor bar in Arizona. Their area in back is huge with a sand volley ball court, horseshoe pit and fire pit and the girls do their best to try and cover it.
