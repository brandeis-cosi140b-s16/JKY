This was my first visit to any Lindo Michoacan and I can't believe it hasn't been sooner. Authentic Mexican food is awesome, but I didn't realize they also have mariachis. Did I mention that I love mariachis? And they were not crappy ones either. But anyway I came here for dinner and drinks with some coworkers. They had mango margaritas which were tasty (and I don't even like mango) and I had a watermelon margarita which was very good. I could hardly choose what to get but settled on the Steak Ranchera (about $20) and it was delicious. They also bring you chips and salsa of course which were good but the little cup of sopa de fideo they bring before your entree was friggin amazing. I need to figure out how to make it like that cuz it was the bomb, I could just have a big bowl of that in the winter, with some tortillas.... mmmm. I ate til I was stuffed and had enough steak and rice and beans left for lunch the next day. Also my coworkers told me that they have $5 margaritas for happy hour? Regardless I need to come more often for mariachis and delicious generous food.
