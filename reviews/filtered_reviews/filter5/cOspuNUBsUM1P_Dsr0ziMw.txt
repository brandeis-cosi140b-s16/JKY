I was in Phoenix for business and Yelped good local Mexican cuisine. I stopped by Los Taquitos and it is solid. Tried a few things to sample the menu. I had chicken tacos (both grilled and shredded) and a green chile pork burrito. All three items were excellent. The shredded chicken was amazing. They feature a large street taco selection and the restaurant is a step above local taquerias. It's worth making a trip too. Food is good. Vibe is good and well priced. Go check it out. I will be back.
