Awesome food and service, no discrimination for having a groupon, we were given meat samples before ordering. All the choices were yummy and it was has to decide. We ordered after reviewing our choices and to our delight "loved it". We spoke with the owner, who introduced himself as Randy and he guaranteed everything to be fresh, they do not even keep freezer food. The coconut bark samples were good enough to sell us take home. We were not able to eat the full portions, so we were able to take dinner for our flute back to Pa. Everyone on the flute will be envies. Thank You Randy and Braddhas.
