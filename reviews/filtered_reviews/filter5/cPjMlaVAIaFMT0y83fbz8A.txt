We've eaten this brunch five times in the last four years.  This last time, everything went perfectly.  Plenty of great food.  The small plates are being rotated (the PB&J is gone... for awhile).  Only one dish disappointed me (only a little, it was the skirt steak).  The passion fruit mimosa is back (thus they're getting 5 stars instead of 4).  Pricy and not for everyone, but we love it.
