Try as I might...I always end up ordering tres tacos de carne asada...con todos...whenever we go here.  If you've never had real Mexican tacos...served on the street preferably, you don't know what you're missing.  It's simple, street food...but so delicious! The carne flavor is transcendent...and when coupled with onions & cilantro...and real corn tortillas...and the essential salsa...ephemerally flavorful and satisfying.  My bf sometimes opts for the huarches...a spectacularly beautiful combination of meat, beans, avocado, lettuce and cheese with a drizzling of sour cream...all in appropriate quantities instead of the typical Americanized Mexican where everything is drenched in cheese or sauce...

Go.  Eat.  Savor...and take some to go...it's equally good or better later or the next day...
