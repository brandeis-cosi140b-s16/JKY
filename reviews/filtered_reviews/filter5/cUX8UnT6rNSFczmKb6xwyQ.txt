I can't lie...this was amongst one of the best meals I have ever had and my waistline will indicate I have dined plenty to come to this conclusion.  The margaritas are made with Patron and made with fresh lime juice and agave and served up as I like.  We started with the guac and chips.   Fresh and yummy!  And the homemade salsas served on the side really were superb. We then split the pork wings.  I have never had anything like this and am sad I live too far away to get these on a regular basis.  They were so tender and the flavors were wonderful.   It was truly a gift from a blind pig. We then split the braised short rib and mac and cheese.  This set us over the edge but were happy to be pushed to the edge. The short rib was so tender and flavorful.  Very well done sauce as well.  The mac and cheese was better than most upscale steakhouses that offer this dish as a side.  We were completely blown away by the quality of food and the yummy drinks.  Being from OC that meal would have cost us well over $150 BUT with 8 drinks (we are lushes) and all that food it came to around $86.  I AM NOT SAYING raise your prices Blind Pig, I'm saying I am thankful for your food, drinks, service and prices.  Don't change a thing...Oh and PS: come to OC...........NOW!!!!!!!
