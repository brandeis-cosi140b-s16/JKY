When I want to be sure to eat healthy with local produce and meats I come here. Wither Chef Vincent & Doug is grilling on pecan wood all will be fresh and aromatic. And now they have a healthy alternative to beef and chicken - goat (lower calorie, fat and cholesterol totals). Prepared with carrots and potatoes in a broth (appears stewed to older crowd) tender tasty & healthy! Server Elaine told me it was AZ raised goat, no surprise I buy AZ goat cheese at Phx Public Market. Will be back again for more.
