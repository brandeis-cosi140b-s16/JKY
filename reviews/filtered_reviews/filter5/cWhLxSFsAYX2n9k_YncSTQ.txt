Start off by saying the food was AMAZING! You start with chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was really good! I also got the house margarita, also really good. Not your premix margarita, this tasted freshly made!
I had 2 tacos. A paco taco and smokey & the brisket. Oh my so delicious! You could taste the smoke in the brisket! I liked the smokey & the brisket a little better because it had a fresh tomato salsa that made the taco very refreshing. 
My husband had the open face pork quesadilla. He would not stop raving about how good they were. 
The services was fantastic! We made a reservation and did not have to wait on a Saturday night at 730. Our waiter was also really friendly as well. 
We will definitely be eating here again!
