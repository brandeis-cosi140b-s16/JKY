The million other reviews for this place sum it up nicely: Tacos El Gordo is awesomely delicious.

As prior reviewers have said, the superstar is the adobada.  The adobada line is the closest to the door and always the longest for a reason -- it's a flavor explosion.  Just make sure you ask for the pineapple and everything on it, those little additions just put it over the top.

My other faves are the carne asada, suadero, and lengua.  If you're in the mood for lengua, I'd suggest refraining from ordering the other tacos.  The simplicity of the flavors in the lengua taco -- complimented with just a sprinkling of cilantro and onions--might get overwhelmed if you flank it with an adobada which has a lot going on. 

The price for this place is also phenomenal.  I'm always stuffed after two tacos, which are $2 a piece, for a grand total of $4.00 plus tax. 

 My mouth is watering just typing this review...maybe I'll head out there for lunch...
