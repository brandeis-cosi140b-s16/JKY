LOVE the carne asada tacos, which come in corn tortillas and are served with guacamole, caramelized onions and lettuce. I usually order three, and after my second I start to think maybe my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but then I polish the third off anyway. 

The guacamole is awesome -- I split an order of chips and guac, and between our meals and that as a side, it was too much. So, I took the guacamole back to the office, and it was still great the next day.
