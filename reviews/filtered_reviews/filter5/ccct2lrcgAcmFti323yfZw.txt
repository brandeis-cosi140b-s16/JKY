This was the first time we had eaten at this restaurant, and have to say - we are SO glad we did.  There were 3 of us, and I got my usual dish I get at most mexican restaurants, enchiladas.  I had 1 shredded beef, and 1 shredded chicken - and they had probably the best flavor I have had since being in Puerto Vallarta.  The service was great, and the atmosphere is amazing.
