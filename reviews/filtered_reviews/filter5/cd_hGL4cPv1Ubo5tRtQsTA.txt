This place was SOOOO crowded and its no wonder WHY.   

We flew into Las Vegas to celebrate a friend's 60th Birthday,,   with the suggestion that we were going to the Michoac√°n (up in the Hills with the view) I read the reviews and really wanted to go there for dinner,,    the restaurant could not accommodate our group, so we ended up at a Pasta joint.   

As we had a few hours to blow before our flight home,,  we decided to find the restaurant for an early dinner,,      a search took us to this "Original" location,,

What a GREAT find,,     I love Mexican food,, and this is one of the BEST Restaurants I have discovered.     

Order the nachos with guacamole -    the owner comes to your table and makes the guacamole right there in front of you.   Great flavor and great chips.  

I ordered the Menudo,,   wow,,  just as good a HOMEMADE.   a great blend of flavor and spices with no skimping on the ingredients.     With the chopped onion, lime juice and fresh cilantro.    Reminded me of my childhood.  

I also ordered a Relleno with rice,,   truly FIRE ROASTED with great flavor.  
Tortillas are hand made with old world flavor.  

My wife ordered her Chile Verde dinner,,   the aroma was fabulous.  

Even though the room was FULL,,   service was swift and courteous ,,   a Big family party of 21 were next to us,,  staffing was enough that they were able to serve this family of Adults and young kids all at the same time.     

the aromas in the dinning room  were most inviting... 

We will definitely come here  on our NEXT visit to Las Vegas.
