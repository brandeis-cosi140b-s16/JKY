My son graduated this May and we decided to order a variety of menu options and have the food catered. My entire family completely enjoyed the meal. We ordered chips, guacamole, burritos, tacos, quesadillas, tostada-in a variety of meats, rice, beans. Sad we will not be regulars since my son has graduated.  Definitely worth picking up since the eating area is small.
