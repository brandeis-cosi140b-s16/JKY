Braddah's is basically the Hawaiian version of Chipotle!

I got the huli huli chicken bowl with guac, nori rice, and corn. Everything blended well together and it tasted great! The portion is big for $8. My dad is from Hawaii so I'm glad I found a place that has huli huli hi ken and kalua pig that tastes like dad's cooking! 

I recommend this place to everyone! Mahalo.
