The most amazing Mexican food I have ever eaten. Especially with my limited options, being vegan. The food tastes clean and fresh. I would consider myself a regular. Visiting 5+times a month. The service staff is super friendly and always makes me and my girlfriend feel welcome. They've memorized our orders exactly every time we come in. And they get it right every single time. I'm always recommending this restaurant to family and friends. It's always the place I take my family or friends visiting from out of town. And the owner frank is such a sweet heart. I respect him so much as a restaurant owner because he puts on an apron and works as a server. That shows passion.
