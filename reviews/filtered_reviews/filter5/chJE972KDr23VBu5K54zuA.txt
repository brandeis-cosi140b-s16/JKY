So happy with location food & service! I'm from Chicago so looking for a good spot and finding one out of town  for real is a rarity! Chris the owners son was awesome! Charged my phone for me which always wins cool points! Food was fresh and I loved the salsa variety and attention to detail with food description! Outside seating was high end and inside upscale swanky Mexican  loved it. Thank you for a great meal! Great for old, young, & families!
