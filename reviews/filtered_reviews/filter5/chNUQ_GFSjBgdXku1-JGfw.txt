Love this place! Such tasty burritos. What's not to love? Fresh made tortillas right in front of you, tasty meat choices ( I like the sweet pork!) and make sure to get it enchilada style to get it smothered with awesomeness! Then get ready for some tasty hot sauce variety to choose from. I'm proud to say I overheat every time I come here. Thanks Cafe Rio, I heart you
