Best Mexican I've eaten in Charlotte.

I grew up near Chicago, which has a big Mexican population dating back to the 1930s, and I lived for four years as an adult in Southern California, so you can say I'm a big fan of Mexican.  My litmus test for any Mexican joint is the beans, and this place passed with flying colors.  

All the food I've had here was good.  If I were 20 years younger and lived closer to this place, I'd eat here three times per week.
