Fun place next to a strip joint!

There's really nothing like coming in for some Mexican cuisine which leads right into strippers. This location is conveniently placed and the food doesn't disappoint. 

My boss happens to be friends with the owner so we get spoiled here and by spoiled I mean tequila! Thank you Mr. Feinstein for taking good care of us! The decor is a lot of fun and it's a very sexy looking Mexican joint. The food is great as well and after several tequila shots everyone is having a party. I love work nights like this because we all continue our bonding :)

So in between many shots sent our way we also had all sorts of great cocktails from traditional margaritas to the specialty house drinks. They all pack a punch and were great. 

The food was so good! The cheesy thing that had onions, mushrooms, peppers and other goodies that you dipped your chips in as well as flour tortillas was so great. We ordered a ton of good stuff from some street tacos, steak bowl & even the Feinstein special which was my favorite dish. It had chicken, crispy onions, a fried egg all on side potato chips. (My memory is blurry from the tequila) but I remember enjoying every bite. 

We had a lot of fun here and will definitely be back. Thank you to our server for putting up with our shenanigans and see you soon :)
