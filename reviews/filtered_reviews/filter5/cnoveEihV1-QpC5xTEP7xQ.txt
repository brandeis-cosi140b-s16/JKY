Here we go. The second location of the ever expanding empire known as Braddah's island style. There also is a another location somewhere in the north west, but it's too far from me and we won't talk about that one.

The new Braddah's opened up right across from the main UNLV campus. This is a great idea due to their pricing point, speed of service, and great casual food!

I like the new Braddah's interior more here than at the original location, it feels more like a cafe rather than a fast food place, which the original one reminds me of.

The food is exactly the same as the original, and so are the prices. This time I also ordered their coconut bark for the very first time. The chocolate, crispy shortbread, and ooey gooey caramel nestled with coconut is just what the doctor ordered. Do I need an IV? No, just send the coconut bark this way :D

Great casual food, love the new setting, one of my favorite spots in town!
