Been eating here since July and need to update my review after my dinner here last night. It just gets better with time. By now we've eaten burritos, enchiladas, tacos, nachos (yummmm) and my new favorite - tortas!

My torta of choice is loaded with bulgogi, lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado and those little sliced pickled jalapenos on a soft roll with a lil mayo ($5.99). I really don't know how to properly describe the fusion taste - it's just incredibly unique and complex. 

Komex has just wonderful customer service. When we walked in last night it was packed and there people ahead of us waiting for a table. We were contemplating ordering to go and Linda explained that in the amount of time it would take to make our food a table would open. Well she was correct and within 10 minutes two tables became available and she very speedily took care of us. 

Oh and their mango passionfruit tea is amazing. It's unsweetened but is actually pretty sweet and satisfying.
