Ok....WOW,   just  WOW!  I am not a hamburger freak so when my Hubby asked around and was told this was awesome, I just went along with him.  When you enter this unassuming small place, the guy at the counter asks if you have been there before.  Then he tells you what the most popular burger is (Brulee)..I did not want to think that day and just ordered the Brulee even though it did not sound good.  There was Soooo a party in my mouth.  It was AWESOME!  Hubby ordered a boring regular burger and he LOVED it too.  Their fries were seasoned and HOT.  They got a huge thumbs up, only thing that was not up to par with the rest was the homemade potato chips...kinda yucky..oh and the Carnival Corn was wonderful!  We will so be back!
