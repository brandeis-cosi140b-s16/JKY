Finally .... A place I can go eat at and NOT get sick. :)
Wow!!! So impressed with this place! Seen it on a friends news feed & the Non GMO is what caught my attention. I am a vegetarian with celiac 's also , so to see they had a gluten free , vegetarian menu on top of non GMO was a jackpot! We have needed a place like this in Vegas . I really hope they do well & stay open . My only fear is the location . Not so convenient for the locals. 

The Food was delicious ! I had the veggie tacos , my Aunt had shrimp taquitos , cousin had carne  Asada tacos , mom had the breakfast fried eggs & beans plate (can't remember name) . We also had the flan & fried ice-cream . EVERYTHING was amazing. . All the meat is hormone free also . If you don't know much about organic , non GMO food ... Do some research ! This is NOT easy or cheap to do.. It is not the most convenient either . For them to have a great menu with these wonderful options at great prices is incredible .
Now to the service ... Holy smokes , our waiter was so friendly & educated on all their food & different diet needs . His name was Kai and I would request him for sure .He also happened to be an assistant manager. Then another assistant manager (Arianna) came to our table to introduce herself & see how the service was. After that , the Chef himself (Chef Paco) wanted to see how we enjoyed the food , then brought us a free sample of the flan. .
Such nice people & such a cute place . The only negative thing I can say is it's next to a strip club & not in a great part of town . 
Excited to go back !
