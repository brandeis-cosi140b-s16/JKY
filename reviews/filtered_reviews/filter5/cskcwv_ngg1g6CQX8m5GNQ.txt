Showed up the other day, to see that their expansion has been in full effect!

Almost no line on a Saturday night!  At least compared to before....only took me a few minutes to get all my food!  Plus it is much easier to find a seat now, since they pretty much doubled that too.

And don't take that as a bad sign...still very full and busy overall, but without the "bad" busy of having to wait before you can eat!

Still wish they made their horchata scratch like in TJ!

Best place to eat tacos in Vegas!
