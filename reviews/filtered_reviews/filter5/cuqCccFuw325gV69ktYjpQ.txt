This is my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  We live nearby and try to stop in for Happy Hour or dinner once a week.  We especially enjoy the bar area after a hot day of golf, although the patio is fun if weather permits.  It is a casual place, which suits us just fine.  My favorite dishes are the stacked enchiladas and the Osso Bucco, although I also enjoy their appetizers: quesadillas (filet or chicken) and the crab cakes.  Their dishes have a nice spicy/smoky flavor, spicier than traditional regular Mexican food.  It's an affordable and friendly place and the food is consistently good.
