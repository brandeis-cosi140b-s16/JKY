The fajitas are to die for. The veggies are rich in flavor. I was surprised how tasty the vegetables in the fajitas were. The complimentary chips served with three different salsas are so delicious one can make the mistake of eating too many and being full before your meal comes! Definitely recommend this restaurant.
