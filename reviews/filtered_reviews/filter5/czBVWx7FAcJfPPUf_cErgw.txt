Yelp reviews led me here, and they were right: this place rocks. The food was fresh and flavorful and absolutely delicious. The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. We kept it simple-- I got the asada tacos and my coworker went pollos. I was tempted to go back up to the counter and order one with carnitas, but I was too stuffed. If time permits while I'm in town, I may swing by again to check out a few more things. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and craving tacos.
