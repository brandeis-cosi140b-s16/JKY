This place is awesome. It takes a little long to get your food but it's because it's fresh and hot and there's one guy doing it all. It's worth every second. I get my truck washed right there and sit down and have a great lunch that's hot and fresh. Compared to don tortaco or robertos......hands down wins over them every time.
