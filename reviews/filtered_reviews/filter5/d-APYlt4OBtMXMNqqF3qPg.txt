We came here for lunch and let me just say the margaritas are sweet nectar of the gods - wowowowooww!!!!!!  We came here after a long night of drinking and the Pomegranate Acai Margarita and the Classic Margarita with Patron were sooooo smooth, my hangover went away!  The food was great, I got some carne asada tacos which I really enjoyed.  Bartenders were so nice and friendly.
