This place is solid. Very clean and well maintained. Love the tacos. In my opinion this is what they do best. I strongly suggest hitting the tip jar when you place your order. Just a couple of bucks goes a long way and will make your meal that much better - for sure.

Only two drawbacks:

With the exception of the cashiers there can be language barriers behind the counter. When this happens you need to speak slowly, clearly and toss in whatever Spanish you might possess. Not a big deal, but it can pose a challenge.  

The salsa bar - amazing taste, but no idea of what I'm getting. Is it hot? Maybe mild? Perhaps super spicy? You just gotta dive in and find out! Seriously, management needs to label the salsa choices.
