GET SOME!!
go now seriously and get some.

This place is easily now my top favorite mexican food joint in all of phoenix. Great cheap prices. There are three types of mexican restaurant places i go. 1) I have to for some reason. 2) I want some mexican food and this place was around. and 3) I crave this place in particular.

This place falls into my number 3 category easily. I literally love the guy at the register, he was really friendly and knew his menu well. That is always a good thing when your workers actually know the menu (i think he might be the owner). It is a small place, outdoor seating if you wish and pretty clean considering the outside aesthetics. 

The food:

Fish Tacos - Grade: A+, the fish was fresh and crunchy, the sauce was nice and tangy, the cabbage was crisp and fresh. The sauce and the lime were in perfect harmony.

Quesadilla -  Grade: A+crunchy corn tortilla, um for real, soo simple yet soo delicious, crunchy all the way through, generous amounts of cheese made each bite memorable

Tamales (spicy chicken) - Grade:  A, i wish the maiz was a little softer, but the texture was still good. I was hoping for the chicken to be spicier but i have a pallet for spicy pain... Even though it didn't get a plus it was still really good, just wasn't what i was expecting so a slight let down

Perro Oaxaca - Grade: A, the Oaxacan version of the Sonoran Hot Dog...still my votes go sonoran all the way through and through. This was REALLLY tasty still, but my only step fuss was, too much mayo on it, if it was SPICY mayo i wouldn't mind too much...
My opinion for the mayo is, either do light mayo, or do a chipotle mayo and put that one top...that would be great.


Glad i have found a mexican food joint i love on my side of town. I'll be back in a week when i start to crave it again.
