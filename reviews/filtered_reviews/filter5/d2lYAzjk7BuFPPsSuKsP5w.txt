Carlito's is the B-O-M-B. I am such a fan of this place and then some. I have been here time and time again and not once been disappointed in the food. The prices are beyond reasonable and the service is decent.

I have inhaled several items on the menu and here is how the rank on the medal stand:
1. Nachos- Insane! Number 1 in town! I want them in my belly right now!
2. Enchiladas- Yes, you are pretty too, Miss Enchiladas. (Get it with green sauce)
3. Tamales- excellent
4. Tacos- Yes, please

They serve beer and margaritas and my favorite Horchata-drink of the Gods!!! I cannot say enough wonderful things about Carlitos. Only negative is the space itself is tiny and because the food is out of this world you might have to wait a few minutes and get it to go. It's worth it. One bite and you will be addicted to it, too!
