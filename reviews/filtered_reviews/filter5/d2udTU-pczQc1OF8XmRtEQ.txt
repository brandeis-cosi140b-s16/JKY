I have been here a bunch of times, thanks to a coworker who recommended it for authentic, good Mexican.  I'm trying to think of everything I've tried here:  the Wednesday lunch special of chicken in a light mole sauce, chicken soup, cheese enchiladas, burrito all delicious.  The service is fast, the food is always good.  Highly recommend.
