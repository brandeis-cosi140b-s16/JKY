We have been here on many many occasions and the food is always hot hot and fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. The wait at times can be long but it is worth the wait for Alfredo's green chili pork. It is delicious!! Hot fresh chips and salsa makes it even better.

We had my daughters wedding rehearsal dinner here (yes it is a groom thing...but well) they placed our group in the meeting room and it was wonderful. We had our own servers and a full bar. The manager made me a great deal considering we had to pay. Everyone left full and happy...

This is Mesa's little secret
