This is by far my new favorite place! $5 Happy Hour Margaritas are delicious and I even have a favorite server! Try it! You won't regret it! My fav taco is the coffee bean braised beef but every taco I've tried is wonderful! The sides have changed over time but I'm honestly never disappointed!

P.S. Ask for Tim as your server...he's the BEST!!!!
