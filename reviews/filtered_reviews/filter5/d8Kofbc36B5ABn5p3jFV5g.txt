Went back again the other night with just my husband and baby boy. We had just as good of a time as we did with our group a few weeks before! I had the shrimp ceviche tostada special. It was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! Fresh avocado slices on top of freshly made ceviche. Yum. The tostada didn't even get soggy while I fussed over little man getting him to eat his cheese crisp--which was excellent again as usual. 

Husband had the red chili pork special and it was so tender and delicious. 

The service is so friendly and polite that you can't help but feel right at home.  Love it!
