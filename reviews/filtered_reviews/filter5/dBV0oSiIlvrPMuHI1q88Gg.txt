You MUST have the bacon-wrapped Jalapenos!!!!! MUST! MUST! MUST! Best service I've had in a very long time! Wish I could remember his name but it was a guy with longer black(curly-ish?) hair, serving the patio. They were unpacking a bunch of new patio chairs which makes sense(a few seconds after I had sat down, the chair I was sitting in, rocked back and I thought I was going to eat sh*t.) The service, the food, amazing! Had the Cabo Tuna Tacos as my main course.
