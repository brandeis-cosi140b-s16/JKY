Being in the area, I decided to give this place a try, Man I am not disappointed! Good food, excellent service, I cannot rave enough over this gem. I had the rib tip tacos, and some chips and guac. - not only was everything delicious, but served with a smile and very quickly. Good portion size, excellent taste and outstanding customer service make The Stand a Stand Out whenever I am in this part of town.
