I LOVE this joint!  Great food, amazing family that owns and operates it.  Bonus:  one of the few places that the entire family agrees on. I have tried numerous menu items and have loved every one. This is a small restaurant in a strip mall, but it is one of the best local Mexican restaurants around. Try their takeout some time.  Just as good as eating it there!!!
