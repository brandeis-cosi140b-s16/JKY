First time here and this places is a little different from your street taco vender/taco truck. Taco trucks typically only offer meats that cooked on a flat top. Santos does offer that and more. Santos offers the slow cooked meats that take time and special seasonings that you typically do not find at the taco truck at 3 am. The awesome staff offers a sample of the meat to try to help your selection. 

I had traditional asada, babacoa, and green chile beef. All three were excellent. The babacoa was spicy.
