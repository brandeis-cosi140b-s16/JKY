We had dinner here a few days ago. We went based on the reviews.

This is a terrific Mexican restaurant. Probably the best fajitas we've ever had. Flaming them at your table is interesting!  Keeping them war over a flame is a great idea. Incredibly fresh food. Great service. 

We will definitely eat there again when in Vegas.
