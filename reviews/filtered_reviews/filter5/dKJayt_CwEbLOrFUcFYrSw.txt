We were in Vegas for a few days in July, I have a gluten intolerance so restaurants with a dedicated gluten-free menu are a plus. We actually had two meals here on our trip. The first was Saturday lunch on our way into town. We shared an order of chips & salsa, and enjoyed a margarita sampler (3 2oz shots of margarita). My other half enjoyed the carne asada tacos and I had the gluten free chicken enchiladas. We are from California, we both grew up on Mexican food and we were both wowed. My other half loved the corn tortillas, the seasoning on the carne and the cilantro-lime rice. I loved the enchiladas, the tinga chicken was super moist and the cream sauce was perfect. Our waitress was very nice, and very attentive. We walked out planning to make our last meal here as well.

On our way home we stopped and grabbed lunch on Monday. We ordered the chips & salsa but no drinks before the long drive. He had the braised beef crispy tacos and I had the gluten free braised pork tacos. We both enjoyed our meal, and the waiter was we had was just as attentive. 

We don't get to Vegas very often, but when we do we'll be back.
