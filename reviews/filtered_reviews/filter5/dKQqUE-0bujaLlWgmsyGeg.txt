On the way home from Arizona we just had to stop here for lunch. Once again the food and service were outstanding! These tacos are something else, I don't even have words for them other than wler&j%bg=qoyve$#o%cniaeb*j/mgva. I could eat these everyday for the rest of my life. Anyway, Daniel (manager/owner) provided amazing service once again by being very friendly, providing meat samples, giving advice, and giving us a free small cup of shrimp cocktail! I found out on this visit that this is a family business and the Daniel's dad started the business in SF. The location in SF is called La Taqueria. SF is 8 hours away though, Vegas is 4 hours so this is still my closest location. But I still want to plan an SF trip since I haven't been there, now I have more reasons to go. Fingers still crossed a location in LA will happen one day! Anxious to go to here again and it's only been three days since my last visit....
