Can't live here unless you love the hell out of this place!!

But if you have any sense of what good food is, you'll love this place anyway! Shooot... okay, dang - where do I start?!?!

I love their sauce! I am a sucker for killer sauce! It's freakin' awesome! I always order extra. Their tortillas are amazing!! They'd make an O'odham grandmother proud! I never leave there without a dozen... well, whatever's left of my dozen! 

The ONLY thing that kinda caught me off guard about this place was that the last time I was there... there werent any  prices listed. There's usually hanging number signs indicating food prices, but nothing! I was scared they were going to charge me whatever they like. but the prices are crazy cheap! You've got to love it!
