P McCullough: Wow...what a cool place and the food is outstanding.  Like many other reviews...unless you are playing Inspector Clouseau, you will never find this place.  There is a sign in front that says "Additional Parking in The Rear" right above the portal in.  Happy hunting.

Bistro setting for food and bar.  Sit at the bar, it's more entertaining.  Had a couple margaritas, hand crafted and shaken (nice).  A little on the sweet side for my likening.

Food is fantastic.  They have a wood fired grill which imparts a beautiful smokey flavor to all foods that hit it.  I had the New Mexico enchiladas that were smothered in green chili. Man U felt like I was back in Santa Fe (but with better food).

Just go if you can find.  You will not be disappointed.
