Sometimes, it's hard to write a review because you have to talk about food. Right now, I am so fucking full, that I have no choice but to write this review with a full stomach, and a happy heart.

My coworker suggested this place for our Work Family Dinner, and we all obliged.

From the outside, it looks like your typical hole in the wall Mexican/Taco joint, but when you walk in, you are surrounded by a clean habitat for the most bomb-ass Mexican food ever.

I ordered one taco (cabeza...brain for you weaklings), and one quesadilla (chicken). Both were perfect.

The taco, perfectly cooked on fresh tortillas, surrounded by onions, and guac. The quesadilla was PERFECT!! Chicken that melted off the fork, and so much flavor, it was as if the chicken was born in the sauce and spices it was cooked in.

Will I come back? Hell yes. Will I feel bad about it later? Probably, but who cares. YOLO. hahaha 

Hint...be adventurous, and not a food wuss. Don't ask for things "healthy" or say eww just because the menu items have cabeza, buche or lengua. Man up, and be the adventurous person you claim you are. Otherwise....you are a poser. And no one wants to be a poser.
