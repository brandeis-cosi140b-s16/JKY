One of thee most relevant New Mexican Restaurants outside the State of New Mexico.

LDM is on par with La Posta in Las Cruces AND Rancho de Chimayo outside Sante Fe.  

We quickly settled in on a Muchaka Chimi smothered ini Red & Green (known as Christmas in NM).  The flavor of the meat was perfect....great beef flavor that was slowly simmered with red chili sauce.  The mexican pizza was excellent as were the sumptuous green chili chicken enchiladas.

I do not feel so homesick anymore.   As a side note LDM's location in Mesa has green chili stew & posole, this location did not have it on the menu.
