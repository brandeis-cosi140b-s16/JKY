Great ambiance and food as well as service were great. We came around 2pm on a weekday and were seated immediately, food was made quickly and everything was flavorful, autumn was our server and was very charismatic and polite!

We had our 9 year old with is and they had a kids menu and coloring page with crayons. 

We ordered chili soup for our daughter, lettuce wrapped tacos for my wife and I ordered the pork burrito which I asked them to make into a chimichanga! Yum

Chef Paco came out and introduced himself, just adding to the great experience we were already having. 

Note: this fine establishment is next to a gentlemen's club for those that are more conservative!

If you come here for dinner, you can stay for the show next door!
