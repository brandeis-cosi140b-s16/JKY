I am so glad I finally tired this place out. The food is very good and fresh. I ordered the 4 soft tacos each with a different meat, carnitas, grilled chicken, barbacoa, and steak.  All of the meats were very flavorful and moist. The steak was my favorite, all charcoaled on the outside and tender on the inside, delicious! My bf had the steak burrito which was also very tasty. Very good fresh homemade tortillas. 

It is set up somewhat like Chipotle, where you go down the line and tell them what you want on your order. It is great that they also have a salsa bar. Service is very fast and friendly. Lobby was clean and welcoming. The owner himself was serving the food and was very nice. Great family ran local place to grab a quick bit for not a lot of money.
