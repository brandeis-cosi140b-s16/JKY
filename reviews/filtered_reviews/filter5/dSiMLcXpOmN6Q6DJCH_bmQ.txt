This place is great. Tacos are good but burgers are better. Excellent shakes especially banana stand milk shake. Seasonal street corn is also excellent. Indoor/outdoor seating. Drive thru is slow and causes traffic issues in parking lot but food is made to order and staff is always happy to serve. Top notch
