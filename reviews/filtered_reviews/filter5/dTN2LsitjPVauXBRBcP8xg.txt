I'm already craving Dick's Hideaway...and I had it less than a week ago! 

The wait'll probably be long cuz this place is tiny, but it's so worth it. The ambience is kind of rustic but cool and the clientele is friendly, and you can always grab a drink while you're waiting. I tried the prickly pear margarita, which was just sweet enough and had a nice salty kick to it. 

You'll expend your recommended caloric intake for the month, but it's so worth it.I had a special platter that included a mushroom tamale, smoked turkey relleno, carne adovado burrito and rice and beans. It easily could've fed three, but it was so delicious that I wanted it all for myself. Each item had a wonderful spicy kick to it, and my faves were the smoked turkey relleno (a lighter take on its cheese-filled cousin, and ten times more flavorful) and the carne adovado (tender pork studding a meaty, hearty sauce). I even liked the beans...and I HATE beans! 

You'll ingest all kinds of carcinogens, but it's so worth it. I had some bites of the special mixed grill, which featured pork loin, steak and lamb chops. Each piece of meat was of good quality and was expertly prepared -- the lean yet juicy pork loin was my surprise favorite of the night. I never thought you could get an excellent burrito and excellent grilled meat in one place, but Dick's proved me wrong!

You'll start pheening for it as soon as you leave the parking lot, but it's so worth it. I would totally drive myself to LAX in traffic, buy a ticket to Phoenix, wait in the security line, sit through a flight, rent a car and drive to Dick's right now to have it for dinner...cuz it's SO WORTH IT!
