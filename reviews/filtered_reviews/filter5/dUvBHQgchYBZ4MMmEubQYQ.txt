We live across the street from Baja Joe's and really we waited two years to try it!  I'm not sure why we waited so long to try this place, but now it's our go to quick fix for nachos and margaritas.  Our first time was great, the service was quick and responsive, the food was really good.  I suggest trying the nachos with carnitas and ceviche is also tasty!  Our 6 year old daughter orders a plain hamburger every time we visit Baja's and she loves it.  I also like that they have a large patio on the side for those great spring time nights!
