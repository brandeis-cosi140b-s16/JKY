Great food,great servers. Nice indoor/outdoor concept. The patio out front is great with super comfortable patio chairs. Super busy even on week nights if they tell you it's an hour plus wait, it will be. The jalape√±o mango margaritas are great! As is the guacamole!! I had the award winning pork tacos and they were really good as well! A great experience.
