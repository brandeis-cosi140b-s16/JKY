Tacos El Gordo blew me away with their attentive staff, impossibly clean bathroom (lots of graffiti, but clean), low prices ($2 tacos), and expectation surpassing food. I had three tacos. 

Steak taco was the least good. Topped with guac and salsa, interestingly the steak was somehow very smokey tasting despite them grilling it before my eyes. Had the flavor you'd get if you threw a steak into a barbeque with wood chips. The flavor was good, but seemed out of place in a taco.

Spicy pork suffers from false advertising. Not at all spicy. The pork inhabits a vertical spinning spit usually seen at your favorite Gyro spot. It's basically a take on Chinese Char Siu (Roast Pork). They've even colored it red and have a pineapple at the top of the spit which they give a squeeze to every once in a while to keep the sweet glaze going. Quite interesting, although not as juicy as I'd like since they seem to have kept mostly lean pieces.  A shame.

The chorizo is their masterpiece. you order it and they cut a link loose and burst the insides out of the casing onto the grill followed by some sauce. I'm at a loss for words, but not appetite. 

If you want your mind blown, the only word you need to know when entering Tacos El Gordo is Chorizo.
