This place is so cozy and intimate. Came here for drinks and appetizers with friends before seeing Book of Mormon across the street at the Smith Center. 

They have this blue martini here that will knock your socks off! So good and very potent! :) The appetizers were great like the taquitos and steak quesadillas. The guacamole here that comes with chips and salsa were like whoa! I'd come here just for that alone!

I have to make a trip back soon for an entree. I highly recommend you come and check it out and make it a must stop before a show at the Smith Center. It's kinda hidden, but a hidden jewel!
