For starters...WOW! I had heard great things about Gadzooks and been wanting to try it and decided I would make today the day I stopped in for lunch. They are set up a bit like Chipotle (how you order) but I don't care for Chipotle's food.... I had looked at the menu before going so I could think about what I was going to have before getting there. I decided to have two tacos. I choose the 1/2 & 1/2 tortillas (AMAZING) and one with the green chili pork shoulder and the other modelo braised bison, jack cheese (toasted) then I put on Pico, salsa verde, crema, honey slaw and jalapeno ranch. My first bite was the pork and I thought I had died and gone to heaven! The flavors were so good and everything was extremely fresh! The portion size was perfect as well. I cannot wait to go back and try more options as they are endless.
