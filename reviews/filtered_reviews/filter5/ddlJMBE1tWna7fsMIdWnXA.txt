Wonderful food with fresh ingredients and a friendly staff make me frequent this place quite often.... I'm in a wheelchair and this place is very wheelchair friendly... This location is particularly nice because the ingredients can be seen from a low profile and I can see what I'm ordering in my burrito.. (  the location on Lake Mead however has a barrier I'm not able to look over ...but still a nice location ) 

I ordered the pulled pork burrito with Corn, Black Beans , Lime rice , cilantro and guacamole.... with a side of chips and salsa..... Nom Nom Nom... It was soooo good!! They packed a lot of stuff on the burrito...
