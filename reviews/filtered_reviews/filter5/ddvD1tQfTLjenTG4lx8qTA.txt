$2 tequila shots, $2 margaritas, $2 tacos. Since we were staying at Bally's, we stopped here several times throughout the week. Friendly service, good drinks and decent food each time we went. The tacos were actually delicious, and the queso fundido dip is great as well (don't worry, I ate them while sober once- they're actually good! Granted, even better when drunk).
