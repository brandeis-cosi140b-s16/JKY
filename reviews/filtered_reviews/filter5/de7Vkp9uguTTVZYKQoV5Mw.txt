I'm not huge on mexican food, but this place change my mind. Usually I feel like mexican food at other places just tastes ok, kinda bland with the beans and rice. We stopped in here because we were on our way to Criss Angel at the Luxor and needed dinner first, and we weren't feeling the food court. I had THE BEST pulled pork tacos I have EVER had! My mouth is still watering for them! And also, I appreciated the servers not pressuring you to drink. I know its Vegas but I feel like sometimes they really push the cocktails on you, and when all I ordered to drink was water, there was no push back, so I appreciated that. I will definitely be back next time and save room for a margarita! :)
