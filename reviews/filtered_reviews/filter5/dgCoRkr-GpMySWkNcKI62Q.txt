I stopped in Scottsdale to visit an old high school friend of mine and we decided to try Old Town Tortilla Factory. Right off the bat, the service was wonderful! The waiter was knowledgeable and knew how to sell the menu! Nice job! I ended up ordering the Carne de fuego and I added the large gulf shrimps for an extra $9. It was well worth it! The chipotle honey sauce was delicious, the stead was cooked perfectly as were the shrimps. 

The overall atmosphere was wonderful!
