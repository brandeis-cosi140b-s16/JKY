Who says there's no culture in Vegas? Been coming here forever and if you think Benihana and all you can eat Brazilian steak is culture, you need to get your gordo   trasero ( fat butt) down to the TEG! You'll feel  like you died and went to Mexico, only they speak english and are not trying to rip you off, just feed you most authentic taco you will find in Nevada. All at the taco  $ 2  store- simple menu, all for one low price, how nice is that? The 5 stars are for bein' real, the food is more like  a 4.
This place is seriously off the hook, as far as a basic taco joint goes. What you see is what you get, BYOB as well. The menu consist of essentially 2 things, meat and meat. Pork in a few versions , the Abodaba is killer,nothing like it anywhere I've eaten- plus the usual body parts cabeza ( brain) lengua ( tongue)  Buche  ( pork stomach) and asada, you can top off your asada with some silky nopal (cactus) all wrapped in their handmade tortillas.Tacos are very simple  meat, onions, guac, hot sauce and a white sauce I can't place that smooths the whole thing over sprinkled with a little cilantro. No beans at all. Be sure to try the different windows, one for pork the other beef. It's a bit of a pain, especially if busy, tag team it with  pals if so.
The attire and clientele   is all over the map ...tattooed chicas in heels and sparkle, hombres with cowboy boots, families with kids, dates, teens on skateboards, toasted college and other kids in town, locals and outta town tourista latinos of every sort..it's all here, under the red tent out front, sitting down at the stainless steel booths. Self serve order at the window, get your grub and pay before leaving. Right on the strip, next to the entrance to the Encore. Step right up amigo.
