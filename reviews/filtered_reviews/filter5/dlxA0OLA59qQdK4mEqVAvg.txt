I was in Phoenix on a business trip and wanted Mexican food. What I enjoyed was beyond belief. Who knew chicken could taste so good. Very interesting favor profile and textures, excellent service, really interesting art (both exterior and interior)  and a chief. Who is both talented and modest. This is NOT your standard street Mexican food. This is solid cooking, fresh ingredients and no pretense. Go there and enjoy.
