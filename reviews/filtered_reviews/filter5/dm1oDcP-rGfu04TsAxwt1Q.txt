This place...such a perfect little neighborhood spot! The menu is simple yet everything is amazing! The hand spun shakes are so like something you remember from your childhood and the fries are just yummmmmmm! The burgers are hot fresh and made to order! The atmosphere is adorable and the staff is super friendly!
