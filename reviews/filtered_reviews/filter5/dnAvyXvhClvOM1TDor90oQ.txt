I've been wanting to try this place out for a while, and it ended up beyond worth the wait! The atmosphere is great, all kinds of random/funny things on the walls and around the bar area. They have Mariachi's sometimes, girls with shot bandelos, and handful of flat panel tvs. The staff was very friendly and made us feel like we were regulars. The chips and salsa were on par with Lindo Michocahn's, and the Original Margarita could be the best I've had in Vegas. For food, I had the Beef Tongue (Lengua) Burrito with Green Sauce, and it was extremely delicious. It is a good size portion so I had the last 1/4th the next day reheated and it was still good! The lobster tacos will prolly be my next endeavor there.
