I recently moved from Cali and was looking for some bomb Mexican food. I definitely found it here. The whole family was pleased. They give you chips, salsa and beans as soon as you sit down. Than they bring you tomato Fidel soup. Oh my so yummy. The customer service here is off the chart. all the way around.
