Not sure how to follow Julie P.'s epic review, but I thought I'd show some support.

La Condesa is a fantastic addition to Central Phoenix. Casual, nice people, amazing food.

Like other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.

The salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.

Bonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. 

Great place -- a gem.
