First time here and I have to admit I fell in love! Ended up coming here after our first choice for a valentines day dinner had over an hour wait. Best decision ever! Everything I ordered tasted amazing and my boyfriend enjoyed his food just as much. Service is very good and I love the casual atmosphere. I ended up ordering a frozen hibiscus marg, the carne asada tacos, and substituted the size for the posole. Delicious! The boyfriend had the red chile enchiladas with chicken and pork for the meat. He prefers the pork hands down. 

Would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I will be coming back soon!
