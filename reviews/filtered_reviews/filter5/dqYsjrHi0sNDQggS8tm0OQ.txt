Great Place! The food was like a fine restaurant in Taos! I had the Taos Combo Honey Smoked Pork Tamale, Tenderloin Relleno & Shrimp Enchilada for 16.95. Awesome! Rustic and tasty! They server was very good! We went to the Roaring Fork the night before and the food was not that good and cost 2 times more than B/A and I was treated to an undercooked piece of chicken! :oP Go if you have the chance! Don't forget the Sopapillas! We had 10 people and the service was great.
 As for the one star ratings. You can't drop a single star rating an then say the food is great. To me 90% of a rating is the food. Scottsdale location was Awesome as well! went there 2 nights in a row. Places have off nights it happens. If you say the food was great but you will never go again seems like your a bit high maintenance. Get over it!
