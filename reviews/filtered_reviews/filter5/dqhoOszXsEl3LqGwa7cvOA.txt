I always get the steak salad here, it's so flavorful. Try it with the vinaigrette! Me and my friend came in half and hour before they closed on a Tuesday and Edwin was the absolute NICEST employee we've ever experienced. We usually just came for the food because most of the time the service was sub par but Edwin made us feel welcome, appreciated, and made sure we were happy with our meals!
