The new ownership at Secreto's has changed this place to a great place to eat or grab a drink.  Almost every item on the menu is Gluten Free and service is outstanding!!

I am a regular and crave the Street tacos and elephant garlic on a regular basis.  Thrilled that they brought back their Sunday brunch!!!
