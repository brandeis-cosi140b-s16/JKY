it's about time I got around to this place. it was so worth the trip! my other half decided tacos were the best choice for a quick lunch spot.

the atmosphere is pretty casual, and i like how open it is as far as seating. not congested like most taco places. I could not get over how amazing the pork looked. it was so incredibly juicy, you could watch it sweat those juices into the pan. after seeing that, I didn't even consider ordering anything else cause it looked so good. 

my other half ordered chicken and Carne asada tacos which looked great as well. it was so pleasing to know these tacos tasted as delicious as they looked. the one amenity to this place that I enjoyed the most was the lime and salsa bar. ample amounts of choices, for different salsa heats and flavors. there's also the pickled carrots, onions and peppers, the beans, and even saut√©ed vegetables. so worth it! pick up a box of chips and go in on those salsas! 

they also serve alcohol and have a bar area. there's even beers on tap. taco y taco, you're definitely winning.
