What a great meal!  If you are willing to try something a bit different I highly recommend this restaurant. The service is on point, the staff is polite and the food is flavorful. Very interesting having Chinese and Mexican in the same meal but very enjoyable. The tuna ceviche is perfect and a must order. The vegetable fried rice is incredible and I could not stop eating it. If you are lucky and ask for a special margarita there is a Cucumber Serrano Margarita that is probably the best margarita that I have ever had. Be nice to your waiter or waitress because it is not a menu. Lastly if you only get one item you must order When Pigs Fly... You will thank me later!
