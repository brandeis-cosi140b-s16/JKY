I love seeing shows here! Hands down it's the best places to see a band in Phoenix. 

What's so great about Crescent? First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.

As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.

Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items. Last time we played we won a lucha libre action figure- score!
