ur original message to Se√±or Frog's:
I want to rate Tracy 5 big stars*****! She was handling the shots last Friday and really made my night. This young lady should be valued as a personable and genuine employee. She is a real nugget and a positive influence for your business. Don't know when we'll be in Vegas again, but I have a knew standard for a waitress and Tracy is it! I hope you share this message with her as these days, it seems, people dwell on the negative. Steve Lopez
