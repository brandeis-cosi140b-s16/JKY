This is a special place to eat.  We love the decor.  The food and service were excellent.

Highly recommended is the chili relleno burro.  Wow.  So tasty.  The street tacos were amazing. The homemade chips were light and crisp.  Salsa was spicy and tantalizing.  Made you crave more.  The Mexican cerviche was served in a wine goblet.  A generous portion with a perfect degree of heat.  

There is live music on Friday.  This is a place to have real Mexican food, not Tex-Mex.
