Party of three for a casual business lunch and the food was fantastic.  The ribs, the red chili and the tacos were a hit.  The flavored were very original and prepared perfectly.  Probably wouldn't come here for anything formal, but our service was good and the servers were attentive.  Coming back again - soon!
