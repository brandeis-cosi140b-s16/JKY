Great service, delectable food, awesome atmosphere... What more can a girl say?  Venture to the basement -via a gorgeous stone-framed stairwell or the semi-sketchy elevator- for a cozy cabin feel and be sure to check out their specials (on the chalkboard)!  I dined there with a group of four on a Friday night and my entree came out later than the others, so our Server ended up comping our dessert, which was both unexpected and extremely accommodating. 

Get creative, because the Rokerij boasts a full bar, but no Cocktail List; or simply go for a glass of vino.  For a filling and mouth-watering entree, try the Rokerij Steak, Chimoy Chicken, or Red Chile Pasta.  Got a sweet tooth?  The Creme Brûlée is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.  I pinky swear that this place is unlike any other Valley eatery...  Foodies, ASU students, and even Snobsdale peeps unite!  This is the place for you!
