I absolutely love this place, best lunch spot! It is probably the closest thing i have found to good homemade Mexican food. My favorite would be their green and bean burro mix! It has delicious mild green chili and juicy tender meat inside.

It seems like a lot of reviewers don't like how runny the burritos can get. Which they can be but it doesn't take away from the deliciousness. Just save the extra juices for your rice or get a side of chips to scoop up that gooey goodness.
