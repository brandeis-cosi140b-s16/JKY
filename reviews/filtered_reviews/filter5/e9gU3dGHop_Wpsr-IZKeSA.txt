I had tried Casa Ramos' salsas at a Yelp event a few years ago and meant to make it to the restaurant, but never did. Tonight (a Saturday), we finally made it there, arriving around 4:45PM. On a street where it seems like about half the restaurants are shut down, the parking lot was already starting to fill up at Casa Ramos. We were sat immediately and started with their complimentary chips and red salsa. We asked for some of their hot (green) salsa but they had run out. Nevertheless, some green salsa arrived at our table within 10 minutes.  

I had the Carne Asada plate. The portion size was quite large and included skirt steak,  three tortillas (choice of flour or corn), guacamole, refried beans and rice. The meat was well-seasoned and absolutely delicious. The guacamole was fresh in the beans were also quite good. I don't really eat Mexican rice so I can't really comment on how good that was.

Overall, I highly recommend Casa Ramos and their carne asada.  Our service was solid and the value for the money is excellent. I will try to find my way back here as soon as possible when I'm on the side of town
