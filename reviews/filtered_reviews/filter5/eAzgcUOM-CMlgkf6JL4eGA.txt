If you go to Taliesin West, or are just looking for a great Mexican restaurant, go here!  Unlike the Blue Adobe in Mesa, this is the original -- with the original chef, and the food and service is awesome! The tamales, pulled pork, and especially the stuffed peppers are to die for.  I ate there yesterday afternoon, and I a still stuffed!  My brother from Virginia Beach recommended this place, and he was spot on!
