What an excellent lunch I had here! Rand H. organized a little UYE for this place with Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B. and myself. The establishment is in a rather cramped commercial strip but the restaurant itself is quite roomy, although it doesn't look it at first when you enter. I ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche I've ever had -- I would come here just for this! For my entree, I had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and Mexican cheese. I also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly. Great food, great prices, and great service even when the place is busy - no wonder this place is so popular.
