My Husband and I love this place. We usually split the special with a side of rice and beans. I love the Mexi Mahi Burrito as well. They give you plenty of chips and salsa and the service is generally pretty good. Some servers are better than others. Wouldn't recommend this place for a large group of people who want to carry on discussion throughout dinner because it is a bit loud.
