What a fabulous atmosphere - sophisticated, but casual enough for the visitor from out of town to walk off the street and enjoy a fabulous dining experience. We tried 3 varieties of tacos (served in a unique and intriguing manner) while we enjoyed primo cocktails at the bar area. It was the perfect setting! Warm and inviting, the service was attentive and professional. "Cheers" to The Mission!
