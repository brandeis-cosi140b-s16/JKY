Ever since Pure closed down in downtown Matthews, I have been searching for a replacement margarita spot.  This may be "the one."  Sadly this corner spot on Kenilworth and East Blvd has been occupied by many bars... and for some reason they seem to go away... maybe it's the parking situation?  Or something else, but I hope Bakersfield is here to stay for a while.

I love the space... lots to look at from the interesting wood textures and industrial looking light figures.  The HUGE windows that they can open up to the street and really have a great vibe going on inside.

The bar itself occupies the whole middle space of the restaurant and whiskey - though I have not partaken in any yet (I'm still sold on the margaritas) occupies some nice shelf/display space behind the bar.  There are booths and tables... some tables consist of some unique barrels which is a plus.  Definitely adds to the "western" (loosely using the term here) theme.  There are TV's here, but they don't play sports... they play old westerns.  Which is definitely different.

Probably the best part of the place (aside from the alcohol) is the food.  Tacos!  They are not your typical taco place, but the food they make here is very yummy - and pretty to look at.  My favorite is the short rib.  Combine that with some margaritas, and you got a great night ahead of  you.  Oh- did I mention that the bar has an old school juicer (handle and all) so they use fresh squeezed limes to make the margaritas!  So good.  Sometimes I do feel for the juicer guy... people (like me) order pitcher upon pitcher and he just keeps squeezing away.  At least he won't have to go to crossfit in the mornings after my friends and I visit. ;)
