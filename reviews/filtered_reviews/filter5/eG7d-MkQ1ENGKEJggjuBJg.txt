First time going to Crescent and really enjoyed the smaller venue. The artists interacted great with the crowd. The drinks were reasonably priced with quick service. Seating for those who don't want to stand but everyone has a view. Come early and grab some food on the front patio or inside. Overall a fun experience and will definitely be coming back, can't believe I waited so long to show up.
