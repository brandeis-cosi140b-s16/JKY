If you want authentic, delicious mexican food, look no further! 
As a central California native, I am extremely spoiled with my mexican food. After moving to vegas and trying numerous places, I finally came here to see if this would finally satisfy my need for "real" mexican food. 
To say I was impressed is an understatement. They are always packed, but the waits are never too long, and the overall experience is worth the wait. 
Their chips, salsa and bean dip are perfect. Their servers and wait staff are attentive and great at their jobs. 
The food, to die for. They have an extensive menu that leaves nothing out. The shrimp cocktail is delightful, the guacamole, which they prepare table side, is impeccable, and their entrees on point. 
Jordan loves the filet rellano,  which is orange roughy stuffed with seafood and battered accompanied with beans and rice. I favor the fajitas and the veggie enchiladas. You can't go wrong!!!
