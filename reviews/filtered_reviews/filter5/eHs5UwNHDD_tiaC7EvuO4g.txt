Best date night while in town. Amazing prices and even better food! Service was outstanding and the staff super-friendly. Margaritas were great, peel and eat shrimp were outstanding and the oysters with the atomic uber-good horseradish and beer battered fish tacos left us wanting more. Whenever we visit Gilbert we'll come visit!
