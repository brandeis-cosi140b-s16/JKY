We drive 20 miles just for the Taco Salad! So many Tequilas you could spend days! But the most important thing about this Uptown Charlotte Restaurant is the Customer Service. Mary, the Manager here at Vida, has blown us away with her consistent, positive, personal, and attentive attitude each and EVERY time we come in. She needs to manage so many other restaurants in this city to positively turn them into better experiences. Thank you Mary for always providing us with an excellent experience here at Vida!!!!
