After living in San Diego for 15 years, I will say that The Mission in Scottsdale has the best Mexican food I've had.  They have a roving guacamole cart...ORDER THE GUACAMOLE!  Someone will mix it up right in front of you, and it is so good that I did not stop eating it, even as the waitress was kindly going over the menu at our request...munch, munch, munch.

Please also order the Malbec-braised short rib tacos.  They put one slice of dill pickle in, and coupled with amazing sauce and the meat, your tastebuds will be in absolute Heaven.  Provided you can stop eating the guacamole long enough to enjoy anything else.
