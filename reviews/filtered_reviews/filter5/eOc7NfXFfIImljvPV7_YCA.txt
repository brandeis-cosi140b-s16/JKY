Hands down, best Sonoran Mexican food you're going to find in Phoenix.  My family has been going there since before I was born and I love that it hasn't changed a bit.  Their salsa is absolutely perfect, from the heat to the squeeze bottle, there's nowhere better.  We go at least 2 or 3 times a month and will never get tired of Los Compadres.
