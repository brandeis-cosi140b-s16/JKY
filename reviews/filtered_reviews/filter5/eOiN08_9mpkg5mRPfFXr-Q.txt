I had a few hours to kill before my evening flight and was already at the Luxor and I love Mexican food so I decided to eat here. OMG. The chips were thick and fresh, not the standard bag of tortilla chips most places just dump into a bowl. The salsa? OMG. best I have ever had. You get red and green and both were just amazing!! Lots of flavor but not too much heat. Perfect. I had the chicken quesadillas. Delicious! I had the strawberry agave Margarita and that didn't disappoint either! The bartender was very friendly, I got my food in a timely fashion and it was reasonably priced. I will definitely be back to eat here even though it is at the ends of the strip I usually don't go to. Worth the walk our taxi ride!!!
