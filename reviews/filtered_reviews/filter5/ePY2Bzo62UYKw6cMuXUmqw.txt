I've lived in Tempe for about five years, and if you asked me what my favorite restaurant is, I would say The Mission.  If I were to try and pin down the reason for my favorable opinion, it would be something about the entire dining experience.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the actual restaurant is an old church.  At least on the outside.  It always feels like a party is happening on the inside.  Indoor and outdoor tables are available.  There is a vast array of margaritas, most come with actual lime juice, and other sundry drinks.    The dinner menu also boasts a myriad of options.  The food is always great.  I'm always trying to decide between several drinks and several entrees.  Although, I usually order several drinks.  The ambiance is festive and loud with dim lighting.  If you want a quieter dining experience, come during the day light hours.  Often, my daughter accompanies us.  There is free parking near by, and a variety of after dinner locations within easy walking distance, such as ice cream parlors.
