I am rarely on the Strip so I usually get tacos at their E. Charleston location. Nonetheless, on the remote chance that I have been drinking on the Strip, this is the place to come to soak up the alcohol. The only downside is that there will be a hundred more drunken people (likely more drunk than you btw). 

Each time I come here I find that they've taken over more space, pretty damn impressive.  I come here and order one thing only, the tacos al pastor. They are the bomb, seriously. Order six, you'll thank me later.
