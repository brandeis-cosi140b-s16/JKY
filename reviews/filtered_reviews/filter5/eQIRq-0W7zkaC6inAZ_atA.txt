Being near my office, we frequent this place for lunch. 

Service: outstanding. Always fast and friendly, with bottomless chips and salsa that actually get refilled.

Food: the food is standard Mexican fare, done simple and well. While you won't find anything truly amazing, everything I've tried has been delicious, well thought out, and ready quickly.

Value: this is where they truly shine. The prices are unbeatable for what you get, and the daily special gets you out the door for about $6, without leaving you hungry. Try whatever is on special that day if you aren't sure, and chances are you'll be pleased.
