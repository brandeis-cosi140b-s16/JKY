I'm such a picky eater, so its hard for me to find a place that has a great selection of food that I actually eat!

The atmosphere of the whole restaurant is very nice, I really like the decor! Their new menus look awesome too, very fancy!

Also love that no matter how much food I eat, the healthy food doesn't make me feel bloated or greasy afterwards. 

They are a new restaurant, however, so have a lot to learn. But their food is great, waiters/waitresses are friendly, and overall nice atmosphere!
