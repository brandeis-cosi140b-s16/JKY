Randomly went in here with my dad for a quick bite to eat. The girl who served us was great. Great personality and made sure we were happy. Margaritas were tasty. Even the other staff took great care. Wish I could mention names Tacos were delicious. Five star experience all in all. Glad we popped in. Completely unexpected and delighted.
