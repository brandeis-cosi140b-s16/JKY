Have you ever just randomly gone to a place for lunch and it is amazing?  Just popped in with a couple people had had your socks blown off?  Well that definitely happened to me here.  My wife, and old high school friend, and I stopped by for lunch here after my wife had gotten here braces put on.  The portion sizes are smaller (but don't worry the price reflects this) so we were able to get a few different things and sample a bunch of stuff.

By the time it was all over I had some molotes, a tamale, the fish taco, and i think the memalita with al pastor.  The molotes are fantastic, it's kind of like a Mexican potato fritter.  Crunchy and delicious outside and the middle is fluffy and tasty.  The memalita is like a tostada but made with a sopa instead of just a regular tortilla.  The fish taco was perfect.  I don't really like fish, but the owner insisted I give it a try and I'm very glad he did.  It was by far, one of the best things I've put in my mouth.  To put it simply everything that I had was great.  And not just, "that was a good meal" great, everything was tasting perfect had great texture and the owner answered any questions I had about the food.  I tried the horchata that my friend had, and usually I hate them, but this one was awesome.  I think it had almonds and cantaloupe in it but i'm not sure, either way it was out of sight. 

If you are in the mood for some perfect Mexican food and want to try something just a little bit different head on down and get some amazing food.
