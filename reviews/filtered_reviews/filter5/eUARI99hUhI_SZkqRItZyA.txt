First let me start by saying I love the Taco Guild!!! My boyfriend and I went to Taco Guild last night for the first time, and it was incredible!  The decor of this place is unlike anything I have seen in Phoenix ever, and I've been here my whole life.  This place is housed in an old church and is nothing short of beautiful.

We sat down at the bar and were promptly greeted by Kristin. She was awesome!!  She was incredibly helpful with helping us choose food and cocktails!  For drinks I ordered The Blushing Senorita, which consists of Coppola Rossa, Hanger One berry vodka, fresh raspberries, blueberries and blackberries and my boyfriend ordered The Myth.  All I can say is Hallelujah! If you want the best hand made cocktail in town, sit at the bar at Taco Guild and ask for Kristin! She's definitely been studying her cocktail bible.

For Food, Kristin helped us decide what to order since we had never been there before.  We ended up ordering The Guild Duo to start and it was amazing! Awesome Guacamole and Fire Roasted Chile Queso that holds the key to my heart.  For dinner, I ordered the Molida Lamb Taco and the Cherry Steak Taco upon recommendation from Kristin.  My Boyfriend ordered the Thai Snapper Taco and the Peking Duck Taco.  These tacos were the best tacos we both have ever had! I have an addiction now and its for Taco Guild Tacos.

If you want THE BEST TACOS, COCKTAILS, AND BARTENDER, then go to Taco Guild and sit at the bar and ask for KRISTIN!!!  She gives impeccable service!!
