Best burros, ever! Had the green chili burro, enchilada style with green sauce and the bean burro enchilada style with red sauce. AWESOME. The family vibe was even better! Marissa, is very welcoming and kind.! It will be my weekly stop! I'm serious! The Munoz family has proven how good they are by their success of Rito's in Central Phoenix. We are so lucky they have brought their good stuff to the west valley!
