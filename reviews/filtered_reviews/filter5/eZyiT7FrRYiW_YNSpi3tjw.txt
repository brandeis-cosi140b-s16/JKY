We just tried this place for the first time today and we loved it! The chips, salsa and queso were great. We tried the cherry beef, lamb and shrimp tacos. All were amazing, but the cherry beef is the best! (Lamb is a close second!) Give this place a try and forget about all the lower ratings who care more about the music than the food.
