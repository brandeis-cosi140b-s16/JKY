I would describe SumoMayo as an adventurous Asian Mexican Fusion experience. We especially loved the Crispy Chicken Mole which included plantains and a flavorful mole sauce. The bacon guacamole was made with pork belly that added the perfect texture to make it interesting. My personal favorite was the Apple Salmon sumo roll which had the perfect blend of spices that elevated the sushi to levels completely unexpected.
