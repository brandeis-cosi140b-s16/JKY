I generally rate mexican food by the taste of their beans and rice, but everything I have had there is exellent.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and yes, terrific beans and rice.  Combine that with rich historical background and freindly attentive service and you have a top notch resaurant in the west valley.  

BTW, the margaritas are the bomb.
