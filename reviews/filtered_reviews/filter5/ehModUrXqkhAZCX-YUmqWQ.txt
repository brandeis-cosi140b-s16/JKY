I really loved the food here.  In a city where virtually all of the Mexican restaurants menu seems to either be the same old "combo platter" or they consist only of tacos, this is a huge breath of fresh air.  LOVE the Owner and Chef, Doug
All four meals were GREAT!!!  I found California Sea Bass, a delicious ocean fish that you can only find in California as far as I know, and the torta was perfectly layered, and had a wonderfull wood fired smell!!  The tacos were just as good.  The Mexican Paella was completely original, and Full of flavor!!
The only thing I think could be improved is how difficult it is to see this place from the street (at least for us).  Maybe add a larger 2nd sign?
Still, a FIVE STAR food experience!  Also, the service was really great this time!!
They also have FLAMENCO night !!!
