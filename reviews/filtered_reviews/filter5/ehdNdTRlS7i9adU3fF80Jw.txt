EPIC TUNA BURRITO.

The name says it all.  But, if you must hear a few more to back up the claim, here are a few: GRILLED YELLOW FIN TUNA WRAPPED WITH BLACK BEANS, RICE, AVOCADO, ROASTED RED PEPPERS MIXED CHEESES & OUR WHITE CILANTRO SAUCE.

Hubs and I visited this past weekend  for lunch while seeing friends that live in Charlotte.  They suggested this location as a great place for us to see the art district while having some good options for us all (three omnivores and one mostly-pescatarian)

The chips brought out were okay, but the salsa was really good, as well as the guacamole we ordered for the table.  We were seated at the big booth in the front, so it was cool to hear the bustle of the restaurant, but still quiet enough to have some good convo.

We all loved the food - me especially!   But the portions are SOOO big.  I ate just half and hubs happily finished mine after he ate his BBQ mahi tacos which he loved as well.  

BIG BIG YUM!
