Loved this place. I had a meeting in the conference rooms at Mandalay Bay. There was a quick break between sessions and so I ran and got some food from this place. It was a little further away from the conference rooms since it was on the upstairs portion. But it was worth the run. I ordered to-go at the bar. The bartender was great, he put the order in quickly for me. I was ordering for myself and others so I asked for a lot of salsa and he got two huge containers that he filled for me. This was convenient to carry in the bag without spilling. The food came out within 10 minutes and was very good. The green salsa was delicious-don't forget to ask for some. 

The pricing was actually pretty good too in comparison to everything else around there. The taco plates came with three tacos, rice and beans. They're $14 and very filling. Most of the other places I ate at in Mandalay were closer to $25 and were often less filling.
