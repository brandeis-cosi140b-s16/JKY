No but seriously, I love this place.

$3 House Margaritas. 
Queso Dip with chips.

These are really the only two things I need to be happy. 

But if I'm feeling like cheese and tequila aren't enough for a full meal (wait, it isn't?) they also have amazing tacos, brunch, appetizers, beer, mixed drinks and whatever else their awesome chefs and bartenders come up with. The cool thing is they are constantly reinventing the menu and trying out new things. 

Want live music on the weekend while sitting on a shaded patio? Yeah, they've got that.

Want cool a cool space to chill during First Friday? They've got that too.

Highly, highly recommended.
