Who doesn't like a plate of mouth watering nachos? Lets just say that I'm a HUGE nacho advocate and for some reason, even living in the South West part of the country it can be a challenging task for most restaurant owners to accomplish.. 

Not for Cafe Rio! Fresh meat (chicken is my preference), fresh corn tortilla chips, hand fulls of cheese, fresh guacamole, beans, and salsa equals a quick tap dance of happiness from me!

I sank my teeth into and wrapped my lips around some mighty tasty tortilla chips this afternoon on my lunch break. I must say my tin of nachos were by far the highlight of my day here at the sweat-shop.

The chicken tacos at Cafe Rio are equally delicious, especially since they are created within fresh (made before your eyes) tortillas. 

My only *ugh* moment at this joint is when I get the lady that speaks faster than the speed of light and screws up my order by putting pico de gallo (chunky salsa) on my food instead of the medium, more blended salsa. Sounds minor but you'd be surprised at how a few extra tomatoes and the additional energy removing them from my dish can ruin my food mojo. Slow down lady! Speedy Spanglish equals messed up food orders, and crabby customers..just sayin.

It's worth the wait in line and the drama (sometimes) to park so if you're in the mood for extremely fresh and always delicious Mexican food, give Cafe Rio a whirl!
