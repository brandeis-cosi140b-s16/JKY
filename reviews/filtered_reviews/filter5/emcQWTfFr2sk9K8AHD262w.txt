I had to do an update on my favorite taco spot in Vegas because of the competition that is popping up in the valley. This is my go-to spot whenever I have that taco jones a-brewing. I absolutely heart this place! I never leave here with a sad face. Why? Because their TACO ADOBADAS are the SHIZZNIT SUN!!! 

There are a bunch of things on the menu, but for me, the taco adobadas are the only things I will usually order. This establishment so far is the only restaurant that serves their adobada tacos (marinated pork) Mexican Street Vendor Style. The adobadas are put onto a vertical roaster and spins continuously to keep an even roast. They're then trimmed from the spit and served on a corn tortilla. IT'S SO GANGSTER!!!

The makings that they put on it are good. They'll ask if you want everything. Everything means onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. You can also opt for slices of pineapple to top your tacos. The slices of pineapple will give your tacos a sour sweetness which is a plus. I do wish that their hot sauce was A TAD BIT SPICIER. I think they need to up their game in that matter. Their hot sauce may not be that spicy, but they do offer free grilled spicy peppers that you can enjoy with your meal. Definitely ask for the grilled peppers. 

For some reason I think the East Charleston location tastes better than the one on the strip. Maybe I'm tripping. I also like the fact that you're in a restaurant where they give you a place to sit and have fountain drinks that you can refill. Orange Bang All Day!!! 

There is great competition out there with some of the street vendors popping up in the valley, which is a really great thing. I've had tacos at these other street vendors that easily gives Tacos El Gordo a run for their money. All in all, Tacos El Gordo is still my favorite. Great service, great food, and a great atmosphere to stuff your face in.

EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
