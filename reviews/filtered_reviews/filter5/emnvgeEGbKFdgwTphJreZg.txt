This has to be one of the most authentic Mexican cuisine I have had in a long time.  This Garcias is kind of in a ghetto area, so if you drive a BMW like myself, I would do a quick take out and leave the area.  I went in my friend's pickup truck, so we were safe from damage.  Regardless of the location, I felt very warming inside the restaurant.  I feel a very old pueblo atmosphere inside the restaurant.  The waitress explained the slow meat cooking preparation process of some of their dishes, and explanations made my mouth water.  I make a lot of determination of Mexican restaurants by the flavor and spice level of the salsa, and its to die for!  I got chicken enchiladas and my friend got a red chili burro.  To complement my meal, I had a strawberry daquiri-like margarita.  I felt like I was in heaven!
