I seriously don't get why this restaurant doesn't have more stars. This is easily one of the best Mexican food I've ever had. This place is soooo good! 

The ambience was perfect and decor was lovely as expected since it's in the Venetian. I thought it was gonna be just your average Mexican restaurant but it was so much more than that! 

I had the cheese enchiladas with cilantro rice and I can't even begin to say how delicious it was! It was too perfect for words. 

I've had cilantro rice at a few other restaurants after that but it's nothing compared to this place! The portions are big enough to where you can have leftovers to savor for a late night snack! 

A little pricy, I'll admit but well worth it! To this day I'm still raving about my amazing dining experience at this place! I'm definitely coming back the next time in Vegas!
