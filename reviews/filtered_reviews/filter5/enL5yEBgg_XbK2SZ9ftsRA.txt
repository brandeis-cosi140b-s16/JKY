This place never seems to disappoint... If you are a pork lover the carnitas are a MUST! I like to order the  carnitas junior burrito because it is a perfect combo of pork beans and cheese.... The carne asada taco with everything is pretty hard to beat too! Today we tried the carnitas quesadilla for the first time and I think we found another favorite! This place is a must try!!
