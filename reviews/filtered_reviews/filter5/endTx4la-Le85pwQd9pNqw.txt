It was funny how I found this place, walking in the Cosmopolitan seeing signs for Chinese and Mexican food.  Thinking it was 2 different restaurants I was intrigued.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I navigated through the menu and tried several items.  I fell in love with mole fries, just order the mole on the side.  The mole is authentic and my taste buds enjoyed savoring all the flavors.
