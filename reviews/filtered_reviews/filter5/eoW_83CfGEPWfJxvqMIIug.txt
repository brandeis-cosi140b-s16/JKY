I met a buddy here for dinner last night. Here is the lowdown:

Location: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5

Don't miss the cornbread, it's fantastic. We started out by splitting a bowl of chips and salsa. The salsa is fresh and very good. The chips were crunchy and not too salty. I had the green chili enchilada with black beans. Not normally a big black bean fan I was surprised how good these can taste when they are very fresh and well prepared. The rice was nice and fluffy and delicious. The waiter was cheerful and helpful with suggestions. The service was very prompt without hovering over us - not an easy balance to strike. 

A nice bonus is that they will valet your car for free. Just get your ticket validated by your server. The location is right off Mill Ave. so you are right in the heart of the action. The prices are very reasonable as well. Most of the entrees are $10-15. This place is great, give it a try.
