Authentic Mexican Diner. Service and personnel very friendly. Fast service with great food. Had the Parillida for 2. Lots of foods for 2. Chips and Salsa was good. Didn't know we went during happy hour and draft beers were $2.99. Total bill with tip $30. Worth every penny. Will be back when we are in town.
