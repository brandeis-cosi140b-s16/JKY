This is a nice gem in the middle of Mill. The wait staff is always friendly and knowledgable. With all the hecticness that surrounds Mill ave this is a quiet place to chill with friends. They serve food until the wee hours of the morning, and is quite delicious.  The beer on tap is a relatively inexpensive for the size of glass you receive. There is plenty of seating both inside and out. The ambiance reminds me of a local mom and pop place where you always feel welcome and at home...without the family arguments ;)
