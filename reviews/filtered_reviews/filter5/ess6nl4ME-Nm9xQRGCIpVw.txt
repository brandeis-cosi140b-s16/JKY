We have been here a few times now and every time we go we enjoy it. 

The menu is huge (almost too many choices). We've had the shrimp fajitas, chicken quesadilla, burrito, and chimichanga....all were delicious. 

Their margaritas are also very good. 

The atmosphere is fun, and the service is always good.
