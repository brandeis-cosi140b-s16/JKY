Words cannot even begin to express how thankful I am for everything you did for me today. My birthday happy hour was a HUGE success thanks to the wonderful staff at Sol Cocina.  Sharon, thank you so much for making sure me and my guest had plenty of places to sit and mingle. That area was PERFECT! Lorena, girl you took care of about 40 people in a 3+ hour time frame! You ROCKED! Thank you so much. Josh, OMG Josh! Thank you so much for putting up my "rowdy" group LOL!  Seriously, your entire team welcomed me with open arms and everyone had a great time. The food and the drinks, OMG the drinks!! Thank you to Sol Cocina for keeping the Farmers Market-Strawberry-Kiwi Margarita on the menu for me for that extra day. It was DELICIOUS!! ( I stopped at two but I really wanted three) Up next... Taco Tuesday anyone? :)
