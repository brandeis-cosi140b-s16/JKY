This was really great food and drinks. We had margaritas that were made with fresh lime juice, great street tacos and really great tasting salsa. Two people shared the order of 3 tacos which came with rice and beans and also chips amd salsa.   We had the ribeye tacos, carnitas and seasoned fish. Great meal, better yet on taco Tuesday. Check this  place out. Also sit upstairs on patio, it's less crowded.
