Seriously the BEST guacamole I've ever eaten! and fantastic carnitas cooked RIGHT! I rate it as good as it gets FOR IT'S CATEGORY! Meaning, if you are looking for FANTASTIC food, that is real, for good prices and GREAT service, this is the place! If you want real plates, umbrellas in your margaritas and fancy whatever, then find somewhere else to waste money! The owner was incredibly friendly, came around making sure we were enjoying our food multiple times (and we got there 20 minutes BEFORE they closed-he even made FRESH guacamole for us! WHO does that!?!?!?). The server was very friendly, never once did we feel like "it's almost closing time". We ate at Cantina Laredo the night before, and both my husband and I RAVED about Habanero's to our hotel and business center where we were attending meetings! Can't wait to go back!!! Found them via Google search BTW.
