I absolutely love this place. Best Mexican food in CU hands down. I order the chips an guacamole to start, and then the chicken fajitas as an entree. The portions are huge and I had enough for 2 meals. The food was so satisfying and delicious. My boyfriend and I got lucky and actually got a seat at the window, but I always carry out. Their horhata is also very delicious, I come here all the time.
