I love mole. I mean, I COVET mole and when I see it on a menu I get it. I've eaten mole in probably 30 restaurants all over the country and this is the most luscious, complex, transporting recipe I've had. Perfectly balanced with a sophisticated exoticness and just the right amount of heat. Chicken was juicy. Mom had fish tacos, just fabulous. As everyone says, definitely get the guacamole, the addition of the pomegranate seeds makes a perfect balance with the tangy avocado and crispy, fresh chips, just droolworthy. Try one of the tequilas neat, they have so many varieties, I especially love Herradura Anejo which you don't find a lot. Service is usually quite good, the servers are knowledgeable and if they're not slammed will be happy to give recommendations. When its really busy they can be a little slow. 

Yes, its pricey. Yes, you'll probably have to wait a looooooong time for a table (weekend dinner - fugedaboudit)  and there are few places to sit while you do so make sure grandma has her cane, mine was pissed she had to stand so long. But after her quesidillas and tequila she was a happy nana.
