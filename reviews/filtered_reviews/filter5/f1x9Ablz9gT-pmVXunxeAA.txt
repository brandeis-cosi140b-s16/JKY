I just went to Tortas El Guero for the first time today, and it is a MUST TRY for those of you who like diving elbow deep into delicious tortas.  I have lived in Phoenix for almost four years now and although I am devoted to my favorite torta source in my hometown, San Diego, this place rocks.  Also, when I gave my compliments to the folks behind the counter, the owners came out and introduced themselves, asked me my name, and thanked me for coming.  Definitely go to Tortas El Guero.  I'll be back for the good food and friendly, neighborhood service.  XO to Tortas El Guero!
