The food is great and the owner is amazing. The staff works hard to get your food out quick and it tasted great. The prices are more than reasonable for what you get. The chicken chimichanga with a side of beans is my favorite. The pico de gallo is fresh and tasty on everything. I am excited to try other menu items but I keep getting the same thing because I like it so much. I appreciate they are closed on Sunday and one Wednesday a month so the staff can make doctor'a appointment, get stuff done that would usually be working hours. There are 9 employees total and I think it's amazing for an employer to do that for his staff. I'm a a loyal customer to this place now!
