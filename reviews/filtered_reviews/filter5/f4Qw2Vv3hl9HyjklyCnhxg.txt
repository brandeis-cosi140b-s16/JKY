I've recently moved back west after 15 years in the east. In the east where I only found one Mexican restaurant that served, in my opinion, real Mexican food. I just had a fabulous meal in a fabulous place, El Encanto!!! I will go there many, many, many, more times. Go enjoy the wonderful atmosphere too.
