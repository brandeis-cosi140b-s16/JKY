Finally able to check this place out and see what all the buzz was about.  It is great!  From the chips, salsa and bean dip, to the Cadillac Margarita everything was amazing!  This place was PACKED on a Wednesday evening around 8pm and now I know why.  Its really that good and the servers somehow handle everything and dont leave you feeling like you are left out with the place so packed.  Well worth the wait!
