My husband and I stopped in for lunch and what a pleasant surprise! Honestly, the BEST carnitas I have ever had! So juicy and soft, not crunchy or over-cooked. We also enjoyed the queso fundido, the molletos and a bowl from the value menu. It's been a long time since I've had good Mexican food and this is very deserving of all 5 stars and then some! Accommodating and attentive wait staff, timely service, clean restaurant, will definitely be going here again!
