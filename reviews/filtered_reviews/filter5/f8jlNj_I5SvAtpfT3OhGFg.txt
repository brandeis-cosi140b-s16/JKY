Dare I say that they are better than the Korean/Mexican fusion that is LA's infamous Kogi. YES, YES...I DARE!

The lack of help staff can kinda be overlooked by the fact that the food was YUM-O!!!
It's a small hole in the wall spot my friend always goes to so, he wanted to bring me there.
When we got there, we waited a few minutes for someone to finish their food so we could cop their table.

We got the bulgogi fried rice, fish tacos, and bulgogi tacos. All were pretty amazing especially since I'm comparing them to Kogi.
Their complimentary salsa and chips were good, too. All tasted homemade. They had all kinds of chili sauces from Chinese chili oil combo to Saracha to a Mexican brand I've never had before.

I was giggling that they had musubi on their menu.

The one major factor to this spot is that they are soooooooo far!
