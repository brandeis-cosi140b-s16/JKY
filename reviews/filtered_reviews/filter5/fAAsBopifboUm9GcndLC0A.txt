Mixteca is a family owned local restaurant that provides you with great service and absolutely delicious authentic Mexican food. My favorite is the ground beef tostada and always the fresh cantaloupe or watermelon juice. We eat here constantly and the food is always great and the service is always exceptional. So happy to have a family owned restaurant that provides such a great meal.
