Looking for fabulous Mexican food? Look no further if you're dining in downtown Chandler.

The chili verde is exceptional and the cheese relleno topped with chili verde is exquisite! If it sounds like I love chili verde, it's because I do.

Our waiter, Nick, was very helpful and made good suggestions. His service overall was very good.

The atmosphere is very nice and there's outside dining when the weather permits.
