Wow! Great food at great prices. We caught some of the happy hour specials and ordered steak skewers, steak fries and guacamole with chips. We also, on the recommendation of our server ordered two yummy margaritas. Despite being super busy we were seated immediately and felt well taken care of by our server. He was attentive and friendly. After our apps we ordered tier pork and fish tacos- YUM! We will definitely be back.
