Phat Phrank's has become a MUST do whenever I head to Vegas. I have tried many different items and have discovered that their ceviche is the absolute best that I've ever had! It has a pretty good kick (you can see the bits of chile!) 

If you are there for breakfast, you have got to try the huevos divorciados! You get two eggs, one with red chile and one with green. It comes with rice and beans and is beyond delicious! I want to make the four hour drive just thinking about it!

My cousin ordered the carnitas torta, which she kindly let me try. I cannot wait to go back and order that!

If you are a fan of churros, they make amazing ones! They drizzle chocolate and caramel over them, making them better than any amusement park's!

All the rest of the reviews talk about their amazing service, and it's true! Frank, oh, excuse me, "Phrank," is super nice and makes you feel incredibly welcomed!

Add this place to your Vegas to do list!
