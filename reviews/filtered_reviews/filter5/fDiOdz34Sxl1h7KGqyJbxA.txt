After years of frequenting this restaurant at the Desert Inn location where I never had a bad experience, my girlfriend and I opted to try the one in Henderson on Valentine's Day.  Fortunately we arrived before the rush and were promptly seated by a very friendly staff.  We immediately received chips and salsa along with requested water. The menu is nothing short of overwhelming, but in a positive way.  Talk about selection and variety.  Everything sounded good but ultimately we made our selections (one steak entree, one chicken entree) which arrived in a timely manner, despite how busy it was.  Our server was friendly and attentive and they always kept my glass full of water.  Both of us completely finished our plates and the taste of the food was totally wonderful.  Even their tortillas were full of flavor.  Overall we had a truly wonderful dinner with top notch service and the view of the city from inside is spectacular.  Upon our departure, the line for seating was out the door - obviously this is a very popular establishment.  I cannot wait to return.
