I had heard great things about this place and was so excited to try it.  Soooooo glad that I did.  :) 
The decor of the place is simple but there is a nice patio seating area so that you can enjoy the weather.  I think I was a Pavlovian dog, while waiting in line to place my order.  I chose two enchiladas one with pork green chili and the other a potato and cornbread mixture.  Smothered in a green chili sauce and baked to perfection. Definitely add the fried egg on top, it makes everything taste yummy.
