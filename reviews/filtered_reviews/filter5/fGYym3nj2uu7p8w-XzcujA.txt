Adorable place! I picked up an order from the bar and the gentleman working greeted me with the warmest, most beautiful smile. Awesome service!!!! 

I ordered the pineapple braised pork and poke with scallions. Every flavor was perfectly perfect! 

Decor wise, it is probably the cutest and most original place in Scottsdale, it literally took my breath away. I'll be back for dessert!
