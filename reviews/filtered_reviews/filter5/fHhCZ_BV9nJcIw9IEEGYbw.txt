This is the real deal. My search is over! No longer need to go Mexico for the original street tacos. We can get them here. The carne asada tacos are my favorite. I had 6 loaded and are a bargain at $1.89 each. Washed them down with a Mexican Coke.. Ahh so good. The birria tacos and papa loca tacos are my next fav. Todo aqui esta muy bueno. Come early as it gets busy quick. Im glad to see they are doing really well. Hopefully they will open a second place soon.
