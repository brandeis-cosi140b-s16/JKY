The food and service are absolutely amazing!!  I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like.  However, I have recently learned that the owner keeps his employees tips if they are put on a credit card.  Please, please, if you eat here tip in cash.  The employees are wonderful and should get the money that is left for them.
