This wasn't my first experience at PVBC, but it was my best, by far. 

I go in, I order the week's special - The New Year's Fail-solution Burger - 2 patties with havarti cheese, chiles, carmelized onions, cinnamon(what?), a maple/bacon/whiskey pesto on a fried brioche bun. I sit down with my Dr. Pepper, and soon enough I begin to smell things from the kitchen. I really hope whatever I smell is mine, because it smells amazing. I smell all the flavors of the cinnamon, the chiles, the carmelized onions and that's when I realized I was so hungry I'd drank half my Dr. Pepper. My mouth was watering at this point. The food comes out and it exceeds my already high expectations. The cinnamon blew my mind. I had no idea using cinnamon in a burger could be so delicious...and don't even get me started on that pesto...that stuff is ridiculous in a very good way. This was the best burger I've ever had. Also try the regular seasoned fries and the sweet potato tots...either will be a great decision. 

Other burgers you should definitely try - the Brûlée Burger, the Country Fried Burger, and the Booze Burger. The Booze is by far my favorite at this point - 2 deep fried patties on a brioche bun with a vodka/green chile/bacon cream sauce that will blow your mind. It's topped with smoked Fresno chiles that take it to another level. This is my go-to when I come to PVBC, however I will always wish/hope they bring back that special of the week that I dream about. 

Paradise Valley Burger Co. has become my favorite spot to eat, and if you have not tried it you are missing out big time.
