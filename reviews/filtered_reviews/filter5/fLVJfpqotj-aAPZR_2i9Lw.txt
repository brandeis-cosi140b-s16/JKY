You'll want to legalize immigration, for sure, once you try this food and salsas. The salsa bar brings strawberry, pecan, cilantro and other 8 or so collection of salsas to be savored with your basket of chips.  An array of hotness, so sweet, yes!  This food will make you question what the heck was that other Mexican food you once thought to be delicious.  This is true Mexico City cuisine. 

I've been to Mexico City and have tasted el sabor verdadero, now here in Phoenix, is a family owned restaurant that brings this authentic Mexican flavor to you and yours and you will say thank you its here.  Provecho!

Keep up the good work to be great Condesa!  Gracias.
