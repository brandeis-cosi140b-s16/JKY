We ate here after a round at The Boulders and were not disappointed! The food here is excellent. I had the chicken fajitas and the hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both dishes were outstanding. The restaurant was completely packed on a Sunday night too, so you know they're doing something right. Drinks were delicious. This place is somewhat pricey but I am a big believer in you get what you pay for. We can't wait to come back!
