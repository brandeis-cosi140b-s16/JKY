Happy hour is VERY popular here. That is because their house margaritas ROCK and I am very picky about my adult slushy of choice.  The staff is ALWAYS friendly and sweet and I've stopped in here for lunch several times now. The music is always fun. Bar is open, comfy and inviting.  Burgers are high quality Angus beef and they seem to procure the juiciest, ripe yummy tomatoes for their plates. Wish we could substitute something other than fries as a side (without extra charges) for their sandwiches/burgers though would be my only comment.
