Vegetarian options, great prices, awesome service and great flavor. That sums up my thought on this place. We do not eat meat and were thrilled to see they had many options available to us. Also after arriving and talking to our server she told us there were other things she could have the kitchen make without meat that further expanded our selection. The food was awesome hot, flavorful, fresh and fast. The server was quick, super friendly, and very very accommodating going out of her way to ensure our dietary issues were met. Had the tacos my wife had a salad, margaritas were awesome I had a traditional and she had the cotton candy margarita(which actually has cotton candy in it). Everyone here goes out of their way to make sure your experience is a good one I would highly recommend this place to anyone and really for the price I couldn't have been happy I have plunked down far more money in vegas for a far less pleasant experience.
