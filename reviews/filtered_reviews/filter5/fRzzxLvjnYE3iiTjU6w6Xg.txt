I've been to Verde a few times and have never had a bad meal.  Always good.  Always fresh.  An amazing bar.  Prices are very reasonable.  tonight I had the chile relleno which was outstanding.  Very fresh and just the right portion for me.  My beloved had the mahi mahi tacos.  He thought they were much better than that other Mexican place not too far from here.  He thought they had a "kick."  Just a wonderful dining experience.  Add to that the beautiful ambiance and you have yourself a great night out.  Don't miss it.
