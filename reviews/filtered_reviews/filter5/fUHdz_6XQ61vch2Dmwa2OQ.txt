Great place.  The staff made us feel welcome, and the food was delicious, with generous portions. I love the soup that comes with dinner, and the margaritas did NOT disappoint. There may be too many choices for what you want, but that is not a bad thing.  I was so happy to find this place for my visit to Vegas.  So nice we went twice, in one week.
