It's exactly what I'd expect for an old school Mexican food place. Yeah, it's cramped a little. It's old. The food is the best Mexican food for white people in Phoenix. The hot sauce is to die for. Chips and fresh and endless. I love the gringo Fundito. If you're thinking about eating at this place, stop thinking and start getting down there to get a seat. It can get crowded very quickly. End of story.
