The food is great the atmosphere is wonderful...and the BARTENDER is THE B-E-S-T!!!!  She is the most friendliest funniest bartender I've come across in a while. And that girl can make a mean drink! She is the reason I'm giving 5 stars! I wish I could remember her name cute little Doll works in the evenings...she's the Best seriously!
