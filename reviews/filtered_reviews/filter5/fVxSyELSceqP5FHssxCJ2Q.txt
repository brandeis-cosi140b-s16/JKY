This white girl is in LOVE!! My mother lives about a mile away from Baja Joe's. We have never stopped to eat there in all the 18 years she has lived in the neighborhood. Last year I snagged a Groupon and took 2 coworkers there for lunch. It was....okay. I think the enjoyment lessened because of the unattentive waitress. The best expereince was the shrimp stuffed peppers wrapped in bacon. About 3 months ago I went again. This time I was just blown out of the water. The queso dip was yummy. The salsa tasted VERY FRESH. The carne asada quesadilla was meaty & cheesy. About 2 months ago I took my mother there. It was her first time. She fell in love too. She thought the seafood was delish. Well folks, I think she is addicted. She has been there 6 more times in the last 7 weeks. She has taken friends and family there to introduce them to Baja Joe's (making reservations each time to make sure there is seating). When you see Mexicans walk in, eat & have fun, you know you're at the right place! (You never see a Mexican eating at Taco Bell.) This place serves authentic homemade Mexican food and beats the chain-style restraunts HANDS DOWN!! Servers are pleasant and informative about the menu choices. Love me some Toritos De Camaron!!!
