When I arrived I wondered what I was getting myself into since the place is attached to a strip club. I was hesitant to walk in but was very surprised at the atmosphere. It was like any other restaurant, nothing to do with the business next door. 
The head chef came out several times to see if we enjoyed our food, Chris was also very friendly with making our table side guacamole. Everything we tried was so good, it's hard to find good mexican restaurants but this is one of a kind. You have to try it.
