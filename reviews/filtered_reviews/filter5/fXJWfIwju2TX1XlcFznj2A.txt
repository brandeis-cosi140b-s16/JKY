The parking lot is not representative of the population inside. We parked up the street and got in within 10 minutes of putting our name down at 7:30pm on a Saturday. The staff were all courteous and helpful; meals came out quick (despite the staff constantly checking the USA vs. Mexico Soccer game that was going on, it was apparently a big deal. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just impressive multitasking). 

The food is excellent. Nothing bizarre, leans more authentic than most "authentic" Mexican places, but just quality versions of familiar food. I would trust the steak and seafood here. The guacamole being made in front of you is amazing, and it allows your to steal the recipe (it also appears to be a lot of work) 

Our waiter, Rene, was on the ball and had quality suggestions. The Mango Mojitos ARE spectacular. The other busing staff executed excellently. My Cadillac Margarita was almost too strong. Which is how I like it. 

SUPER MEGA BONUS: The first Mariachi Band that did not annoy me. Not only did they do a splendid job of traditional tunes, they had a delightful version of Charlie Daniel's Devil goes down to Georgia (I am not a hillbilly; it was just a good rendition.) and at no point did they beg for tips or get intrusive. Excellent stuff.
