Growing up in los Angeles and making trips to Tijuana in my late teens to party should tell you I've got experience in eating my share of great tacos. 

Tacos el gordo saved my life when I moved to Vegas. Price is fair. But seriously so good!!! I've been looking for this style tacos, Homemade style!!! 

They turn tables pretty quickly. I've been pretty lucky I always seem to get there right before a large crowd. Don't let lines intimidate you they are quick. Enjoy!!!
