Delicious food and friendly staff (their English isn't always the best, but don't let that deter you).  We usually get the tacos, but the burritos are amazing, too!  Try their carnitas or barbacoa.  If you're wanting to try something new, they have cow tongue and pig snout as well, which is actually surprisingly good (may not be everyone's cup of tea though).
