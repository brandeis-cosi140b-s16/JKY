After driving by all the time when I go to the gym, my boyfriend and I finally went. Wonderful service, clean and great atmosphere (could barely hear street traffic on University), and most importantly, delicious! I love the smaller portioned tacos, and the salsa bar was always stocked and fresh. Will definitely be making bicycle trips back and become a regular! :)
