This Mexican restaurant has the best burritos in town!  This is not your roach infested 24 hour drive through kind of burrito joint either.  Here are the reasons that make La Tolteca #1 and one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix!
1-Full bakery with mouth watering fresh pastries
2-Fresh ingredients and great prices
3-Also serves beer if you feel like having a Corona with your meal as opposed to take out
4-Little market has the best prices in town on citrus fruits and just enough of everything to cook up a little Mexican meal (Ranch Market not needed!)
5-Make your own pico/ salsa bar, make it your style and get as much of it as you want:)
So, if you are downtown looking for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Of course it is super casual take out or seat yourself kind of place so don't  try to flatter your date here! But get there early, I'm pretty sure they close up shop by 9 or 10...
