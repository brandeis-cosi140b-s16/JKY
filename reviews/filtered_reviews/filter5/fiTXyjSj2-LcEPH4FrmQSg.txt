Hello, I have never written a review before. However, after eating here I felt I would be doing it a dis-service by not writing. My parents and I went to SumoMaya after hiking up Tom's Thumb Trail. We made it in time for the happy hour and it was delicious. We were a under dressed for the occasion, wearing only the clothes that we used to hike up a mountain. The employees didn't bat an eye, thank god! First we ordered bacon guacamole, which I must say was the best guac I've ever eaten. We went ahead and ordered three servings of SumoMaya's happy hour tacos. First came the Sesame Ginger Tacos. The good news, they were fantastic! The better news, it was only getting better! They brought out the Korean Beef Taco and Pork "Al Pastor" Tacos at the same time. Both of them, especially the Pork "Al Pastor" Tacos were the best tacos i've ever eaten.

I highly recommend this establishment. You won't be disappointed. You might even see me, as I will for sure be coming back! 

Btw, it is also a great place to watch football as they have 4 HUGE TV's over the bar. 

PSS, amazing margaritas!
