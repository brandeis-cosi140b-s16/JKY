the food here is amazing chips and salsa r the best watch out for the orange one though my server amber warned me right away she seemed to know all about the menu and had great recommendations i had the taco plate with pastor cochanita and asada tacos all three were great and the rice was so delicious make sure u save room for the flan its the best ive ever had !!!
