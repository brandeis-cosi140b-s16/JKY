I've been to both America's Tacos restaurants - one on 7th Avenue and one on 7th Street near my workplace.  The food was excellent on both occasions.  Perhaps a little pricey, but then again, I like good food and I will not lie...no other brother can deny.  Oops, sorry.  :)

Anyway, go here and you will not be disappointed.  Great outdoor patio seating and good food...the combo can't be beat.
