2. Huge portions.  
C. Friendly staff
IV. Delicious.

Definitely lived up to the reviews on Yelp!  Go with the fusion offerings before anything else on your first visit.  The Bulgogi (beef) taco's are cheap and amazing.  I down like 3 of these on each visit.
Free chips, Salsa, and Guac. start the meal.
We usually do one dish with the tacos.  The kimchi fried rice is delicious and HUGE, with a fried egg on top. Especially after 2-3 taco's you'll definitely have leftovers. The Mongolian beef is also worth a try.

Decor needs updating as it looks old and a bit run-down on the inside..but i guess with the type of reviews they've been getting and since the food speaks for itself, I'm sure the owners could care less.

The only way to describe this place is truly with the corny albeit often used phrases: 
**HIDDEN GEM** **MUST TRY** **FOODGASM** **GO-TO SPOT**

But i wouldn't write those words if they weren't true about Komex.
