I went here for lunch with my co-workers yesterday. The food was excellent, and that's why this place deserves 5 stars. I had a salad and my coworkers for the mole' chicken and tacos. The guac was excellent too. I think everyone finished their plates. If there is any complaint about this place, it's that the food was a little on the pricey side (for lunch). If you come here, be ready to spend about $20 per person, and maybe more if you drink alcohol. 
I did glance at the Sunday brunch menu, and that looked excellent and well priced. I will make sure to go here for Sunday brunch. Otherwise, I will only go here if I am looking to impress a girl or if I win the lottery.
