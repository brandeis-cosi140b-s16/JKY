What fabulous, cheap and delicious food!  Everyone in my party ordered hamburgers with fries, 2 of us had the cheeseburgers, 1 a hamburger and 1 guac burger.  Everyone said the food was great.  My cheeseburger which came with a drink and fries, for a cheap total of $7.00, was fabulous!  Fries were steak fries and delish, the cheeseburger met all my needs, juicy but not too juicy, quality beef, comes with a good slice of tomato, lettuce, mayo and a pickle slice, plus I had grilled onions for free changed from raw onions, and I added mustard.

The menu has burritos, pizzas, and different types of burgers.  They have more than one location in the valley, if this one doesn't work for you.  

This is a must-go for us locals, and  tourists with a car!!
