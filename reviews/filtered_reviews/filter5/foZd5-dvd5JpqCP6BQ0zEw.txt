The La Santisima Quesa is absolutely delicious!  I crave it all the time.  Order it, you won't be disappointed.  

In my opinion, this is the best restaurant within a 10 mile radius of downtown Glendale. It has the best margaritas, tacos, salsa bar and service.  I tipped off my buddy Jason V. to this place and now he's the duke.  It's goooooood.
