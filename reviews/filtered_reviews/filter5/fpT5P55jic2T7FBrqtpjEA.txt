Unexpected flavors at an unassuming place! I am definitely glad I went out my way to come and try Komex. This 'hole in the wall' offers a unique blend of flavors and textures and delivers foods sure to please (and surprise) your taste buds. 

Not only is the food awesome, but the service is amazing.  The lady who took care of me today (the owner I'd assume) greeted me with a smile and, being my first time, was welcoming and recommended some amazing dishes. 

I tried the bulgogi, pork and shrimp tacos and they were all very good. In fact, I got a second shrimp taco due to its amazing flavor. I also ordered fried pork wontons which were freshly fried and the pork was juicy and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and come try this place.
