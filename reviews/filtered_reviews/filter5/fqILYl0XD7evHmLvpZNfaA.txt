So so so GOOD! Whenever I go to Mill I start my night off with Fuzzys. The shrimp and fish tempura tacos are the best. I really love their beeritas as well. Very cool atmosphere and it's really not a bad price. Cheaper than Rubios. I really recommend this place to those that are looking for a cool place on Mill Ave to eat. They even deliver to World of Beer!
