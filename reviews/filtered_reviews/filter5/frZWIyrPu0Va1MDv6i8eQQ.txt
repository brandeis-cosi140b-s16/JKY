Well, we've been here every week since I posted my last review.  Menu has changed slightly but the quality has not.  I wouldn't recommend the squash blossom app but they have added their guac fest guacamole to the regular menu and those are absolutely fabulous.  I tried their chipotle mango margarita and it was awesome (but no longer on the menu), the elderflower margarita is also awesome - so much so we went out and bought a bottle of St. Germain.  I know I mentioned it in my last review but it deserves repeating, the short rib entree is absolutely unbelievable.  Mole is great too.

2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 margaritas = around $200 with tip - a good deal for what you're getting.
