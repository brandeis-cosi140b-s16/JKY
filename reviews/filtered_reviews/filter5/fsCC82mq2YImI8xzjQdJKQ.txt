This place is fantastic! I visited Charlotte (from New Orleans) with my boyfriend and he's obsessed with fish tacos. We loved the NoDa neighborhood so when I discovered this place online we had to go back to try it out. Nothing short of amazing! Our waiter (guy with a beard) was very sweet. We sat in what looked like a patio area for warmer weather but it was closed up and equipped with heaters at the time.

The food was fantastic! Fresh unique salsa (and free). I thought I was going to stuff myself to capacity! I had the lemon shrimp tacos. Holy hell! Just the right amount of avocado spread and I would kill for the cilantro dressing recipe. My boyfriend had a burrito and couldn't even finish it at the restaurant but ate every bit later on. All around fantastic place!
