My son and I were getting ready to turn into a Mickey D's when I asked him if he'd like to try something new.   I had just read about this place last night and was dying to try it.  We were pleasantly surprised.   My son had the monster boyger with bacon and fat fries and I had the guacamole boyger with cheese and skinny fries.  Burgers were juicy and fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   We both left full and vowing to return soon.
