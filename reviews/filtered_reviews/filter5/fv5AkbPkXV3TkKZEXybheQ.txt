I don't understand how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars. This place is unique and has amazing food, I never wait too long for the food to come out, and it's always delicious. 

Unusually get the jade red chicken, pollo diablo in a quesadilla, jerk fried rice and black beans. I then will top it off with their famous sugar cookies.
