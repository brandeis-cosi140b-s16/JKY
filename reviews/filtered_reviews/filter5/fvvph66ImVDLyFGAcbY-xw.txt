Yum. I had the pork and green chile burrito. It was the best burrito I can remember having.  The pork was tender and lean, and the whole thing had so much flavor. The tortilla was fresh and homemade and delicious. It was so good I didn't bother adding any salsa, and I usually add a ton of salsa to a burrito. I can't wait to go back!
