To start off with the building is ultra cool being in an old church with the stained glass windows still intact and all.  They have an extensive tequila list and also feature local craft brews from Cartel, Papago, Four Peaks, etc.  The portions of guacamole were large enough for a group of 4.  Very interesting mix of tacos to choose from from lamb with blue cheese to peking duck. Prices were fair and service was excellent. Could turn into a new regular place for us.
