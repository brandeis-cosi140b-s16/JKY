Awesome little hole in the wall, this spot has extremely nice staff working here. This is another reason why I love coming to family own businesses they always seem to know how to take care of their customers. 

Food here is decent in price with an awesome taste that will knock your shoes off. I'm a sucker for yummy food that has kimchi in it and guess what this place decided to do? Yeah some genius here thought it'd be a good idea to put kimchi in their fried rice and WOW was it awesome. Kimchi fried rice with some of that nicely tasting marinated meat all bunched up in the fried rice.....I hate for those of you guys that can only imagine this tasty food and can't have a chance to eat it. If you're definitely in the area, I really really suggest you come to this spot and try it out, if you like Korean food, then this place is a must. They also have some Mexican food as well, but if you come here I suggest you try the fusion side of the menu. You simply can't go wrong with KO-rean food fused with MEX-ican food. KOMEX you guys rock. Having friendly staff as well, makes this place that much better. I really wish they would have a place like this is the Bay Area instead of those cheap imitations.

On top of the fried rice, we also ordered the bul go gi burrito, I believe that was what it was called. It was just like the fried rice, but all wrapped up in a burrito. Another thing that was good here was their fried wonton, which were pretty much ground beef wrapped into a wonton (this item is free if you check in from yelp). I almost forgot that we also ordered the bul go gi fries. Just as the others were good, the fries were just as good. All these things were too good to be true and I highly recommend any one of these.

When coming here please beware, that your tastebuds will go nuts after eating here, making you want to come back for more. It just sucks that I live 9 hours from this place and I can only get it when I'm in Vegas.

I WILLLLLL BE BACK FOR MORE KOMEX!
