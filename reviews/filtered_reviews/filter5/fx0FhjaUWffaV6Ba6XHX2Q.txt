I was drawn to this place by the awesome atmosphere and great location. The group I was with was a total of six people but they were very accommodating. The best thing about our experience was our awesome server Laura. Five out of the six people I was with are servers and every single person was impressed with her personality, great customer service and likability. If you ever go there, ask for her because she is awesome!
