There is no better bang for your buck than Komex.  It is delicious and inexpensive.  It is the Korean fusion magic that they perform that makes it so amazing.  The wife and I have been many times and have never been dissatisfied.  To us, it is worth the over 10 mile drive.  The warmth of the owners/staff as well as the deliciousness of the food will keep us coming back again and again and again....
