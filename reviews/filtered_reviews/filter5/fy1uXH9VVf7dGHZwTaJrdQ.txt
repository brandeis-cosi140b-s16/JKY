Love this place!! I get the teriyaki chicken quesadillas (with the sauce inside)!! With refried beans and fried rice on the side! Completely normal meal right? Oh and don't forget the snicker doodle on the side. I think that hits every food group you need? Lol!! No but really this place is amazing, the ambience is great but it doesn't matter because the food is! Go here!!!!!!
