Steak cilantro was amazing. Went on cinco de mayo. Being a Mexican restaurant, it was busy, but in 20 minutes we were seated and had our drinks.THE STEAK. WAS THE BEST!!!!! I had chile relleno and it was delicious and... Delish. Do not miss steak cilantro! We stuffed ourselves with guacamole and their fabulous bean dip so we were already kind of full. Totally worth the short wait. I recommend this to anyone who likes Mexican food. Large menus ensure everybody gets what they are looking for and even if they don't know, it's safe to try something new!
