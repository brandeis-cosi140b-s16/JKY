We love this place - the food is always good!   You will have to wait for a while since contrary to the appearance when you walk in - it is NOT a fast food place and that is a GREAT thing!  The food is worth the wait since it is all cooked to order!   I love to pick it up and take it home too! and we have purchased their salsa for home later too!  Take the time to stop and try this wonderful place - hidden away in the Fry's Shopping plaza - we will be back for sure!
