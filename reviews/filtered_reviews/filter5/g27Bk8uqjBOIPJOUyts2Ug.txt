I first visited Frijoles a year ago. I'm an Arturo Trejo (YouTuber) fan, so I knew about the restaurant from afar. My fianc√©e and I made the trip to Vegas from Los Angeles and we weren't disappointed. We came back a second time that trip because we couldn't get enough of the food and friendly staff. On our most recent trip, we stopped by the new location as well as the first and it was just as we remembered. Back home, we frequently talk about how much we miss every one of their entrees, aguas frescas, and delicious sauces. Frijoles can't be beat!
