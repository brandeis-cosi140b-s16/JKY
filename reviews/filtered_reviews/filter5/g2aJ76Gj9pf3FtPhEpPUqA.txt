Los Dos Molinos has been a fiery oasis to me and my sister for nearly 20 years.  A trip to visit our parents in Mesa doesn't feel complete without eating there.  Dad always gripes that we could go to the one in Mesa, but this location is the only option for me.  It is one of the few places that I can get food that is satisfyingly spicy hot.  I love the funky atmosphere, and the margaritas are HUGE.  The carne adovada chimichanga with green chile is my current favorite.  I am headed to AZ tomorrow and am taking a shuttle directly to Los Dos Molinos from the airport.  I love it.  If the other reviews about the clientele are scaring you off, go there for lunch.  And get someone else to drive.
