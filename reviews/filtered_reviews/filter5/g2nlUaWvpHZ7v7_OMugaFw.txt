Best Tacos EVER.  I swear there must have been every part of every animal available.  Usually taqueria tacos don't fill me up so much, but 6 of these beauties and I was done.  I had a little carne asada, cabeza, lingua, tripa, and pork adobada that has been roasting along side pineapple.  Every one of these tacos were delicious, bountiful, and better than any tacos I've eaten before.  Not to mention their beverage bar is awesome.  They serve a variety of Mexican drinks and soda, and it's free refills.  A place like this you would expect to be a dirty hole in the wall that you would have to get into through a secret passage and a password, but it's quite the opposite and very clean.  They have two old ladies sweeping the floors and clearing tables around the clock.  As soon as I was done she took my tray for me.  Great service great food, what more can you ask for?
