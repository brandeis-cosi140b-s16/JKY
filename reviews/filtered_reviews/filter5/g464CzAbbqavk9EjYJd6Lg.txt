I am a big chipotle fan, and this place is better! Better service, clean place and the food is so fresh and delicious. You can taste each flavor and ingredient. The avocado, the unique cali style burritos, the quesadilla, fantastic. I highly recommend this place for lunches. And it's even cheaper than chipotle!
