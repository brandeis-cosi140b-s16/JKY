Was looking for a good breakfast place off the strip for some good affordable food and Phat Phranks fit the bill. Great burritos, good salsa and fantastic service. The owner really cares about his customers. He checked up with us half way through the meal to make sure everything was good. You could tell he was genuine and it wasn't just going through the motions. Was impressed by the food too. The breakfast burritos have some fried crispy potato slices that give a good crunch. Loved it. 

Bottom line: great breakfast alternative to over priced places on the strip.
