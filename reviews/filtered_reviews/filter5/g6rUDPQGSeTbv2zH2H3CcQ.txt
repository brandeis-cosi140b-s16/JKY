I am absolutely in heaven, enjoying the enchilada veracruz right now. It's light and healthy - filled with chicken and spinach, with a side of grilled zucchini, but it is huge in flavors and totally hits the spot. It has a little kick to it, which is perfect. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and crispy, lightly salted.. And I still can't decide which salsa I like best of the two. 

The house margarita is tasty. A little sweeter than I'm normally used to, but it pairs well with the dish. The server is fantastic and everything came out quick. Definitely a spot to hit again if I'm in town!
