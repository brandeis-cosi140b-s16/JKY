Awesome!

There are so many reviews here already for this location!  Here's my take on the visit, which occurred Saturday Jan 29.

After I convinced my 10year old that she might actually enjoy the unfamiliar (and get a fresh fruity drink), we stopped in at Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch.

We were seated quickly and a friendly young lady waited on us.  We needed a minute to look over the large selection of items, so she brought us water and gave us a couple minutes.

My daughter wouldn't order a torta, but said she'd try mine.  She selected a quesedilla with guac, and a Mango/Strawberry Aguas Cremosas, which is kinda like a lighter milk shake- not as heavy on the cream. The white cheese was melted and folded between a deliciously buttered and grilled flour tortilla.  Yum!  She enjoyed it, and the drink.

Based upon Rand's review, I ordered the "Torta Norte√±a" with salad.  Iced tea is fresh brewed and good.

The food arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.

This was truly the best Torta I have ever had.  The mix of ingredients was just right, and the bread was divine.  It was a little spicy for my daughter, but she loved the mix of flavors and suggested that the entire family come back for lunch next Saturday.  

Servings are larges, so we took home 1/2 a Torta and a bunch of quesedilla, which were quickly consumed by a perpetually hungry teen, who now wants to go get her own Torta.

We enjoyed the atmosphere- lots of families, bustling and lots of energy.  Positive, happy crowd.  The restaurant is in an old-school strip center, but is clean and effort has been made to make the inside cheerful.  We watched some of the prep cooks working and I noted that they used proper safety/sanitation measures at all times.  

I can't wait to go back and try some other variations.  My daughter is now a Torta convert.
