Carlsbad Tavern had been on my bucket list for quite some time
ever since I found out it was New Mexico cuisine
Well you can obvi tell by the name Carlsbad
But I weaseled my way in 
and
I loved it

My favorite thing was the seasoning on the chips and salsa! I tried to ask if they sold bags of the stuff but they didnt. The server was so nice, she offered to pack me 2 to go bags though

The food was great and the chile was nice and spicy

I also had a marg which was pretty tasty

I shall return to CT
