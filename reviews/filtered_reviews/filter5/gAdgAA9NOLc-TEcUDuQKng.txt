I was trying to find a mid-way place to meet a friend, so I got on Yelp to look for restaurants. Once I saw that someone compared Los Olivos to La Pinata in Burlingame, CA, I was going to try it. I grew up eating at La Pinata & have missed it for years. While the food was not La Pinata (& after 10 years, I may have built it up so much that nothing ever is) the food was excellent but the service was even better. I had a shrimp chimi that was delicious, but I have to rave about the wait staff. I had my two small dogs with me & my friend can't be in the sun. The staff set up umbrellas special so that we could eat outside without being in the sun. They also brought my dogs water and didn't bat an eyelash when I asked for a grilled chicken breast without anything for my dogs. My dogs are really well behaved & sat on their chair the whole time without making a fuss, but the fact that the staff at Los Olivos was kind to them without making a fuss & disrupting the conversation was priceless. I will be back. Probably tomorrow.
