I was skeptical at first upon going here. Their sign was seriously hand-written. I love hole in the walls, but sometimes it's too hole-in-the-wallish and downright bad. Not so with this gem. The owner of the place was running the cash register and looked totally out of place. Tall white dude serving Mexican food? He spoke Spanish too. He was extremely nice and funny. He had his son running around serving everyone - I loved that family vibe.

After we ordered a ton of food for all of like $14 we sat down and patiently waited. It was a bit of wait, but it was also fairly crowded. I could see the people hard at work in the back. They were legit hand-rolling the tamales. Impressed! I ordered something called a "Molote" which I've never had before. It was like a potato thing stuffed with chorizo. Awesome. I had 2 of them and literally inhaled them. I also inhaled a bunch of carne asada tacos and a shrimp taco as well. They come with some very tasty salsa and unknown green sauce. There was a fish taco in the mix which wasn't as good as the rest of the food, but no matter. For the price we paid, I was a happy camper. 

It was weird, when I left I felt "meh" about that place, but now sitting here typing this I seriously crave it. That's good food! I still prefer La Condesa, but they're more for gourmet tacos. This is your $2 taco fix right here, boys and girls.
