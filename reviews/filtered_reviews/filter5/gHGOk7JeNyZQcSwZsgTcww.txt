We went on the recommendation of some friends and Im glad we did.  The food was delicious, large portions and at a great price.  Even on a Saturday night the service was friendly and fast.

I was a little worried when they told us they had karaoke going on, but we sat on the left side and it was no louder than some background music at many restaurants.

Really have nothing bad to say about the place.
