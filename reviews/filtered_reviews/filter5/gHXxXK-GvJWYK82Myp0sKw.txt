5 stars for happy hour deals! We go here every once in a while for chicken enchiladas verdes and their chicken tostada salad. The happy hour deals are only offered in the bar area and include menu specials as well as drink specials. 

Pros: Inexpensive food & drinks, fun staff

Cons: I wouldn't come here anytime other then happy hour because it is very much a bar with bar food.
