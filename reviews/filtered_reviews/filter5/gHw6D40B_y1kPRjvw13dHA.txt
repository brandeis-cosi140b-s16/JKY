I took a group of people here from work -  The service was outstanding the food was even better. I produced my "Yelp" coupon and it was honoured without question. The chips and salsa really get your attention, and some of the cocktails were excellent. They seated our group of 8 immediately, even while they had a large function going on outside. All who ate there were thrilled.
