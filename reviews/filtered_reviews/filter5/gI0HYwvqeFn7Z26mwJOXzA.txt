Very good mexican food at a reasonable price.  I went last Tuesday at 1 pm for lunch and it was packed!  There wasn't a table available inside for a while.  They do have outside dining.  

I highly recommend their Carne Asada Burrito for $4.95.  It comes with fresh chips and salsa.  The burrito was about the size of Chipotle's.  It is a sit down restaurant with servers, so don't think fast food just because it is a small location than normal.  A good value considering the chips are free.  However, be aware that the $.99 tacos don't include chips.  

This place is right next door to Milano's Music in Downtown Mesa.
