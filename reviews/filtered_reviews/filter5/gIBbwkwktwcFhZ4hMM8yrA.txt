Stopped by today for the first time to this establishment.  Drove passed it twice before I finally found the place.  For those going for the first time, if you're standing under Sapphire's awning looking at its front door, El Dorado Cantina's door is a mere 20 feet to the left, part of the same structure.  With that said, once inside, it has zero resemblance/association to Sapphire (as far as I could tell).
I was greeted pleasantly by two hostesses, one of which went out of her way to try to find the baseball game I wanted to watch.  My server was nice and efficient, too.
I had the street taco plate, al pastor.  The tortillas were delicious as were the contents.  And I actually ate the side of beans and rice.  Normally I don't because other places put too much salt in them, but these were good.
I liked the decor - lots of booths with leather seating, and high bar tables with leather seating, too.
But most importantly the food was good and at a good price: $2.50 for a fountain coke, $7.50 for tacos al pastor.  Lunch for 10 bucks!
Would go back.
