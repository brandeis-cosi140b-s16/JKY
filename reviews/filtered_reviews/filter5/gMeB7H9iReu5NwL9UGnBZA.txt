I actually come to this place maybe once a week!  It's one of my favorite local hangouts. 

The food is really good and the interior has a comforting factor.  The employees that work there are friendly and give the restaurant some character.  It makes this great local joint to grab a quick bite to eat!

Whenever I eat there I generally get a chicken burrito or fish tacos (and potato tacos).  The fish tacos are extremely delicious! I would highly recommend this place for anyone who has not been there!

Friendly, quick, and delicious.  Yum, yum, burritos and fish tacos!! 

I highly recommend for convenient, delicious food.  A MUST TRY!!!
