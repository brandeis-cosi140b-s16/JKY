Went there last night and it was so much fun! For a Friday night at 12am the bar gets very busy and somewhat loud. The bartenders were very fast at getting my drinks and the bartender "Brittany" was very nice and had a big smile the whole time. I normally don't like bars like this because it is Not my sene , but this bar was actually fun and a must go back! Thanks.
