I LOVE AZTECA!! It's a definite on Cinco De Mayo this place is packed and the Margaritas are HUGE!!! 

I love the hot fresh chips and they're salsa is good too!! I think this place is better than Cantina and it's definitely more authentic! I always get the same thing its a dish with shrimp and vegetables with rice and cheese sooooo good!!

The value that you get in unbelievable for 2 people it ends up to be $17 can't go wrong!!
