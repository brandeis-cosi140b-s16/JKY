Tacos Sahuayo is a casual small shop with great food and a casual atmosphere. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, one carne asada taco, and one chorizo taco. All of them were amazing and I left rubbing my belly in a food coma. 

There was a chili hot sauce served on the side which reminded me a bit of harissa. I'm not sure exactly what it was, but it I wanted to put it on everything. The service was great and I'll certainly stop again if I come back to Phoenix.
