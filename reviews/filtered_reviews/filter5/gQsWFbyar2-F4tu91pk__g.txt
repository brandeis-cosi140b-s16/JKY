This place has the best Mexican food in town, the 2nd best is Richardo!

The homemade Guacamole is awesome! An idea how fresh it is, they bring it to your table and make it right their in front of you and you get a lot of it as well! The house salsa is awesome, it may be a little too hot for some but very addicting! They also bring out some bean dip as well. 

I have had several different items on the menu from the Burritos, the tostada and the carne asada - which are all were leaving you to want more!!

The bar drinks are great as well and a very strong!

This place has been in town for years, one of the very few places where they never disappoint you!
