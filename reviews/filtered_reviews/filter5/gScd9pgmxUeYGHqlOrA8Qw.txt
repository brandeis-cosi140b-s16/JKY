I work right across the street from the Restaurant and really have been craving modern Mexican food lately.  I decided today to head over there on my dinner break and ate by myself and had the best experience.  I was automatically offered a drink by someone who wasn't my server.  I ordered my food and it was promptly served.  My server refilled my drink before i was emptly.  I was asked my four different employees how everything was going!  My plates were cleared immediately by another server and a box was brought out by someone else and the bill as well.  They have this great group of people that help each other out in getting things taken care of.   The food was really great.  I ordered Pozole soup and the corn tamale.  I also got to try the mushroom tacos because there were extras.  Anyway i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone.  This is definitely what Mill needed as far as a nice bar with some food options.  I'll be frequenting this place quite often.
