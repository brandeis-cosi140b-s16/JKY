We tried Pedro's using our Groupon we had purchased. I can say that this place has been around for 50 years per our cashier and it is well established. The service was prompt and the ice tea, chips and salsa were very good. The salsa wasn't overpowering and the chips were crispy and light. Our meals arrived shortly after we had finished eating the chips and salsa. My husband ordered the #1 and I ordered the #3. The shredded beef tacos, cheese enchiladas and tamale were delightful. Every bite was savory and tender. 
I would recommend this restaurant for Mexican food. The staff is friendly and efficient, attentive and helpful. We will be back.
