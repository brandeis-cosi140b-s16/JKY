We ate and partied on the rooftop deck lounge. The food was good but the service was really great. Music was solid and it was fun to look out on the strip. It can be very warm outside at night, so be sure to dress for the warm weather and you'll be happy too.

There's a mostly indoors restaurant and bar downstairs with the same food and service but is much more protected from the weather.
