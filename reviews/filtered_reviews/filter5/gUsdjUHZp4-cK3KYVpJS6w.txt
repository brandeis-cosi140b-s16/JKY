This place has got some baller tacos.  We came here after doing a Hoover Dam trip and on the way to Red Rock Canyon and it was the perfect stop.  If you want a break from some of the over-the-top nonsense of the Strip and something thats gonna be easier on the wallet but still freakin fantastic food, go here.  

I got three tacos: bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken.  Chicken is standard, bulgogi is amazing, and spicy pork had an awesome flavor to it.  

Fusion fries = just get it.  

If you want a great meal for a great price and a few hours away from the Strip to get yourself together, go here.
