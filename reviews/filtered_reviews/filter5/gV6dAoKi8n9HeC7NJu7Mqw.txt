Don't judge a book by its cover. And, don't judge a New Mexican food place by its exterior. Vital life lessons.

The food is fantastic. For my gringo tastebuds, the green chili sauce is a little spicy, but the flavor is amazing. I had the chicken burrito, and I'm pretty sure they used a whole chicken given the size of this thing. The ground beef was also delicious, and not at all the cheap tasting product that so many ground beef burritos are. 

It was 11am, so sadly I didn't try the margaritas (though it was five o'clock in Praia--an "island nation off the coast of Senegal--thanks Wikipedia!). But my co-eaters espoused their deliciousness--I'll give them a shot next time. 

Staff was friendly and I fully anticipate being back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
