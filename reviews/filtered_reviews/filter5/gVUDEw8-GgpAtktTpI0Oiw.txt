Favorite Mexican place in town! They have the best table side quac and I love their grilled shrimp tacos. They have a lot that is reasonably priced but depending on what you order it can definitely add up. I like to eat off of the a la cart menu because I don't care to eat the rice and beans, so it's cheaper that way. My favorite margarita is their mango margarita :) they have a late night happy hour that starts from 11pm-2am. (They also have an afternoon happy hour) Half off margaritas. It's a good time to go. Awesome view too! For the most part the service is always great and the waiters and bussers do an awesome job.
