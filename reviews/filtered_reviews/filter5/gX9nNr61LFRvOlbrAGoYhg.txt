Absolutely the best mexican food I've had in the US to date (and I've been everywhere except New England, Alaska, and Hawaii). The refried beans have pork in them which sucks for me since I'm allergic to pig, but all 5 of us loved the meal. Very pleased and a must-visit for anyone that prefers a less touristy Las Vegas experience.
