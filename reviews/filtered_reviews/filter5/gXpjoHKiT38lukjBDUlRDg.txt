This is the gem of Arizona - literally so delicious.

I've been coming here since I was about 5, so that's 16 years for me now. I'm from Scottsdale, so the commute is long - but worth it.

The refried beans are soooooo dank and all the rices are great. The jade chicken is delicious but oh my god the cookies... everytime we always get a stack of cookies to go.

The place looks questionable, yes. But this is a delicious establishment. Think of it as more charming. Holy crap - if I could make everyone go here I would. COME EAT HERE IT'S DELICIOUS AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!
