I love this place. So much.

Ever since Texano's in Tempe closed, Fiesta Burrito has been my go-to place for adobada burritos. A side of sour cream is a necessity with the adobada burrito and they give you a good portion for the price. I also like lots of pico and they have a big container of it inside at the salsa bar.

The machaca plate with egg (#11) is my second favorite. I always use the accompanying tortilla to make my own burrito, plus I get the rice and beans on the side. Yum.

The quesadilla supreme is also very good, but I would recommend eating it with a fork and knife, they really load it up.

Overall, I have never had anything bad from Fiesta and the staff is always super friendly. Plus there's a drive-thru. Awesome!
