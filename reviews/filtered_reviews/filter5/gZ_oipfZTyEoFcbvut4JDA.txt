This is a new restaurant in Scottsdale (less than a year I believe) and is located in Old Town.  We had heard a lot of good things and decided to give it a try.  It is a beautiful restaurant and was packed on the Thursday night that we were there.  We had an excellent waitress who really explained the entire menu and we chose to go the small plates route and were very happy with what we ordered.  The dish we all loved was their Grilled Street Corn with a delicious aioli sauce.  It was outstanding. We also had a grilled prawn salad, smoked Swordfish, Guacamole and chips, and one other dish that escapes me right now.  All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting. I would definitely go there again.
