We were visiting Gilbert and were looking for some good Mexican Food. As always we pull up our Yelp app on our smart phones to find the best local cuisine. La Ristra seemed to pique our interest. Sure glad we did, the food was great, salsa was hot and the Margaritas kicked butt. Our waiter Ivan was awesome and service was impeccable.

Glad we found this place and will be back in the future.
