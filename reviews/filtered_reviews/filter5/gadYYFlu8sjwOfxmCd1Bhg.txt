Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in downtown Las Vegas? Look no further.  La Comida has arrived.  

New restaurants are opening left and right in Las Vegas, especially in the downtown area.  One things for sure, La Comida is a refreshing change from your usual bar food, appetizers, and fried food.  Here at La Comida, you get authentic tasting Mexican dishes.  When you think of Morton's, their steakhouse, N9NE, Ghostbar, and Rain comes to mind.  And because this is a Morton's establishment, expect no less than quality, upscale, and great service. 

My first thought upon arriving here was "Wow".  Although this place was packed on their very first night, we were greeted by almost every staff member.  Smiles are free and we got them.  My second thought, another "Wow".  Las Vegas' who's who was here tonight.  I'm not going to mention names, but the energy was surely in the air tonight.  

There's seating indoors, at the bar, and at the patio outside.  The ambiance includes an attentive staff, wide open restaurant, and a ton of people watching.  Can you imagine this place on the weekend? This restaurant was extremely busy, but there's no rush once you're in and no one seems to be rushing you out.  In other words, this restaurant has a chill feel to it.

As for the food, you really can't go wrong.  Everything made here is authentic. The food was so authentic that I even had a tough time reading the menu.  But our lovely server, Camila, took the time to give us her recommendations and even gave me a short Spanish lesson. My main dish was their Carne de res a la Parrilla (beef skirt steak).  The steak is prepared to your liking on top of a bed of mushrooms and peppers.  The wild mushrooms were so good that I could eat a bowl of this stuff ala carte.  As for the steak itself, I wish I had seconds it was that juicy. Terri R had their Camaron de Golfo (buttered shrimp dish) and for dessert their Platanos Fritos (banana w/ice cream).  It's obvious that Terri loved her dish since she finished the whole thing.  Plus, she told me numerous times "I love my food".  

It's awesome when new restaurants open in Las Vegas, specifically Downtown Las Vegas. Owners Jenna and Michael Morton open it's doors today on an invite only with an expectation to open officially mid-week.  Jenna and Michael didn't miss a beat with their soft opening.  The restaurant was fully staffed, the talent at the bar kept patrons drinks full, and the ambiance matches what us locals expect at DTLV.  Even better, they took the time to meet, greet, and take photos with everyone.  My suggestion...visit or bookmark this place for a fun and happening dining experience.
