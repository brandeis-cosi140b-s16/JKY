I was thoroughly impressed with this place. Awesome beer (120 Minute? Are you kidding me?! How great!)! Great atmosphere with lots of TVs to watch the game and the food was wonderful. The enchiladas are fresh and tasty and the guacamole was wonderful! Kimmi, our server had a bubbly and fun personality. I would totally recommend this place to anyone in the Las Vegas area!
