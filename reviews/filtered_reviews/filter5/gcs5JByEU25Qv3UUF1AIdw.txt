My family has been going to Matta's for decades, first downtown Mesa and now at the new location. Their combo plates are amazing, but my favorite is the chile relle√±o, filled with meat and cheese with amazing green chile sauce . You can't get these anywhere else like this!! Super!! They also have great tamales. If you like chimichangas, Sandy's Special is great. All good food with excellent sauces.
