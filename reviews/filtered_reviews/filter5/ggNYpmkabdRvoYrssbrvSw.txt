Coworker recommended this place. All I can say is thank you! This place is amazing. In the west valley there isn't many restaurants to go but I'm going to add this to a must go place. The food is delicious, the restaurant is beautiful and colorful, and customer service is great. What more can you ask for? You should try it out. You won't be disappointed.
