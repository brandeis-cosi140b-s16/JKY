This place is great! We've lived in Old Town Scottsdale for 6 years and this is our go to spot for breakfast delivery. They always arrive on time or earlier than quoted, food and coffee always piping hot and 100% accurate. Delivery people and order takers always friendly. It's a great place for out of towners too...real old school diner feeling with malts and shakes.  Oh, and the chili fries are just like the ones from Coney Island in Detroit where I grew up!
