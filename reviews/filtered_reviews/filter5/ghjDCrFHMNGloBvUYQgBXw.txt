My FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant for over 30 years!!!   It's not just the delicious food but the staff and the owner.  They are my 2nd family!!!!  Jena is always a joy to see and goes above and beyond the call of duty with every customer.  She has a smile on her face, makes you feel welcome and hustles back in that kitchen like a BOSS!!!!  Danny.....well he is the BEST!  My daughter and I adore him and appreciate the kind, caring service he has given us for years!!!!  It's our "happy place" for food, great ambiance and smiling faces!!!
