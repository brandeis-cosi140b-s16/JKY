I had tried this place before for lunch and thought it was just OK.  I've since tried the brunch and, let me tell you, that's where it's at!  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  We sometimes plan our whole trip around making it to that weekend brunch.  It's outstanding!  Our favorites are the Steak & Eggs, Chilaquiles, and Coconut and French Toast.  Skip the shrimp BLT--pretty strange.
