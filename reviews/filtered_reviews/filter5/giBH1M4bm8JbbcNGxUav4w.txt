Chuy's is a breath of tex mex air to Charlotte. For over a decade I have pined away for true Mexican food and now I have found it. 
Everything is great here. My current crush is the steak tacos al carbon. If this is your first time here you have to have the fajitas. I also like the flautas. Great kids menu and the patio is heated with TVs. The service is fast and friendly. 
The Perfect Margarita is near perfect -  good amount of tequila.
