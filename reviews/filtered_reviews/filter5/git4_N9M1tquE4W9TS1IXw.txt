This place has the best street tacos in Central Phoenix. I generally come here for lunch and order the tacos but they have lots of other great stuff. They also have a store here where you can get soda, beer, snacks, etc. They have a really good bakery here also. They do all their grilling over wood and the food has that great flavor. I sometimes get chicken and ribs to go from here and it is always really good. This place has been in Phoenix a very long time, I know I have been coming here for over 15 years and I will keep going back!
