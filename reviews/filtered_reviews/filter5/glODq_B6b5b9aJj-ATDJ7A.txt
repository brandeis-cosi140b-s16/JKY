I wasn't in the mood for Mexican food before showing up here but my mood quickly changed.  I judge a Mexican restaurant mainly on basic staples: tortilla chips, salsa, guacamole, and quality of the meat.  If these are great, then everything else is good.  Everything was top notch.  The guacamole was fresh and delicious, the standout was the carnitas.  Very tender and flavorful.

Don't think about it, just go to Javier's!
