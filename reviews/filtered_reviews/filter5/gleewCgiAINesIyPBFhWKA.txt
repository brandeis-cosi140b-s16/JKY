Absolutely love this place!!!!   Have been here twice with about a group of 10 or more and each time was fantastik!!!  Our waiters were very friendly and ON TOP of it everytime!!  The manager, Brent, was also very involved in making sure we had a GREAT time!  Even though one of our peeps was a little sad they didnt offer dessert, Brent did NOT disappoint!!!!  . 

Along with their great staff, they have wonderful food too!!!!  Their chips and guacamole are sooo tasty and the tacos are a must try!!!  Oh, and you cant beat all day happy hour on sundays!!!!   Thank you for making it a great night!
