After living in San Diego for a few years, I was in desperate need of an authentic TJ Style taco, and I have found it here! They serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings. If they man working there tells you a salsa is hot, take his recommendation and don't pour it all over your taco, because chances are, it's really freaking hot!
I recommend beef tongue if they have it, but if not, chicken is my second choice. 

No other Pittsburgh taco place compares to Las Palmas for me! 

The tacos are $2.50 and 2 will fill me up. (Cash Only for tacos, cards inside the store)
