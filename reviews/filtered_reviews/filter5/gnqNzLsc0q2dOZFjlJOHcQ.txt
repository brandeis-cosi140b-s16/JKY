I don't even know where to start. This place is amazing! From the atmosphere to the plating. Service was amazing. Amber did a great job. Everything in this place is top notch. We received a free sample of "Aqua fresco" the cantaloupe flavor and it was fantastic. Then these amazing chips and salsa (three amazing flavors). To top it off the chef came out and greeted us, gave us a free sample of flan. Paco you the best man! You could tell he was very proud of his hard work and you can feel it too. Oh and checked in for a free margarita!  Don't pass up this place. Lol oh wait we almost did. It's inside the gentleman's club parking lot. But don't let the location fool you, this is a must top.
