The last stop on the Taco Trek for our group.  This place also has an al pastor wheel but I got a carne asada taco Azteca style which means it comes with a fresh grilled cactus pad.  I love cactus can this was super good!  Also, you can get at no extra charge, grilled vegetables to go with your taco.  When I saw it consisted of grilled scallions and two grilled peppers--one a jalape√±o, I had to get the veggies.

The taco was very tasty and I ate the onions and peppers almost as a side dish.  Another thing different about El Gordo is that you can get either flour or corn tacos.  I got the corn this time and it was quite flavorful.  The tacos here are smaller than at the other places we stopped, but they are good and worth the price with the vegetable dish.  At $2, the place is on par with the other taco places in the area.

A little difference with this place is that you pick up a tray and place your ordered dishes on it.  Then you go to the cashier and pay for what you ordered.  It's very much cafeteria style.  Last night was quite busy and when our group arrived, we got a lot of stares.

A good stop of the Taco Trek!
