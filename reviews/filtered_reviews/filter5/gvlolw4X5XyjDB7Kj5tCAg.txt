Stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Doesn't look like much outside and only has 11 tables inside. Appears carry out is big for them. We ate in and were very excited at the list of authentic dishes and options on the menu. My sister had a veggie dish with cactus as the 'meat' and She LOVED it! My alpastor carcinitos(??) was excellent. My daughter loved the chicken tacos. We will be back!!
