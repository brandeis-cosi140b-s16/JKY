The way I ended up coming to this joint is far from typical.  Matter of fact, it's so far from typical that most of my friends questioned my insanity for even showing up on a random school night during twilight.  That said, it's really a good story but I shall save that for another time.

Not only is it tucked away in a very cool / scenic part of Scottsdale, but the layout is vast, expansive and impressive.

The patio has personality.  This is important when one lives in a place where outside dining is preferable for eight months out of the year.

The help / service were impeccable and everything I tried was tasty and affordable.  If you can get behind the culture and history of born & bred Phoenix family stories, this is one not to be missed.

I'll be back without question!
