This place is a gem downtown. The decor is nice and eclectic, very Dia de los Muertos. The bar has a vast tequila and mescal selection. The menu is friendly for someone like me (vegan and gluten free), and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. They were playing one of my favorite albums, Los Lobos Kiko and always seem to have good tunes playing. Try the veggie fajitas...
