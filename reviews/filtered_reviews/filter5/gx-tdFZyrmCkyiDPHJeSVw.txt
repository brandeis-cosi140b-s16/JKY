Dick's has that special something - the allure of the secret spot, your proximity to food coaxed by open flame, the forced intimacy, the darkness on the edge of visibility... and booze.

It's the food of Richardson's within a speakeasy atmosphere. Quirky rustic  ambiance served with a meaty, habanero kick. Great for an adventurous early date where you want to see if the other person "gets it", and to "get some" later if they do get it. And of course, an old reliable that you suddenly perk up and remember when you think you've run out of options for a great casual meal.

Also, the private room/wine cellar is a great option for smallish family gatherings, company events and holiday parties. The reservation fee completely applies to the tab and the enivronment itself keeps the conversation moving.

Don't ever change Dick's! (does that need a comma somewhere?)
