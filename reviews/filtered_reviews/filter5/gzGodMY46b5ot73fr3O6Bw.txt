First Carniceria to open in Pittsburgh in years!! 
I'm Argentinean, I'm exited to say that they even carry asado (beef ribs) at a very reasonable price. The owners are great, make sure you let them know of anything needed (I have asked for tapas de empanadas); most of the items they carry are Mexican style foods and other Latin American countries. 
They also have marinated fajita meat (beef, pork and chicken) spicy but not too much. Last time I went in there they were roasting a pork, my husband said it was delicious! One new thing I noticed is chicken milanesa, one more thing to try, very easy to cook and the pieces are big!

I'm glad we have the this butcher in town. My family is very happy. And I support local stores!!
