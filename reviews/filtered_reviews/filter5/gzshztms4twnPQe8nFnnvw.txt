Just got back from dinner and it was sooo good.  We had a party of 4 and were seated right away. Waiter was very attentive and food was great.  We usually go to the McKelleps restaurant but just found out about this one.  We are in trouble this is so close to our house.   Have never been seated so quickly the food was very good and plentiful.  We love Mexican food and this the best.
