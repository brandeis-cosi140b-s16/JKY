Truly my favorite Mexican food restaurant of all time. No place in Scottsdale even compares. Trust me.
I average about 5 burritos per week. They help me stay fit and healthy. The more I eat, the better I feel about myself and the world around me. They are very nicely priced and are delivered by some of the city's finest and hardest working chefs.
My total Fiesta burrito count (I only get burritos) is rapidly approaching the 600 range, and I must say that the top contender is the California. I highly recommend the California to both beginners and experienced Mexican food eaters alike. The shredded beef burrito and carne asada burrito are also fine options if you are looking to delve into some of earth's most delectable fruits.
