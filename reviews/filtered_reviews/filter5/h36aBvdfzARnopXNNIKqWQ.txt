I ordered the weekly special, which were (2) HUGE Calamari Fusion Tacos and my other ordered her favorite, the bulgogi fusion tostada. I can speak for both orders, but I'll stick to my tacos.

I feel like they were hands down, the best calamari tacos I've ever eaten...not that I've ever had a calamari taco, but these took the place of all of my previous favorite meat-fillers like bulgogi, pork, carnitas, etc.  The calamari was as tender as whitefish with a super crunchy batter that's been seasoned perfectly.  The quality of all the ingredients were superb! I still don't know how they can keep the food and service quality so high and manage consistently low prices.  The owner was kind enough to grace us with her presence for a couple of minutes of friendly conversation; as she is the role model for business owners/operators.

Bravo!!!
