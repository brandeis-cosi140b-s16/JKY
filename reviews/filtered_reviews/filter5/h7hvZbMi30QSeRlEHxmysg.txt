Ok first let me say really pricey BUT well worth it! Chicken Mole or steak fajitas are a must when I come here. The ceviche is like none other I've ever had! Fresh guacamole and great service! The waiters here were really nice and very attentive! I love coming here wether in Vegas or Newport. Javier's has really authentic Mexican food. Taste like home cooking!
