Many less than stellar reviews seem to be for dinners, or after shows when the crowd may be too much to handle for this place.  

However, we went for BRUNCH on a Sunday at 11am.  We had a party of 6 people and were able to make RESERVATIONS.  Seats inside and outside, where food can be enjoyed on an outdoor terrace overlooking Mandalay Bay's fabulous lazy river and wave pool.  

Too far down strip for you?  Catch the Deuce or the SDX on Las Vegas BLVD.  We caught the SDX from the Bellagio and it was a quick ride and well worth the trip.  

Without a doubt, this is the best brunch I've ever had.  What's more surprising is that this falls in the top 3 meals I've ever eaten - breakfast, lunch or dinner.  

The deal is all you can eat small plates for $34.99; choose to add bottomless Mimosas (Cucumber, Pomegranate, Strawberry, Passion Fruit, et al) for $8.00.  As an example, we paid $30 for a fabulous buffet brunch at the Aria; but for $4.99 more Border Grill was like a serious fine food experience.  

We were able to try the Bacon Jalapeno PBJ, Peruvian Shrimp and Grits, Skirt Steak and Egg, Bread Pudding French Toast, Yucatan Egg Benedict, Biscuits and Sausage Gravy, Frittata Tart, Short Rib Hash and Egg, Churro Tots, Waffle and Pork Belly, Sweet Potato Pancake, Brisket Omelet and Fig and Blue Cheese Quasadilla.  My personal favorite was the Guava Empenadas.  Each and every one of these easily blew away the finest the Aria had to offer.  Least favorite was the Frittata.  Please do not misunderstand, the Frittata was excellent,  but it was like choosing between Labron and MJ, someone has to  lose.   Consensus had short rib hash was a heavy favorite, followed by the Shrimp and Grits, Brisket Omelet, the....oh, damn.  Seriously too hard to choose.  

Just go to brunch there, already.  Stop reading.  You won't find a better tasting brunch, I guarantee.
