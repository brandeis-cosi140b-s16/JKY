My husband and I discovered this gem of a Mexican restaurant and we love it! We have already been back a few times. The food is amazing to say the least! The staff has been extremely friendly and already recognizes us when we come in. The restaurant is really nice and has great ambiance. They have awesome happy hours 7 days a week from 4-6pm and then again from midnight - 2am.
