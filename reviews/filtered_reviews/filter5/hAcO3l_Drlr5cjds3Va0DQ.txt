I took my girlfriend here on one of our very first dates, fast forward almost 2 years later and we still go to this place. They have great food, and great costumer service to top everything off. The place has a nice vibe to it and really helps to enjoy the food. Eating here is more than just eating at a normal restaurant, It is an experience. Braddahs has been a large part of me and my girlfriend's relationship, it's our to go to food whenever we get hungry.  And we still can't get enough of their food.

P.s their bowl is amazing !
