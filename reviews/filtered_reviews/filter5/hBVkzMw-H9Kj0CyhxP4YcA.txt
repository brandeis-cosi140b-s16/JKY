Went there this past Tuesday. I was very impressed with  the decor as soon as I walked in. The service was outstanding to say the least.  Then there was the food. I had the chili verdi.  It was awsome, or as we would say where  I grew up, wicked pissa.  This is one place  I will frequent again. And,I will be sure to pass the word on to my friends
