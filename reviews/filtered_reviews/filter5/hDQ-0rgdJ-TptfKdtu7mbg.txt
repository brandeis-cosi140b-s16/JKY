Street tacos to die for.  The Carne Asada is smokey, spicy, and freaking delicious.  The red sauce on the burro was great as well.  All the food was spicy not bland, the beans and rice were wonderful.  Lots of people in the line but it clears in about 10 minutes from line to order to eating.  Definitely worth a try.
