Just finished up their Standard Burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, and a Salted Dulce de Leche Milkshake. Contrary to it's name, this isn't just a Stand. This is something much more rare, and better than most chain burger places. The Stand has managed to do what most places fail to do, be really good at a couple of items on the menu rather than a lists of only decent items. 

The limited menu at the Stand is there for a reason. Order anything on there and it is almost guaranteed to be a satisfying experience for you. Their Dulce de Leche Shake is a nice mixture of milky, carmel-ly goodness that is a nice compliment to their rich and meaty tacos and burgers. 

Definitely make a stop here if you ever have the chance!
