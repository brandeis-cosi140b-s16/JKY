Found this place on Yelp as it was close to my hotel and some Mexican sounded good. Reviews were good, so I set off into 96 degree weather and walked over. Would have been hard to fine if I hadn't had directions, but the food was great and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I had the carnitas burrito which was fresh and amazing. Their homemade hot sauce was superb as well. Highly recommend!
