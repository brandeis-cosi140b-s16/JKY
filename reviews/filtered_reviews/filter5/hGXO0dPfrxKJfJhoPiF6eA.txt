I waited until I'd been here twice before reviewing and I'm pleased to say both times it was a 5 star experience. 

Delicious food, great menu, super cool atmosphere and vitally, really friendly staff. 

I was a big Gallo Blanco fan before it closed so that's what got me here. The Tacos are still delicious and the Tortas are amazing. 

A perfect location for Sunday brunch on the patio with friends. I can't wait to come back here for dinner too.
