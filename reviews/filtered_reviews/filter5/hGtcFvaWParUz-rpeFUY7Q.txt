Favorite place in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for groups and dates. I had my birthday brunch their this year with my twin sister and they accommodated us great for a large group of 20. Sunday brunch buffet is the best for the pork tacos, all you can eat for $16. The ghost sauce is amazing but use with caution. Also ask for the baby taster frozen margaritas of the day. Then order them mixed if you like both of them. Best margaritas in town. Be bold don't go with a skinny one here. They are worth the extra calories. Table side guacamole is MUST HAVE!

ENJOY!
