Best Mexican I've ever had - really. Try the Borrego en Chile Pasilla (lamb in a heavy pungent sauce with a kick) or the Cochinita Pibil (pork marinated in citrus with pickled onions - complex and layered).the rice and beans don't overwhelm the entrees. Atmosphere is typical Mexican colors of red and orange, but the original artwork sets it apart. I'll be here again within a week.
