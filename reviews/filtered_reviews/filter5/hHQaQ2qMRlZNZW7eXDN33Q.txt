Feels very welcoming. The staff is friendly and helpful with choices. The food is very affordable & high quality. I couldn't believe the size of the stuffed baked potato I got! Everything was delicious. Went with a group of 4 friends, each ordering something different, each loving what they ordered. Would definitely go back!
