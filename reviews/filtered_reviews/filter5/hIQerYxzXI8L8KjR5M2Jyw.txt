I absolutely LOVE this place, but I have heard that people either love it or hate it, so your mileage may vary.

First off, everything is a la carte. There are no "combo platters" or anything like that. You order what you want. (don't forget the Yelp check-in special for free chips and salsa!)

Don't expect "sit-down" Mexican restaurant with waitstaff, plates, and silverware. If you think of it more like a stationary food truck, you may have a better idea of what this place is all about. I have tried everything on the menu and have not been disappointed. Unlike some other reviewers, I have not experienced the "dry meat" syndrome, although sometimes we have seen pretty light cheese on the quesadillas. The "Papa Loca" is something I have not seen on the menu anywhere else, and it is both tasty and filling, but I really prefer the tacos and gorditas. My wife and kids really like the quesadillas. Don't forget to grab some sauces, pico, and salsa from the salsa bar to dress up your tacos -- they are traditional and very simply prepared. Therein lies the beauty. 

The place is small and can get VERY crowded, but service generally remains pretty fast. I have not been there on "taco Tuesday" when they drop the price on their tacos, but I can imagine the place becomes a veritable zoo.  

I found the beans to be a little bland, but anyone who has made real refried beans at home knows that many recipes don't call for a lot of seasoning in the beans -- that way, you can add that after the fact with toppings and salsas.

The horchata is worth getting: it always tastes fresh.
