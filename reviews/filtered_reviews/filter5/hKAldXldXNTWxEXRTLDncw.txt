I fell in love with Diablo's about 6 years ago and have frequent the place every time I go to Vegas. I try to taste new things each time I go, but I usually cannot stray away from the nachos.  They are fantastic and can feed about 5 people. This time, we were successful in trying new dishes.  I picked the tortilla soup.  It was packed full of stuff that was all amazing.  Extremely cheesy, I slurped up every bit of this soup.  Brian went with an app that they have called the BBQ corn tamale cakes.  The were cute little masa cakes topped full of BBQ pork and rainbows.  That is how I felt it was.  What amazing dish! Well prepared and beautifully presented. An awesome bartender, that I am sure has been there since opening day and a pitcher of citrus mojitos, this afternoon was complete.
