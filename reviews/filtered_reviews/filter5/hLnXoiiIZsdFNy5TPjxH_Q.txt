Best Mexican food ever created. Don't worry about the prices, your tastebuds will thank you later.

Came here my first night back in Scottsdale in a few years. The place was buzzing; we waited fifteen minutes in the gorgeous front patio area with a couple of over-priced Stella Artois. We were soon escorted to our table on the back patio.

The place was decorated beautifully and with southwestern class. Dress to impress here, but also don't fret if you're wearing shorts and a collared shirt; everyone is welcome here.

We began with table-side guacamole, which was prepared with ease and efficiency. Made with some heat to our liking; we finished it before our entrees. My girlfriend and I shared the pork shoulder tacos, which came highly recommended, with a habe√±ero pineapple sauce, and small dishes of chopped onions, shredded cheese, and cilantro to add to the mix. 

Handmade corn tortillas served on a hot Himalayan salt block, absolutely exquisite. 

The do-not-miss side dish we ordered was the Peruvian Street Corn, (offered on, or off-the-cob) which came with a lime wedge to squeeze over the top. Incredible complex flavors of sweet, tangy, and savory. We started adding it to our tacos and wow, we were blown away.

For dessert we shared the pumpkin bread pudding which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served warm; a great way to end our meal. 

Our service was a little scattered, only because the place was slammed. However the food was some seriously inspired cuisine, with flavors hitting every desirable note imaginable. 

I'd come back again and highly recommend this place to anyone willing to spend $75+ on an unbelievable meal for two.
