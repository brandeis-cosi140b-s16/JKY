We have been faithful customers of this restaurant since it opened! We are people who eat out A LOT, and the food here is outstanding!! We always go with the New Mexican Traditional burrito plate with adovado pork with green sauce. It is spicy but FULL of flavor! All of their homemade salsas are great too! One thing we love here is the customer service! The owners are extremely friendly and have learned who we are. Our young daughter has severe food allergies to many things so they know she can only eat the tortilla chips! They are so kind & gracious to her! We highly recommend this family owned & operated place! You will not be disappointed!!
