For the sheltered American, it may take a bit of bravery to experience Gordo. It is not in the most pleasant neighborhood, it is very authentic Mexican, and there is a little bedlam going on when ordering while the place is busy. Be a little more brave when you get up to the counter and order things like tongue and tripa (intestines). If you can get your mind past your American upbringing, explosive flavors await. Do not expect anything past bare-bones decor and service at Gordo, because it certainly does not care about them either. This place is driven toward one goal: fast, tasty, authentic Mexican fare. And it not only reaches that goal, it kicks it in the balls and then stomps all over it (in a good way).
