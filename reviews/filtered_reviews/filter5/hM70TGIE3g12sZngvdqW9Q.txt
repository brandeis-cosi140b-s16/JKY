Used a groupon here at Papi Chulo's and it's a pretty cool place... After looking at the menu we chose to get the Nachos for our appetizer which was a great choice. The cheese was nice and melted, the sour cream was yummy, the guacamole was good... The jalape√±os were not very hot but still good... 

I chose the Sizzling Shredded Beef Enchiladas which came with rice and beans. Wow! So the sizzling dish is actually very yumzo! The shredded beef is juicy and tender. Also the rice and beans are standard rice and beans but very good too. 

This was a great dish and I am looking forward to my next visit and groupon to Papi Chulos 

Oh I almost forgot our server was on it as well, he wasn't over bearing but he was very tentative, nice, and just very professional. Great job :)
