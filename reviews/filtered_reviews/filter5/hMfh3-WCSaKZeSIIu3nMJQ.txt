I was so happy when they opened their North Phoenix location!  It's definitely a "styrofoam" kind of atmosphere, but sometimes that's how the best food comes.  You can buy fresh tortillas which are delicious, and their salsa should be a controlled substance because it is so addictive.  Some of their items are generic, but others are phenomenal.  My favorite are the crispy chicken tacos.  I could eat those every day.  The breakfast burritos are good too.  And if menudo is your thing, theirs is tasty.  If you have a lot of people to feed and not a lot of money, this place is a delicious option.
