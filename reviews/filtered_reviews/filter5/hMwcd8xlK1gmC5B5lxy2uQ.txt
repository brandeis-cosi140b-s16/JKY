There are a lot of really good Mexican restaurants in the valley of the sun, but this place stands out in my opinion.  When you walk in you'll notice the vibrant colors and beautiful decor.  They have couple of TV's in the place.  The place was very clean, and had a good vibe in the area.  The food was fresh and service was top notch.
