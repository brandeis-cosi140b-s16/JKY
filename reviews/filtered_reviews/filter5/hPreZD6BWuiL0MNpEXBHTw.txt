I can't say enough good things about this place!

We went here on a whim early one Saturday night, and we weren't disappointed!  The atmosphere was really cool, and our waitress was very kind and genuine with great recommendations.

We ordered several tacos and apps, and the crispy fried chicken, shrimp, fried oyster, and carnitas tacos were our favorite.  I don't know what they put in that zesty sauce, but it's perfect! I also really liked the balance and texture of the different toppings on each taco. I'd also recommend ordering the special queso to go with the tacos, because isn't everything better with cheese sauce to dip it in?!?

Oh, and the WINGS--- you absolutely have to order the wings!! My husband and I are big foodies, and I have to say, these are the best wings we've ever had.  (I know, weird considering this is supposed to be a Mexican place lol).  The slight crispy texture, the sweet and yet spicy glaze sauce, and the horseradish crema on top were just phenomenal!

Their version of Guac was really the only thing I wasn't a fan of, but other than that, a flawless experience!
