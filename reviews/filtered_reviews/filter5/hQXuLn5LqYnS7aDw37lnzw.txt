Wow!! Went here for the 4.5 star Yelp review. We give it 5 stars. It's a little strange being next door to a "gentlemens" club with nothing else around. Best habanero salsa ever!! Hot, hot, hot. Sandy had a jalapeno and cucumber Margarita which she said was awesome. Great tacos. Topped it off with the best flan we've ever had. Bar none. We will probably go here again before we leave in a few days. Excellent!!
