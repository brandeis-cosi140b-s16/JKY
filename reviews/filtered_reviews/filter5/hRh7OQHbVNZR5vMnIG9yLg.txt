Food- great tasting food! big portions- enough to bring back to your room to eat at 4am when you're starving! 

Drinks- Awesome drink specials during happy hour! Cheap shots and margaritas are refreshing!

Location- Ideal! Located in the Miracle Mile shops, it's perfect if you stay at the Elara like we do!

Service- awesome! I really felt taken care of. We were seated right away and our server was very attentive. We never had to try to get her attention which is always a plus.

Cost- Vegas is expensive, but this place won't break your wallet. With the big portions you can take what you don't finish and eat it later. And of course- did I mention the drink specials?

Sure, this is a chain Mexican restaurant- but this place does a solid job and they deserve a 5 star rating.
