Chilaquiles... OMG the chilaquiles!

In case you don't know, chilaquiles is a Mexican dish of fried softened tortilla chips covered with salsa or mole and cheese and broiled. They are one of my favorite foods and I've ordered them at countless places. Border Grill gets them right. Very right!

If you don't care for chilaquiles, this review isn't for you.
