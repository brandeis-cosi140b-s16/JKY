Good selection of music, with the volume just right.  One of the things i noticed was  the on the burgers I had, there was the perfect ratio of bread and burger.  No chocking down a bun and feeling overstuffed.  The sweet potato tots are of the things that make you wonder " Why did this take so long to be invented?"  Five stars, and I don't give them out frivolously.
