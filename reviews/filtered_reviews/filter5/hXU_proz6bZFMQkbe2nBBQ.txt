If you're looking for a good authentic taco, look no further! This place was delicious. The steak tacos and shredded beef are great! They have a little topping bar set up with many choices of salsas and toppings. We had never been here before and it was a little confusing So for all you first timers, you go inside the store and pay, then you give the grill guy your ticket. The only sucky thing is there really is nowhere to sit. But when the food is this good, they can get away with it. Only 2.50 a taco. We each got 3 tacos and we were full, can't beat it!
