The fish tacos are brilliant! My wife and I went here for exactly that and have Zero complaints. The dish in the tacos is cut into large chucks and cooked perfectly, something uncommon for fish tacos elsewhere.  The tortillas are lightly fried but with no greasiness, only crisp and fluffy.

Ambience was good, nothing special there. Beer list consisted of national staples and some local fav's.

I even took my father-in-law here who is a fish taco connoisseur from CA and he said they beer better that any fish taco he's had in CA, including Rubio's.
