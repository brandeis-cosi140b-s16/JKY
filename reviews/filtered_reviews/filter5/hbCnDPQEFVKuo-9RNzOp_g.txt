Let me start by saying I love Mexican food, I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!! They have really great Mexican food! I LOVE the breakfast burritos. They are the perfect ratio of tortillas to ingredients, meaning they are perfect in size.....they aren't so huge you can only eat 1/3. I love the enchiladas, tacos, beans, and rice. This place is also very convenient as well as you can call ahead and pick up food in the drive thru line!
