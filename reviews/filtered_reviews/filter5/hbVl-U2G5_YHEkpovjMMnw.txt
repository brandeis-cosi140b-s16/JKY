The best Tacos I have eaten in a restaurant. Only my mom can make them better. By far the best. Taste so good, smell and look good. Lines-wait time- well that does suck but hey quality takes time right. But damn I drove two hours and waiting in line one hour and I can tell you it was worth it!!!!!! They have a customer for life. Have gone to San Diego by I-5 and to TJ MEX I love it. All places have long wait time. No matter what time of the day. There is a line waiting before they even open  but worth the wait.
