I am so expressed by the courtesy of the manager of this restaurant when my Agency had a fund raiser at the Arizona Cafe.  He invited our team to have lunch, gratis, after all the work we had done.  

The service was excellent and the food very good.  I had the carnitas which were a little spicy for my liking but there was plenty of it and take home provided a lunch the next day.  I have GERD so maybe if I had not just had a stressful week, they would have agreed more with me.  The second lunch I had a few days later, a salad was even better, very fresh with a dressing that was not overpowering as they can be.  Once again, excellent service.

The only thing I regret was the weather was on the cold side.  It looked like the patio would have been a beautiful setting for a nice lunch.

I have no issues with suggesting you try the Canyon Cafe.
