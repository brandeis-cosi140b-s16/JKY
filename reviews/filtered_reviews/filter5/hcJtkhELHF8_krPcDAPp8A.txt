Took us a few times up and down the block to find this place but it was definitely worth it. Great food, the ribs, queso and scallops were amazing. The ribs were by far the favorite though. Great drink selection. Loved having the grill behind the bar so you can see your food being cooked. Friendly staff and great service!
