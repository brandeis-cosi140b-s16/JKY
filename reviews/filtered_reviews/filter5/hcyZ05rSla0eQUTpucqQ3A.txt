After finding the Hippie Burger Joint closed at 3pm - we made our way to The Stand. We were immediately welcomed and given a brief run-down of how the restaurant prepares its food and where they get it from. When the food came about five minutes after the order, we were treated to some of the best hamburgers we've had in a long time. The house-made chocolate milkshake topped it off and it was bar none the best milkshake I have had.
