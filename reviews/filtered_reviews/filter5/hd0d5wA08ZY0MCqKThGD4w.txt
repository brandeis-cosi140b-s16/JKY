Dude. . . It feels like you are walking the streets of Tijuana. This place is fantastic.  Busy all day and all night. There is no better place to go after some long hard vegas partying. It's a little pricy for the size of the tacos but hands down the only Mexican food better than taco y taco. . . Too bad they don't serve cerveza!!
