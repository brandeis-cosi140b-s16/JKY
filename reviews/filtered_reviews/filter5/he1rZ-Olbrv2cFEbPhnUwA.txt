Great service and great food! Extremely family friendly, and most of the time, there's a live musician setting an authentic mood.
I come here often with my daughter (16 mos), because they take very good care of you. They bring out a small plate of rice, veggies and meat for the little one(s) very early, sometimes before I've made up my mind about what I want to eat. 
The tortillas are made fresh, you can watch the lady make them, and so is the guacamole, which they'll put together right in front of you.
Oh, and if you think decorations stop at the bathroom door, think twice. These bathrooms are NICE! I know that's an odd thing to notice, but it did make an impression on me. :)
They're also honest about their mistakes. My friend and I wanted to try a new dessert they were offering. We had already paid for it, when the manager found out they didn't have anymore, so he gave us TWO desserts of our choice, even though we had only paid for one.
