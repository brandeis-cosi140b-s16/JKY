Incredible Mexican food. My wife and I come here every time we are in Vegas and have never had a bad experience. We always go for lunch and sit along the canal so that we can watch and listen to the gondoliers. 

Margaritas are great and we typically order a pitcher of the Canonito Margaritas. Pork Barbacoa, Filet Mignon, Vaquero ribs, Mussels are all to die for and you are just about guaranteed that your meal will be of top quality for a very fair price. 

Wait staff is nice and attentive; the only drawback is the receptionists; they seemed to be preoccupied with anything other than tending to the customers.
