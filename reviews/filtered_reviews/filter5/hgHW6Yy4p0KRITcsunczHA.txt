Best Breakfast Burrito I've had so far in Peoria. 
I normally LOVE straight Mexican breakfast burritos. But I've been eating healthy lately and I tried their BEEF CHORIZO BREAKFAST BURRITO recently and I was Truly Amazed!! 
It was NOT greasy
It was perfect size and amount if eggs potatoes and chorizo and their Spicy Mayo sauce OMG Amaze!!
I will definitely go back and try more items in their Menu!! 
Bwt their service is awesome and fast
