This place is amazing. The food is fantastic the service is top notch the ambience is luxurious. We ordered the Wagyu beef Nigiri sushi and it was phenomenal. We also ate a lot of the different specialty sushi rolls and they were really good too. The tuna tartar was served on ice in a real coconut and it was super delicious.
