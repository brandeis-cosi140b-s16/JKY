Housed in the downtown design center, Mundo is in a great spot --  especially if you are excited about the soon-to-be Smith Performing Arts Center and like the idea of a swanky and fun place off-strip. The decor is nice but not at all stale or formal. The service is very attentive, food delish, and the drinks delightful. Go now!
