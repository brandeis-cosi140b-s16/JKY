Will definitely be going back soon. Al pastor and lengua tacos were really good. The meat was great quality. Aguas frescas are amazing especially strawberry mixed with horchata and the spinach one is so good and refreshing. They let you sample all of them. Street corn is also yummy. Next time I'll have to try the shrimp cocktail.
