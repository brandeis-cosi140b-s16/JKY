I am going to give this a 5 star based on every aspect of the meal. Our food was off the chart and best Mexican/Tex-Mex I have had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area yet.  Must, must, must, must try the roasted corn (did I say a must try the roasted corn). This place is amazing - this makes all my other 5 star reviews feel like a four.  I know know what a true five star is!  Again - if in the area you MUST go.  The margaritas are awesome and did I say you must try the corn???  Well done Blanco - we will be back often!!!!
