I'm a fan! The service was great- the man running the business (is his name actually Phrank?) was great and took the time to chat with me. The prices are all very reasonable and the food is delicious as well! I had the fish tacos place which comes with rice and beans and is enough for a meal, but I indulged my sweet tooth and went for the chimi cheesecake as well. The fish on the tacos is breaded lightly and the sauce on them is delicious. The salsa was fresh and had a very small kick (I went for the mild). The chimi cheesecake was also good- very sweet and very filling, the serving size is good for 2.  I will definitely be coming back here!
