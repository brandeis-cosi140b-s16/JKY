I am so thrilled to have found this restaurant. I went without looking at any rating and boy was a surprised with this little, hole in the wall, blink and you miss it eatery. We are broke like most are and there has been a natural gas crew working in our neighborhood so our gas was for cooking was all but cut off, so we decided to try this little Mexican restaurant we had a 2 for 1 entree coupon for. We both had the carnitas and a margarita each. The salsa and chips were warm and FABULOUS, the carnitas were perfectly seasoned with crispy edges/bits and the margaritas were pretty good. All in all it was a delicious meal with fast friendly service. I do recommend it highly, and we will be going back. 

2 entrees + 2 margaritas = $ 9.36

CAN'T BE BEAT - YUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMY !!!
