Love this place - good food, service and price!! 

The breakfast burritos are awesome! The Chicken California Burrito is great! Same with the Taco Salad with Chicken. Haven't tried one thing I don't like. 

Used to go there 2-3 times a week until I moved. Now it's a wonderful treat when I visit PHX.
