Great food and super friendly service. My friend and I walked in with our brood, and the guy working the line proceeded to make us a bowl full of samples of meat for everyone to try. All of them were great. 

It's set up "chipotle style", full of unique Hawaiian flavors. The charred pineapple verde was DELICIOUS and adds the most unique flavor, without being weird. The guac was superb, couldn't have been better. They even have bean sprouts, and you can't go wrong with those.

They also have these little bottles of sweet sauces. One is pineapple mango jalapeño (mild) and the other is raspberry jalapeño (medium), I believe. They're sweet and packed with flavor, def worth a try. 

I forgot to grab the coconut bark, but that just gives me a reason to go back. Not that I needed another one!
