I love this place! The vibe is so romantic, perfect for couples! The serve you complimentary warm chips and salsa first. The margaritas were good and loved the taquitos, although the were a bit hard to cut. The guac is also very good, but make sure you save your warm chips because the guac literally had 3 chips only. One of my favorite places in Vegas to grab a drink and some food.
