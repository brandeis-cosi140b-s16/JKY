Arriba's is great. They have definitely changed management at this location, because a few years back it was awful, but the last 1-2 years it has been awesome. We make the decision to sit in the bar area, as service is almost guaranteed to be excellent.  The bartenders they have are both friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We never have to wait for a refill on either a mixed drink or a soft drink.

Their happy hour is great, 1/2 priced apps. that are so filling you won't need a main entree! If you opt for one, split it, as it will be more than enough. Food quality is very good, and we always enjoy our time there. 

Keep it up!!
