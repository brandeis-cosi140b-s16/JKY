Yum! My friends and I went to Braddahs today for lunch and can't wait to go back. I had the salad with Kalua pig and grilled veggies, black beans and brown rice, topped with sesame gingerette salad dressing and grilled pineapple salsa. So delicious! The pork was so tender and flavorful. We were given samples of the chicken and steak and they were all so good that it was hard to choose. The staff was super friendly and explained everything since it was our first visit. The owner is great... he spoke with us us several times, offering recommendations and and explaining his concept and background. As great as lunch was, by far the most amazing part of the meal was the coconut bark. It is the perfect combination of sweet and salty and melts in your mouth. Can't wait to go back!
