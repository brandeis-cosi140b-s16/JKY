Went on a weekday afternoon over ASU's summer break and was treated to amazing service. The women working the front were incredibly warm and welcoming and made sure we were never in need of chips, salsa, or drinks.

Clare burro with green sauce was fantastic. Loved the whole beans and how messy and flavorful the whole dish was.
