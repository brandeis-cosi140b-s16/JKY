We ordered two bowls, two burritos. They were all great. The bowls are bigger than they seem and they stuff it. Same with the burritos. Everything tasted great, not a bad price by any means. I misordered one of the bowls and they were more than happy just to add the other meat to it. They were really nice and gave us samples of the 3 types of meat they offer as soon as we walked in. First time there and we will definitely he returning.
