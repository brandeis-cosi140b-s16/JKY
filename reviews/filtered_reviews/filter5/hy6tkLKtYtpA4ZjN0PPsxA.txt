I really enjoyed this restaurant! Best restaurant in Mandalay bay. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere is great. There is outside seating and indoor seating area. 

The guacamole was fantastic! Worth the extra cost. I would highly recommend it. 

The tamales were wonderful. I got the green corn ones and they were sweet, moist and omg--- delicious!

The fish taco meal was perfect size. Not too much food but definitely would fill you up. The fish was very flaky and tender. 

The carnitas were tender and extremely flavorful. The sides completed the meat with and outstanding hand made flour tortilla. 

The dessert was----- WONDERFUL. We tried the tres leches
