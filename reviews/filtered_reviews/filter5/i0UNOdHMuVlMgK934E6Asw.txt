First off..... The service is OUTSTANDING! My husband and I got seated immediately. Within 1 minute, we had water with lemon and warm chips & salsas the our table. Less than 2 minutes later we ordered two margaritas. They were delivered within another 2 minutes!
We were given time to peruse menu. My husband ordered the Carne Asada. I ordered the Chilie Rellanos. Both meals were excellent. I am quite a Rellanos aficionados. Theirs were out of this world!! The special sauce topping the fluffy Rellanos was perfectly delicious! This dish is served with loose pinto beans that tasted almost "buttery". We were so happy with our meals. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!!
