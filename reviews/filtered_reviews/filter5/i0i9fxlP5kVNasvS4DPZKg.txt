4 of us dined here on March 1st. We had a blast! All of the diners (including us) were singing along (loud, proud, and off-key) to the 80's & 90's music videos playing on the big screens. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food and drinks are worth way more than the price said everyone at the table. I only snacked there while my friends / family ate full meals. The following are items I sampled:

Daddy's Chip Plate - The salsa, guacamole, and queso were perfectly seasoned.

Daddy's Buffalo Wings - May I have these every Sunday?

Tortilla Soup - This is the only dish I was not a fan of. It wasn't bad. I just prefer my torilla soup on the thinner brothy side.

A delicious mango alcoholic beverage - Yum, Yum, and more Yum.
