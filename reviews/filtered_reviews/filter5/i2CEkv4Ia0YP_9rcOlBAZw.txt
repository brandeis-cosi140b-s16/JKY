So I will never get a chance to eat at elBulli and I have to live with that. China Poblano was awesome. Yes, it is very pricey for the portions you get. We ordered the Queso Fundido (yum), Dancing Eggplant (beautiful presentation, so tangy and lively though they kind of went overboard on the bonito flakes), 20 Vegetable Fried Rice (delicious) and Dan Dan Mian noodles (this was absolutely outstanding; spicy pork and peanut sauce, fresh delectable noodles). 

We had water to drink and our bill for the two of us was $55, but we left full.

The service is okay. Not overly friendly and two waiters stood by our table and talked about how hard they work and what money they made through almost the entire meal.
