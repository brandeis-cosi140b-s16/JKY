Okay, first of all let's talk about the atmosphere!  Really bright colors, fun decor and a super feel of the Spanish culture to it.  

We were visiting from out of town and turned once again to Yelp to help us out.  We were anything but let down!  We got there about an hour before they closed on a Friday night, so the place was pretty dead.  Our server was helpful and friendly.  

I tried the Brava Burro with the Baja sauce (a suggestion by our server).  My wife went with Chicken Pablano with beans and rice.  The food portion sizes were huge, but it matched the price.  We ordered some extra spicy salsa that was really good and spicy.  The chips and salsa they have is some of the best I've ever had!  Really fresh tasting and the right amount of spice.  

I asked some of locals about this place and most of them say it's their favorite.  We left painfully stuffed, but it was so good not to finish it all!  Also a huge variety of margaritas that were20 oz, nice and strong and good flavor!   An easy 5 star place... don't believe me, go and try it for yourself!
