I can't believe I haven't been here sooner! The staff is super friendly & helpful... Free coconut bark (yummy dessert) & samples of EVERYTHING!!! I was going to get the veggie-only, but after tasting the WONDERFUL meats, I decided upon the tacos (one each of chicken, beef & pork) They were great! You can choose any toppings you want & after having all, my favorite is the pork-I can't believe it since I usually don't dig swine, but the pig wins out BIG TIME! Not only is the food fantabulous & the staff welcoming, but the owner came out to greet us & he was also just as fantastic as his place! I really hope everyone continues to patronize this location since he mentioned it's been slow... PLEASE DON'T LET THIS LOCATION DIE!!! Everyone come out & support this great concept!!!
