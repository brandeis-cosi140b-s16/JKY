I love this place. The tapas selection was so yummy I couldn't decide. Omar, our waiter brought my husband & I his choices. OMG absolutely perfect. First was bacon wrapped dates. Then pil pil shrimp, oxtail, a little later was ahi tuna & tenderloin with Brie. Jalape√±o margaritas are a must have and the sangria is heavenly.
