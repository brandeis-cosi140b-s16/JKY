Had a very late dinner here and was very excited to try this place out. The atmosphere is very laid back and the hostess nicely greeted us when she saw us walk in. We had the taco platter and ordered the beast burrito. The meat was deliciously flavored and I loved the fact the there tortillas are freshly made! There salsa is so good and spicy and we couldn't get enough. To finish off our meal we ordered churros which tasted freshly made! I can't wait to come back and have some more great tasting tacos!
