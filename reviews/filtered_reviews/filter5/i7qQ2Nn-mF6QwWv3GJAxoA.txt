Now that BG has a new chef, I decided to update my review! Menu overhaul has happened, the faves are still on board and some new treats to try. We are still major fans! 

We've been thrice since Chef Chris came on board and have yet to be disappointed. We brought a bunch of friends here in March and loved our time. We had some food allergies in our group so we begged not to do family style and were elated when we were given the approval. 

Came again in May with family and for the first time, remembered to ask for the Chef's secret brunch item (that wasn't so secret since it was on Facebook). The waitress looked at us like we were insane and said "we don't have secret items here." Then, when shown the picture: "Oh, we must not be giving those to the public." Lady, I'm pretty sure I've seen 4 other tables get the delicious Jalapeno Sorbet. Queue bringing the items out. She explained she just started in April... probably something that should be discussed before sending her out during brunch service. 

Hopefully one of these times we will meet chef Chris since we've met Chef Mike several times (gotta get to Truck U!!)
