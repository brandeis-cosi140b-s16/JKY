Had lunch here this week, great as always.  The tables are all booths, and the restaurant showcases a waterfront view for many of the tables.  I love the decor and atmosphere, food and service.  It's clean and the people are friendly and efficient.  Food was fresh and excellent, and salsa and chips.  Excellent service from the server Krystle, who was prompt and attentive.  I have been going here for more than a dozen years and it never disappoints.  Their margaritas are excellent so are happy hour deals and the senior nights 2/1 (I think Tue).  They have a great lunch special menu too, that is easy on the wallet.  Overall I rate this restaurant highly and consistently.
