First, was our waiter Joey.  He was amazing.  I have never had a waiter go as out of their way to make a meal a fantastic experience.  He offered great guidance on choices and was just all around amazing.  A special thanks to him for a great time.  

The setting is very pleasant on the canal shops in the Venetian.  The table salsa was smoky and delicious.  Joey suggested a particular Tequila flight was was fun to experience the differences between the Tequilas.  All of the food was great.  For me this was 4 1/2 stars but Joey made it a 5 1/2.  A great stop if you are ever looking for a casual spot in Vegas.
