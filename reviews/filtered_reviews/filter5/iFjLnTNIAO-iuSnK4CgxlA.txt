I have grow up in Arizona with Mexican food and this place is THE BOMB!!  I am very picky when it comes to my Mexican food (No one can compare to my Nana, God rest her soul) 
I am addicted to their hot sauce.  You have to take some tortillas home with you or you will have to drive back just for them.  
It is like fast food there, food served in Styrofoam and plastic silverware so if you can get over that you will not be disappointed.
