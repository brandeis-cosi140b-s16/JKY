I wish the food I order everytime I come here wasn't soooooo darn good so I can try everything else! 
Hangover bliss!or (munchie paradise) Never disappointed!
 3 years going strong! Jade red chicken, pollo Diablo quesadilla, and pork fried rice everytime! 
Hits all the notes! Spicy,sweet,savory, and packed with flavor! 
The place looks like a hole in the wall....with a crowd out the door! Give Chino a try!!!! Mucho awesome!!!

You get a cookie with every meal! What more do you need!?
