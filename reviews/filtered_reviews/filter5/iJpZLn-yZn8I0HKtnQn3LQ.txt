Was here Friday 4/24/15 with 3 others... All 4 wanted nachos and tacos.... oh, and BOOZE! 

Our server Carlos was KICK ASS. Thanks for the great service man! 

Lets start off with the drinks. My wife and her cousin ordered specialty drinks which they loved. My boy and i stuck with beers. Ice cold! Our Server Carlos was on point, kept up with us pounding our drinks, and always checked in on us. 

Now the food... Wife and i shared a chicken quesidilia, and we loved it. The other couple shared tacos, which they also loved....

then came the mountain, what they called the COMBO NACHOS. We kept seeing these MOUNTAINS get carried by us so we HAD to try. Let me tell you, the chicken and steak both were cooked perfectly, chips had good flavor, as did the rice and beans. THey used real cheese, as well as nacho cheese. ALL VERY GOOD! 

i would go here again and again... great place located ouside of the Monte Carlo facing the strip. Great Muisc. Great Service. Thanks Diablo Cantina
