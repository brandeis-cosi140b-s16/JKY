Wow, I must say 5stars plus! This place is in gas station/car wash. Was waiting for car to be cleaned figure I grab some tacos while waiting. $2.50 each plus Jamaica hibiscus drink. Total $6.75. Cheap! And REALLY GOOD!! There's only one person working behind counter but he's does a kick ass job! So be patient. 
And here's the best part...the guy washed his hands after every time he use cash register and then put on gloves before he touched any food!! Health department should give this guy 2 AA's for that. I think I just found my new place to grab some good tacos! Tip the guy few bucks, he deserves it!!
