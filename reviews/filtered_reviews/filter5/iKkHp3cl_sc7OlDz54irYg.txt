I sent my fiance to CB for the first time with 15 minutes to spare before their 9pm closing time. Boy am I glad he made it in time! I had seen reviews and heard about this place on various websites describing it as a "must try." When I saw that you could turn your Asian entree into either a quesadilla or a burrito I was sold. I knew this place was a foodie heaven must try.

Since there were four of us at home waiting for the take out, the fiance arrived back home with 2 two item combos and 2 rice bowls. The rice bowls had the most popular Jade Red Chicken which tasted like a spicier orange chicken. The two item combo was a feast of new and unusual delights with a Jade Red Chicken quesadilla and a Chile Relleno burrito. Ummm...orange chicken in a cheesy melt quesadilla? Sweet! Deep fried crispy chile relleno in a burrito? Ah-mazing! Add to that the Cuban style black beans and the Jerk Chicken Fried Rice and the four of us were happy campers. 

I know this is a place we will be frequenting again b/c we were already talking about other items and combinations we would try. It's definitely the type of hole in the wall, so bad for you it's good type food that one craves every now and then. 

PS: I can't forget to mention the softest, airy and not overly sweet Snickerdoodle cookie that comes with every combo meal. After the bold flavors of the Asian/Mexican/Carribean meal it is the perfect way to please the sweet tooth!
