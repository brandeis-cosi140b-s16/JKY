I recently stayed at the Fairmont Princess and decided to check out La Hacienda. What a terrific surprise and where do I start? Do I start with the great tequila choices? Cocktails? The staff was really friendly and although I read mixed reviews about the service, we had great service both times were there! So, over the course of a couple of different meals, we tried quite a few items from the menu - most notable for me were the ahi ceviche (pumpkin seeds in there! Very unique and oh so good), the trio de tacos is a must and the pipian de puerc (slow cooked pork) is out of this world good! For dessert, I had churros and one night, I tried the cafe 1921. They make the drink for you tableside. Part of it is streaming sugar and cinnamon from above into the glass and watching it as it catches on fire. It's quite the show.  It was also really good! I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in Scottsdale.
