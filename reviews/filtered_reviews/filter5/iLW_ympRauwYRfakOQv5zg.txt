Trying to find locally owner shops for lunch when you work odd days and hours isn't easy, with that being said, this place was an amazing find. The place is really clean and inviting. The staff was super friendly and service was good. I had the shrimp burrito and it was AMAZING. My coworkers had breakfast burritos in the middle of the afternoon and lived then. Needless to say, this place was great and is now in the rotation of regular places for lunch.
