This place is so close to the airport that if you have a significant layover you could pull an Anthony Bourdain and catch a cab to Comedor Guadalajara. The food is sensational!  The green chile is flavorful and thick.  We had the specials of camar√≥n with nopalitos in chile rojo served in a molcajete  as well as fajitas de carne asada and tripe. My Finance got the green chile shredded beef chimi smothered in green chile sauce enchilada style. She did this on a yelp recommendation. Comedor Guadalajara is the best Mexican food I've had in quite some time.
