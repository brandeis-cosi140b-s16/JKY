Love this place. I am a new customer (going the last few months), as I have read some of the other reviews they may have been having some issues with quality or their cook a year or so ago, but whatever they are doing now keeps me coming back. 

I love the decor, and staff are always attentive and respectful, and the place is always busy (good sign). Drinks are always refilled in a timely manner, the margaritas are always cold and delicious. 

The Jalapeno bean dip and the enchilada style chicken burrito will always have a special place in my stomach from this place. I must reiterate, the chicken here is AMAZING, any dish you get with chicken on it you will love, whatever they are doing, just keep doing it and I'll keep coming back.
