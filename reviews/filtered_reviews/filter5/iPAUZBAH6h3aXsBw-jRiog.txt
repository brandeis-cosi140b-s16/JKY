Found this great spot yesterday and I'm so glad I did. The place is new and quite popular as a lot of people tried to get in and couldn't because it was that packed. Fortunately for me, I was alone so I sat at the bar located right outside. LOVED that concept. You can also see the kitchen from the sidewalk which I think is a genius idea to attract more customers as the food was not only attractive to look at, it was also delicious. Also, having grown up in Spain, I know I good Sangria when I drink one and thankfully, the Sangria I ordered made me feel like I was back home (not too many time I get to say this). I also ordered the duck confit tacos and they were a hit! I recommend you order them if you like spicy food. However there were two things that were a miss: first, I noticed that the hostess could've maybe...smiled a bit more. Although friendly when we spoke both on the phone and in person, she looked like she didn't want to be there at all. As a customer, this is a bit disappointing since your first experience with a restaurant begins with the host/hostess and seeing her look bored or perhaps annoyed really does not leave a good impression. Also, I ordered a ceviche to start off and I thought it could have had a bit more flavor. 

Having all this said, I will surely come back to Tako in the future. The cooks look like they know what they're doing and are constantly supervised, the service was fast and attentive, sangria was phenomenal, and what I believe was the owner is extremely welcoming and professional.
