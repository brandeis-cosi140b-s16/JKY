Very delicious, fresh authentic mexican food. Imagine a non greasy version of Roberto's. The Aguas frescas as are so delicious. I got the limeade with the chia seed. Honestly they all tasted amazing, the woman behind the counter gave me samples. The salsa is authentic, hot and tasty. The crane asada was perfect and the chicken was also on point. This place also has delicious frijoles...as the name would suggest.
