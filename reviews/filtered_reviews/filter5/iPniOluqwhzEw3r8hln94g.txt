I had to renew my sheriffs card and decided to stop somewhere quick on my way. I saw Phat Phranks and remembered reading about it in the weekly. It was delicious! The service was great, everyone was very nice. They were helping the woman in front of me with directions, but didn't make me wait to take my order too. I got the carnitas (pork) taco plate- the carnitas was flavorful and moist. The tortillas were piping hot. Very satisfying meal. I will definitely stop in the next time I am over here!
