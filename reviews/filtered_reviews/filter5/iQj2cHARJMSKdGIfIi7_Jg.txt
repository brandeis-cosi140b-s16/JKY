GREAT PLACE FOR TACO'S!!, 
Reasonably priced for fresh, made to order food. Fish taco's a must, than the beef carnitas, great flavor, loaded with fresh cabbage, also great pico de gallo salsa.
also cheese enchilada very favorable.
Employees are very nice, mgr. Steve very customer service oriented.
Overall, a great and economical stop with fresh food, including brown rice and tofu!!
Highly recommend for a quick lunch or dinner!!!
