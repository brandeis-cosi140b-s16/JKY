We were in Vegas for the first time and felt this place was a good place with good reviews for the money. We were so pleased after dinner that it was the best place we had eaten. I am also gluten free and the waiter had great knowledge about the gluten free options. The best part was that he ordered us dessert for our anniversary and it was also gluten free and I didn't even have to ask. This place is a must visit place!!!!!
