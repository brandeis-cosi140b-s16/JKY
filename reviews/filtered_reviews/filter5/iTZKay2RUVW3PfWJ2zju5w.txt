This place has some yummy chile colorado. I had their Tamarindo margarita and it was amazing. Our server was very nice too (can't remember his name...maybe it was the margarita ;)). I will continue to go to this restaurant as it's nearby and has a good selection. Try it out as I'm sure you'll love it too.
