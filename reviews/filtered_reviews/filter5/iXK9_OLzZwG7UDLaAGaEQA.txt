This place is fantastic!! What a great find. Prices are right and the food is superb. Just. Backyard cookout with carne asada. You can taste the char from the grill and the flavor of the meat. If you love tacos or simple, real Mexican food look no further. It's worth a drive too if you're in Scottsdale or Tempe.
