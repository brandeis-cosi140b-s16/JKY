What a find! My daughter and I were out looking for a cafe type place to have dinner. I saw this place remembering that I've been wanting to try it. Lovely atmosphere, wonderful service and delicious food! We like to share meals so we ordered Baja Shrimp Coctel, Tamales, and Churros with coffee. Everything was so good! And to make the food and atmosphere even better they have live music on Thursday nights! What a treat, the musician is funny, talented and interacts with customers. You can even make requests. I look forward to another Thursday night dinner here.
