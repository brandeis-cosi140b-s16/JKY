Sometimes in life, God drops a blessing and just so happens Komex is one of them. I enjoy everything about this place! The food here is amazing. I enjoyed the beef tacos as well as the Kim chee fried rice. This place does not disappoint and every time I come to Vegas, I make sure I stop here and get some food.  The service was friendly and fast. Overall a must go if you are in town!!
