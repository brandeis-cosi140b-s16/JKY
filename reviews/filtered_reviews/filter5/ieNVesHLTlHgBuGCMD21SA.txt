Had to try it after seeing the taco challenge on the cooking channel.  The hostess was a little confused right at 11 when they opened and we were a little worried but our fears quickly subsided when our waitress and bus boy took excellent care of us.  We loved the chips and the three dips and both got super fresh salads with the taco lunch special.  My husband had the ground beef taco and I had the carnitas and it was filled with lots of delicious meat and we loved the beans and rice too.  We asked for some hotter sauce and it was hot but tasty.  We also had some delicious margaritas.  We live in CA but will definitely make the trip to Leticia's the next time we are in town.
