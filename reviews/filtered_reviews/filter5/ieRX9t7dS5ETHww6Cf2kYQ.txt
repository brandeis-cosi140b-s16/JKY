New Location---- so glad it has finally opened and is now closer to us again! Starting with chips that are not greasy or over-filling, crisp and thin, served with their Gecko bean dip, green and red salsa on the side! Try and eat just one...We adore the chicken enchilada - never had them so delishly simple and tasty; I don't know how they prepare their chicken but it is consistently moist, tender, flavorful. The green sauce served over is just yummy and the cherry on top! Such amazing value...

The service has always been great, and tonight was not any different. Attentive, eye contact, sense of service and sense of humor. So appreciated on a Sunday evening with my family. Looking forward to the liquor license coming next month! 

Cheers and congrats!

p.s.- this is what food from scratch tastes like when someone cares!
