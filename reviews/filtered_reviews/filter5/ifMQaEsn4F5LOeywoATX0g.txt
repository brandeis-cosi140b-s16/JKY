Seriously loved this place! I went for lunch last week while I was visiting a friend at U of I - so glad she suggested it! 

I got chicken tacos and they came with complimentary chips - love that, although I could've used a little more salsa. Since it was free, I can't complain. Tacos were SO GOOD. Very Mexican-street-food kind of tacos. yum yum yum! She got a torta which she said she's had before and loves. This will definitely be a regular place to hit up when I am visiting U of I!

Only downside was that we planned on eating there but it was packed so we ended up getting our food to go. Not a huge deal at all
