My Dad and I frequent the Emiliano's located in the North Hills once a week - I would go every day if I could but that would be horrible for the diet/figure. That being said, this is 1 of the BEST Mexican restaurants that has graced itself upon the Pittsburgh area!!! It is authentic as it gets, delicious every time, great service (we get the same wonderful waitress every week, Natasha), beautiful decor, great drinks & just a relaxed ambiance. I've been to them all, a lot of 5 star restaurants in and around the area and nothing compares to Emiliano's! I would chose this place over Morton's, Ruth Chris or Monterey Bay almost any day! This is in my honest opinion a true Pittsburgh Gem and is 1 of the only true Mexican Restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Mad Mex is a bunch of tex mex garbage, El Campesino's is unsanitary (look for annual write ups in the Post Gazette on El Campy's). The only other Mexican Restaurants that can hold a match to Emiliano's would be Patrons in Wexford or the Franklin Inn on Rochester Road (North Hills) (although is not authentic Mexican by any means but still very good!). So, please disregard the nay sayers or the Debbie downers and check this place out - I have never been disappointed in all my years and I believe you won't be either : ) Enjoy!
