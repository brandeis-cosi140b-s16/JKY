Best tasting mexican food I've had in pittsburgh. The quesadillas are actually crispy. Very flavorful. Seating outside amazing. Retro style seating inside for a different experience. Service is good as well. Price is reasonable.
Draft beer selection is limited though. Parking in the area is difficult
