When the guy you're ordering tacos from doesn't speak a lick of English, you know you're in the right place.

My boss who speaks fluent Spanish told me this place is legit so I walked here.

Just North of Wynn, El Gordo looks like Mexico. Walking in it's kind of confusing to figure out but basically you have to line up by station to order each kind of taco. Inefficient and confusing yes, but you learn quickly. 

My advice: head for the offal station on the right. Rarely a line as white people think it's gross. Cabeza, lengua, buche, tripa, now that's the sh*t I dream about after. 

This is also the 1st taco joint I've been to that makes the tortillas fresh in front of you with a press! 

For under $10 for 4 tacos I can guarantee you that you won't find a better deal in Vegas. 

Te amo Gordo. You is THE Senor.
