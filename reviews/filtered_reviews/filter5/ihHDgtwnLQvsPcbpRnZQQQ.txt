The food here was great!! I had the carne asada tacos and chicken enchilada's.  The fresh guacamole is to DIE FOR and I spread it over everything!! The sangria's were refreshing, crisp and complimented the meal very well. Loved the decor, and the jazz playing in the background. If you are in Vegas and want to eat some delicious Mexican cuisine, El Sombrero is your place!!!
