I love this place and for a while when they closed down after the fire I was so sad thinking that is it for my favorite mexican food place. Heaved a sigh of relief when they re-opened, and boy, were they popular! They weeks right after the re-opening saw huge crowds even after they expanded their sitting area. You can tell this place is authentic by the sheer number of mexican diners ~~

The moment you get seated they will start you off with water and tortilla chips with salsa while you look over the menu and wait for your food.

Love their huarache and their tortas. And the grilled cactus plate. Well you could hardly go wrong with mexican grilled meat, potatoes, fresh salsa and avocado/guacamole etc. And these are all made to perfection!

If you visit on weekends, they have the menudo, a soup with beef tribe (stomach). Caution: The serving for that is humongous! Probably that alone will fill you up, so if you are going to order something else in addition, might be a good idea to split the soup with your group. 

I can't stop going on and on about this place. Their service is awesome for such a busy eatery. The waitresses are always smiling and friendly and service is prompt. If you like, you can also sit at the counter area where you can watch the chefs grilling the meat as you munch away on yours =)
