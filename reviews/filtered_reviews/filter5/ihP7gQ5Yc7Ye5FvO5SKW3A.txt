What the heck, I just ate 15 minutes ago, and just searching for Barrio Cafe made me hungry for their guacamole, which is prepared at your table, mixed in with pomegranate seeds. Yeah...you've read right...POMEGRANATE SEEDS. Who thinks of adding that to guacamole? My oh my...the combination with sweet and savory just did wonders to my taste buds.

I had their Chiles en Nogada, which was recommended by the waiter. Oh wow. I seriously have never been served Mexican food like this before. Again, the beautiful battle of sweet and savory. Savory being the chicken and the chile. Sweet being everything else- apples, pecans, pears, apricots, almond sauce. 

They had live music as well, so in case your sense of taste is in overload, relax for a sec and switch to your sense of hearing.

By the way...I LOVE THEIR SMALL PARKING LOT! It looks so dingy-ish, and since from the parking lot you enter the restaurant in the back...makes it feel like you're in on a scrumptious secret. Plus, the street wall art was extremely colorful...almost a hint to what your taste buds will experience, and enjoy.

Warning for huge groups...it's on the smaller side.
