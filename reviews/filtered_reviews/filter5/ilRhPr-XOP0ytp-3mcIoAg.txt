Ambience is always a nice addition when entering a restaurant or anywhere for that matter. This place is awesome. Situated in an old Church, they have remodeled but kept a lot of the character traits such as the stain glass windows and everyone has to sit in a pew. I am kidding about the pew. 

The food was great, very authentic and fresh. We had the beef tacos and burrito along with street corn (which was phenomenal) and then we also partook in their delicious chips and salsa. My daughter loved the salsa so much she asked if we could have some to go (she is 6) and our waiter brought us a huge bag of chips and a large to go container of the salsa. Needless to say we were both very happy!

I think I am going to go there today!
