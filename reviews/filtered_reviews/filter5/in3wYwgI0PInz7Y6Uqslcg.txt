I'm obsessed. The handmade tortillas are what initially excited me. I go back for the cornbread.  The cornbread stuffing is so dAAAlishus it angers me. I don't like experiencing such deliciousness, as I want to make it last forever. 

The tortilla chips are great!! ! I'm a big fan of tortilla chips, and these chips make my top 3 list for the phoenix area! Light, Fresh, crispy, savory. 

The concept is great- a variant of Chipotle (where you pick your enchilada mix-ins in an assembly like fashion) but with greater character, authenticity, quality and savoriness. 

The meats are flavorful and fresh. The portions are hearty! 

There's one employee who is so friendly and explanatory;  she walks us through the options. 

 My only reservation: some of the salsas are a little too tangy for my taste. I would love to see a hearty roasted molcajete salsa.
