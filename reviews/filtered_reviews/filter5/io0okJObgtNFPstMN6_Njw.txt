My boyfriend and I love this place! We usually go there to eat but today I did take out. I was worried about how the food would travel but it stood up well! Highly recommend the corn and the cherry steak taco. I also think it's awesome that they collaborate with another local establishment for one of thier menu items. I can't remember exactly but it's like coffee braised beef. The staff is always friendly, knowledgeable and informative about thier food and drinks. The building is recycled and they just seem interested in doing more then just serving food. Greatly appreciated!
