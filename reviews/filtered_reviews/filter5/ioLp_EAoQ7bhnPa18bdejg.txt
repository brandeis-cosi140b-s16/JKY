Cabo Fish Taco is one of my personal favs in Charlotte (and I'm  a former restaurant co-owner and native Charlottean).  Been going for years and it's hard for me not to get the same thing every time...Cabo's signature tacos with beer battered white fish:  two flour tortillas stuffed with cabbage, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses, & finished with their white cilantro sauce.  And I'm not even much of a seafood eater.  Back in the day the thought of eating a fish taco would have grossed me out.  But going to Cabo in Noda is a different experience that everyone in Charlotte should try at least once, seafood lover or not....
