I had a really good first experience here. They have a really good reputation and a couple of times I wanted to come but it was TOO full lol.

I finally stopped by and I the lady was super helpful.

She just had the perfect way for you to order while explaining to you what you are getting.

I got a Carlito's burrito. It was all meat. I didn't get it with beans or anything. The steak they use is delicious. You can get red or green sauce and also can get it smothered. I got christmas which was red and green mixed.

My food was good! 

We got a frito pie also which was huge! 

The sauces are spicy but SO GOOD! 

I joined the mailing list and I was happy to get an email. I thought the lady was lying.

All in all awesome service and awesome food.
