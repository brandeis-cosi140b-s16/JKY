This place is great!  Good food, and good service.  We had a large group HH and our server Jay was very patient and happy to suggest plates over others.  I told him my dad was back in the US from Afghanistan and the owner came out to let me dad know all his drinks/meal were on the HOUSE! whoot whoot!! America!! F**ck yea!! Anywho- this place has a super cool patio with a walk way bridge over water.  New Mexican food is the cuisine and they give big portions and rich in flavor :-)
