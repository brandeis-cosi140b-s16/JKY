We are new to the area, live right down the street and decided to check this place out. The service was great. We came on Monday the 6th and were greeted by a nice young man who seated us in a booth. Shortly after our server came over and I cant remember her name but she was very helpful, funny, sweet and made us feel like we were old friends. Lucky for us it was buy one get one wine night. The menu is huge so we asked what is good and she let us know some of her favorites. The way she described them we didn't have to look any further. We ordered the florentine nachos and philly cheesesteak sandwich with garlic parmesan french fries. Just as she described the florentine nachos taste like chicken alfredo,  the. sandwich was melt in your mouth cheesy deliciousness with saut√©ed steak, onions and bell peppers. But those garlic parmesan french fries were amazing! Our drinks never went empty and plates taken off the table after we were done eating. We will be coming back to eat desserts first and try the margaritas.
