Spectacular! The food is right on...The sauces that they stash alongside the food are so good! I had takeout today and got this little baggy of roasted onions and jalapeno, very tasty.  Just speaking of the sides I'm astounded, the lunch was just as impressive. Beautiful, tasty fish tacos and carne asade tacos. I got these two because of the many reviews suggesting them. I was not disappointed. To top it all off I got a big cup of horchata, it was divine. It was not too watery at all. It was very milky like and had a slight sweetness with of course the Cinnamon shining through. 

Great place. I plan on many more returns.
