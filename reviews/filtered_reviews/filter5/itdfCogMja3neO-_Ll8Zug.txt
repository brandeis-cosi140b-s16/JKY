I've lived in Phoenix pretty much my whole life. I've had quite a few breakfast burritos, from the categories of "I hate my life so much right now and I'm going to hate it more after this something-bertos awfulness I'll eat so I can at least live through this morning," all the way to burritos lovingly homemade with the many fresh ingredients cut up and grilled in front of me.

All that said: The breakfast burritos here are The Best. If I'm not out of town, I'm here at least once a weekend. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 3pm, some day that weekend I'm devouring a breakfast burrito here. The potatoes & eggs are cooked in just the right way and amount that they're guaranteed to slay any hunger or hangover you may walk in with. The ham/sausage options are excellent, but my heart will forever be caught in the ages old battle waged between bacon and chorizo (chorizo usually wins). The red salsa just completes the masterpiece.

Not to mention, the managers/owners are kickass. If they know you, they'll probably know if you need some water, how much salsa you need, and if you want chips (without even saying it) in the morning(ish). And sometimes they'll sit down and chat with you over their own burrito.

I've grabbed tacos here a few times as well, and they're also excellent. I can't imagine these guys doing anything average.
