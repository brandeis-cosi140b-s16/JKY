This is a big restaurant, way bigger than it even looks from the outside.  We sat outside and watched the sunset which just adds to the surrounding ambiance.  

I saw some reviews below mention the chips and salsa, but omg don't get me started on how good it was!  I mean we were like vultures attacking prey and had to ask for like 4 refills of the free chips and salsa.  

I actually can't do too much spice so seeing the dishes were not really spicy suited my tastebuds.  The chicken fajitas were good, comes with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, cheese and tortillas.  My family liked their dishes as well and commented on the shredded chicken being really tasty.  

We will def be coming back here in the future.  One mention is that they do offer a coupon on their website for $5 off...so go look!
