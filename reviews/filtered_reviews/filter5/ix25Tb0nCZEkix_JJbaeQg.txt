Went to this place after having a Mexican craving. I was not disappointed the flautas were great and the slaw they put on top was awesome. The black bean dip they had was very spicy and tasted good. My other half ordered the carnitas and the chile sauce that they used was great. Their Margaritas are natural and taste great too. I would come back again.
