I've been going to Viva Mercado since I was a kid (I'm 34 now). With that said even if it's your first time the owner Bobby Mercado (who works 24/7) will treat you like a long lost family member. The food is always great but it's the service that makes it even better.  In a city with an abundance of Mexican restaurants what makes Viva Mercado stand out is there quality of food, attention to your needs and how they genuinely care about your experience. Take a chance on Viva Mercado, you won't be disappointed.
