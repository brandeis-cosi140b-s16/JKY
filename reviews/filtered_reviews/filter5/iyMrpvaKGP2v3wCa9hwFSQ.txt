I had lunch here earlier today for the first time, and its all I have been thinking about all day! WOW delicious burgers i guarantee you wont find anywhere else for the price. So many awesome random menu items. Totally unique. My new favorite burger place. You must try the fries as they come (seasoned in 16 different things) and their fried onions are good enough to order as your side
