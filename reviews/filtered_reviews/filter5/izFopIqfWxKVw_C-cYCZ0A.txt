I had a GC for Mundo for at least a year before going to try it out. We finally got around to it for my husband's birthday a few weeks ago.

I wasn't crazy about the location, but it is a short walk from the Smith Center.

We were seated right away. While we were looking over the menus, I mentioned to my husband that I was going to order a glass of wine. And, our server (I think his name was Jose) brought it over immediately without me even asking, which really impressed me. 

Do not fill up on the homemade tortilla chips and salsa they bring you because the food was pretty awesome. I had the cilantro lime sea bass which was excellent, and my husband had the carnitas. He said they were sweeter than what he was expecting, but also delicious. The rock star of the meal was the Mexican street corn we split. It was to die for, and I have been thinking about it ever since. SO GOOD!!!

We ordered dessert. I had the flan and my husband had the chocolate tres leches cake. Both were just OK.

I think we spent around $100 bucks including the tip. Based on this experience at Mundo, I have added it to my top 5 restaurants in Vegas. Great food, and even better service. I already have plans to go back!!
