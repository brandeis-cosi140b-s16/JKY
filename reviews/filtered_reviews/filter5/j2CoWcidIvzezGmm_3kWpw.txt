My parents and I just came here for the first time and we enjoyed ourselves! We had the fajita plate and a seafood plate that I forgot the name of. The food was delicious and very fresh. I'm from LA and I have yet to find a authentic Mexican spot that serves great food. 

Also the service was beyond amazing! From the host to the waiter to the lady that kept asking if we want more ships and bean dip(which was yummy as well). They were all so friendly and so organized. I really enjoyed our time and the dinner we had! Definitely coming back :)
