In town with the family for one night. Stayed on the strip. My cousin is a local now, but having come from upstate NY as well, he knows that excellent Mexican food is hard to come by. We went with 4 adults and 3 children for Easter dinner.  The food was amazing.  The service was outstanding. So worth getting off the strip for some outstanding food at great prices as well.
