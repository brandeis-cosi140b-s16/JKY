Buckle up because you're in for a truly joyful ride. This restaurant is the whole package. Starting from the first glance, you'll love the fun decor and oversized booths. The service is not just attentive (my water glass was never less than half full) but they are friendly and people you'd want to hang out with- my friends invited our server Ivy to our next taco night. 

The food will not let you down either. The guacamole is incredible. I enjoyed the crispy fish tacos loaded with guacamole and their magic sauce. The braised beef were melt in your mouth deliciousness. My friends topped off their beast burritos in no time, but I would stick to their tacos. While they might not be authentic street tacos, they are fresh, tasty and will fill you UP. 

They have great taco Tuesday deals with 2 dollar tacos. They also have everyday 5 dollar drinks before 5!
