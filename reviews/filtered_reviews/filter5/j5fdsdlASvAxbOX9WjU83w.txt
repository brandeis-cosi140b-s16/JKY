Best Mexican in town, perhaps the best inexpensive Mexican I've had anywhere.  Yes, it's cramped, parking can be difficult, including getting out at the corner -- but it's worth it.  Chips + verde salsa (I think you have to ask for the verde) are great.  Fish tacos are best in town.  Love the chorizo burrito -- so good I'm willing to suffer the upset stomach.  (The price I pay for any chorizo.)

Always friendly even  when it's a little chaotic in there.  Wish they would expand and wouldn't mind having a margarita with my meal.  Hoping.
