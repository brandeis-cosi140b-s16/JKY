I love this place!!! The atmosphere is great. When you walk through the entrance they have a big pond with ducks, swans, turtles and even an owl. You can even feed the animals some pellets you buy at the counter. You can choose to sit outside by the pond or indoors. The service is amazing and the food is wonderful!!! They start you off with chips and three different flavored salsas, and the size of the meals are large enough to satisfy the biggest appetite. It may be a bit pricy buy I think its worth it. This is one of my favorite places to eat. Also they make terrific pomegranate margaritas!!! So if you're ever in the area I highly recommend this place.
