Like others, I'm glad there is an outpost of Komex farther west.  As it's new, the restaurant is bright and airy and seems to seat more than the original location.  We arrived around 5pm on a Friday and was seated immediately.

We had our standard order of kimchi fried rice, calamari tacos, a trio of tostadas, and fusion nachos.  This was enough for four adults with healthy appetites. The deep fried rice patties for the base of the tostadas were especially good this time - crispy yet light and chewy.  Out of the three available meats - beef, chicken, pork - the chicken is the least inspiring.  

Service is always prompt and friendly.  Water glasses always filled.

By the time we left around 6:30, the place was filling up fast.  Plentiful parking and not in  a sketchy neighborhood.  We'll be back soon and often!
