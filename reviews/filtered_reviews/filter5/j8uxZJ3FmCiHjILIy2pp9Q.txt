Yolo's was great!  

4 starving (and quite dehydrated) ladies couldn't wait to be seated at a table, so we sat at the bar where Chris, the bartender tended to us.  He was GREAT and super friendly!  Gave us some tips on what to order but I ended up with the shredded beef flautas and it was delicious!  3 fat pieces of flautas, covered in some green sauce with very generous servings of guacamole and sour cream. The chips and salsa that came before the meal was perfect too and totally hit the spot.  Chips were fresh and still piping hot when served and salsa that was just right - not too spicy, not too mild!  And did we look totally parched?  Cause I've never had my water filled so much in such a short while! 

We arrived around 11pm or so, so the music was bumping and had us dancing in our seats! 

Great time was had and I'll definitely be stopping by again for those delicious flautas and to say hi to Chris!
