I love this place and I can't believe I have not written a review yet The horror!!  This is some authentic Mexican grub. Some may pass over this place due to the 'so,so' location on central ave with the bars on the windows next door, but don't fret. 
This place is usually busy, so expect to wait a little. Let me start with the Margaritas, sweet Jesus they're good, they don't use a mix, homemade mix and as good as it gets. The guacamole is fresh and the queso is a wonderful representation of cheesy goodness. I usually order the Verde enchiladas, but I have had the tacos burritos etc. I have never had a bad meal here. The wait staff is kind and usually speedy.
