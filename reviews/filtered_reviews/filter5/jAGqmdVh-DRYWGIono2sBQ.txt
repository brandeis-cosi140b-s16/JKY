My fiancé and I really enjoy this place! It's a California Mexican menu and they do fun versions of guacamole that change periodically. Ive had the chicken tacos and the sweet potato tacos and they were both great! My fiancé really liked his duck tacos as well. This place has a cool atmosphere and the margaritas are pretty yummy too!
