This food is legit.  We ate the Alambre de res, which is a flour quesadilla with chopped beef with bell peppers, onions and cheese and the Torta Nortena Torta, 
grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado and mayo-chipotle dressing.  Both were fantastic.  The menu is extensive and there really is so much to try.  These 2 were fairly basic and clearly something a novice would order, but it was a good start and a great choices for a first timer.  I want to try the tacos and other tortas that have all sorts of amazing options like ham, chorizo, eggs, avocado and much more all in one torta.  Some of them were so high, I thought for sure the tops were going to fall off and the people eating them were going to bust the button on their pants- no doubt.
