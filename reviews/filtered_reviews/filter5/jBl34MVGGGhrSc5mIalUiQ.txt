I had dinner here with friends while visiting Las Vegas because it was recommended through word of mouth this place has the best Mexican food you will ever try from the fideo soup to the handmade tortillas to even the beans everything here is excellent not to mention the service, we felt we had three waiters waiting on us I will definitely come back here when I visit Las Vegas! They deserve nothing less than 5 stars!
