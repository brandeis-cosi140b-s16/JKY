This place is absolutely amazing! The ambience is trendy and and relaxing. The food was delicious. I had the carnitas. The meat was so tender and served on the bone. The margaritas here are out of this world. They claim their margaritas are the best in the world and I haven't had one better. I'll definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!!
