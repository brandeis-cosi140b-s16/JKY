Why is this place not busier? I feel like it might be the hidden gem of old town. Amazing food, great happy hour and unbeatable atmosphere with that patio. Everything on the menu is delicious and the staff is great. Always sit at the bar and all the bar tenders are great. Come 2 to 3 times a week and it isn't enough. Don't sleep on that beet crema either. Sounds weird but it is life changing.
