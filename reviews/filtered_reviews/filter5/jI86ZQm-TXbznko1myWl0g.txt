Best.tacos.ever! Hands down. I found this restaurant on Yelp and had to check it out. 

The ambiance is crazy!! It is brightly colored and the decor is based on Mexican wrestling so it is very... unique. I thought it was funny and definitely different... but good different! I loved the Mexican music playing in the background!

The food was incredible. When my husband and I walked in, the people behind the counter asked if we had been there before. When we said no, they told us we could sample all the meat. I dont eat meat, but my husband jumped on the chance. Every one he tried was followed by "oh wow!" or "oh god this is delicious!" etc etc. He ended up getting a beef burrito and I got vegetarian tacos. It is similar to Chipotle in that they make your meal in front of you and you decide what toppings you get. Both of us LOVED our meals - and the guac was delicious! The meal was fast, inexpensive and awesome! 

We cant wait to go back! Thanks Yelpers!
