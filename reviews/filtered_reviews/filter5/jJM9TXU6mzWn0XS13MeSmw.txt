I live In San Francisco and I came here for my Aries weekend bday party and to my surprise I actually loved this place. IThe food was great  differentChef Mike even came out and took a photo w/ us . We loved the empenada's . The cocktails were strong which is a must in Vegas cause you need to have one in your hand at all times. We had a great dining and drinking exp. Would go back in a heartbeat actually I wish I was in Vegas right now with the food and  a drink in hand oh well back to work lol
