I had really high expectations for this place and I'm happy to say my expectations were met.  Really delicious authentic Mexican food.  I had the chiles rellenos and it was really satisfying.  The food tasted very fresh and home made.  Reyna's doesn't cut any corners in their food preparation and it really came through in the taste.  The service was a little slow but it wasn't terrible. Reyna's is hands down the best Mexican food that I've eaten in Pittsburgh. I hope this place does well and sticks around for a long time.
