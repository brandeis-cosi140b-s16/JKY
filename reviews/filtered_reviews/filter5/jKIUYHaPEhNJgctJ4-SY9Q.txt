Being from SoCal I am VERY PARTICULAR about my Al Pastor meat.  This place exceeded my expectations on taste and presentation.  
I got the Al pastor bowl (sans guac) and it was quite tasty!  Price was great @ 5.99 and portion was perfect.
For a first timer I definitely recommend them for lunch on the patio.  I may try this spot for dinner as the lighting outside, I'm sure, would be beautiful at night.
