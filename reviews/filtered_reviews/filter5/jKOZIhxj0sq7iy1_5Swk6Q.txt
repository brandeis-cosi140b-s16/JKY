Great casual atmosphere.  We had the sangria,  escargot,  paella, and tequila rice pudding.  Everything was excellent.  It was my first time having escargot and it didn't disappoint. Chef Oscar came around and spoke with us. We even added him to our Facebook.  Great to speak with a chef with such passion about his food.
