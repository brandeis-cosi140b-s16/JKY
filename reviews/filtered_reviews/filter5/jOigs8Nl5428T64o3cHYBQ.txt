I love this place! I had high expectations from the accolades given from people I know who enjoyed jaburritos from foodie fest. From their recommendation, I ordered the one with the softshell crab and spicy tuna. It did not disappoint. Paired with the seaweed salad and a drink it totalled to about 14$ which is fair given the quality of ingredients and portion size was ample. The texture and flavor was right on point and seems like a natural progression in sushi rolls. Make em the size of a burrito? Brilliant. :)
