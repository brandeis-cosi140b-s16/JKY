This place has the best Mexican food in town. We live an hour away and still have to come here as often as possible. The chips and salsa (unlimited) are some of the best you can find, and the staff is says helpful and prompt. Even when they're busy you can still get speedy service, and the food is delicious. I always get their chicken tacos, and I've never had a bad experience. Come hungry, because portions are generous and you'll love the food!
