Perfect hidden gem! We grabbed the Botana Papa Pepe and Taquitos Dorados as takeout for the road. The service was very friendly and even on a packed night, they made my order before the time promised and even called me when it was ready as I gassed up the car. 3 appetizer orders total was perfect for our car of hungry travelers and my daughter now magically loves guacamole. Gracias and we'll be back. 
PS- Jalape√±os were YUM!!
