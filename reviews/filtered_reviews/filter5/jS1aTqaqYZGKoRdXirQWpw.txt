This place is a MUST when I come to Vegas. Who can say no to delicious, affordable tacos that are available at all the right hours? Perfect for late night bites as well as mid-day snacks/lunch/indulgence.

I've tried a good variety, but my favorites are still Beef Tongue and Spicy Pork. Beef shoulder is good, but a little tough and not as tender as the tongue. Brain is an interesting choice, but only if you are a foodie wanting to try new things. My least favorite so far is the tripe - don't get me wrong, I love eating tripe, but this just wasn't the way I liked it. It just tasted too organ-y if that makes any sense.

The food in quesadilla form is also pretty tasty... Ahh my stomach GROWLS as I am typing this!
