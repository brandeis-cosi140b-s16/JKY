Fun, Festive, Inexpensive, Selection, Culture, Taste, Energetic....

The Ranch is a great place, but be prepared for crowds, I don't know of a time we have been there that it hasn't been busy, but Christmas time ... Ay Carumba!  The produce, the meats, the Cocina, the Bakery, the selection is all amazing... even if you don't live close, bring a cooler with some ice in your car to get what you want/need and then feel better about taking it home!  

Be sure to try their resturant (on West end of the building) Tradiciones!
