I am so upset that this restaurant is 3 min from my house. I am truly addicted to the Green Chili Burrito Bowl with creamy rice. I can not stop eating it. Oh and did I mention the Old Fashioned Lemonade from real lemons? Someone needs to intervene and force me to try something else. Get the mild sauce as the medium and hot really have no flavor or taste. On the serious side what this restaurant lacks in size and atmosphere it more than makes up for it quality great tasting food and really cool staff.
