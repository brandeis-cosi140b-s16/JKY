I actually came here because I had purchased a Deal Chicken deal. So glad I did!! The burgers were to die for! The Banana Stand milkshake was tasty and perfect! Peach Lemonade was delish! And the fries...Well they were okay, the boyfriend didn't like that there were so many little pieces versus full fries. And I thought they were a touch to salty, but I would gladly order them again!
Everyone was really happy to see us, and serve us! The place is sort of small, but it has a patio with a cooling unit on it.
I highly recommend this place!!!
