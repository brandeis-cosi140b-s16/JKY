This place is south Scottsdale's dirty little secret.  If you want the awesome authentic taste of a real hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant but with the speed of a XXX-ertos (minus the Hepatitis), this is the place to go.  I've been to this place at least twenty times and I think I only ever order four things there because they're so good: the super nachos, the rolled tacos with guacamole, chicken tacos and the two carne asada burrito plate.  Any of these selections are guaranteed to keep you full for at least ten hours.

Everything comes out piping hot and both the green and red salsa provided are excellent additions to the already tasty flavors provided.  If you are in the mood for Mexican food and you're within a ten mile radius of this place, it's certainly worth the drive.
