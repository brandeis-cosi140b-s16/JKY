I have forever been put off from trying mexican seafood. I am not sure why really.  Just something always tells me, don't risk it, you are too young!

So i finally did not listen to my gut feeling and I am glad i didn't. We got their special stone bowl with mocalate...I am 100% i spelled that wrong, there was different meat in it and it was delicious.... I am actually drooling thinking of this dish again. 

Yes I will be back and I might just order that again, because it was so good. (i am sure there other items are good too).

I would pass on desserts though.
