Now that is what a fish taco should taste like.  I tried the full taco, the shrimp taco, and the machaca taco and they were all great. I will definitely be getting the shrimp again and again. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The corn tortillas had a mild flavor and held up well to sauces. 

The hot salsa wasn't joking, go easy on it the first time even if you are a spice lover like me.  There were plenty of condiment choices, from the traditional pico de gallo to  worcheschire and tarter sauce. Something for everyone.

This place looks modern and clean.  It has really comfortable chairs, believe it or not. Plus, the staff is really nice. I recommend going on Tuesday for their 3 for 2 taco special. I'm full and my wallet thanked me.
