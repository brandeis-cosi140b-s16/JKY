I am very picky with restos but with our original flight cancelled, I had to give up my reservations at Mon Ami Gabi. So the hubby and I walked the strip hunting down a place to grab some grub. We decided to check this place out. Typical Vegas resto, loud BUT the gal was gracious enough to ask us if we want to be seated at the back. Adam was our server and he was a gem. We are easy diners, got the staples, guac with chips (in love with avocados) and split the fajitas. Food was good, the mango margarita was yummy but our server made a difference between as so-so dinner to an enjoyable one!
