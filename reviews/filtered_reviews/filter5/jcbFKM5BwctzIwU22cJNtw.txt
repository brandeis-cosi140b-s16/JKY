Chino Bandito... I think my mother gets sick of hearing this when I talk to her on the phone, reminding her that when I come home, I wanna go to Chino's. I have not moved away from their black beans, because they taste "different" in a yummy, I am taking all the leftovers home yummy. I love their Jade Red chicken, though I'll admit it has changed a little. It used to be a lot more spicy... not it's just... not that hot? I'm a girl who likes my spicy food and that was my go-to! I like the steamed rice, though I've tried their other rices and their jerk rice is pretty good. I like their carnitas, and their pollo diablo is one of my new faves.... I think I'm going there tomorrow actually, since writing this review has made me hungry. Yes. I think I will. In fact, I AM going tomorrow.
Oh, and for all the people who claim their ordering process is really confusing... maybe you should just pay attention when they tell you to do it. You look at the menu, all the items are numbers. Q-(#) means Quesdilla with ____. B (#) Burrito. Most people I think are just used to having their orders taken rather than the time-saving option Chino takes when they get hardcore busy (which they occasionally do) and when they're not, they're nice enough to help you and give you samples. Along with a free cookie. Have you heard of the phrase "do you want a cookie?" It's a reward for your patience. =]
