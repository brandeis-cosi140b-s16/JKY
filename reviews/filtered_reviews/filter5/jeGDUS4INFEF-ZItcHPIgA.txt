San Pedro was blessed to have this deliciously amazing eatery from Las Vegas in a 2 day pop up event at Ports'o'call. We are hooked on the chicken bulgogi tacos with lettuce, shredded veggies, and a killer hot sauce. Our senses were left in a state of arousal only teen boys at the girls camp would know. All perfect. All delectable. All wonderful.
