Border Grill is what a nicer Mexican restaurant should be. The menu has a variety of interesting dishes and while a few of the "usual" are available please get outside the box at BG. You will be glad you did. First. Margaritas!  Excellent and feature a nice choice of tequila to choose from. And.   For a Mandalay Bay venue.  Pretty reasonable. My entree was pulled pork served in a banana leaf with fresh tortillas on the side. Awesome.  Really different.  It was a server recommendation and was a win win meal. Killer guacamole too! There was a big fight that night in the resort and they were busy but they were staffed for it and service was spot on.  A great meal  a price point that is a bargain.  Go here. You will love it!!
