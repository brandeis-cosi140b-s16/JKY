Great little family run restaurant with quite possibly the best street tacos I have ever had (40+ years of testing)! I ordered the 5 street tacos with one of each (pollo tinga, carnitas, barbacao, asada, and adobada) filling, and all were equally amazing (get them with the works). My wife got the taco salad with chicken and raved about it too. She loves salsa and they have a great little salsa bar (beware of the green! It's hot! ). The whole place is a shrine to Lucha Libre wrestling and is funky and fun. I only wish we had discovered it sooner!
