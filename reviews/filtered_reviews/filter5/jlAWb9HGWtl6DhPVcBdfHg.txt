We came to Vegas to see P!nk at Mandalay Bay. After a very long day of walking around we were famished and decided to take a chance and eat at Border Grill since it was right across from where the event center entrance. The food and service was excellent!!!! We haven't had such good authentic mexican food since we were actually in Mexico! They were a little pricey, but what isn't in Vegas. I don't mind spending a little extra money on food this good.
