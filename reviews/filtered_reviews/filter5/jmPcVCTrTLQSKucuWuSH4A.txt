I have dreams about Tacos Atoyac and they are the types of dreams you don't talk about.  I used to work close by to TA so I would come at least once a week to have lunch.  The Owner was always behind the register and always remembered my order (1 fish taco and an Oaxacan Hot dog).  He even remembered how I like my food (no tomatoes, no jalapenos, no side of grilled onions/peppers).

My go to is the Oaxacan dog!  Even though bacon is sprinkled on and not cooked with the hot dog it is the BEST hotdog I have ever had!  They also toast the bun before the bean shmear which really makes all the difference.  Pair it with a Mexican Coke and you've got yourself the best day of your life.

The building/location itself is a little scary.  I went there a few weeks after it opened and I will say I had my doubts (I thought i would get robbed) but the place won me over and I would brave all scary things in this world to get my TA fix on.  My secret suggestion is always get a churro for the road.
