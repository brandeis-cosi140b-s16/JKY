Had the pleasure of eating here last week and will definitely be back when I'm in town. It's a small place with big flavor. I had the green chili burrito,  one of the best I've had!  My friend ordered the cheescake chimichangas for dessert and those too were awesome!  Frank was very nice and friendly. Only downside is you may over indulge ;)
