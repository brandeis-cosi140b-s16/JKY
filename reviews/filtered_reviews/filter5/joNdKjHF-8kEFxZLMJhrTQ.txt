This has been my favorite restaurant for years, I have NEVER had a bad meal and the waitresses are always so nice and seem to really work together as a team. 

My favorite meal is the bean and cheese fry bread with all of the toppings! I soak it in their delicious bottomless chunky salsa and it is easily 2 meals worth of food (especially after I have already filled up on chips and salsa before the meal got to the table).

Love the price, love the cleanliness, love the salsa, love the food, love the service...whenever my sister comes back home from Tucson to visit we HAVE to go there and then always visit the Ceretta's chocolate factory across the street!
 HIGHLY recommend!

GO THERE and you won't be disappointed.
