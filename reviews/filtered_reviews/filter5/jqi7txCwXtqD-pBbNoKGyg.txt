I love this place.  It's easily my favorite Mexican food in the valley.  Great service, great guacamole, great margaritas.  I've been here 3 times and have never been disappointed by the entrees.

Be advised, they don't take reservations, and there is usually a wait on the weekends.  However, if you're going mid-week, it's usually pretty easy to get a table.
