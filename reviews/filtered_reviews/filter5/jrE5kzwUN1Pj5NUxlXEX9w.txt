What can I say that hasn't already been said in the myriad of reviews of this place?  I come here as often as I can for one item only - the Adobada tacos. They are uh-maze-ing!   The carne asada tacos are pretty good as well but the flavor compared to the spicy pork (adobada) pales.  Come here, order some spicy pork tacos, thank me later.
