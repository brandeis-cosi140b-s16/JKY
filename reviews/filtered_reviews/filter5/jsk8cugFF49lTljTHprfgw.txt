My wife has been following them on Facebook months before they even opened, but we hadn't had a chance to go visit until this past Friday night (12/20/13).  It was well worth it. 

It's a smaller restaurant with comfortable indoor seating and outdoor patio seating along with bar seating. The staff was friendly and apologetic about the 20 min wait time for a table due to two large business Christmas parties taking place at that time. However, once seated, we were well-taken care of. Our waiter was efficient, yet unobtrusive. Bus staff was busy, but you never seemed to notice they were there. 

Chips and salsa came out, delicious. I had the Dia De Los Muertos Pale Ale, my wife had a mojito. The wine list does not feature any wines from France, but it does feature three from Southern AZ - very nice touch! The menu is not overly large - they obviously know what they can make and do it well. I ordered the Poblano Chile Relleno, my wife ordered the Chili Rojo de Pollo.  Very much a gluten-free menu - most everything can be made GF or already is.

Once the food arrived, it was hot, steamy, and delicious. The Chili Rojo de Pollo was so good, it reminded us of the food we had at our wedding... 17 years ago! 

The price was excellent for the quality of food and service we received. Isabel's Amor has definitely found its niche as an upscale Mexican restaurant. 

We have a favorite Mexican restaurant in Tucson; I think this has become our new favorite here in the Valley. We will definitely be returning.
