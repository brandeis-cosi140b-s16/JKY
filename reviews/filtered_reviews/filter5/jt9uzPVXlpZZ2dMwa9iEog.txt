Come for dinner. Just do it. So, we were informed that the dinner chef at La Piñata is the same chef at Mi Patio during the day. With that said, he must be a one magical being, because his food is consistently delicious across the board no matter what restaurant you catch him at. I had the taco, enchilada, and green corn tamale plate. Everything on the plate was incredible - even the beans. I was too full to eat my rice, but the consensus at the table was that it was the only part of the meal that was mildly unsatisfactory, as it was a bit salty. On a side note - my husband had the Piñata Chimi and wasn't very happy either. The waiter had warned him that the regular green or red chili chimis were actually a better choice, but as usual, he didn't listen. 

I also did not partake in the margaritas of piñata fame, but my sister claims that she had imbibed many a night and that these margaritas, they are top notch. My kids were also raving all night about the french fries and tortilla soup, and my kids know french fries and tortilla soup - so I'd just take their word for it. The service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating with some of our special needs. Overall, a GREAT experience and we will definitely be back!
