True authenticate Mexican food.  The way it should be with lime and salt.  They have a salsa bar with guacamole, 3 flavors of salsa, limes, and other stuff. 

Has an area to sit outside or inside and free chips and salsa with yelp check in. 

Definitely a place you should try if your in or close to mesa. I'll be taking myself and family back soon.
