Plaza looks sketchy, but it's safe. This is where day laborers eat.  They have the *best* carrot, jalapeno, cauliflower mix on their condiment bar, not the same boring stuff you get at just about every other "real" Mexican dive. They have 3 basic salsas: green, red, and smokey red.  Try them all to find your favorite.

My favorite dish is the breakfast plate with chorizo. This is chorizo that you can actually taste, not the stuff you find at many places that tastes like hamburger. The lunch items are very good, too. Like any dive, it might take a few tries to find your favorite dishes.

And the menudo (weekends) is about as real as it gets.  I.e. Excellent.
