I absolutely love the food here. The rice and beans taste like the way they would if you having dinner with Mexican family at home. I'm a fan of the fish tacos for sure, the batter is light, crispy and delicious with a flavorful "slaw" on top. The atmosphere is fun and comfortable although I feel like some of the table are too small if you want to have a tapas style mix and match meal with others. All in all I'm hooked on the food here. Ive been here a few times now and all my servers have been very pleasant. Our server Matt was particularly delightful and engaging and made a good meal into a fantastic experience.
