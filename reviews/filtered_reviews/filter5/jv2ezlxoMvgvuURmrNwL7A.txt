Fantastic.  The food was awesome,  the service average.  The menu immediately strikes you as being different. The ingredients and descriptions of the dishes are delightful.  I rarely give 5 stars and this is definately a 5 star establishment.  Knock a couple of rough edges off of the wait staff and the whole experience would be spectacular.  Come early,  there is usually a wait to get in.
