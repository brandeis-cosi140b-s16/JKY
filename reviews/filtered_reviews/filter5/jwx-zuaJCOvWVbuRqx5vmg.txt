Was in town again for work had some time before we were leaving so we decided to hit up this super cute spot for happy hour. Had been here before so was a little excited to have their taco flight. 

The taco flight is definitely enough to share. 3 of each (chicken, veggie, carne asada, pork and fish) taco for a total of 15 tacos!! My favorite are the fish tacos topped with red lettuce and topped with their pico de hallo, amaaaazing!!! The carne asada tacos are filled with meat, definitely hearty.

I also enjoyed a hot mango margarita. Like spice and tequila, this is a must try! 

Our server Yohanis was attentive and touched our table just enough for us to not feel negelected. He was on point and definitely defined great customer service! Thank you!!!
