Great food. Went on a Sunday so the place was kind of empty, which made the service spectacular (not sure how it would be when they are busier). The food was fantastic. Very organic and "real". The main chef (Paco) came out to our table and visited with us (again, it wasn't packed so not sure if that is normal) but that made the experience even better. Don't be discouraged that this place is attached to a gentlemen's club (as others have noted, it has a separate entrance).
