If you're into authentic Mexican food this is the place for you! You're taste buds will have a party when they grab a sample of their unique flavor. All their food tastes AMAZING. Bold marinated carne asada, lemony fresh cevice, spicy yummy menudo, I have NO COMPLAINTS regarding their food it is WONDERFUL. The only downside is this place is tiny and the location is a bit on the bad side. The employees aren't rude but theyre not super friendly either. Regardless, I believe the food speaks for itself!
