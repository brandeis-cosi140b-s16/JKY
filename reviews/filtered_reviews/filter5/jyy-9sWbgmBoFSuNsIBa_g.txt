Im from Taos, New Mexico and this place has some great food.

Start with a bowl of the Red Pork Posole! This stuff is like tia makes it. Lime, cabbage, great chili paste, AMAZING!

We get the red and green carne adovada enchiladas. The pork just falls apart it's so well done. 

The service is decent but the food portions and taste is Muy Bueno!
