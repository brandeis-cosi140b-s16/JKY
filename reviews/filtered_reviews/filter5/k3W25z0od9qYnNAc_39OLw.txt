Since my triumphant return to the valley of the sun, I had made a list of restaurants that were a must try and Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup was at the top of that list! This place is similar to chipotle in concept but the quality of food doesn't even compare. 

Being a newbie to the joint - I asked the guy behind the counter to make me what he usually eats. I think this is the best thing to do sometimes, It's fun to try things that other people recommend. 

So of course I had to try the Enchiladas, I got one house corn and one made from scratch half n' half corn flour tortilla filled with green chilie prok shoulder and a sweet corn type filling in the other, I went christmas style and got the red and green sauce and asadero cheese, topped the sucker with a griddled fried egg and guac, salsa verde, with a little scratch made cream, crumbled cotija cheese, and pickled red onions! 
Seriously delicious - and not pricey at all.... I can't wait for it to be soup weather so I can try their tortilla soup! 

So, simply why should you come here?!
- Fresh homemade ingredients
- Huge portions, and great prices
- Amazingly friendly and helpful staff
- And there is booze

A must try!
