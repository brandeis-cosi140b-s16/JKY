I remember first going to Popo's with my parents 20+ years ago.  I recently rediscovered it and it is now our favorite place for Mexican food. The food isn't that pricey and the quality of it is Very good.  After all these years it still looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but the inside will surprise you!

Give it a try... you will enjoy it!
