We came here for my birthday and it was absolutely wonderful. The atmosphere is great and they hands down have the best margarita I've ever had! It's classic, clean, authentic and full of flavor. The mahi mahi tacos are delicious and the guacamole is to die for and they make it right in front of you! They make their own bread for their tortas and everything here is ridiculously authentic. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, it's a great up scale place. For dessert - I am not at all a fan of bread pudding, but OH my goodness - do not pass up the opportunity to try it if you have it, it is incredibly well done & momentarily makes you levitate into a state of paradise.
