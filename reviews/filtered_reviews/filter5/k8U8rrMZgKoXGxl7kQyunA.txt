The wife and I went and loved it.  One of the best burgers in Phoenix.  We went around 1:30 and wasn't very crowded, which was great.  It's a small place and I'm sure it gets packed during lunch and dinner hours.

Next time we will try the sweet potato tots. 

Milkshakes are great too!

Thanks for making an awesome burger at a reasonable price!
