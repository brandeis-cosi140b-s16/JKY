I'm currently eating at Diego Pops and we're having a wonderful experience. The manager, JD, and the staff have been extremely accommodating and have made our dinner both personable and exciting. The food has been delicious and the atmosphere proves most inviting. I will be coming here in the near future and I hope you will too. Also, the vast smorgasbord of incredible sauces leaves little to be desired. Much love, Diego Pops. Much love.
