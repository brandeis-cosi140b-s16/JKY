I freaking love this place! It's the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to! Not that I've been to that many :). It's generally not my favorite type of food and it's hard to find a authentic Mexican place in Warsaw (where I live), so to this very day I did not know that their food can taste so awesome!

I don't really understand why all restaurants in Vegas hotels are so dark - you can barely see the menu. But I guess they like it like that. The decor puts you in a good mood, they have very comfortable sofas and play great music. The waiters are really nice and professional. One time my fiance and I stayed a few minutes past the closing time to finish our drinks and we didn't feel rushed at all. I tried a few things from the menu and all of them were really good: the steak, the enchiladas, the quesadilla. We also had a superb fun creating our own tacos from the plate of ingredients (La Tablita)! And the margaritas there are great. I loved the mango one on the rocks. 

To sum up, great place, tasty food, delicious drinks and friendly atmosphere. I would gladly visit again.
