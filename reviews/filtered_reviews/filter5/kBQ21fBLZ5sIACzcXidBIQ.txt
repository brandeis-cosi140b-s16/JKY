Yelp does it again! We flew in from Austin and San Francisco for the weekend of football games. We wanted to have great Mexican food and we found it at La Piñata.  The atmosphere, service, drinks and food were all delish! The chips were thin and warm, the guacamole was fresh and the margarita divine.  We had shredded beef flautas, beef tamales, chicken tostadas and piñata chimi...all excellent!  The rice and beans were great also.  When in Phoenix again, we will definitely be back!!
