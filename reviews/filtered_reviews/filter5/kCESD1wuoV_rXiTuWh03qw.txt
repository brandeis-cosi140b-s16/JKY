No hesitation. Five stars. All the way. 

This taco place has my heart. This taco joint is love. Tacos El Gordo, I can't hold it in anymore. I. Love. You. The adobado, also known as "spicy pork" & carne asada tacos on corn tortillas were magical. Granted, we are from Florida and aren't provided true mexican food very often -- but this place was on a whole different level of amazing. My husband and I were smiling during our whole visit to Tacos El Gordo because the food and service were impeccable. I'm glad we ventured away from "The Strip" for cheaper food. We got stuffed for $17.00 and it was one of our favorite parts of our trip to Vegas. Thanks so much for the amazing food. We will be back! We already miss the food. It truly is a shame that Florida doesn't have food this delicious.
