This is my favorite Mexican cuisine in Vegas, we go there every time we go to Vegas, good for romantic dinner, or hang over cure late lunch :P

The decor is beautiful, there are fountains by the booth. service is always over the top. they have  happy hour from sun to sat. good for friends hang out. A romantic place for dinner date night, you can have more margaritas after dinner at the bar, they have music and good crowd.

I love the food ! menu is big, portion is big, I love seafood ceviche, and that Naga Jolokia - The Hottest Chili On Earth, its extreme spicy! but it doesn't hurt to give it a try :P steak taco is so yummy according to Fianc√© , appetizer platter is the bomb, their tasting menu is very good.



its a bit pricey for Mexican restaurant, but its a upscale place with great service, very well worth it!

we go back every time we go to Vegas!
