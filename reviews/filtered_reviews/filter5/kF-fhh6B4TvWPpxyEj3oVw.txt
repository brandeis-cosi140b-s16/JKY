Ok...I went back after great anticipation. 

I still love this place. I had the same wine as last time and I still cannot remember the name of it, but man, it is good (maybe the reason I can't remember the name is because I had too much of it). I went again for happy hour on a Friday, it is dangerous that this place is so close to my work. This time we had to sit at the bar upstairs because the one downstairs was packed. I really love the open kitchen. You can watch them prepare all of your food right there in front of you. Our bartender was awesome, joked around with us, talked wine with my friend who worked at vineyard for years, and gave us some great recommendations for Riojas that he thought we would enjoy. I love service like this, that is why I will keep coming back, people who genuinely like their guests and enjoy their jobs. The awesome food at $5 a plate doesn't hurt either:)
