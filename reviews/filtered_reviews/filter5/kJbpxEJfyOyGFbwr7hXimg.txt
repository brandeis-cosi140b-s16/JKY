I am not a huge fan of Mexican food so when my sister took me to this restaurant, I was not expecting to me blown away. Except I was! I loved this place, from the beans to the different types of salsa and the to-die for carne asada tacos! My boyfriend had the al pastor burrito which he loved as well. Service was great however my only complaint is that there aren't enough servers. We found ourselves waiting a lot but I knew it wasn't our server's fault. She was just extremely busy. 

5/5 stars for sure! :)
