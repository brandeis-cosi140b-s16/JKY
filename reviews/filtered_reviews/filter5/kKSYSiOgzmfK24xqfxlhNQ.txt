Just had lunch there today @ 11:25 (on a Monday) or so. I give a specific time because boy was it packed in there. When I got there the line was a just out the door.
The food was great!
Wife had fish tacos and I had carnitas de jalisco. 
Food was great, seriously.
Just too bad the seating is limited and it's a popular place to eat obviously.
Staff was pretty friendly with a genuine smile.
