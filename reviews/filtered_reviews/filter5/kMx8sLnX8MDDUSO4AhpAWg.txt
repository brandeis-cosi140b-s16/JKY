Great Happy Hour at the bar. Enjoyed an excellent frozen margarita made with a premium agave tequila. Yum! Bartenders were very informed on the many quality tequilas Sol has to offer. Perfect to enjoy with the Baja inspired happy hour specials. The Chilie Gordo pepper appetizer was amazing. Of course we never pass on the large, tasty chips and gourmet guacamole. So good...
