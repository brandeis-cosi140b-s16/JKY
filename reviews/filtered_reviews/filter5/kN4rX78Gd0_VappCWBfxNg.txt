Bored of all the usual joints, we decided to try something new. My friends and I head out to täkō on a Friday night. I made a reservation, and that was a good thing as I saw the average waiting time was about 45 minutes.

We ordered the pre-built vegetarian guacamole and it was absolutely delightful. My friends and I loved it so much that we ordered another one. We went on to have some really amazing cocktails, and I particularly liked my Blue Mango Mai Tai! 

All of the tacos were incredible, probably the best I have in the recent past. I ordered the pollo asado which was really nice. What was good was, they could replace meat of any combination with mushrooms and make it vegetarian. For instance, my friend got the carnitas taco with mushrooms instead of pork. 

Overall, we would definitely go there again. We liked the location too. The only thing which would be better is if they can reduce the volume of the music down a notch.
