I have eaten here twice for lunch, and have enjoyed both times.  In the past I have always rated a Mexican restaurant by their chili relleno - is it greasy from too much oil, is the cheese totally melted inside, is the batter crisp and covering all of the chili or is it sloughing off, and is the sauce flavorful with a touch if spice - and Viva Mercado's met my expectations with one if the best chilis rellenos I have had!  Service was good both times, and they will make your margarita to order - Sauza Commeritivo and Cointreau on the rocks, sin sal!  Que bueno!  Their sliced, grilled jalapeños and onions are a delight; you cut them up and add to whatever you want, as much or little as your preference. My second lunch I was able to speak at length with Victor, Bobby's brother, and we reviewed restaurants past, such as Viva Zapata's on Tropicana and Maryland - yes, I was born here - does anyone else remember El Cholo on Fifth Street - I mean Las Vegas Blvd South?  And their carne asada tacos were very good as well.  However the great draw for me is their veggie tamale!  I came to love green corn tamales in Phoenix, at Manuel's on 32nd and Indian School, and until Viva Mercado's opened they were not to be found.  I have died and gone to Heaven!  In addition, their beans are flavorful and not runny, their quacamole is very good with the jalapeños and onions to add for more heat, their salsa and chips are fresh and the latter not greasy either time I was there.    And even better - nopales!  Their interior decor is lovely, the ambiance and noise level is great, and I am taking our daughter and granddaughters there on Saturday.  Life is good.
