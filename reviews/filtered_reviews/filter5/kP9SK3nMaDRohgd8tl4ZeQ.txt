First time at this place and the food was delicious!! Everything from the food to the service and decor was great! The free chips and salsa are a bonus for sure. Started off with the chicken tinga tostadas which were extremely tasty. Also had the stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp and boy were those a definite highlight. The posole tasted so authentic and the portion was perfect! Best of all was the flan and the churros! The flan literally melts in your mouth. Loved the dipping sauces for the churros (banana foster & Mexican chocolate) YUMM!
