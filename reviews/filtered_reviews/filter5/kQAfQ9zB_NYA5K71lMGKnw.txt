Great service, authentic Mexican atmosphere with huge variety of Mexican beers and margaritas including organic!  Prices are very reasonable, if you do not want rice and beans order ala carte and the prices are as low as $3.00 per item.  In fact chips, salsa and beans are free as appetizer.  This place is a great value!  My favorite items is a NY Strip with cheese enchilada and chili pepper strips.
