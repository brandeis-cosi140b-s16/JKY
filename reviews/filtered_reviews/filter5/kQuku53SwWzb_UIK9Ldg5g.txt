How does this place have so little amount of stars? It's Pepe's Tacos, not some fancy Mexican cuisine restaurant. The staff has always been very friendly and the food is even more amazing. My girlfriend and I love to come here and get the menudo and a quesadilla with al pastor meat. This is definitely one of my favorite places to go to when I need great authentic Mexican food. The only place that I have to say is better is Felipito's.
