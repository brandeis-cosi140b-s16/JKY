OMG! This place was the most amazing Mexican restaraunt I have ever been too. It was so by coincidence that I stumbled upon this place and I am so happy I did. There was not one thing bad about this place. Watermelon Sangria to die for. Chrispy chicken tacos were delicious and desert OMG! The atmosphere is wonderful and our waiter Jose was great. What an awesome find. I can't wait to go back. I wonder if tomorrow is too soon?
