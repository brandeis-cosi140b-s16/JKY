I can truly  say I have never had a bad meal here or when they were at their other locations. The complimentary salsa and chips with bean dip is a great way to start off along with one of the great margaritas.  I always order the enchilada de calabacitas  and a side of habanero salsa, it will blow your mind and you will remember  that meal days later. The service and managers are attentive and always fantastic, the bartenders  are very helpful in picking out a shot of tequila for you to try. They also have some Mexican brew on draft!
