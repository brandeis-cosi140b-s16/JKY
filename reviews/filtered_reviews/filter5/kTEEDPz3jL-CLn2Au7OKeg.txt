This place was amazing the food was so yummy and the chips and salsa amazing ..Its a casual dining place you can tell its been around for a long time and that's whats good about it. It was packed when me and my husband went but that's how it is there all the time. People love real food and a real dining experience. Its not a big place but I think its worth it even if its small spot. The enchildas are to die for.
