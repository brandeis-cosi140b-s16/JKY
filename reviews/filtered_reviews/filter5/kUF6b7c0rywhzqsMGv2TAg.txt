I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The place is hip and clean. They seemed understaffed BUT like another Yelper stated, "the food is worth the wait." If you go on Tuesdays, it is dollar-off certain tacos.

The tacos I had were delectable - I will be back!

A solid 5 stars for food and 3 stars for their lack of servers. (We had to wait a while to get our food).
