Love the food here and is extremely customizable.  All the choices are fairly good.  Great place for takeout as you can just fill out the pad drop it off and wait.  Although sometimes depending on how busy it is there can be a bit of a wait.  Also, they have a gluten free menu and are willing to customize those dishes.
