my new favorite Taco shop in vegas. So just some inside info. I lived in Mexico for 4 months when i decided to do some traveling. and i never thought id ever be able to find a traditional taco shop again... until i came here. This place is freaking amazing. Im not one for red meat BUT the carne asada here is to die for. SO juicy and flavorful. I get a corn tortilla with the carne asada and all the fixings. onions, peppers, guac and cilantro. you know a taco is good when it doesnt need cheese... and the chips. OMG. homemade with homemade guac, and a slasa bar. what more could you ask for! at $2 a taco you will leave here stuffed without spending more then $10.
