We were in town for a conference and thought we would try this place after seeing it on Triple D. It was AWESOME !! We had the Cochinita Pibil which was the best shredded pork I have ever tasted! It was so juicy and tender! Then we had the Churos Relenos de Cajeta de Cabra for desert. It was Amazing! The carmel sauce with the churros and the ice cream are so good. Everyone in my group left there so grateful we had found this place. The food was incredible. Whenever I am in Phoenix again, I am definitley coming back here!
