I have been eating at Chino Bandido for over 15 years.  I have my favorite (Jerked Chicken) that I always order, but sometimes I will sample something else to mix it up. If you are new to them, ask for samples, it helps in ordering.  Don't let the exterior fool you, this is no dive.  The food is amazing.
