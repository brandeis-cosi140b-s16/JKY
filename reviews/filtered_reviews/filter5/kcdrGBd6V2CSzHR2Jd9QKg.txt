What an awesome place to hear some tunes.  You thought I was going to say grab a bite to eat (even if it is an amazing place to get some Mexican influenced grub).

Saturdays seem to have turned Las Velas into a dance club with a Latin twist.  You get to hear all the great popular dance music that are hits today, but you also get to hear the Latino dance songs as well.  The part of the restaurant that overlooks Market Square is transformed into a dance floor and is instantly crowded.  Speaking of crowded, this whole place is crowded from the time they start, until the moment that last beat drops.

Drinks, Â¡Muy delicioso!  I have a soft spot for margaritas, and Las Velas has definitely found that soft spot and exploited it.  I couldn't get enough!  Margarita not to your liking, try anything else here and I'm sure it'll be just as good.  Full bar can never disappoint.  Chips and salsa, Chips and queso, can't decide, I suggest both.  

Need something to do on a Saturday night and are in the mood to be downtown, I strongly suggest stopping by here.
