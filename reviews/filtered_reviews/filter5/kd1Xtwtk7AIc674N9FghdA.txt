Definitely one of the best and my favorite Mexican restaurants in the greater phoenix area. I've literally eaten here two nights in a row: the service is always awesome, everyone is so nice. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed, it's all SO GOOD. I'm not a vegetarian but they have amazing vegetarian options that even I get sometimes. Seriously, why go to filibertos or some place like that when you can get restaurant service for practically the same price, AND you get bottomless chips and salsa AND the food is better. Great good, great prices, great people/service, never probably go to another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.
