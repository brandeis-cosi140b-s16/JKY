This place brings back true Mexican cuisine in North Scottsdale. I'm excited to go back because the food and service were outstanding! I wish I remember our servers name so you could request him, but he was from Spain and had two daughters. If you read this I hope you made the trip back brother. Oh and you must have the street corn...unique and delicious. Thanks guys for a great time
