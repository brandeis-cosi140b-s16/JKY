I love this place and take my family to it whenever they're in town.  The food is great, it's family owned and it's reasonably priced.  They're happy hour can't be beat (I think I paid $3 for house margaritas) and I love the salsa.  Great atmosphere and really laid back.  Always really packed during Giants games (Spring Training).
