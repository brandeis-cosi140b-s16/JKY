Santa Fe chicken is succulently amazing !! This palace is very unique and the margaritas are awesome. My mother had the Carne adobada and she was so happy that wants to come back again. My bf got the Pasta Heidi , creamy spicy and delicious ! Great place to eat if you are looking for New Mexican style .
