We were looking for a lunch stop for our last day and chose Border Grill.  I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the service but I have been a fan of The Two Hot Tamales since the beginnings of the Food Channel.  The family and I gave it a try and were glad we did.  
The service was top notch and what you would expect from this type of restaurant. We experienced nothing like some of the other reviewers.   We were promptly seated and greeted by the bus person with chips and salsa.  He went over each salsa with us.  The server was professional and pleasant.  The bus person never let our chips or glass go empty.   
The food was also excellent.  My 9 year old loves tortilla soup and if a restaurant has it he has tried it.  He ranked theirs at the top.  My wife had the potato tacos which she described as very flavorful and crisp.  I had the short rib enchiladas.  The sauce on the enchiladas was fresh made not from a can.  It had the right amount of heat and was very flavorful.  The enchiladas themselves were packed with short rib and excellent.  My only complaint for $27.00 for three enchiladas there shouldn't be an extra charge to add rice or beans.  
I am glad we tried it and next time we are in town it will be a dinner stop for us.
