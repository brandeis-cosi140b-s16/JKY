We  Javiers.....My husband and I enjoy a yum quality nice glass of tequila and an amazing margarita and here at Javiers we are never disappointed!! The food is very delicious as well! Right from the start with their chilled salsa and tortilla chips!! Seriously a great salsa with a bit of hot but not too much...I love a little my husband likes a lot!!....never disappoints to start a night off in Vegas at Javiers!!
