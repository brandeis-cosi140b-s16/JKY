As a Southern California Mexican, my expectations on Mexican fast food are through the roof. This place didn't just meet my expectations, it exceeded them. 

I'll start with the service. The man in charge, I wish I had his name, was so kind and showed a real passion for his business. He didn't just sit there annoyed at my European friends being unaware of what half the menu meant. He explained every choice enthusiastically, and offered up suggestions that they'd be sure to love. 

The food was top notch. I was shocked, really. The carne asada muleta exploded with flavor. The beef was incredibly juicy. The al pastor was nuts, slow roasting, and cut right off the bone similar to brazilian style birria. All this for very reasonable prices. 

I'd go back again anytime I find myself near the area. If you live nearby, GO!
