Amazing food! Amazing service (great job Madison) I stopped in for lunch today and had a wonderful experience. (Thank you Steven) This restaurant opens Nov. 18th and I can't wait to go back. 

I had the guacamole with pineapple and mint, it was very refreshing and a must for AZ warm weather, house salad, and two tacos. I tried the Urban Bean Beef and Thai Snapper. I love coffee and Urban Bean (the local coffee shop next door) so the beef was my favorite of the two. I recommend the Cilantro Dressing on everything. 

The decor and ambiance is wonderful, so glad to see that they kept many elements of the old church but it still feels like a restaurant. They have happy hour on both Sat and Sunday which is really nice. 

Thanks for a wonderful lunch Taco Guild, I can't say enough great things about my first dining experience! Excited to return and try the Lamb Taco and Ceviche.
