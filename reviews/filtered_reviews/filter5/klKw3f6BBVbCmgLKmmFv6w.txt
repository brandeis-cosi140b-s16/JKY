Everything I've said about Taco's El Gordo applies here except it's $.50 cheaper! 

La madre santa de Dios que es un taco bueno! Have you ever had a taco so good that you spontaniously start speaking spanish? Yeah. Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Taco Tijuana... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!

As we are both Mexican food aficionados, we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and our personal favorite, tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?
