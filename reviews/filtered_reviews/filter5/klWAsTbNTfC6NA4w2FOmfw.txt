Was in town by myself from NYC for a business trip and came here on the recommendation of the bartender at the W. Sat at the bar and had a phenomenal dinner! Ordered a primarita cocktail, street corn (best I've had) and butternut squash tacos (small, but very filling). Also ordered the Pumpkin Bread Pudding for dessert and almost punched the bartender it was so good! Seriously, out of this world. Great service all around and a fun atmosphere. There's outdoor seating next to a fireplace which looked great as well. Highly recommend!
