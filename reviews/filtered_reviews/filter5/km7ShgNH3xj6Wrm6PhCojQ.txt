GREAT MEXICAN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DIVEY

Canonita's food is right up there with the best Mexican I've had in LA, San Diego, and even Mexico City.  Since it opened, I have not gone to Vegas without eating there.

Everything is delicious without exception - right down to the salsa and chips that are hard not to fill up on.  Even the rice, which comes as a side with just about everything, is not to be missed.  The star of the meal, however, is always their salsa verde - hands down the best salsa verde I've ever had.  Ask for a side of it (they will charge you $1 or so but it's worth it) and pour it onto whatever you end up eating.

Don't expect a taqueria in the conventional sense because Canonita has little in common with the holes-in-the-wall where you often find the best Mexican food.  Which is not to say Canonita isn't authentic - it's just a gentrified (and thereby both healthier and more elaborate) version of the same cuisine.
