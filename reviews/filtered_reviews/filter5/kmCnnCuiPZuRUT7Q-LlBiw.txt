This has to be a hidden treasure!! We stopped in here just by chance and was taken by surprise. The inside area is very quaint and comforting, yet there is a bar to sit at if that's what you're looking for. The food is amazing!! We did there happy hour taco deal - can I just say 1.50$ taco happy hour, yes please?! You have to try all of their sauces with their chip and salsa appetizer (I believe there was six flavors, all very different and all very spectacular in every way)! If you're considering this place you might as well just give in and go cause it's amazing.
