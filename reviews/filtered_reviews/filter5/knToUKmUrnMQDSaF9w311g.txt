I LOVE DICK'S HIDEAWAY. I have never eaten anything here that wasn't amazing! I daydream about their chile all the time. Chile relleno, enchiladas, green chile stew, carne adovada--all of them have been absolutely wonderful. I love that it's hard to find and whenever I take people here, they are always impressed. 

The service is hit or miss and the inside is a little strange: dark, cold, crowded. That's fine. I'm not there for anything else except for the New Mexican food!
