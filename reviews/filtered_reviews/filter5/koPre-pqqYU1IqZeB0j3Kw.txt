The power chopped salad with shrimp, cajun beans and brown rice.  Don't forget the Green dressing (on the side).  Perfect, healthy, hearty, spicy, yummy!!  The chicken tortilla soup is very delicious as well.   I've always had good service at the Boca Park location.  It's clean and certainly fast for fresh made food.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
