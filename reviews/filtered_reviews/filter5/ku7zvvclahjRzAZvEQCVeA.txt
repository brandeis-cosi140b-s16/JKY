I went here for dinner with a large party on a Sunday evening.  We had a reservation so we didn't have to worry about a long wait but we did have to wait until our entire party arrived to be seated which I guess is pretty normal.  The 20 or so minutes I had to wait for my entire party to arrive was more than enough to explore the Clarendon which might be the most hipster place I've ever been.  I didn't really fit in because I am pretty preppy but I don't care.  They could have made the place a bit nicer, but I guess that wasn't the look they were going for.  It still looks like a nicer motel that has been redone half-assed. 

My table shared a bunch of appetizers like the guac, grilled corn, and some sort of cheese dip thing that I forget the name of.  All were excellent.  They don't give you near enough guac tho for $7.  However, it was some darn good guac.

For my entree I ordered the  1/2 Pollo Asado and it was tender, juicy, and delicious.  My only complaint is that it comes on a plate that is too small so it was a pain in the ass to eat and not make a complete mess of myself and the table.  I would order it again.  I also sampled the Chilaquiles and several tacos.  Everything was delicious.

I especially loved the chips and salsa.  The red one in the bottle is perfect.  Not too spicy, not too watery, full of flavor...just perfect.  The chips were fresh, thick, and not greasy.

Service was fast and friendly and they prices are reasonable except for the tacos and guac.  I can't wait to return.
