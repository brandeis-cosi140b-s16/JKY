The flavor is amaZING!!! I don't eat spicy stuff but this has so much flavor that I end up eating 5 small tacos! I love the ambiance and the FOOD, a must go if your spans the Phoenix area!  Finger liking GOOD! Just keep in mind that their HOT is extremely SPICY specially if you only eat mild and sweet things like me,  But we'll worth the burning tongue after each taco. I try all the beef and the tinga chicken and chicken green chile.
