Just from walking in the place looked legit! GREAT service from to front door to the bar. Some of the best salsa I've had in a very very long time. Excellent food. Who says you need to go to Mexico to have some really good Mexican dishes. Their selection of tequila was massive .Great place a must try if ever in Vegas.
