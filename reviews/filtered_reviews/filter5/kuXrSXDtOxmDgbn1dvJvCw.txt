We just got back from Mexico and let me tell you...this place is probably as close as you will get here in Gilbert. We got pastor tacos, a gordo burro and a couple beef tacos all of which were good. I usually do not order chicken at Mexican restaurants but since we had never been there before I decided to try it and boy was the chicken tasty! Guac was good, nothing that you would think came out of a tube with a neon green color, I am pretty sure they make it in house. Needless to say this place is darn good and would recommend it over Los or any bertos place around here.
