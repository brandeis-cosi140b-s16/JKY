This place is by far one of the best late night places to go. Their food is authentic and delicious. They have different lines for different meats and everything is made to order so you know that your food is fresh. I got carne Asada fries (it comes in two different sizes: small $5 and $10 for large) carne Asada tacos, and lengua tacos. The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole which is always a plus for me. 

After ordering and receiving your food you go to the cashier to pay. It does get very crowded however the wait is not too bad. The only con would be that it is located a little far down the strip, but the food is very well worth it.
