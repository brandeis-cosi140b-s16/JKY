I haven't been here in forever. Recently came for my friend birthday dinner. We sat on the patio, it was so nice out. Love the Christmas lighting and it also had a water fountain, super cuteee. Love the ambiance.

The waiter was very patient when it came to me, I'm a vegetarian so I had ask 100 questions. Haha i end up making my own nachos. Fresh chips, black beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, jalapeños and vegetables, and Salsa on the side. It was phenomenal. It was such a big portion.  Glad I shared my entrée with a friend.
