I absolutely love this restaurant and it's always my highly suggested Mexican food place for out of town guests....mainly because I look forward to seeing their faces when they try the hot spicy foods. 

My go-to entrees have always been the enchilada dinner or the chile relleno plate. Both come with a side of rice and beans and a homemade tortilla. 

My only complaint about this place is the fact that they don't serve fried ice cream. They have sopapillas and flan, but I always need that ice cream to complete my mexican meals.
