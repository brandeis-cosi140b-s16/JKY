This place is so bomb!! I come here almost two or three times a week! I live right next to it !! The beans are bomb!! The best bean and cheese I have found here in Chandler(or Phoenix in general) They also have great and efficient service ! I love that they also have margaritas and a few beers to choose from. This place is amazing !!!
