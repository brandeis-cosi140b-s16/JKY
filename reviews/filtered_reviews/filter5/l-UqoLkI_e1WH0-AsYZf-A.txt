Just went here for dinner. They were very accommodating and made modified things on the menu for us.

We got pork tacos, chile verde enchiladas, Carne asada buritto, Carne asada quesadilla and beef taquitos. 

The pork tacos and taquitos were really good. I would go back just for the pork. You should definitely try this place and get something with pork. The frijoles charros were also delicious! I will definitely come back!
