F fast food, suckas!! There's a new standard in town. The Stand's Standard burger is a prime piece of meat, made up of chuck, brisket, and short rib (hell yeah!) nestled between a soft, pillowy and buttery bun. It's a fine, quick-served burger with all the right fixins' wrapped in wax paper and served like it ought to be - tasty and a little bit cheesy, assuming you're a big boy and opted for cheese. 

This is the kind of burger place that doesn't "wow" me to the point of culinary orgasm (see my review of The Old Homestead's burger) but it's not trying to. It's not trying to be something it's not (see my review of Miracle Mile Delicatessen's pastrami sandwich). They're pretty clear about what they are - a brown bag burger and taco "joint". They don't say Kobe and give you Sirloin or Wagyu and give you Angus. It's clear. You get a good burger and that's what you get. 

One burger with a few toppings to choose from, 3 tacos (short rib, chicken, and vegetable), and a few sides is what they offer out of a small, garage-like space. Side note, the chocolate chile milkshake was awesome too - velvety chocolate with just the right amount of heat to keep you wanting more. They did the place up nice. It has charm with its solid wood tables, steal counters, and awesome employees - smiles ear to ear, friendly "hellos" as soon as you walk in no matter what task they're managing at that moment, and a sincere appreciation for walking in, ordering, and chowing. Living in NYC, I get sick of certain niceties. What can I say? It's in my nature to welcome a brutha with a head nod not a smile. Fuggedaboutit! But at The Stand, I felt true sincerity and I appreciated it. In fact, I was all about it. Congrats to the owners for wanting to open up a burger joint and succeeding. 

So get your a$$ off the pot, cleanse yourself from the garbage you eat for lunch, and go to The Stand, mutha sucka!
