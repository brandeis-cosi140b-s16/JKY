My second time to Milagro Grill and again spectacular food, service and atmosphere.  I had the Salmon with guava sauce and my friend had the burger and we couldn't stop all the oooohhhs and awwwwws, this is the best restaurant in Phoenix hands down.  We also had the guacamole with dungeness salmon and it was off the chains awesome.  The raspberry martini was fantastic.  Reed, Luke and Jarod are the best, and they have the hottest restaurant in Phoenix.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.
We didn't save any room for dessert this time but we already have a day planned for that.
