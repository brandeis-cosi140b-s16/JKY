I have been here three times and each time has been a joy! The service is pretty quick even during their busy times! I absolutely love the music they play. Although I could do without the flies that buzz by because of their open windows. I especially love their agua frescas! Fresh food and fun atmosphere! Come here if you're looking for something fun!
