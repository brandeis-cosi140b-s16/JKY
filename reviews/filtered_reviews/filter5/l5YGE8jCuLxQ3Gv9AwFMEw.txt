Brunch review! 

Decided to try brunch here after rave reviews from coworkers and was not disappointed! We all chose the brunch special that was $25 for bottomless mimosas and one dish of your choice. What a great deal! We had the opportunity to pick anything off the menu which was awesome and all of our dishes were great. Flavorful and well-sized for the price. The mimosas were good too, and we had 5-6 flavor options which was fun for us to try them all.

Aside from the menu itself- the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and constantly checked on us as well as refilled both our alcoholic beverages and water on a regular basis. Atmosphere was cute and clean, they also played some fun brunch jams that we all enjoyed humming along to as we ate. My entire group will definitely be back!
