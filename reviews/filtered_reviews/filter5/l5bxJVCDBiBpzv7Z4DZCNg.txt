Don't let the bright pink exterior (and it's location right across the street from the Arizona Republican Party) fool you, the food here is top notch. Moles are as good as everyone says they are and the red and free salsas were incredible. The steak was well marinated and tasted good even without the mole sauce. Unlock the free Tres Leche through yelp, it's worth it. Although you might be so full from your meal that dessert might be the last thing you want.
