Tried this place out this past Saturday.  Passed it many times, but never got around to trying it before.  Went through the drive thru and ordered the Carne Asada Burrito combo.  The burrito was phenomenal!  Would order it again!  Loved the flavor.  The beans and rice were ok, nothing to brag about.  The rice was actually kind of flavorless, but to be fair, the taste of that awesome burrito may have made everything else taste weak!  At the window I asked for a paper menu, but they didn't have any.  Not a big deal, just would have been nice to have.
