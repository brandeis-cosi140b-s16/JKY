I'm from New Mexico, Hatch specifically. My grandparents live in Deming, where the OG Si Senor is and I've had countless meals there. I now live in Hawaii so I take any chance I can get to have New Mexican food. The place is much like the Las Cruces location, only not quite as fancy. The initial chips and salsa include 4 different types which is always a bonus. I had shredded beef gorditas and they were excellent and the beans of course were also. I'm not a big rice fan, I usually get double beans, and the rice here isn't special so I didn't eat it. When in doubt, order a combo.

I will be back every chance I get since our family is in the area. it's always a good taste of home.
