The employees were very welcoming and pleasant. They had us try the different meat they offer - the steak was my favorite! I had it as tacos with seaweed rice and pineapple salsa...yum yum yum!
Even their coconut and chocolate bark was great for dessert.
Glad they have a drive-thru for added convenience. I'm totally hooked!
