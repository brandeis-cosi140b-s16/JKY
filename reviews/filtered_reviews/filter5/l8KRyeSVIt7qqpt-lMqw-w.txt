Just what I have been looking for in true Mexican food.

I spent the last 10 years in Tampa, FL and worked at an Authentic Mexican restaurant for 7 of those years.  Needless to say I am picky about my Mexican food and this place knocked it out of the park.  

Their skinny margarita was spot on and a generous size but, really the food was the star.  We had the mini tacos and salsa to start, the chorizo was awesome.  For our main course we had the Cuatro Moles Traditionales,the verdes mole was my personal favorite and my boyfriend enjoyed the gaujillo, but all of it was fantastic. The service was prompt, pleasant and she timed our 3 course meal perfectly. We plan on visiting again and eventually trying everything on the menu.
