My Wife and I went here for the first time for lunch on Wednesday.  It was by far the best Mexican food we've ever had.  I had the Jalapeno Tacos.  While she had the Chicken Fajitas.  We were seated right away, and the service was great.

I would never visit Vegas again without making this a regular stop.  The Chips and salsa were great as well.  I cannot stress enough how great the food was.
