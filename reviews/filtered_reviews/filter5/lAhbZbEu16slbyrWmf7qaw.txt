I know this is not authentic Mexican food; but still, it's Tex-Mex that is really, really good. The patio seating in the bar area is nice. 

Their salsa is spicy so be forewarned if you have a problem with heat; but I think it's the best salsa in the valley. The rice is also slightly buttery with corn and is addictive.

You should try:
- Fajita quesadillas
- Beef empanadas
- Fajitas
- SW chicken tacos (w/onion ring and chipotle crema)
- Beef enchiladas with ranchero sauce
- Dessert: sizzling apple crisp
