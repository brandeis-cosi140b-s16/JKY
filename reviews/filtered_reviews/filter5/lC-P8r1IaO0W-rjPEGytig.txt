I LOVE this place. My friend and I came for AZ Restaurant Week last month and everything was so delicious, I couldn't wait to go back. When another friend of mine suggested Barrio Queen for my belated birthday lunch, i was super down! While I couldn't have their yummy margarita (boo work day), I wholeheartedly enjoyed everything I ate. 

The bean dip and chips they provide is solid. Then, of course, you have to order the guacamole! They'll make it as mild or spicy as you want and table side! Big chunks of avocado, freshly chopped peppers, pomegranate...SO GOOD!  My friend ordered the Pozole and seemed really happy with it. I ordered 3 tacos: the Cochinita Pibil (which they're known for), the Relleno, and the Camaron. I love me some shrimp tacos so the Camaron did not disappoint. The Relleno is pretty much carne asada with a roasted jalape√±o at the bottom...spicy and fantastic! The Cochinita Pibil is marinated pork and it was so juicy and yom yom yom.

The customer service was also top notch. A woman (possibly the manager) came by and asked my friend if she wanted a to-go container for her Pozole. My friend said yes, but then our waiter came by and took her bowl. When the woman came back with the container, we realized he wasn't taking the bowl to transfer it to the container. The woman felt so bad she offered to have some more made to put in the container. My friend didn't want to put anyone out, so she politely declined. Then the woman offered her guacamole to go, to which she said YES! It was really so kind of her to go above and beyond like that for a simple mistake. 

Oh and they surprised me with the Flan for dessert for my birthday and it was BOMB.com. The sauce tasted like coffee...so good, so good.
