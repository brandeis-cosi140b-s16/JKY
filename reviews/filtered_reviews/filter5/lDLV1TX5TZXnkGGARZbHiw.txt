I can't sing enough praises for Cantina.....I know, I'm late in my  discovery....but hey it's way too many restaurants in the qc;-)  I must admit this was the first time trying guac and umm, I'll just say it has to grow on me.  The restaurant was very busy as it was during lunch on a Friday, however there was no wait time and the food was ordered and on the table in no time!  Grilled fish taco's and chicken milanese tacos were simply to die for! Full of wonderful seasoning and flavors and slaw, and pico and the rice and the beans.......and ahhhh, I just loved every minute of it.  I'm still dreaming of Cantina..........
