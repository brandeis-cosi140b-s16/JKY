This place is AMAZING.  You will not find authentic food like this in Henderson.  The food an amazing from the Mexican Corn made the traditional way from the street tacos made with a choice of about 9 different cuts of meat to the burrittos, nachos, and Mole Fries, OMG....

The staff here is amazing and will help you if you have never been here before and need assistance with the ordering process or have questions about what some items are.

The prices are extremely reasonable and did I mention they have a full bar with AWESOME Bartendars.  Christopher is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and one of the best bartendar's I have met.  

They have a Happy Hour Seven Days a week from 5 to 7pm, are you kidding me?  They are offering you an opportunity to get some food and drink cheaper then the normal price, you need to check this place out if you have never been here.

I love this place and will be back often.
