I can't believe I haven't written a review for Lindo, yet! This is my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. I come here with my family and friends at least twice a month.

If you go to Lindo, you MUST get the table-side guacamole. They bring all of the ingredients to your table, ask you how you like it, and then they make it right there. So good! I'm boring and I always get the steak fajitas, but they are bomb. Can't really go wrong with food here. 

Margaritas are delicious, too ;)

Service is normally good, though sometimes it can be a little iffy.
