Ding Ding Ding!   We have a winner!   Forget McDonalds owned Chipotle, forget Phat Burrito and Salsaritas.  This place beats them all in price and friendly service.  And the food?   Delicious!   Great Flavors all around.  Salsa bar?  Yes please.  Fyi the medium is an americans version of HOLY SHIOT my nose is running, "may I please have some sour cream nice sweet chica behind the counter?"   

Decor is trendy and urban. But seriously, are we here for the decor or the food?   Give me a picnic table and paper towel dispenser on the table and I am happy.  

If you have any doubts, I promise they will fade promptly as soon as the counter lady says hello.  If not, then shove that awesome burrito in your mouth, shut up and enjoy.  You can thank me later.
