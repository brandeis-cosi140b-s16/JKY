I haven't had the pleasure of visiting the Gilbert location, so I came in with high expectations based solely on my stellar experiences at the other Uptown restaurants. Today was the hard open, and I must say, I'm pretty impressed. I love how the staff rotates between Windsor, Parlor, Postino's, and now here. Upon arrival, we were greeted with fresh tortilla chips and deliciously spicy fire roasted salsa, and served our beers shortly thereafter. We opted for the ceviche appetizer to start, and damn! I'm a ceviche addict, and theirs rivals Hula's in awesomeness. Fresh shrimp, tomato, avocado, cucumber, onion, the obligatory lime juice, and... jicama. Jicama! Quite a satisfying crunch. For our entree, my accomplice and I split the El Capitan torta- a fresh toasted bun with carne asada, salsa, avocado, and shredded lettuce. The torta COULD be piled a little higher, based on the size of the bun, but the flavors were stellar, fresh, and just plain freaking delicious! We closed the meal out with fresh churros with chocolate dipping sauce, but I was much too full too eat more than half of one!
Rest assured, Joyride is now on our roster of neighborhood restaurants to bicycle to. I'm in love!
