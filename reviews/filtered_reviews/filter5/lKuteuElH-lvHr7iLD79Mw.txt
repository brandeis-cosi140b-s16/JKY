Great spot!
If your looking for a plate of Mexican food covered in cheese and messiness...this is not for you!
Mercadito is an upscale tapas style Mexican restaurant. We went for couples date night (yes guys it's us!!) and damn near drank them out of tequila and shut the place down! 
Fish tacos...chicken tacos...shrimp tacos...beef tacos...pork tacos...so good they come 4 small tacos to an order so you can all try one. We also started with nachos...great flavor and presentation...not too messy looking! Only think I don't like is you have to order chips and salad separately (my opinion)
We also had rice and beans...Mac and cheese and Mexican corn...all food delivered with a bang. From the managers to the waitstaff and bartenders we got A+ service. We were 2 couple with kids in kids quest ( yes you know who we are) and we got a little rowdy and has a little too much fun but i think  we made up for it with our spending!
Can't wait to go back! New favorite date night couple spot! 
Well done Mercadito!
