The salsa bar is "all that and a bag of chips!" "Since when do you go to a salsa bar, where the salsas are actually really full of flavor, thick (not watered down), and unique?!" as my friends put it so well! It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly "peanuty." There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!

Slow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much. We live so far from here that I just wanted to "stock up," and I came oh so close to having to be rolled out of the place like that "blueberry girl" from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
