This place is amazing. I've been here twice and was surprised both times at how much meat they give you. The short ribs are excellent and the guacamole is perfect. 

My only problem with this place is the girl behind the counter who talks way too loud. She's been there both times I've come for lunch. I get that it's noisy back there, but no one else behind the counter talks nearly as loud as she does and I hear them fine. I'm not letting this affect their rating though, since the food is worth it.
