OK I go to many places for Fish Tacos, but this over the counter place is just fantastic. First the fish is so lightly battered and tender it literally melts in your mouth. The chunky tartar sauce is tangy and rich with flavor and if your like me I add some Hot Salsa to the mix and BAM what flavor.

I'm a big guy and 2 tacos fills me up, just fine, so for a quick lunch or like I experience the Fish Taco must have now feeling, this is my place to go.
