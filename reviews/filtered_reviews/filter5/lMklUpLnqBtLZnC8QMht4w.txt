Truly the best Mexican food you will find. The food is so fresh, I usually get the taco salad and the chicken is the freshest I have ever tasted. The service is quick and everyone is very friendly. Before you even have your drink there are fresh tortilla chips on your table with 2 delicious salsas. It's a must try when in Indian Trail.
