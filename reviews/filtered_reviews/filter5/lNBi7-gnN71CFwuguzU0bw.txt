If you are visiting vegas and tired of spending $20 on hotdog and fries at the hotels THEN this is the place you need to go so YOU CAN SAVE MONEY AND EAT GOOD!

Best quesadilla ever!! So it's setup like chipotle were u can add your own toppings. 
Also the quesadilla is HUGE!!!! You have ample choices of meat to choose from, veggies and rice and cheeses.

The food was muy bien...the price was right considering what Vegas was charging to eat at these other places. The service is quick, place is clean and ample drinks to choose from.

Believe me you wont be disappointed by eating here.
