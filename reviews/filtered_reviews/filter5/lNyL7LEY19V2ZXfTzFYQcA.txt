YES!

This place is dakine!  I finally got to try this today and all I had to say to the lady when I was leaving was "See you next Thursday!"  This place is so friendly, I want to call the people there Auntie and Uncle.  I like the local accents, I miss living in Hawaii.  The people here are SO FRIENDLY!

I got the Burrito with Flour Tortilla, Kalua Pig (Hooo!), Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Cabbage and Lettuce.  For Salsas, I got the Mango & Roasted Corn and Tomato W/ Grilled Maui Onion.

This place so uno broke da mout! Yah, really.  I also got some desert - the coconut bark.  Wow, it was really good.  The sauces they have at the table were good. My favorite was the mild and hot one.  The other two were too sweet for me.

This place is awesome, I am so happy I tried it. I even want to eat there again tonight, but this time bring my wife and kids.  The Kalua Pig was perfect, I loved it.  The seaweed rice is brown rice with some nori in it.  Very delicious.  Black beans and corn is my weakness... Winning combo.

This place has Hawaiian Sun canned drinks and a soft drink station that has Light Lemonade. 

I did get a chance to check out the bathroom too since the table sauces got me all sticky.  Place is nice and clean.  I love this place.  Great way to start off the year.  This goes instantly in the lunch rotation.

You guys need to open a place further west... like Tropicana and Fort Apache or Charleston and Town Center. You'ld make a killing and I'd never have to buy groceries every again.
