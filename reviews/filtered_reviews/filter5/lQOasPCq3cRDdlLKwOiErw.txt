Love this place! My husband and I stopped in for a few drinks and bite to eat Friday night. The atmosphere is high energy, with exceptional attention to detail; like throwing a fun modern flare on their delicious cocktail/tapas menu. We can't wait to go back to experience the full lunch/dinner menu!
