While getting ready to check out of our hotel we searched for restaurants in the area with top ratings and this was on the list. Awesome food and fresh! To be honest the best food we had all weekend long in Vegas! Guacamole was fresh no artificial taste. The red hot salsa definitely on point. As far as food goes we order Chile relleno plate (good in flavor), adobado wet burrito (very filling and great for the price), and the adobado torta (to die for.... fresh...best recommendation ever). We even got free refills. Great service, clean place,  and Frank himself if awesome great personality. These phatties loved this place :) we shall indeed return...hoping to try the green salsa (they were out :/)
