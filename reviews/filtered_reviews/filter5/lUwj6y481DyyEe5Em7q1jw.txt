Mi Patio has the absolutely cheapest margaritas in town, fer sure!!! $1.75 for a yummy confection on the rocks is fabulous--and it's a GOOD margarita, not a watered-down version. 

That said, fellow Yelpers, DO be responsible when imbibing upon Mi Patio's spenderiferous drinks.

Now that all said--Mi Patio also has some of the best chips and salsa in town to boot!! Combine all that with the fab Mexican fare, fast and friendly service [no, dear, I DON'T mean cervezas, although their beer is ice cold too!] and homey barrio decor and you've got a fiver on your hands.

And now for the piece de resistance [or whatever the heck the French spell i out!]--there is a little tiny little patio out back now for the smokers. [not that I smoke, but I understand that smokers have to have someplace to go, too...]
