I was craving pozole so of course my mister & I looked on Yelp & stumbled upon this place. Following my map it led me to Sapphires Gentlemen's Club & I thought "Crap are we going to have to pay a cover??" To my pleasant surprise the restaurant has its own entrance so we came inside.

Upon coming in we were greeted & told that the tables were full. Not a problem, we sat at the bar (I was craving a margarita anyway). 

We were served chips & salsa (delicious by the way) while we read the food menu. After my margarita fix I got the pozole ($9.50) & my mister got shrimp tacos ($15.50). The pozole was very tasty & very authentic (trust me I know, I'm Hispanic & my grandma makes bomb pozole) & my mister enjoyed his shrimp tacos which came with a side of rice & beans. 

Being locals, we will definitely be back. I've been wanting to find a good Mexican restaurant & I found my spot. 

If you're visiting Vegas definitely check this place out, the food, drinks, customer service & atmosphere is really great. 

Now if you don't mind I will be enjoying this beautifully presented flan & I have a lot of tequila left to finish!
