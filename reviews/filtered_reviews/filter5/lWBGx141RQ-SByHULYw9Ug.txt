I ordered a burrito... Let me start by saying it was amazing. The melted cheese and the flavorful meat was delicious. From outside it doesn't look like much but this place really impressed me. As a Mexican I am always extremely critical to Mexican establishments (can't ever compete with Mom's food) but I can say those beans and that melted cheese in the burrito really brought me home! I highly recommend this establishments. And their mango drink.... That's another yelp review by itself.
