Great tacos!!!!!   The shrimp and steak tacos are the best.  The best side is the spicy avocado pasta salad.  Their tomatillo sauce is delicious as well.  Truly one of our favorite places in NODA.  The drinks are great too.  Get there early because the wait is long...but well worth is.  Also, this place is awesome to get together with family or friends.
