My husband and I found this place while searching for our next Mexican hot spot.  We are actually here right now having dinner.   It's part sports bar part Mexican restaurant but all yummy.  We have ordered the chicken pablano faitias and the beef taco they were all amazing.  The quality of food is def up there and the prices r very reasonable.  Anyone out there searching should stop at this great spot.
