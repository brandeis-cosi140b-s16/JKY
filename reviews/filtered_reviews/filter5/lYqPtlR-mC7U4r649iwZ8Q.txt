Delicious is an understatement. Carolina's Mexican Food is one of the best, if not the BEST Mexican food restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. If you are in the mood for Authentic Mexican Cuisine, this is a must visit. There burritos, tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas are amazing. Each ingredient is tasty alone, but when combined; it's a miracle in your mouth. I never knew how good something as simple as a: bean cheese and potato burrito could be until I eat there the 3rd time. (I have probably  eaten here 900000000 x! :) ) I highly recommend this place!
