Just a forewarning the lines at the Cabo can be a bit long Friday and Saturday night. That being said its worth the wait and the buzzer they give you reaches across the street to the shops if your looking to blow some time. 
Once your seated the chips and dip are amazing and the service is great. I will however warn you that you may have to seek professional help after taking that first bite. If your anything like me you may become a Fishoholic. Night flashes, shakes, panic attacks. I guess it all depends on how well you can handle a taste of heaven on earth.
