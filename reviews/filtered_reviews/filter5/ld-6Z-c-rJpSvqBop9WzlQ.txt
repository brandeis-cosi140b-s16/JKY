I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as I did!

I've had Mexican Food in the best restaurants in Mexico City, & hands down Padre's lives up to it's reputation of being one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out... Although every one boasts about their Margaritas, I tried out the Sangria, it was so good that I had ordered a second...

I will definitely go back!
