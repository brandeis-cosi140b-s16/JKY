I visited New Mexican Grill for the first time last night (Lindsay location), with my sister and two of her kids.  They had all been here previously.  I was very impressed!

The physical location itself is very well kept and quite clean and the huge menu of choices presents itself nicely as you walk in.  The staff were all friendly, attentive and accommodating.

The food is fantastic.  I am an Arizona native and grew up with a mexican family (my mother's best friend), so I've been raised on Sonoran and New Mexico style mexican food.  AZ has its fair share of questionable establishments; believe me, this is NOT one of them.  

Everything was prepared at the time of ordering and the freshness of the ingredients plays out very nicely in the dishes.  A hallmark for me, or a gauge by which to judge how good a given restaurant of this nature is, is the quality of their rice and beans.  Absolutely top-notch here.  Carefully prepared and not overly laden with other flavors.  

The same can be said throughout their menu.  Even my nephew was very impressed.  He's not a pro (yet), but he is in a culinary program and is highly aware of kitchen procedures, health guidelines, etc.  The kitchen here is open and can be readily seen, so he noted several things that he noticed and was impressed by.  Everything from the state of the kitchen, to food prep to how good the actual food was.

All in all, very well done!  Give them a shot, you won't be disappointed.  I'm also a bit of a chorizo aficionado, so I think I may return there this morning and have some breakfast!  :D
