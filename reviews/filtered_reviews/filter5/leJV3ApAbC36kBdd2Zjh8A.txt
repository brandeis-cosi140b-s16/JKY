This place rocks!  I'm from San Antonio so Mexican food has to be done right to impress me.  The chips came with creamy refried beans and green salsa.  Excellent.

The margarita was $4.95 at 8pm!  It was excellent.  I had the steak ranchero with jalape√±os and it was pretty good.  A little too much gravy for my taste but most will love it.  This is not a place to bring your clients but the food is reasonably priced, tasty, and close to the strip.  Give it a try.
