You have to check out Joyride. What a blast. Gilbert has needed an awesome new hang out and Craig Demarco has done it again. Sit at the bar and you will not be disappointed. IF you are lucky enough to have Chris(tall and bearded) as your bartender, you will have the best service in town. The fish tacos are great and the nachos are probably the best item on the menu to share. 

One again upward projects has provided an awesome restaurant and I can't say enough GREAT things about this place and it's staff.
