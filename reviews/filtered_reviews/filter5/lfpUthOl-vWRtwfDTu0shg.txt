Best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  Drinks were amazing.  Love the patio and the setting.  I don't believe all the bad service reviews.  I have never had bad service no matter what day or time of day.  I wanted to tell the chef how much I enjoyed the food and Chef Damon took the time to come out and talk for a few moments. Top notch!  I would recommend this restaurant to locals and travelers alike.
