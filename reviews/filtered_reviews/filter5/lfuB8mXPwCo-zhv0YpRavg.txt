Amazing food. The menu offers many more interesting choices than I am used to from the other local Mexican restaurants, and they're absolutely delicious 

The service was solid.

The extensive salsa bar is worth the trip alone.

They have Anchor Steam Beer for $3.00 during happy hour (Try it, you'll like it)

Beautiful artwork on the walls, and a very laid back, non pretentious, but still classy, environment.
