So... My question was, do they really have the BEST taco in VEGAS? My response has to be YES!  Skirt steak, marinated and grilled to moist freakin' yummy perfection!

Chips and salsa rated as best in Vegas to us personally! 

Carnitas were pricey.. But wait... Was it worth it! Hands down the BEST giant chunks of well seasoned succulent pork! Heck yeah! 
Chicken Tamale appetizer was a surprise! Very flavorful!! We will come here again!
