How have I not reviewed this place?

I am pretty ashamed of myself for that and its a disservice to you my readers. I apologize!!!

This place is in the Maryvale area of Phoenix. They have fantastic daily specials, especially on Tuesday and Saturday. Why you ask? Good Question! 1.00 Margaritas with purchase on an entree limit 4 per person. Frozen or on the rocks and they are tiny. (Granted they are not the 1/2 gallon bucket glasses but 2 of them and I am happy, 4 of them and I am time traveling!)

Now for the food. Best. Mexican. Food. In. Arizona.

I do not say that lightly, growing up in Arizona I lived in Tucson for my childhood only to move up here to where it is hotter in my early 20s. I have had my fair share of Mexican restaurants here in town, and we have ALL been to a (Fill-in-blank)bertos.

I could drink the salsa by the gallon here. The tamales are amazing, the seafood enchiladas are wonderful, and the fajitas are to die for!

They have a ton of TV's to watch sports with too. 

The Bell Rd. Location is really good as well, but there is just something about this location that has be driving back down here even though the other one is closer. 

I highly recommend going, and you may drive right by it if you aren't careful. Its tucked away next to a pawn shop in a strip mall on the North side of the road. (More parking in back).

Go. Its worth it!
