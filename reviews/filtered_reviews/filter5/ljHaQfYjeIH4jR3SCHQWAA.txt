Sombrero's is everything I want in my neighborhood Mexican joint: The flavors are bold and spicy, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.

The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.

Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).

The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.

I've probably been to Sombrero's a couple dozen times but have been too busy stuffing my face with delicious Mexican food to write this review until now. Thanks, Yelp, for helping me find my new favorite neighborhood spot.
