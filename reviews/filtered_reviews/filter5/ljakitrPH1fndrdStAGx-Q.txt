Being from Mexico I get this question all the time. "What's the most authentic Mexican place in Charlotte". I always send them to Three Amigos.  While it is impossible to replicate the real flavors of Mexico or really any other country. This place come pretty darn close.  The Tacos al Pasto and the Mole are some of the best around.
