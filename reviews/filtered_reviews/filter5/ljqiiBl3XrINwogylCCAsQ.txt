This place is definitely 5 Star's.  Traditional Mexican food with your average atmosphere seems to be the standard here in the valley.  Cien Agaves goes above and beyond and really doesn't even compare.  Their taco's are amazing!  Except for a few apps, I haven't even tried anything else that's how good their tacos are!!  Their fresh squeezed lime Margarita's are mouth watering.  Atmosphere and Service were both top of the line.

Trust me... I'm a native of AZ and have been to many Mexican Food Restaurants... GO TO CIEN AGAVES!!!  You wont regret it!
