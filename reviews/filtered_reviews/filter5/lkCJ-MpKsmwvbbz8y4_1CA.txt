We can here for my sister's 30th birthday meal. She is obsessed with Mexican food and wanted a huge meal. This delivered on both accounts. Yes, it was totally weird driving into a strip club parking lot with my parents. And the waitress wear bustiers and booty shorts, but you get over it immediately after your first round of drinks. Our waitress had to be the loveliest woman in Vegas. She even brought the chef out after our meal  to meet us and arranged for the staff to sing to my sister (who pretended to be embarrassed but we totally know she loved it). And to top off the atmosphere the drinks and food are insanely good. No one walked away unhappy -- and we were beyond full. Hard for the bottomless pit crew we have. Overall, jump into a cab or your rental car and treat yourself here. If I can pull into a strip club parking lot with my parents, you can do it. Have a laugh and enjoy a great meal!
