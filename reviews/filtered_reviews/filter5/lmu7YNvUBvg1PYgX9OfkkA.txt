The newest BORDER GRILL opened at the FORUM SHOPS AT CAESARS. The lunch menu is fabulous! The food is so fresh! (Read all the other reviews for more details.) Our server, Adrienne, was super-friendly! I wanted to add that I love the way the company is conscious of sustainable fish, gluten-free restrictions and the ecological presentation of the table water. Instead of expensive elite bottled water or tap water, they serve water that has been through a triple filtration process on site and poured from from recycled tequila bottles that are washed and reused every day. Maybe that's what makes the difference in their lemonade, too! I loved the Pomegranate Lemonade! Definitely going back!!
