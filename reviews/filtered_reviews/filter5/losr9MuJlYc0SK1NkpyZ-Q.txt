AMAZING!!!!!

There is reason for long lines, and full parking lot. the food is Amazing!!
I am a hard critic when it comes to any restaurant. This place is great in ALL areas, This place has awesome seafood, from fresh fish fillets, shrimp and more. The other fare is awesome too, from the enchiladas, burritos and everything else. You can tell they go extra mile to make sure the food is perfect, and spiced perfectly. This is my go to place for Mexican food and Seafood fare..

Comedor Guadalajara is the Real Deal!!!
