I happened upon this place when trying to find a place for lunch with a co worker.

This place is phenomenal. Tacos tend to be my go to since you get 3 for $6. My favorite meats are the red Chile beef and pork. Each taco has the perfect amount of rice, bean, meat, cheese and then topped with cabbage and a fresh pico. The loaded quesadilla is awesome too... 

You add the food with great service and you have yourself a wonderful place to eat. !!!
