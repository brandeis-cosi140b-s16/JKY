Wife and I went to try it out after visiting Vegas and reading the reviews on here. Well needless to say this spot was the bomb. We ended up eating here the three days in the row that we were visiting for. The Campechana  (shrimp cocktail ) was excellent. The tacos were really good as well. The burritos could of been a bit bigger but nonetheless it was good. The fella at the register was cool as can be and this was overall a good place to eat away from the pricey strip.
