Always on the hunt for a top notch Latin grill. Sabor exceeds that expectation. First off, it is located in a chic little urban scale building in the Elizabeth area. The decor is cool, funky, and Latin - not at all the typical Mexican-american restaurant. They use an open kitchen design where you can see and smell all the goodness. And certainly it is important to note the attentive, friendly staff. I admitted to being a newbie with my yelp open and in hand, and they were excited to bring on a new follower.

Okay, now for the food. Ordered 2 tacos, 1 chicken 1 fish, both authentic. Outstanding, fresh, nothing else needed to say. Also ordered a large guacamole and cashed in on the free chips with the Yelp check in. The guac was clearly fresh and homemade. Top notch. The interesting thing about the chips was that they were tossed in a paprika seasoning. Top notch as well.

Go here now. You will not be disappointed.
