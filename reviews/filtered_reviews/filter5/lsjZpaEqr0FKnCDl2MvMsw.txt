If you are looking for mouth watering authentic Mexican food, then look no further than Popo's Fiesta Del Sol (Indian School location)
Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant.  This little hole in the wall eatery never lets me down.  The drinks are good and the food is delicious and authentic.
We also use them for catering at work and get nothing but compliments on "Popo's days"
