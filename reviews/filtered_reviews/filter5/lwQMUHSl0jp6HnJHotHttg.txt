As with other Someburros locations, they serve up excellent food at an inexpensive price.  The chorizo burro had a good proportion of meat to egg and potato, and was very flavorful, especially paired with the salsa they serve.  The salsa here seems to be tastier and more flavorful than at other locations.  The horchata here was refreshing, and not too sweet.  The service people at the counter were very friendly.  I'm glad there's a good place to get Mexican food in North Scottsdale!
