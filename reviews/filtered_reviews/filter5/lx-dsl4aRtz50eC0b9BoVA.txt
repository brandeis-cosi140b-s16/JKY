My husband and I stumbled on this place about a year ago after reading about it in the now defunct Calendar Section of the Arizona Republic.  We have been in love ever since.  I want to try a burro or something else so bad but I cannot tear myself away from the Tacos like a few other Yelpers have experienced, addiction, in a good way.  My husband ordered a quesadilla one time and it was delicious but I need my tacos, the shrimp ones are my faves with the chicken mole coming in second.  Vanessa (I assume this is her name from other reviews) has one of the prettiest smiles I have ever seen!  There must be a hidden Wizard at this Oz- like place, I have not ever seen anyone else except "Vanessa".  Whom ever is behind the curtain is a culinary genius in my book.
