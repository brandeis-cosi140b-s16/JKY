Places like this are the highlight of living in Arizona. Good access to cheap, delicious and authentic Sonoran food. I tried Chilaquiles here for the first time and they were amazing!! The horchata was pretty run of the mill but the empanadas were fantastic! 

I also really like the market they have. A really great place to have in the neighborhood.
