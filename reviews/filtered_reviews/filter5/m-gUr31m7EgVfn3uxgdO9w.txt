On July 11th, I had my first Cafe Rio experience. Holly crap, I cannot believe what I was missing. I had no real clue what to get so I chose the award winning sweet pork barbacoa and had it in a quesadilla. Honest to goodness it was nearly orgasmic it was so good. By far the best tasting pork I have ever eaten in my 43 years. Cafe Rio has a new loyal fan. In addition, the fresh tortillas were out of this world as well. Over the weekend I brought some home for my wife to try who loved it just as much.  

Wow.  This place is food gold.  Awesome.  If you have not been, you have to go!
