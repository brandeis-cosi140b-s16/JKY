Love. Love. Love this place. The taste, the amount, the price everything is spot on. On any given day you can find your choice of meat in steak and onions, mixed meat (pork+chicken+beef), chorizo, chicken, mixed pork with pineapple. Everything is so so good and fresh but unfortunately you can stuff yourself with only two tacos or three if you are a serious eater, but two should pretty much fill you up. There is a separate stand for the different salsas and pico de gallo. Just one warning though, the salsas are hot and by hot I mean really hot. Being an Indian, I can pretty much handle any kind of heat but not the salsas at las palmas. You can skip the salsa and your taco will still taste great with the pico de gallo and generous squirts of lime. They have a busy oakland location too in atwood, but the brookline location is cleaner and more spacious.
