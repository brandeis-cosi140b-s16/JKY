This place is excellent! Best Mexican restaurant in town, amazing street tacos (I recommend the Al Pastor) and great margaritas. Never had a bad experience here, the staff is always prompt and friendly, only downside is they can be very busy around dinner time on the weekends so prepare for at least a 40 minute wait.
