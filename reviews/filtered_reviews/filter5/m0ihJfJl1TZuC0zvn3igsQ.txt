I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place.  Shocking.  I LOVE this place.
Their quesadillas are doughy cheesy heaven.  HEAVEN.
Their tacos are the stuff dreams are made of.
Their salsa bar proof that there is a god.
Well, that may be much, but still, awesome place.
And guess what kiddies? They finally have beer!
Decor is nice, room is a bit small to contain all this awesomeness though.  Its cozy.
let me recommend  the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco.  That pork, tender, so very very tender.  Amazing in the quesa as well.
The dogfish shark and shrimp are great too. 
I haven't been disappointed yet actually.
Order one of everything! (maybe two of the pork)
