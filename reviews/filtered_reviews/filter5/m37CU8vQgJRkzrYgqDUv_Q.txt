Yelp comes through again I feel like I hit the jackpot finding out about Komex. I was hungry and on the strip but I didnt feel like spending a arm and a leg for just a meh meal. Came accross this gem and decided to make the trek. Its pretty far from the strip it was ten miles and about a 15 minute drive.

Sunday afternoon at 1:00 pm and it was pretty dead. Our server was really nice helpful and patient with us gave us good advice as far as what to order.

We went with there carne asada mexican burrito, the bulgolgi cheestake and a single bulgolgi flauta. My girlfriend loved her burrito being a san diego native and so close to the border she knows her mexican food. Not traditional but it was executed really well portions were great as to amounts of ingredients as well as overall size.

I loved my bulgolgi Philly cheese steak. It was really messy fork and knive were necessary.  I would definitely recommen it if your a fan of Philly cheese steaks. Fries sucked in my opinion soggy and lifeless. But that just made me fill up on there other awesomenss. I almost forgot while we were waiting they brought us some great guacamole and chips for free too. The flauta was good a little fluffier than im used to but still really enjoyable. 

Im lucky this place is a state away.  If it was any closer it would be bad for my waistline.  Worth the drive from the strip. Ill be back next time im in town.
