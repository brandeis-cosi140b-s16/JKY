Doing errands in the area and stopped here for lunch.  What a great place! Perfect place to watch sports, final 4 basketball on the big screens while we were here.  They turned music on during the break.  Service was nice, even down to bus boy who we chatted up. Tacos were amazing! I had the braised pork shoulder al pastor and my partner had the beef cheek which were recommended by the bus boy.  Beef cheek tacos all the way! I'm sure this place gets crazy packed at night, which isn't for me. Lunch? Anytime for this mid 30 something.
