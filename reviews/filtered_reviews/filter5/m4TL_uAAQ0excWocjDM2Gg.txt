In a neighborhood full of mediocre bar food, Yo Rita is a diamond in the rough. The tiny restaurant immediately draws patrons in with windows covered in sexy, tattoo-inspired logos. Inside, the concrete bar and spare decor create an atmosphere that is just hip and modern enough to feel cooler than most South Side joints without being snobby or off-putting.

The reason everyone goes to Yo Rita, however, is the food. Oh, the food. I've consistently ordered off the a la carte taco menu and have yet to be disappointed. Whether noshing on an oyster po' boy with jalapenos, a vegetarian taco with potatoes and mushrooms, crispy pork belly, or any number of other choices, my taste buds are always surprised and delighted with tastes that I have never experienced anywhere else. The menu is innovative without being overwhelming, and the ingredients taste absolutely fresh and delicious. In short, your belly will thank you and you'll soon be longing for more.

Oh, and the margaritas aren't bad either.
