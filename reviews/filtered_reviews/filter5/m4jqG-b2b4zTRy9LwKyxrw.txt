What can I say about this place? The food is on point! The customer service is even better!

My review is purely based on the Al Pastor meat. I love it so much I haven't tried the other meats. I've had the tacos and the mulitas. 

A description of this taco...the Al Pastor is perfectly cooked on a rotating.....uuhm, stick thing! You can watch it cooking as you wait! The meat is so succulent and perfectly marinated. The perfect meat is then topped with onion and cilantro as well as this delicious, spicy, avocado sauce. This is all you need in a taco. They don't skimp on any of the ingredients! If you're feeling extra cheesy, I would recommend a mulita or two!

The place isn't very organized, they have one line for the Al Pastor meat and a few other lines for the other meats. Of course, the Al Pastor line is always the longest. I've gone where the line pretty much goes around the entire restaurant!

I would truly recommend bringing your appetite here! By far my favorite taco place in Vegas!
