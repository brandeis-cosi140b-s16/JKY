I could have sworn that I reviewed this heavenly taco joint.  With that said, i must first retract my title for Los Tacos as the best tacos place in Vegas because has El Gordo has stolen it and tucked it away in a far far place.

3 items that will have you mesmerized forever.....Spicy Pork, Beef Tongue, and Beef Head.

The pork is amazingly juicy packed with flavor and sauces that'll make you go up and order 5 more.

The beef tongue is super tender and soft and melts like butter.

The beef head is naturally delicious with a strong beefy taste to it so beware if you're sensitive to smells.  The meat is extra soft as well.

I usually always get tacos of the 3 but venturing out is definitely worth it.  Tostadas and Mulas are not bad options and if you've been here 2312932 times and always order tacos, these are the ones to try.
