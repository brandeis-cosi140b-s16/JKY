The tacos are inexpensive and delicious! Their selection of draft beers and bottles is extensive and eclectic. Their waitstaff and their hostess are very helpful, polite, and fun.  When you go, you have to have the churros and the flan! Their tacos are great and the queso modelo is awesome! The best part of my Las Vegas trip was eating there each night!
