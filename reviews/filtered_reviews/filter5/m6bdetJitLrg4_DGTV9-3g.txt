As far as fusions this has to be one of my favorites. Taking sushi, adding some Mexican flare and rolling it up in burrito form using a tortilla,soy paper or seaweed with rice(white or brown). GENIUS!
-I went with the signature burritos and added some other menu items to make it unique. it has the same concept like a Chipotle where you go down an assembly line building your own Jaburrito to perfection. There is a condiment bar at the end near the register where you can get salsas, wasabi, soy sauce and ginger, help yourself.
-So pick from the list of burritos or "roll your own" !
