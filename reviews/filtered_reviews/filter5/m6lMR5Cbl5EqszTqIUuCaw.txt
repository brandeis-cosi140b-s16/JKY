Heebus Jeebus this is our new favorite "mexican" restaurant in Vegas.

Three words: BEST. SALSA. EVER. Wait, is that drool on my space bar as I nostalgically reminisce about the most fantastic, mind blowing restaurant salsa I've had IN MY LIFE? Hold on as I grab some more tissue. *slobber slobber*

We flagged the waiter down and I attempted to charm the kadoozie out of him to get the secret recipe, but all we pulled out was that it was "made fresh daily", "the tomatoes are roasted on a hickory grill" and "vegetarians always get mad 'cuz they say there's meat flavor in the salsa when in fact it's just the smoke from the grill which gives it that sweet smoky taste". Stupid vegetarians. Every day I try to consume twice as much meat as recommended by my doctor just to cancel out one vegetable-eating moron. 

I got the enchiladas and hubby got a burrito. We got massive food coma immediately after and swore that the next night we'd down massive amounts of red bull to make up for pitifully calling it quits at 11pm. Vegas Fail!

Came back again for a farewell lunch a few days later. The tortilla soup I ordered was nothing to write home about but jiminy crickets the hubby's chile relleno knocked my socks off. Buahaha, that's what she said.

Also, GREAT service. Definitely returning.
