Right off the bat 5 stars for organic n non-GMO - sorry but if eat all organic your heart skips when you find a place to eat out!  We've been twice, it is hard to find, just look for Sapphire gentleman's club, the restaurants entrance is to the left of Sapphire's main entrance.  The service has been great both times (fri n sat nights) and included table touches from the GM and Chef Paco.  Admittedly we enjoyed it more the first time but will return many more times as it really can't be beat for an organic/no-GMO choice (are there even any more??)  Hands down winner has to be the seafood enchilada (according to our guests on both visits) but I really enjoyed the salmon, and am excited to try more dishes in the near future.  Also they make the best authentic painkillers (very hard to find in the States let alone the desert!), and strong as hell too! 
Many great daily promos, like Monday is 50% off for locals, and Friday is BOGO seafood dishes, oh and an all-you-can-eat/drink street tacos night (Thursday maybe?) 
Did I mention we live 30 minutes away?? Yeah, we love it THAT much! (Would love to see another location up around Summerlin, I'd be a frequent flyer for sure!)
