The food was great. 
It took a while to actually get our food after ordering it, but at least I know that my food was being cooked fresh.
The oysters were to die for. Arranged beautifully and with tons of flavor.
I went with a large party and I can say that everyone enjoyed it and we will be going back for sure.
