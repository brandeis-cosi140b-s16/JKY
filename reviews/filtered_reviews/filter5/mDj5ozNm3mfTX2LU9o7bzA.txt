I wish you could taste the food (and margarita) just by reading this. The food never disappoints. The staff are wonderful, but the food remains the star! It is one of those local places that when you discover it, you want to both keep it a secret, yet share with the world because it's so good. Kudos on that raspberry margarita ! 10/10 limes on my "how good is that margarita" scale.
