Great food!!!  The service is somewhat lacking, but I think that's just the culture and most of their clientele is very happy and comfortable with the level of service provided.  I think we were probably the only white table in the place.  We arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  We didn't think it would be so crowded but it was a 20 minute wait for us. Well worth it.  The place was packed and when we left there was still a line out the door.  Can't wait to go back . . .
