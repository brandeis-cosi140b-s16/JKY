Amazing food, warm accommodating atmosphere and did I mention the food? We came here as a big group of nine (including a picky seven year old) and had an amazing lunch. As the lone vegetarian I got the 'El Flaco' which was some kind of veggie burrito with beans. Now normally these veggie burritos are just rice and beans but this one had all kinds of delicious veggies in there and the sauce was just the perfect mix of spices. I surveyed the group and every one of us had a great meal. 

Oh, and that picky seven year old ended up devouring some churros and sopapillos =)
