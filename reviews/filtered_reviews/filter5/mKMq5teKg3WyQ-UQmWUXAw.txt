Wow! What a find! We were in the Area and yelp lead us here. The decor was very cool  and beautiful. The cool menu was short but full of quality. Our server was Carlos and he made our experience there extra cool. So we now call him Cool Carlos! We did not have to ask for refills on our cool drinks...very cool, the salsa was amazing...and the chips had a cool chili powder, so they were...cool too!  Cool Carlos explained the menu to us and even helped out with one of our picky eaters! We will be back again! Very cool!
