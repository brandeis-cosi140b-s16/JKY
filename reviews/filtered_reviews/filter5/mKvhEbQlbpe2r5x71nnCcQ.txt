Five words: Back Patio, Happy Hour, Friday

First: Back Patio. There are two patios at Aunt Chilada's. One is in the front when you walk in, with a bocce ball court and an outdoor bar. The other is through the restaurant in the back. I recommend this back patio. It's very large - on warmer days they have the misters flowing freely, and the cool strung lights at night. The trees around it make it feel somewhat secluded, and as the temperatures go down, this is the perfect spot to have a margarita or beer.

That being said: Happy Hour and Friday should really go together. During the week, Aunt Chilada's has happy hour snacks for free. Usually enchiladas, chips and salsa, etc. But on Fridays, they step it up 5 notches. The happy hour food goes on the back patio, where you can get chips, usually taco meat, beans, enchiladas, veggie tray, fruit, salsa, etc. for free. They continuously refill the free food while it is happy hour, so don't fret if the enchilada tray is empty. 

One of my favorite patios in Phoenix.
