Stopped by Gallo Blanco Cafe as I heard they had a great Happy Hour and I was not dissappointed.  Not sure what more I can add with over 500 reviews here but what I can say is that the Taco's are delicious.  

Tried one of each of their offerings, the Cochinita with Pork in a orange garilc sauce, Carne Asada made with Grilled Ribeye, Shrimp served with slaw & Guacamole and although they did not have the Halibut option we did get the Ahi Tuna.  I am used to Ahi raw and this one was cooked, probably to perfection, but next time I will request it rare.  All this goodness and all under $2 per Taco with the exception of the Ahi which I think was priced at $2.50.  

The Made to order Guacamole with chips was a deal at $5 and all draft beers were $3 for happy hour.  

A special shout out to our server Rebecca, she was terrific!
