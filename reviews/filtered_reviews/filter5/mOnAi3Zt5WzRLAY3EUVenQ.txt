Great happy hour! I loved this place. The atmosphere was really chill. My waitress was awesome and really helpful. They were pretty busy and their weren't too many people helping out but she managed to stay friendly and calm and make her way around to everyone. Oh and the food and horchata was deeeelicious. If I'm ever in Phoenix I'll come back!
