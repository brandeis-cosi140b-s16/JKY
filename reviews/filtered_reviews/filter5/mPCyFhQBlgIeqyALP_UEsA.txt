The same folks who used to own La Comida Ranchera or Ole! in Gilbert. Some say we moved down the street from there to be close to the food. I cried a little inside when they closed.

Made me really happy when they opened the Burrito Shack and I have threatened a few times to move towards them. 

Try the chicken chimi with green sauce. I normally don't care for spice but the flavor is worth the burn!
