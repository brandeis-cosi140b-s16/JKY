This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at especially when I'm pregnant. I'm not as daring as my husband, I stick to the Asian menu.  I always order the same thing: Chicken Bulogi, Fish Tacos, Kimchee Fried Rice, Wonton Soup and the Chow Fun. The staff is very friendly and I can't wait to try their Soju-tini!
