So my girlfriend (a mom of 2) is a fanatic for Mexican food and it is Mother's Day so we had to try it.  GREAT PLACE!  From the moment you walk in you know you're in an authentic Mexican restaurant (decor, music etc.)  Everyone (except my lil one) tried something outside of their comfort zone and loved it!  The service was incredible and this was even more impressive since it was a packed house (Tip: Make a reservation).  We must have been asked 5x if everything was okay which some may think is annoying but I appreciate this in a restaurant and it shows a willingness to correct anything that may be wrong before the meal ends.  We'll definitely be back and would recommend it to those wanting a good experience and good food.
