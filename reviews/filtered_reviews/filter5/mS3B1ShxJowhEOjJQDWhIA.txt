Sooo soo yummy. Friendly staff who actually takes pride in their business & genuinely cares about their customers. I love supporting family owned places like these- they are usually more delicious than a chain restaurant because of their own homemade recipes. 

I'm addicted to the bean and rice burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Can't get enough of it. Highly recommend this spot!
