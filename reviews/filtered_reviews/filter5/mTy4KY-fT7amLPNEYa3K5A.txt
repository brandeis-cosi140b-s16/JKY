The food was awesome!  I had the three tacos:  chorizo, chicken and ground beef.  The taco shells were super fresh and I love that they provided the lime wedges to give everything that extra fresh taste.  The torillas were excellent as well.  They worked very hard to revamp this place it looks totally different and the decor is very nice.  Small and like a previous reviewer stated, if they stay consistent with this quality, it will be hard to find a seat.  Much like It is hard to get a set at Black Dog.  We will be taking the kids very soon.
