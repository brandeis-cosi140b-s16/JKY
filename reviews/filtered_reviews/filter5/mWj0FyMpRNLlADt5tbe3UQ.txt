The concept is insanely awesome. Was in Vegas for a week and this was our first stop. Its away from the strip, but definitely worth the trip. First time there I ordered the Thai chicken nachos. Delicious! One of the best things I've ever eaten, without a doubt. I liked this place so much we went back 2 days later before we left to go home. The second time there I had the buffalo chicken nachos, they were also very tasty and saucy.

Both times we were offered jalapeno cornbread muffins. They were pretty good, and I really liked the fact that they were moist like cornbread should be. The jalapenos weren't overpowering and added a little extra something that was unique.

The staff was great, very nice and very helpful.

I read other reviews before I was there, and I must say some people don't know what they're talking about. I'm from out of state and I thought this place was great! 

If I was a local, this would totally be my regular spot. I will definitely be going back whenever I'm in town.
