Unique, tasty, variety or flavors, and great value.

When it comes to bulgogi tacos it doesn't get any better. What? Exactly. These aren't your typical tacos here, they take tacos to another dimension. This family-run gem has an awesome mix of food. Korean-Mexican fusion! Who knew?

They have a decent sized menu here with Korean food, Chinese food, Mexican, Korean, and of course the fusion. They even have burgers on the menu which my 5 year old son enjoyed.

Thank you Yelp! I would not have found this place if not for this site. I'm surprised to see anything below 4 stars for this place, but I guess people have different tastes. If you typically like Mexican and Asian cuisines I would recommend this highly. Try something from the fusion menu - it is fantastic!
