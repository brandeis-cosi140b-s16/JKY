I have never ever heard of this place until two days ago. After a google search and menu perusal I got excited!! Went to dinner tonight and I was not disappointed in the slightest. The restaurant is basic; meaning the focus is on the food not the decor. It's actually refreshing to be in such a laid back casual atmosphere. It allows the food to shine. Bathrooms were spotless which is +++ in my boom. Jerk chicken is totes amazeballs also the Cuban beans. Next time I go I am going to try the veggie quesadilla. I saw that being served at the next table and it gave me entree envy. So just GO!!
