My new favorite Traditional Mexican restaurant . The staff is really friendly and the place is spotless. I love their house made salsas. I was very surprised with the variety they had on fresh fruit waters. One thing that I found very unique is how the menu had traditional plates from all over Mexico and next to the name of the plate is the state if where it originates . I actually had the opportunity to meet chef Paco , he was very friendly and asked me if I had any special requests. It was nice to know that the restaurant carries organic and gmo free plates.
