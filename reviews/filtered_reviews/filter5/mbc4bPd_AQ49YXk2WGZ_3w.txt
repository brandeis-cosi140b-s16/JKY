If you are tired of the same, humdrum, Mexican food place (and let's face it, AZ has a LOT of them) I recommend trying Fuzzy's Taco Shop on Mill Avenue!

I read the previous reviews on here and couldn't be more dumbfounded with the response.  

This place was:
Friendly? Check.
Helpful? Check.
Tasty? Check.

This is a regular stop for me when I'm on Mill.  I love the food, the happy hour gives you huge cheap drinks (if you drink -- I do not, but I recognize the appeal for everyone else), the service is with a smile, and the comfortable seating  (inside and outside) really does it for me.

Their salads are amazing, tacos (soft tempura shrimp tacos are my fav) are out of this world, and their burritos are HUGE!  You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients and the flavors blend well.  The one thing that I will say is that one time, I got a beef burrito that contained a lot of fatty meat.  Other than that, it's been pretty yummy.  So, please, do yourself a flavor and check this place out! :)  You won't regret it (coming from a girl who usually avoids tacos or burritos, I think that that says a lot!)

Yay! Fuzzy's! :)
