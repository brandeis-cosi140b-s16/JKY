My favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley! We can always count on excellent food when we come and the servers make us feel like family. Patty Cakes and Rosie are definitely our favorites they have our order and drinks memorized! Prices are right on target for my family of five, I'd eat here every day of the week if my husband would let me. If you haven't tried this place already you should.
