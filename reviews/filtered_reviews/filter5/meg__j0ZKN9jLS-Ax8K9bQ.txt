I had never heard of Gallo Blanco before my Yelpathon began. What a sad, sad life I had been living.

The restaurant and bar were so cozy, in the lobby of the Clarendon Hotel. While hanging out at the pool, we had their $5 happy hour margaritas. I usually prefer a skinny margarita - hate the taste of sweet and sour. The bartender assured me there was no sweet and sour in the bar, great news! The margarita was still a bit heavy even though it was made with fresh fruit juices. It was still yummy and you can't ask for more at $5 each.

After a day at the pool, we got ready and headed back down for dinner. I had no idea what to expect, but was very happy when I looked at the menu. I'm a girl that likes choices. Variety. I was in for quite a feast.

The tacos range from $2.50-$3.50, which means you can try pretty much all of them and not break the bank (although you may be really full). My absolute favorite was the night's special: a pork belly taco with who knows what else on it. All of the tacos (I tried the Halibut, carne asada and pork belly) were perfect.

Do not try to do the whole "with extra this, no that, substitute such and such" thing here. Just don't, you'll love them as they are! Three tacos + chips and salsa and the amazing Paloma (think Grapefruit Margarita) were enough to fill me up - though I was throwing around the idea of ordering just one more taco.

You can't forget breakfast either. I gott the Breakfast Burrito. Love. It was about a  foot long and I made a severe dent in it. And even though this is a Mexican joint, the pancakes looked AMAZING.

So yes, literally everything about Gallo Blanco was perfect, and I will be back VERY soon.
