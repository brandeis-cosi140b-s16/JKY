Very nice little place! Gets very busy around lunch time. Frank and his staff have always been very nice and treated us all well. My personal favorites there are the Adobada Torta and the Ceviche. So good and everything is very reasonably priced! I can't say enough good things about this place. Only complaint is they are only open during limited hours. It is understandable considering they are small and their primary business is the other businesses around them. So, I can't fault them for that.
