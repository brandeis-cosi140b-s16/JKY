Now this little place in tucked right in the corner in between Planet Hollywood, going southbound in between "little Hawaii" and/or The Harley Davidson "Best BBQ in Las Vegas" sign. They have $2 tacos, or the 3 combo tacos with everything except Guacamole.   The meat was tender, flavorful, plentiful, and the salsa was fresh, both the green and red salsas were spicy as they said. I had 1 tear come out my right eye. It was a delicious meal under $10 ON THE STRIP.   Outside the restaurant, people were singing karaoke, selling t-shirts with speaker attached and colored stereo waves, and "cheap souvenirs, and 2 for $1 waters (cold). I suppose it is a festive island, you can easily walk through, but should stop!
