Seriously, undoubtedly GOOD.

Carne, Pastor, Pollo, Shrimp, Fish tacos or burritos or salads or taquitos you just cannot go wrong.    

Tortillas, mexican hot dog, tortas, homemade salsas all above and beyond what you would expect.

Friendly owners with a story and a smile...all great.

This is not an average taco shop.  It is truly extraordinary.  

........Best Taco Shop in Phoenix. Period.
