If you are looking for the typical Phoenix-Mexican blanket of gloppy cheese and lard-heavy refried beans, this is not your restaurant.   If, however, you are looking for finesse and carefully crafted Mexican flavors, then rush over to Sol Mexican Cocina.

We had lunch there on a Tuesday afternoon.   We had a friendly server and excellent food.   Highlights were a bean paste dip, a very spicy salsa, and great chips.   We also tried a fish taco, a mushroom taco, and a beer batter shrimp taco.    All were terrific.  

We were less thrilled with the naked guacamole and the rice that we had as sides   But Sol had brought out a plate of condiments at the start of the meal so we were able to "season up" so we enjoyed them.  

I always had trouble finding Mexican restaurants when I have out of town guests.   Now I have Sol!
