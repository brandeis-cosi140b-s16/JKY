My son & I went for lunch today and it was awesome!!  I don't know which was better, the food or the service...
I ordered the Mexi Cobb Salad and it was soooo good!! My son ordered the big daddy burrito with filet and there wasn't a bite left on his plate. 
Everyone was friendly but our server, Phil was phenomenal! 
We went with a groupon. This was our first visit but most definitely not our last!!
