My boyfriend and I went to Nacho Daddy last night, and we loved it. The bartender sat us and was super sweet and personable. We ordered the grilled Mexican corn on the cob, which was to die for. We both could've had five more of those. The nachos themselves were fantastic, and huge! And for dessert we got the fried ice cream, which comes with chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips, which were probably even better than the fried ice cream. Service was great, food was great, atmosphere was great... Very pleased.
