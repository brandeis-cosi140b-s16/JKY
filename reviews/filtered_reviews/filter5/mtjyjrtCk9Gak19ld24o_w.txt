We called on a Tuesday night to set up an engagement party for Saturday night for our friends. The manager was very nice having emailed me right away with menu options.  The managers were very nice sending pictures of the space in their agave room. From the minute we arrived to set things up we were greeted with wonderful hospitality. We had 38-40 people with separate checks. The service was on top of things taking orders and getting things out very fast. The food and drinks were wonderful. Our friends and family had a great experience and all are happy to come again.
