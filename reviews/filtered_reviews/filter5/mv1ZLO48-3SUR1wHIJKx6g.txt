Oh, good old Dos Gringos.  I make it a point to hit up this place whenever I'm in Tempe.  The food is cheap, delicious, and there's an excellent patio that is awesome to sit on year-round.  The service can slack a bit when they're busy, but the wait staff seem to always make up for it.  The salsa is delicious, not too spicy, and extremely flavorful.  I've never had a complaint about their food and the drinks are on-point.  The outdoor patio is also dog friendly, which is really awesome.  And there are huge Jenga pieces and a bag toss game which is popular with the kids I've seen there.  I honestly don't know why this place only has three stars...give them a try.
