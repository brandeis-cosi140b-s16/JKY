Great food, great view, great atmosphere. The service was the best. Our waiter was fantastic. His name was Jorge or something. (Serious resting face, great smile, pitch black hair) Food came out fast even though it was so busy. Been there 2 other times. Nothing to complain about... Except parking... Small parking lot sucks.
