Oh, Popo's....  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways!  having lived in the area for more than 20 years, Popo's has been and likely will always be the best mexican food around.  We worried heavily when they opened their new location at 59th and Bell because it can often signal the beginning of the end (such was the case with Garcia's).  

Popo's is a family restaraunt.  A bit rough on the edges with the decor but the food and service are far more worthy of a visit than any decor.  I often look intently at the menu hoping that I would find something that could sway me from my usual choice but I somehow always seem to default to the Chimi dinner.  Sure I would love to try other items but I feel as though I would miss the chimi just a little more.  So, for me it's the chimi dinner with machaca, red sauce, guacamole, and their delicious jalapeno cream cheese.  The machaca (shredded beef) is absolutely amazing and if I could make it myself I would never have to venture out again.  Add to that their salsa (which has the right amount of saltyness and that addictive red hot sauce and you will be set for an incredibly filling and delicious meal.  

The service is exceptional.  Like family really.  The beer is cold and the drink specials are always fun.  We have always had a great time and look forward to each visit.  We have tried many other Mexican places over the years but this place takes the blue ribbon.

Incidentally, we have a home in Texas as well and our Mexican food experiences there have been less than spectacular.  The TexMex - Fresh Mex idea is a completely different type of dining and it lacks the depth of flavor and preparation that Popo's is expert at.  

For a south of the border treat, check it out and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!
