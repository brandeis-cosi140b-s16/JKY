Went on 10-16-12. My wife and I had seen it on "Triple D." It was fabulous. The host was very attentive, made it clear it was happy hour and the cook came out to see if we were happy with our food. This place is awesome! You really have to look for the store front as it is in a strip mall across from UNLV. We definitely recommend!
