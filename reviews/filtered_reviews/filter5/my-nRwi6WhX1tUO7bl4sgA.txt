I was so impressed by this restaurant! The whole package. The food, the Staff, and the atmosphere. 

I went here on my birthday with 3 other people. We all got different dishes(Tortilla soup, Enchiladas, Tacos, Chimichangas). We were all able to taste all the different dishes and everything was perfect! It tasted home cooked, not frozen. Absolutely delicious!

For dessert we got the Fried Ice Cream, and the Sopapillas. OMG. I was in absolute heaven.

I definitely recommend you give that charming little place a try, you won't be sorry.  Come hungry!
