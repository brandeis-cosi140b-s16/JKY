This is my new favorite place for fish tacos. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch and each ordered one fish and one shrimp taco. When you get them, they are plain - just the fish or shrimp. But then you head over to the salsa bar and add the topping that you want. 

I added the slaw to both and got a few sauces to try on the side - avocado, chipotle and cilantro. They also have different salsas, ranch, tartar sauce hot sauce, limes, and more so you can really customize your tacos.

The slaw was fresh and crispy. All the sauces I tried were good but my favorite sauce was the cilantro. It was creamy and not overpowering.

The tacos are pretty big, bigger than street tacos. Two were enough for me, boyfriend did go back for a third.

Both the shrimp and the fish were really good and I love that you can add the toppings that you want. I will definitely be back!
