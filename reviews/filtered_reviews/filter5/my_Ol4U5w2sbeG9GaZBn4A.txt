Don't come here looking for a gourmet experience. It's not fast food either, it's very affordable dine-in fusion food. They close early and it's out of the way in North Vegas.

If you're looking for delicious food though, please make a stop here. Lunch is the perfect time to go. We stopped by on a weekday and it was empty. It's located in a strip mall and can be easy to miss.

But the food is just straight up delicious! Bulgogi tacos with all kinds of hot sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly, piled with onions and cilantro, and topped with a selection of hot sauces. It was one of the best tacos I've had in a long long time.

Service is excellent. The hostess/waitress is very friendly and not intruding at all when you're trying to enjoy your food. It looks like a family owned business. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again.
