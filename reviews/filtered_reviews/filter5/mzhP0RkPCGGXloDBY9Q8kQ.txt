I really, really love this Popo's. I have never had a bad experience here, and everyone I have brought here has loved it. They have THE BEST salsa I have ever had. Loved it so much we bought a quart of it! Their lemonade is also very good. The food is definitely above average. I would recommend this place to everyone!
