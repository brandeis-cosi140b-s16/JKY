So I've been eating more veggie lately (although nowhere near entirely), and the one major carnivorous mainstay of my diet lately has been tacos. To the point where I've started calling myself a "tacotarian." (And yes, I know they make fish tacos, I just don't care.)

So on my latest trip to Tacos El Gordo, I decided to branch out and try their vegetarian option - to see if I could keep visiting my favorite Vegas taco joint even in the absence of meat.

The taco azteca (nopales asado) is strips of grilled cactus served on your choice of corn or flour tortilla with salsa and guacamole. The cactus really had a nice snap when you bite into it and a bit of a peppery flavor. A lot of times with vegetarian options for Mexican it feels like you're "missing" something. A vegetarian burrito from Chipotle feels like a magic trick sometimes. And not in a good way.

But this was legit. If I ever pull the trigger and go full-on vegetarian, this will be a staple of my diet.

(The adobada is still amazing too.)
