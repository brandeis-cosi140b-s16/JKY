Very happy with the quality of the food and service!  I like their chips, salsa and guacamole! I even crave their guacamole from Where I Live (LA) so I always made a stop here while i'm in Vegas. I came in, dine in, twice in this restaurant and very happy with their food, coctails, margarita and service. Our other favorite dish is their first of the day catch fish. Always delicious, never dissapointed. Consistence and friendly people. Definitely will make this my regular place.
