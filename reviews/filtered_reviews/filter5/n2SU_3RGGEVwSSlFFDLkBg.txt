The quality of their food is fantastic.  I tried the mole poblano chicken which was sweet and spicy, with chocolate and green mole spices topped with sesame seeds.  They serve their homemade warm tortillas which are awesome.  I love their complimentary bean dip and salsa - it's so good you could make a meal of that.  Everyone in my group loved their food.
