Amazing New Mexican Restaurant!

I hadn't heard about Maize, just saw it pop up on First and Green where during my 4 years here on campus I've seen many establishments come and simply disappear. Me and my roommate (all mexican) went to try it highly suspicious that any place around here could actually offer authentic mexican cuisine. Boy were we wrong. This place is great! It does everything right, taco, quesadillas, huaraches, and even tortas. It's the level of authenticity you might expect from a place like Nuevo Leon. I wish they just had more seating and were able to offer a dinner type atmosphere and menu. Great lunch and cheap dinner food. They are missing a lot of dinner items such as  enchiladas, mole, or pozole. However, everything they do do, they do it right. Their salsas are great, their tortillas delicious. Everything has the perfect amount of grease. Seasoning could be better, but it's better that they under salt than over salt. . Definitely try this place out!
