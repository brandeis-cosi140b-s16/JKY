Lick-the-plate delicious!!!   

We've been going once a week since we found this place a month or so ago....it's fabulous.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, the wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing.  

I had the Pollo a la Chipotle a couple weeks ago, and seriously considered licking the plate to get every last drop of sauce.  Last night I had the Camarones Rancheros, and again could not get enough of the fabulous sauce.  The meat in all the dishes is cooked perfectly, the chips and tortillas are freshly made, and the salsa is yummy!

We generally try whatever margarita they have on special, and so far I have not been disappointed....blood orange, purple cadillac, wild berry...YUM!

We'll definitely be continuing our weekly visits, and can't wait to share it with family when they come for a visit.
