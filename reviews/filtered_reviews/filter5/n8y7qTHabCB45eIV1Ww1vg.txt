Definitely a Vegas favorite. The family that owns the business is INCREDIBLY kind and the food is delicious. I'm personally not a huge fan of big filling meals but I will totally splurge when I go to FB. My favorite so far is the guacamole burger with skinny fries. The also have $5.99 medium pizza with one topping, which is also very good and cheap. My boyfriend likes the wet boyrito with the red sauce the best! Five stars for being a really great, family owned hole in the wall. No complaints at all, by far.
