I am obsessed with Brushfire, my husband says I might turn into it lol, I highly recommend papas bravas with the spicy mayo! Yum!!! I actual buy the spicy mayo for my eggs at breakfast at home its great!  I haven't had anything here that I didn't like!  But let me tell you why I really come back, the people who work here are AWESOME, I am sorry I don't know everyone by name but everyone is always so nice to chat with, tonight Ricardo was working in the window he is always so customer service focused, Brushfire is so lucky to have the great employees they do!! Thanks for the fantastic service!!
