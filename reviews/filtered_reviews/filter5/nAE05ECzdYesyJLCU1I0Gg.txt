So some friends and I came here based on the great reviews...and WOW absolutely amazing! This place is a real hidden gem. It doesnt look like much but once you taste the food...Boom! Everything we ordered was so fresh and flavorful! My husband and I had the Aguas Chile, Camarones Tecolote, a carne asada plate, a taco on the side, 2 sangrias, and a michelada called Buen Dia. Of course this food defeated us and we barely made a dent! Our bill was $70 not bad at all for mariscos. Give this place a try you will not be disappointed
