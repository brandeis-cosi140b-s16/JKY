So lets start at the beginning.  Nestled on the corner of 7th St & Osborn is an old church building that now houses Taco Guild.  The decor and architecture is an amazing mix of new and old so you get an ethereal feeling from the minute you walk in.  Then comes the whole tequila and beer experience!  Nothing like sharing a shot of tequila and a cold beer on a Thursday night (their happy hour lasts till 7 PM) and feasting on a duo of queso and fresh guacomole infused with jalapenos and bacon.  I honestly didn't know if I would have any room left for dinner, but where there's an amazing taco, there's a way.  The tacos are divided in two groups, Old World and New World, which basically means old-traditional, new-mind blowing.  I had two off the New side, the Yucatan Shrimp (a favorite of the entire table) and my favorite, the lamb with Creole aioli, bleu cheese and sweet potato hay.  I can not wait to take my next group of out of town visitors to this amazing little place and I will ask for Joshua again.  He was knowledgeable, helpful, funny and a great waiter.  

PS:  They do not take reservations, however you can call and get put on a wait list.  Its worth it.
