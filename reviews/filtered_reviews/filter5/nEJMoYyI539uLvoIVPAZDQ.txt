my all time favorite taco place.. everrr

lengua lengua lengua

my first experience with los tacos was at my friend's graduation.. you can hire them to bring out a cart and grill and they make tacos for everyone!!!

my favorite if you haven't noticed already is the lengua taco with everything.. you gotta make sure you add everything.. (its worth the extra 1.50)

el pastor seems to be a general favorite among my friends as  well but i haven't had a chance to try it yet

the tacos are big.. i actually get full off of 1.. but i've seen people eat 2-3.. maybe 1.5 would be the perfect amount so maybe you can find a buddy and share a third one..

their fruit drinks are delicious.. all of the flavors
strawberry, watermelon, pineapple, horchata.. mmm..
usually i order water when i eat but here i always buy a fruit drink.
