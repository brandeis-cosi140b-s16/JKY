I had the street tacos and my husband had the burrito. Both were delicious and so filling! We were both very happy that the tortillas didn't break, despite the enormous amount of filling they had. The order set-up is like a Chipotle, but the food tastes OH SO MUCH BETTER. Also, the beans are vegetarian, which is a big plus for us. Decor is centered around the Mexican wrestler theme; kitschy and fun. Will definitely be returning!
