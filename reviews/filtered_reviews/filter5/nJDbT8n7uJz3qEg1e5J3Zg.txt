Definitely feel the need to step in and share my experience of this place, because by the looks of it no one who enjoyed themselves wanted to hop on yelp and do so. 

I come here all the time, usually for the fun/drinking/laidback//beach atmosphere and regularly have a great time. Everyday they have $3,$4,$5 drink specials (& $2 drinks on Tuesdays) so its easy to have a few drinks without dropping a ton of cash. 
Consistently super strong yummy margaritas. Which is definitely one of my favorite things about this place. 
I would give service AT LEAST a 90%. On the rare occasion that service here has had a few bumps my server has always made sure we are perfectly content waiting an extra couple minutes for whatever is backed up.  

I just don't get how there are so many bad reviews but is consistently packed?
