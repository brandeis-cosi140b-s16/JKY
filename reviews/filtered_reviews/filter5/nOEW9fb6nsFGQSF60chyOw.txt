As a California native saying I was excited to find not just one but at least THREE Wahoo's in Las Vegas is an understatement. My girlfriend and I would frequent the location near the 215 and Rainbow off Sunset quite often on our lunch breaks. The staff was great and knew us by name, but it never really felt like a Wahoo's like back home. There were no windows :(

By luck we found this Wahoo's while on a work errand one day. WHAT. A. TREAT. We happened to sit down at the outside bar at just the right time of day and just the right time of the year. The breeze blowing on our backs kept us cool as the sun beat down from the sky. The tasty ice cold draft Pacifico ran down my throat and at the exact time we silently soaked in the glory, turned to look at each other and realized we had found it. It felt JUST like we were sitting on the Southern California Coast. It feels JUST like home. There is a open patio with couches and a fire pit next to the indoor/outdoor bar, and the corner location is perfect boasting floor to ceiling windowed walls. It's nice and open.

I've always been a huge fan of the Baja-ladas. Flour tortillas filled with chicken, tomatoes, spinach, and cream cheese. Pair that with a frosty draft beer and you are set.

This Wahoo's has a "house special" green sauce. They mix some spicy chili powder goodness into the already great green sauce. BOMB DOT COM.

The location of this Wahoo's is to-die-for. It's located right smack dab in the middle of Boca Park surrounded by great shops and minutes from Red Rock Casino.

I can't deny that I am SUPER stoked to be moving into my new apartment right around the corner from here very soon!!
