Tacos and Margaritas Ayyye!!!

Love coming here, best tasting Margaritas on the strip! Wide variety of flavors try the Chupacabra Rita's! The patio is perfect to chill. Best happy hour specials. Be aware this place is always busy but worth the wait.

Make sure you check in to get buy one get one free drinks. The guacamole was fresh and yummy. Tacos are bomb. Came here twice this time always have to stop by when I'm in Vegas, I highly recommend this place.
