First time here this evening. I was with my 16 year old son, and we were both hungry. I read the reviews here on Yelp..I made a u- tur, parked the car..and came in. So glad we did. We ordered a bowl with brown rice and kalua pig..amazing. Everything is so fresh and tasty. They have these sauces that you can put on your food that is like a hot sauce, but better. There is Kiwi, Lime and Jalapeño, Raspberry, Agave, and Jalapeño, and Mango, Pineapple and Habanero (has a delayed kick). My son a I both liked the Mango the best. If near UNLV, stop by. You will be in for quite a treat. PS. Show your Rebel Card for a free drink.
