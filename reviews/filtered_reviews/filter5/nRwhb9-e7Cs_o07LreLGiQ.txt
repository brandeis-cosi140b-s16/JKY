Chino Bandido is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food is as bizarre as it is delicious.  And, they'll let you try before you buy!

Half the time, the place is packed, but don't fear the long line or the daunting task of filling out your order.  You'll be at the counter quickly, and if you have no idea what to do with that piece of paper, just take it up there blank.  They'll figure it out for you.

Great place.
