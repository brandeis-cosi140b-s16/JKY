Came to this place w my fam bam n the service was top notch, I myself em a bartender so when I'm out the service I receive I I really pay attention and lemme just say our waitress was on top of it she didn't bug too much where I cudnt enjoy my food n when asked for something we got it in 2.5 seconds never had to remind her for anything literally Christina our waitress was amazing best service I've had in a long time!
