I had the Chili Colorado and wow it was great!  I eat a lot of tex-mex so I wanted something different.  Beef in a stew with jalape√±os, beans and rice. It came with flour tortillas.  Very tasty.  The beef was very tender and perfect.  Their beans and rice have a lot of flavor too.

The service is always very attentive and liberal with the free warm chips, salsa & warm bean dip... mmm.

The ambiance is typical tex-mex with Spanish themed items on the walls and bright colors.  This location is a bit cozy, but it has a nice feel.  I came in with a party of 10 and they were able to seat us quickly, our food came out quicker than expected and everyone enjoyed their meal.

Plus they recently updated their menu to include pictures of ALL entries. Not everyone's thing but I appreciate it and so will your family.

Grab a couple chocolate-mint candies as you leave.
