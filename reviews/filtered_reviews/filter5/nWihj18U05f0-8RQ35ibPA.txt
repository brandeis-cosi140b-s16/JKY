Try the Michelada which is the Mexican version of a Bloody Mary. It is good if you're ok with Clamato juice. It's so refreshing on a hot summer day. The chips and bean dip are great. I don't eat a  lot so I think it's great that you can order Tequizas (not the cheesy beer, it's their Mexican street tacos). Reminds me of the tacos I could get when I hopped over to Tijuana when I Iived in SD. They're only about 1.75 each. 3 is enough for me. The carnitas & rib eye tacos are the best. I had the grilled fish tacos but I wasn't a big fan - I didn't like the sauce they put on top of it. 

Don't forget to check in onYelp! You ge a free fried ice cream which is delicious! I'm so glad there is a decent authenic Mexican restaurant in Centennial Hills. I think this is the best Mexican restaurant I've tried in Las Vegas.
