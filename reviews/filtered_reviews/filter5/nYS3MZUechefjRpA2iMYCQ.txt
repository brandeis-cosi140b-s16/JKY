I love Manuel's!! My family and I have been coming here for years. I've now turned my boyfriend onto them too! We always go on a Monday or Tuesday when they have the beef taco and cheese enchilada on special for $6.99 and the house margaritas are only $4.00. The food is consistently good and so is the service.
