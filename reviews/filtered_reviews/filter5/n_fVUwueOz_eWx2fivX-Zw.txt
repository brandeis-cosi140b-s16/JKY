We've been laughing at the name of this restaurant for about 3 years just driving by, and finally decided to go there to try something new expecting another sports bar. It was great! They have a complete menu for vegans & vegetarians - including mango tacos, fajita tofu salad (quite spicy, but the sauteed tofu spiced and prepared perfect) the vegan nacho has a vegan patty crumbles over it. Really great stuff. My husband had some chicken tacos, that he liked. Kids meal has lots of options too - both Mexican and American cuisine choices (only 4.99 & includes a drink). And then of course all the nachos - they have nacho combinations with inspirations from other cuisines, quite interesting and a lot of them sound amazing. The only minus for me - no wine list. Beer list is definitely making up for it though with some great Belgian beer and smaller American microbreweries, they also offer draft beer mixes (!) Really interesting...  Some items are definitely pricier than expected, like the fried ice cream dessert - 7.95 I believe, but it is big - more than enough to share for 3-4 people and its basically deep fried vanilla ice cream with raspberry and chocolate chips and lots of whipped cream. The service was absolutely great, waitress was exceptionally knowledgeable of the extensive menu, and courses came in very timely fashion. Overall highly recommended if your looking for some contemporary quality Mexican food.
