Here's the deal:

Downtown Phoenix needed a place like this. You'd think tacos and margs in downtown phoenix would be a dime a dozen - but its far from it. 

The $3 Paz Margs are so damn good.  I've paid 3x that much at other places and had a subpar drink. Seriously - get the damn margarita.

The Guacamole is divine. It's creamy and a nice serving - but best of all I can really taste the lime which totally made it for me. 

All Tacos are extremely delicious. I got 3 of them and was completely full so don't let the small size put you off. They are worth it. 

This is the perfect place to hang out on sunny day, with friends and dogs alike, and enjoy yourself. Salud!
