I was here for a happy hour event and especially liked the tacos and the friendly service.  Have you ever had duck tacos?  Neither had I until I tried them at EH.  Very tasty and a nice change from the usual taco choices.  The nachos were great as well and the three dollar Dos Equis' on tap was the perfect libation.
