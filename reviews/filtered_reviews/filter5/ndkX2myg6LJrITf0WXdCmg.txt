So I FINALLY had a chance to stop at Taco Guild today and my oh my, was I blown away.
The inside of the church is revamp porn. Glam/Midevil/Missionary/Catholic/Vintage and Goth rolled into one amazing place to enjoy a meal. 
The salsa was delicious. The tacos were amazing! I was incredibly thrilled to see they used home made tortillas in their tacos. Great happy hour menu! Friendly staff and QUICK serving times. Quality ingredients and unique flavorings. I have a new favorite spot to add to my regular outings list. I am thrilled to have Taco Guild in Phoenix. The music is pretty random as well, but I liked it. As I told my friends, Taco Guild is basically church, tacos and Drake all at once. Enjoy lovelies! Five stars!
