Oh yes i LOVE this place!! 
It's been about five years since I stepped foot in this spot but we are gambling at Hard Rock and we've earned a comp and we are HONGRAY! Friend has never been to Pink Taco so OBVI we HAVE to go here! Chicken Tostada Salad is on my mind! We order. Of course I get the salad and I believe he ordered the PINK TACOS and we also got some chips and salsa and guacamole! 
The guacamole and the salsa were SO ON POINT!! I LOOOOVED the salsa! I could have drank it! 
Of course my tostada salad was just as amazing as I remember it from years ago and his pink tacos were AIIGHT. 
Friend did enjoy the place though and agreed that it was DELICIOUS! Especially the tostada salad!! NOM FREAKIN' NOM!!
