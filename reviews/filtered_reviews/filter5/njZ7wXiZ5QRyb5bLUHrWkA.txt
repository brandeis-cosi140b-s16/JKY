This is the most amazing Mexican food restaurant I have ever, ever eaten at... Their food is incredible... I left Las Vegas 3 years ago and moved to LA and have eaten at 50 plus Mexican restaurants including the Velvet Taco and other such trendy places in Hollywood... Nothing beats this place... I am going to Vegas for a meeting... I am eating here...

I lived down the street.. I ate here 3 to 4 times a week... Try the Steak Cognac... I wish they were in LA... They would KILL...
