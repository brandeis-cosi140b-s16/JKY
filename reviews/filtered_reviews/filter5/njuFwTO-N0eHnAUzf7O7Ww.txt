We eat here once a week.  Love it, we eat late and at 8pm they are not too busy but the staff is still attentive.  I always get the Macha and if you haven't had it, OMG is it good.  They stuff it inside a chimi and smother in cheese and sour cream.  how do you not love that.  plus they have veggies if your not in favor of the beans.  Huge portion, always have left overs and reheats well. My hubby gets the massive portions of fajitas and they are always hot! 
The chips are so good and the salsa comes in a large bowl not a little dish.  Great service to.
