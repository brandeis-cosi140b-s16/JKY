Service with a smile. From LA visiting a friend for the Phoenix symphony and looking to grab food to go and to lay pool side. The atmosphere is great for brunch, lunch and possibly dinner. The menu is contemporary Mexican, however the taste is authentic Mexican. 

I got the grilled chicken burrito with extra guacamole. Great place to try out.
