If you're a native you'll enjoy this Mexican restaurant hotspot. If you are from out of town you might not get it.  For some reason in Arizona, these less aestheticly pleasing restaurants serve great Mexican food.

I get the same thing every time and it never gets old... chimi machaca...dam it's good!
