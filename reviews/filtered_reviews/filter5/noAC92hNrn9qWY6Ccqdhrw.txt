Heard nothing but great things about this place, so was very excited to try it. Dined here about a month ago and it could not have been a better experience. Such a strange location on washington and decatur and parking lot is small but totally worth the drive. From the moment my brother and i walked in the service could not have been better. 

Had the calypso lemonade to drink and my brother had a mexican coke. I love, love, love lemonade and let me tell you this one ranks up their. A little sweeter than i prefer but still delicious. Mexican coke = always a winner.

Bulgogi fries = holy moly my friend these things are amazing, i love french fries and adding bulgogi and cheese and salsa and lots of onions, won me over real quick

Pork belly tacos, perfect amount of different flavors and the tortillas are grade A

Carne asada tacos, meat was perfectly flavored and cooked

Not that i mind spending $ on great food and great service but this is place is so cheap its crazy that they make $...g2 respect great service, i tipped 100% of the bill and when the server took the bill at the end of the meal and looked at the bill in the side station, she yelled "thank you derek", she then came over and we chatted a bit. 

Forget the servers name but wonderful woman, so friendly and genuine. Couldn't ask for someone better.

Even if your on the strip, it is worth the drive, trust me. This location is a little better on service than the new one but food is equally great at both.
