The best Mexican food in AZ! You walk in and the place just smells sooo good, it's always busy, from open to close for a good reason so be prepared to wait anywhere from 5-30 minutes but trust me you won't be disappointed! The employees are so kind and helpful, you never have to look around for them because they are are always there when you need them. The food tastes great and are very large portions, expect to bring some home in a to-go box. I know the parking lot is small and that can be a little of a downer but I would park across the street and walk over if I had to, just to get a table :)
