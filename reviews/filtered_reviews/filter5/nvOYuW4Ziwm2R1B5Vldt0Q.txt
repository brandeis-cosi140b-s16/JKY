Came here for lunch. I was skeptical of the Border Brunch because it is all you can eat, and I didn't want to eat all I can eat. However, the plates are small tapas style. It's easier to manage the gluttony. Everything is great. We had the breakfast fries, the esquite lettuce wraps, spicy chicken tamales, Peruvian shrimp and grits, steak and egg, huevos rancheros, Spanish omelette and the Chile relleno. It was all great.
