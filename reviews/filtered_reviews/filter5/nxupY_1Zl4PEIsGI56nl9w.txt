Saw a re-run of ddd  which featured CB. I have been her many time before but not quite awhile. Decided to make a busy. I was not disappointed. Had a combo. Was a delicious as ever. Did was pipping hit and service was excellent. Even say the owner and she was kind and made sure that the order was correct. Glad to see she is still there making she the place is up to her standards.  

The food really hit the spot. Was exactly like I remember. Maybe even a bit better that in the past.
