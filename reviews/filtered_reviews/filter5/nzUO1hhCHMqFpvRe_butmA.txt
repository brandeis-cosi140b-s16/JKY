What can I say? Los Dos, Mesa, is like a second home to us. We have been to all locations except NYC, and we like the Mesa location best of those in Arizona.

We absolutely love the salsa--both red and green--and sometimes get seconds on both among three people.

Our favorites are the No. 4 (green tamale, taco, beans and rice) and the garlic pork plate, although we sometimes order other items on the menu. 

The manager, John, and staff are wonderful and always have a minute to "catch up" with us and make us smile. We go there at least once a week.

The music selection is great--most tunes are Puerto Rican salsa and merengue, sometimes with a few other surprises thrown in. 

I recommend it most highly for anyone wanting the Real Deal in New Mexico-style cooking and, of course, to all those who like it HOT!
