I think out of all the places I ate at this weekend; this one was my favorite! The margaritas were great and our food came out fast yet hot! I had the chicken enchiladas and my boy friend had the chicken green burrito. Both were great! We also tried their pi√±a colada and that was beyond amazing ! Great place to visit! The waiters were so friendly and nice; I will be coming back!
