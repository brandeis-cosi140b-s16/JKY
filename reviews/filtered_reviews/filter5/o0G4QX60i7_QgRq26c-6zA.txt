Perhaps one of my favorite brunch spots on the planet. The place is small weith only 4 tables and a bar. It is also dark and can get pretty loud, but "sitting by all your friends" loud not "talking in a movie" loud. 

They cook over an open flame wood fired grill right in front of the bar. The interior is copper and dark wood which exudes a warm comfortable feeling. The service is always awesome and they remember the regulars and treat you like family. They also have a private dining room that you can reserve for parties. There is a loft in the room which is pretty cool if you're dumb enough to climb up there when you're drunk (wasn't me).

Now for the food (insert drum roll) the finest New Mexican Cuisine in the valley. Things you must try before you die:

Shrimp quesadilla served with roasted red peeper dipping sauce, carne adovada, try not to orgasm while shoveling it in to your mouth. The chili relleno (choice of turkey, pork or beef).. Everything comes slathered in red or green sauce that makes you want to cry while eating for fear of being done. And get the posole sometime, you'll never love another. This is just for brunch, their dinner menu includes fresh fish, grilled steak and on and on and on... I'm getting hungry just thinking of it.
