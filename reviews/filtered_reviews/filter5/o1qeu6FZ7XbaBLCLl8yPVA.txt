We gave it a 9, so we will make that 5-, 4,5 stars. 
   To start with it's just beautiful and we lucked out to be outside, under the heater next to the roaring fireplace. The service could not have been better and thanks to our YELPing friends, we hardly needed a menu. 
  The Portugese clam soup was "souper" though on the salty side. The pork belly was "off the hook" and the steak tacos were tops too! We gave the dishes, 9, 9.5 and 9.5 respectivley.
  Margaritas were awesome, Smokehouse and Pomogranite but it was a short glass.    
  It's been a long time since we had a solid 9. Thanks guys! Oh and the table guac is a must. PS if you get he bread pudding, get the sauce on the side. It's over the top sweet. My pancreas is running laps right now!
