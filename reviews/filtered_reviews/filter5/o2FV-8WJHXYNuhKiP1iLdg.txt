My husband comes from LA and is Hispanic, so when it comes to Mexican food, he can be picky. This restaurant passed with flying colors! Like other reviewers have noted, the chips and salsa were fantastic. The fideo soup that came with our meals was also a favorite. My husband said it reminded him of soup his mother made on cold days at home. Our entrees were plentiful and tasty and we appreciated the sweet treat at the end.

Apart from the delicious food, I think what made this place awesome was the service. It was the fastest I've ever had, super friendly, and on point. My husband even did a small test by downing is soda right after it was refilled. Within 10 seconds someone had come to refill it. Everyone who passed by were helping with refills, whether it be drinks or chips and salsa, little waiter things, and even the bill. Instead of one waiter we had a village and it made a pleasant experience. Thanks Viva Mexicana!!
