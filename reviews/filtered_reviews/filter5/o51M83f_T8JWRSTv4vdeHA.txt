5 stars for the Taco Stand & 5 stars for the market!

The Taco Stand
+ Top notch service and super fast.
+ I love the toppings bar--it moves the line faster and it gives me the chance to just try out a new salsa by putting it on the side.
+ The price.  $2 a taco is unbelievable.
+ They are open in the winter.  I've been here on some brutally cold days and they are still open.  Love it.
- There's nowhere to sit, and these are not tacos that you are easy to eat standing up.  I'd love it if they put on a couple folding chairs even.


The Market
+ Fabulous prices.  Ex: I found a pico de gallo that I enjoy for 60% less than the big chain grocery store.
+ The fresh tortillas.
- The corn tortillas only came in tiny sizes.  I was hoping to find something big enough for a proper quesodilla.
+ Nice cashiers.
