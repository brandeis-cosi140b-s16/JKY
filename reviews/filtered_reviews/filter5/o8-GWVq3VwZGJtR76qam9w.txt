I've been back three or four times since my first review of Joyride. I'd like to say it is just as good each time . . . but you know, I think it gets better and better! Oh, the blood orange margarita and guacamole lived up to their usual reputations, but I swear every entree I try is better than the last one I had. Today it was crispie fish tacos (2) & a vegetable taco, with a side of orange cucumber salad. OMGoodness it was so good. Service was even better than usual (and it is always good!)! Christian, supurb bartender, waited on us.  Thanks, Christian, for making our Sunday lunch so enjoyable!
