Not a lot of choices in Anthem but this place is definitely a go to for us. Never had anything we don't like. They have some outdoor seating which is nice when it isn't 120 out. I love the enchiladas and my hubby likes the burritos and fish tacos. The only bad thing is they are closed Sundays and other random times for family events. Which is fine but disappointing when u had a craving then had to go eat at some other not as good places in Anthem. Oh and the bean and cheese burritos are a hit w my dd!
