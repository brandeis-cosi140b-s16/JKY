I cannot say enough wonderful things about Otro Cafe from the FABulous staff, BEYOND delicious food, moderate price for GREAT food, etc., etc.  I usually eat at the bar so I can visit with the staff, and they all are such a friendly and caring TEAM!!!  I am truly addicted to the restaurant, their staff and food.  If you haven't tried them, you must!!!!!!
