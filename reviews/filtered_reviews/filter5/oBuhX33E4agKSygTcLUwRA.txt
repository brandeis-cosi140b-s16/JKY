Best tacos I've ever had. Ate the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco (pork shoulder taco) as well as the Baja Surf Dogfish Shark Taco. The pork shoulder was my favorite because of how well the marinations blended with the pork as well as the small hint of cinnamon... Fucked up good! Both tacos came with a plate of rice and beans.  As mentioned before the pork shoulder taco has cinnamon in it which my girlfriend is allergic to so she switched if for the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The carne asada was well done and you could taste the mesquite charcoal it was made on. The salsa bar is another reason why this restaurant is good, due to  how diverse it was. There were so many salsas that we couldn't test them all before the chips ran out; can't remember the names of all of them, but the peanut salsa was awesome.
