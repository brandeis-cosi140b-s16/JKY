First time at this Chipotle. After reading so many Yelp reviews about the long line, I decided to order ahead online. Thank you Yelpers, great advice. 

Parking was tricky. Had to park at the bank but not a long walk. As I walked in, I bumped into the back of the line. There were seriously about 30-35 in line. I was afraid, after reading a couple of reviews, that my order wouldn't be ready but, lo, there it was, all bagged up. 
I ordered a barbacoa bowl with guacamole and extra cheese. My coworker had ordered a chicken bowl and a side of chips. It worked to about $9 each. Sounds steep but the portions are big. Really big. 
My bowl was full of meat, guacamole and cheese even though I asked for no lettuce. The meat was hot, juicy, seasoned well and held good flavor. 

I recommend this location to anyone BUT, order ahead. They opened at 11, I got there at 11:15 and it was packed!
