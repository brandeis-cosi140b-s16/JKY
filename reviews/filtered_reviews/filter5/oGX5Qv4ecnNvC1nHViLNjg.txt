Came here for dinner with my wife on our way to a 4th of July party. The entrance is kind of hard to find from the parking lot. But then again, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer. This place is much bigger than the one in Gilbert and from the looks of it much hipper too. The place has somewhat of a 70's discotheque feel to it but without the stale cigarette/alcohol smell. My wife had a strawberry agua fresca which was awesome. They bring chips and a roasted salsa to the table which is awesome. I ordered the chicken fila salad which was amazing. It's kale with jicama and crunchy green beans. Sounds weird but just do it and you won't be disappointed. My wife had the chicken tinga that was very good as well. Make sure you ask them for the green salsa. It really makes your plate. They have a patio outside that looks like it'd be awesome to sit in when the weather is nice. At the end of the day, the service was great which always goes a long way for me.
