We decided to try here after we couldn't get into several places because of the holiday.  It was still only 5PM and it was getting busy when we got there.  We had a few minutes to wait.   Just after being seated, the restaurant started to fill to capacity.  As busy as they were, there were employees doing nothing but serving chips and salsa, refilling drinks.  YES, they do give refills on drinks contrary to what another reviewer said.  They were constantly bringing more chips and salsa if you wanted it.  free   Service was wonderful, very attentive.  Servings were huge, hot, and fresh.  Tables were being cleaned as soon as guests left with clean towels each time, not the rags used over and over like most places do.  Chairs were being wiped down, also.  The manager was very visible in the dining room, helping servers and checking guests.  There was a mariachi band tonight going from table to table.
The tables and chairs and custom made and so pretty.  The decor is very nice.  The only complaint I have is how cold it was. 
I had the whole deep fried talapia.  delicious.  My husband had the huge bacon wrapped shrimp.  Four of us and none of us were able to finish.   We can't wait to go back to try something else!
