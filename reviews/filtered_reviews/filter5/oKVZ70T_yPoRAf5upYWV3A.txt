I went with a friend because I was really craving tacos and margaritas. I think we went on a Saturday night around 10pm. There was no wait. 

The tacos were really good. The margarita with the 7oz corona with it was amazing! I seriously couldn't love the taste of it more! I definitely want to come back here again. The staff was also friendly.
