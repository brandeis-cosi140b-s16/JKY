The food was amazing and the service was great. I had the lobster and shrimp tacos and the grilled sweet corn with the strawberry, Serrano guacamole. They have an impressive selection of tequila and great variety of margaritas. The only thing I will say is that the food did take some time to get to us ( like 35 minutes) but if you've ever gone to brand new restaurants, teamwork and timing is shortly acquired after opening week. I highly recommend this this place if you want good baja Mexican food and great service.
