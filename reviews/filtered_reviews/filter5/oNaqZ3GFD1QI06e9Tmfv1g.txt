This is a small place that I am surprised was not packed.  The servers were very friendly and offered samples of all of the different types of meat in little serving cups to help me decide.
The green chile beef was my favorite!  I got the taco salad with green chile beef but it is really closer to a "burrito bowl" like you would get a Chipotle but served in a fried flour tortilla.  Toppings were good and fresh and the decor is hilarious.  Very reasonable prices for the massive serving size!
