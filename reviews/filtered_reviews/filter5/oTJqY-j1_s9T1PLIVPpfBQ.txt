I don't go to Mesa often, but when I do...it's for this place right here!

I had a difficult time finding delicious Mexican food that served Lengua tacos and this place does it justice...and they got the salsa bar too with the spicy carrots.  It's a hole in the wall and that's what I love about this authentic place.
