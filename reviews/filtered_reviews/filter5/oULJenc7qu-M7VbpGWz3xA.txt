Wow - a hidden jewel in phx. A great mix of food, atmosphere and reasonable prices.  We found through yelp and needed Waze to navigate the 30 minute drive from Scottsdale.  Was well worth the trip.

Ladies behind the counter gave us samples of the meats in little containers - luv the carnes cita. I had the 5 small tacos (7.50) and my wife had the fish tacos for $8.99. With the tacos you can have a variety of meats if you like. They then top with cilantro, onions, cabbage, tomato, roasted corn and sour cream.  Two thumbs up. 

The only disappointment was RC Cola in the  fountain dispenser but they had a great selection of Mexican bottled drinks. Something for everyone. 

Well worth the trip and will come back on our next trip to phx. Thank you yelp community for highlighting this restaurant.

Also if you grab a copy of the local Sunnyslope Plus magazine/free paper they have a $1 off $5.00 or $2 off $10.00 order (June 2015).
