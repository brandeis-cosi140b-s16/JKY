Been here several times, tried the carne Asada fries, Mexican street corn, pastor tacos and frescas.  Everything I've had here has been so good! I like the food here when I'm craving Mexican food and don't want anything to heavy or greasy.  I've ordered carne Asada fries at Robertos and other fast food restaurants in California which I love but I've always felt guilty and sad afterwards.  The Asada fries here (or pastor or shrimp or whatever meat you would like) are good but don't make you feel all crappy after finishing them.  The corn is great too!  I get usually get the Agua fresca with spinach and pineapple or strawberry with my meal which is super light and refreshing.  *lots of frescas to try, don't miss these!
