I love this place. Food is yummy. I always order the shrimp tacos. I've never tried a fish or shrimp taco before because it did not sound appealing but they are very good here. I also love this place because they have the very spicy habanero salsa. If I am ever craving spicy food, this is the Mexican restaurant I go to. And you can't beat the view of the city.
