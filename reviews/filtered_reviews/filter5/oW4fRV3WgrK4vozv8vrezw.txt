Had dinner and drinks here on Friday night while visiting Phoenix for the weekend. Our server was great at recommending an easy tequila shot. The tacos we had (grilled mahi mahi and shrimp versions) were delicious - along with our appetizer of guacamole! We also had to drink: Paloma and Blueberry Smash. Can say that every one of our items was awesome!
