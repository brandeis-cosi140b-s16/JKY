The carnitas are the best I have ever had.  This is some seriously tender and perfectly slow cooked pork.  It was crispy in some parts, soft in others and downright flavorful all around!  My only question is why can't any of the Mexican restaurants in the Chicago area make food half as tasty as these guys?  I can't drive out to Urbana every weekend...
