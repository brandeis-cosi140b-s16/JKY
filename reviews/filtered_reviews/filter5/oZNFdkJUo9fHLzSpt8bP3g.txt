What to choose, what to choose. Such difficult decisions! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Dispite the fact that I'm a libra, I'm very decisive. Friends usually look to me to make all sorts of decisions ::diabolical laugh:: Still, this place consistently stumps me.

Is it Tuesday? If yes, then I'm definately getting the Pork Belly Tacos.

Otherwise, I'll start with an order of Ceviche and Asado Salad.

To drink I'll have Agua Fresca de Sabor.

Yes, I'm going to have an entre too, I mean I've already broken my diet, might as well :D

I'll have the Huevos Rancheros or 3 Carne Asada Tacos or the Verduras de Temporada or the Chilaquiles Verdes or the Carne Asada Torta. OMG, so many great options! Seriously, this normally isn't a problem. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to try everything.

Next up, a euphoric food coma! Life is good.
