Love this place! I'm half Korean and I'll admit that I thought fusing Mexican and Korean food was a little weird but I was proven wrong at this place. The chicken fusion nachos were amazing, prefect amount of flavor, toppings and nachos! I also got the kimchi fried rice and it was just like bibimbap and they used sour kimchi, so someone knew what they were doing. And the service was great, the waitress was very nice. Overall, very happy, will be back very soon :)
