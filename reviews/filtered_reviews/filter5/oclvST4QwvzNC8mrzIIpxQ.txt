You have NEVER tried mexican food till you've had it here (and I've been to mexico several times)....and if your gonna come and order tacos - then just go to taco bell!

The menu is extensive, I've tried EVERYTHING from tongue to intestines and I am SOOO not "that" kind of eater!  Delish each and every time! The wait staff is helpful and some of them have been there for years (speaks heavily on the quality of management...they must be as good to their workers as they are to their customers). 

You will not be disappointed....if you go for breakfast, you have to try the Machaca Chiliquilies......unforgettable!
