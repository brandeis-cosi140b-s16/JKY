Baja easily earned their five star review from me! I came in Monday night and was the only customer (as UNLV students are currently on holiday break). The manager immediately sprung into action, accommodated my Yelp check-in for a free potato taco, and recommended the fish and beef tacos as well. (From 4-7 PM tacos are only $1.25, bringing my grand total to $2.50 plus tax. Score!) 

I only had to wait about 5-6 minutes (and their TV was turned to Monday Night Football game, bonus!). 

My tacos were absolutely loaded with lettuce, cilantro, tomatoes, and other goodies! My favorite was definitely the delightfully crispy potato taco, but I enjoyed the beef and fish tacos as well. 

I'll be back...soon!
