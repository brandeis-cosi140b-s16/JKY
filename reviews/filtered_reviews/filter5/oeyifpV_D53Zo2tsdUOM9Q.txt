Like one reviewer said... its like tacos el gordo and chipotle had a child and named it Tacos y Tacos.

This place is fantastic with my only complaint being that unlike its mother chipotle it does not have ICED TEA!!! Perfect otherwise, great salsa bar with FREE BEANS!!! Extremely fresh and clean yet authentic feel.  Yes the servers speak english but this is a good thing! You dont have to feel like you are in the third world to enjoy great mexican food.  The fish tacos are better than what I used to get in San Quentin when I  lived there in Baja Norte.

UPDATE: Their Eastern location DOES have "ICED TEA" but it is not brewed there it is some horrible concoction they bring out in plastic bags.  Again other than the lack of quality Iced T this place is 100% awesome.
