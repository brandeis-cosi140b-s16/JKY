I love Mexican food and this is one of my favorites. Warm, fresh and never ending chips...wonderful salsa. Last night I ordered something different than I usually do (pollo fundido) and it was delicious. It was super busy last night so service and food was slower than it usually is (typically we get our food fast) but our server still managed to stop by and check on us, get us more chips and provide refills. I keep trying other Mex places but this is still the best.
