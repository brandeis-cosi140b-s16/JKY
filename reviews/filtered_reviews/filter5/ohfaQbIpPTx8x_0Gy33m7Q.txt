I enjoyed the food here when they only had a few little tables outside under an umbrella. They moved a few doors down and are now even more awesome. Byob (by the bottle for beer so treat yourself to a nice 22oz to bring in), salsas are great, chorizo - I usually order 3-5 tacos/quesadillas/burritos (mix them up) with all different flavors. Breakfast on the weekends is also incredible. My brother from California got their Goat and loved it. This place is legit
