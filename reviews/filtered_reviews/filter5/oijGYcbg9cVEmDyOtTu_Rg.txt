This is my second time here, and it continues to impress me. First, the queso here is the pinnacle of what it should be. Molten, smooth, and extremely creamy with great spices. The chips that come along with it may be a bit too salty, but that is a minor flaw. 

The. Tacos. Are. Beastly. 

I really don't understand the culinary genius behind these things, but they have such a cacophony of blended flavors that just seem so perfectly matched. It really is just an epic meal to have. Overall, this place is my go to lunch spot in all of Charlotte.
