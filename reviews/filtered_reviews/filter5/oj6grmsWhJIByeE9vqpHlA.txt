My husband and I came here around 4 on a Saturday afternoon after spending a couple of hours at the Dog Bar. We were pretty hungry although it was not quite yet dinner time, so we just wanted something to nosh on. 

We decided to go here after all the rave reviews we had from friends. We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken. We decided to split the queso and a chicken quesadilla. Our waitress (as listed per the receipt) was JWOO. She was spunky with piercings and was perfect. She was quick and even asked the kitchen to split the quesadilla between 2 plates since we were splitting (that goes a long way). 

The food was excellent, although I think the queso is meant to be taken down in 5 minutes, because once it starts cooling off it can get a bit hard. 

Overall we had a great time and will be back, especially if going to Dog Bar.
