I have been to Richardson's many times and it still remains one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  For the people complaining about the food being spicy, um, it is a restaurant serving New Mexico cuisine - it is supposed to be spicy.  My favorite dish has to be the Relleno Platter.  I usually split it with a friend because the portion is huge: two rellenos with rice and beans.  I especially like the pork rellenos with verde sauce, but there's also smoked turkey, beef and regular cheese.  Their margaritas are outstanding...honestly, I haven't had anything that was bad at this restaurant.  And the wait staff is friendly, too.  

I love their patio renovation.  It is stylish and sophisticated with a modern New Mexico ambiance.  Great for having dinner and/or drinks outdoors on one of our beautiful Phoenix evenings.
