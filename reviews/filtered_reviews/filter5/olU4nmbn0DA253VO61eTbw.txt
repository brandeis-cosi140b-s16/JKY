I have loved this place for many years.  At my son's suggestion we would stop at their old location on the way to the airport when we would visit Phoenix. Great atmosphere, private adobe booths and best of all great food.  Everything we tried was good good good.  

Fast forward 10 years or so and we are Sunbirds here in AZ for the winter.  The old Richardsons burned down several years ago - major bummer - but the phoenix has arisen in a newly built Richardson's.  It is every bit as good.  It has the same wonderful cozy, intimate feel with the very private booths and a luxurious bar that is always filled with happy, satisfied customers.  On a recent visit I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was buttery, flaky and done to a tee.  It was served with an assortment of sauteed vegetables incluing green beans, baby carrotts, squash and mushrooms.  Also their special green chile potato was a welcome sight.  Two Rob Roys with some wonderful, totally different kind of maraschino's,rounded out the delightful experience, not to mention my charming dining companion.   

Oh I will be back Richardson's of New Mexico!  Thanks again!
