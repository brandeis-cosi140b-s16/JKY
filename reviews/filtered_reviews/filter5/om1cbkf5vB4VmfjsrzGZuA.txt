Guess I'll join the 5 star review club on Santos Lucha Libre. My first visit was very memorable. They let my friend and I try all the meats since it was our first time. They were all very good. I had the barbacoa, green chile and el pastor. Very very good. The decor is hilarious. My only hesitation with their food is that it tends to be on the hot side. But very very tasty.
