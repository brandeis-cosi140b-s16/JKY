I agree with everything the previous review said. This place is as authentic as it gets on this side of the border. My regular order is two tacos al pastor and a manzanita. The people here are friendly and helpful. They used to be open until 3am on the weekends but I think that has changed. 

They also operate a food truck on McDowell between 24th and 32nd Street on the North side of McDowell.
