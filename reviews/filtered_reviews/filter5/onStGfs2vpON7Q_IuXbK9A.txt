Driving up to this establishment, you would have no idea what was to come.  This is one of the best Mexican food establishments in a strong Mexican food market.  Located at 16th Street and Thomas, heading into a little bit older area of town, you don't expect to find a fine dining Mexican food experience.  I was greatly surprised.  While looking at the price of the food, and coupling it with the location, I was hoping that I would not be disappointed.  I was not.  The food was excellent.  The taco's were very enjoyable, but the surprise of the meal was the heavily seasoned french fries.  I will definitely come back on a date here, and enjoy some of the traditional Mexican dinners.

The only thing that could make the Barrio Cafe a better experience is a lunch menu.  It's tough to head out for a lunch with the only option being the Taco's at a reasonable price.

I see that there are tons of choices for Tequila.  I will have to go back and test out their varieties.  Can you call me a cab??
