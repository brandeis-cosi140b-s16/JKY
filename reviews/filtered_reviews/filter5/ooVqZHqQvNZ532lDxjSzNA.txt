Fancy freshly made guacamole? Delicious sangria? Fajitas seasoned to perfection? Then try El Segundo.

I was a previous fan of the once Cafe Baba Reba, but the owners of this venue decided to go bigger with their Spanish themed restaurant. With a new look and a whole new menu, El Segundo Sol is absolutely delicious in my opinion! 

You have your choice of indoor or outdoor seating, and with the weather as perfect as it is at this moment, I recommend the outdoor seating. Your outdoor table will be tucked under some strategically placed trees, adorable lighting and accompanied with a fantastic view of entertainment filled Las Vegas Boulevard. 

The service started off a bit rocky but after some light banter, and a few smiles, we were on a roll! 

Chicken fajitas, fresh guacamole, delightful salsa, and satisfying sangria; this meal was hands down, one of the best I've experienced in a while in the way of Mexican food. 

Give it a whirl, and be patient if the service isn't fantastic, the food certainly makes up for any dining experience hiccups!
