Juan's is my all-time favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Usually we call ahead and pick it up because the lunch rush CAN be a  bit daunting, but for all of the business they do, they seem to handle it as well as possible.   the service is always friendly and the portions are huge and cheap.  the salsa is fantastic!  if you're in a hurry, i recommend ordering to go or going EARLY or LATE.
