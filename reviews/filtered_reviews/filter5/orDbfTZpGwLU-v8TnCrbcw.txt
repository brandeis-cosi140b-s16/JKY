So I've been going on a bulgogi binge of late. This place is on the way home from work and I decided I had t see what all the yelping was about. It's in a small complex that has a couple of empty/broken into/deserted stores that really make you believe you took a wrong turn and may be entering the slums of Bombay. Either way, don't drive by too fast, otherwise you'll miss this camouflaged beauty..

The first time I came in, they said there would be a 30 minute wait for a to go order. I decided against the wait and made a plan of coming back the next day, but making sure to order ahead. I would recommend doing the same because I think 20-30 minutes is the norm for a to go order at any time of the day.

I ordered a Bulgogi and Kimchee burrito. Usually the only burritos I ever get are from Chipotle, but how can you pass up Korean Mexican? We don't have any of these places in Arizona so the novelty was not lost on me. The burrito was overfilled with bulgogi (the way i like it) and was super spicy (also the way i like it). Bottom line: It was super bueno. Make sure you have an ice cold drink to tolerate this burrito. And this place is light on your wallet, $5.50 or so was the total...but make sure you bring cash if your total is under $10.
