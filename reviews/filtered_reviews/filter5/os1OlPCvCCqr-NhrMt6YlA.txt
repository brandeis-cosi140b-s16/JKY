I was recommended by a local to try this place out. It was wonderful blend of Chinese and Mexican cuisines. We celebrated my dad's birthday. We ordered lamb potstickers from the dim sum menu, oh my this was incredible, the meat was cooked very well. Another Chinese dish we ordered was 18 Monk Noodles, very delicious! For the Mexican taste we had some poblano flautas, it had duck, this was a special on their menu. It was rich with flavor! Then we added papas fritas. Of course I ordered Mexican Coke. We ended the meal with tres leches! Oh my this was decadent, and huge! Haha didn't expect it to be so wholesome. The manager, Jessica was incredible and so was our server! Highly recommend this to anyone visiting and to the locals. I'm coming here again!
