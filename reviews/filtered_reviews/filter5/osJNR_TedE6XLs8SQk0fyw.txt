One of my all time favorites and the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I've seen in a restaurant (and being 100% Mexican American with a mother who is a great cook, I am PICKY about Mexican food). Do yourself a favor and try their lengua tacos. Long story short, though, I've never had a bad meal here!
