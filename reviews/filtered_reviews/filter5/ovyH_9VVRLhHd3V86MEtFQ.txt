The bathrooms are really boring. 

That's literally the only less-than-fantastic thing I could come up with. Everything else is spot on: Medium-sized space that feels intimate but not cramped; great sound equipment; stage is the perfect height; bleachers in the back of the room; 2 bars run by friendly people & phenomenal food.

If you haven't been: check out their calendar and try to make it in soon. Or if you'd rather just grab a bite and skip the show, you can go into the front section ("The Lounge") and just eat and have a drink without buying a ticket. I recommend the nachos.
