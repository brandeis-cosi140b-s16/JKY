I really liked this restaurant.  For a really small place they had great service.  The waitress checked in on my 3 times which was awesome.  I got the beef bowl.  It was great but i mainly tasted the Asian side rather than the Mexican side. Overall i wish there was one closer to me but it is definitely worth the 35 minute drive.
