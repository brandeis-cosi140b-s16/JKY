I went to The Mission last night on a first date. Our server, Jomar, was excellent and kind. He was very knowledgeable and attentive. He bought my date and I dessert because he said that he could tell we were hitting it off and he wanted to be a part of the evening. His service was as good as it gets. The vibe is eclectic, the lighting is soft and romantic, and the food will not disappoint! My date and I are both gluten intolerant and there were a ton of menu options for us. Go here if you get the chance, and if you have the money.
