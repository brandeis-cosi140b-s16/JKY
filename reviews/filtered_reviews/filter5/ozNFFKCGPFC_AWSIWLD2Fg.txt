This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Vegas! I'm a local so I avoid the strip as much as possible, but I would take on the traffic and tourists every day to eat here! And I recommend this place to any of my friends or family visiting Las Vegas.

All of the food is amazing...from the margaritas, to the chips and salsa, to the meal. My all-time favorite is the Quesadilla de Mariscos with crab and shrimp. AMAZING. The meal is a little pricey, but worth it. I would high recommend Javier's to anyone looking for some great food!
