OK, it's not Nobu, no celebrity chef behind the kitchen doors and no fancy plates or tablecloths but this was the only place I visited twice during my stay (and can't wait to go back to). Nothing fancy, just Mexican families, bikers, normal people enjoying true Mexican tacos: delicious, greasy, spicy. And at $2 each, best value in Vegas!
To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go). 
Crowded at all hours so be patient! no alcoholic beverages, just sodas and "aguas frescas" (horchata is my favorite). My favorite tacos, it's a tough choice because all are delicious but I guess the spicy pork and tongue are the most special (the double tortilla is great, that way you don't spill the filling all over). 
It's just a 10 min. walk from the Wynn/Palazzo/TI/Fashion Mall intersection.
