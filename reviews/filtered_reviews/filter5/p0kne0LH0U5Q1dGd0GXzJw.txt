Sooooooooooooooooo damn good!  I had the fusion bulgogi tacos in lettuce wrap, carne asada tacos, and kim chi fried rice w/ spam.  Yes! I ate all that.  The salsas were yummy too!  I will most certainly be returning!  My only head up is if you can, is that food is made to order, so some entrees take a little longer.  *cough Kim chi fried rice
