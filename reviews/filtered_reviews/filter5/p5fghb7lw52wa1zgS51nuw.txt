Whoa! Pleasant surprise! Service was great and food was so good!! I will definitely come back for more when i return to Vegas! This is the kind of place off the strip that you get lucky to find.  

Food was fresh and delicious! I had the shrimp empanadas as an appetizer - the best! 

The seafood mocajete was boiling and filled with all kinds of yummy seafood!
