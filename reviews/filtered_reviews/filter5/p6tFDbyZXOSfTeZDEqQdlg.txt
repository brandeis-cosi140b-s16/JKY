Such a cute place! I have been obsessed with Joyride for the past 6 months. All They're tacos are amazing. The Fila salad is also great. The first time my boyfriend got the Mexican street corn he said every single person should have this on they're table. And he's not usually impressed by food. I have never been disappointed with the food drinks or service at joyride.
