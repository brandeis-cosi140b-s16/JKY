Ever since the location next to Wynn closed down, this location is always PACKED. Yes, loyal taco fans, Tacos El Gordo is an absolute MUST HAVE if you're in town. It isn't too far from the strip so if you have a car, please do bother to take the drive down here. If not, you are definitely missing out!

Warning: you will leave smelling like tacos so don't come in after a fresh shower... Also your fingers will have the taco scent lingering for like the next 7 hours. 

The menu is priced at $2 or $2.50 per taco depending on what you order. You grab a tray, go, and order. On a normal hungry day, I can eat about 7-8 tacos. 

I highly recommend ordering the adobada (aka "spicy pork" -- not really that spicy at all, actually) and ask for pineapples on the side. I eat it with the pineapple and it is sooooo good! I do this by ripping pieces of pineapple and just dropping it on the taco lol. I've noticed if they see you add something to the tip jar, most of the time they'll add the pineapple & extras without you even asking ;)

In addition to that, the classic asada (steak) is always spot on! I've explored all the other tacos such as the lengua but it didn't tickle my fancy. Every time I come here, I now only get the adobada and asada. 

The fries are also HUGE. We have shared the fries between 4 people while also eating some tacos. I also enjoy the quesadillas they make here!

I have been to Tacos el Gordo so many times.. And every single time I leave stuffed and satisfied. Yum!
