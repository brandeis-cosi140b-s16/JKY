I have heard about Barrio Cafe for several years but I really don't know what took me so long to actually try it out?!? I have to admit I usually stick to my favorite places when we go out but we found ourselves downtown after a Dbacks game and finally made the decision to go here.  

On a Sunday late afternoon the parking lot was packed. We found street parking nearby and loved looking at all the murals surrounding Calle 16 building. We put our name in and was told 45 min wait! Almost walked out but we put our name in and lucky enough it was about 10 mins and we got a table! Lucky for us because we were starving!

We had to try guacamole made table side and it was awesome! They give you a choice of ingredients and we chose them all and the best was the pomegranate seeds. This was seriously the best guac I've ever had in my life. A little expensive for $12 but after eating it was well worth it. 

My wife had the carne tacos and  I had the house speciality Cochinita Pibil. All I can saw was WOW! I loved the slow rosted pork. I even saved some of the guac that we were eating with chips and put that in the tortillas. Wife's carne was also really good. 

All in all I loved each and every bite at Barrio. I do believe it was a little too expensive, and thought about giving it 4 stars based on the price but while we were driving home we just couldn't stop talking about how excellent our meal was. This was one if not the best Mexican food I've ever tasted. I will be back here and this is a great restaurant to bring out of town guest.
