I love Cafe Rio. They offer so many choices--different meats, sauces, fillings. You can get exactly what you want. I like their shredded chicken enchilada with the green sauce, which is more tangy than spicy. Their quesadillas are cheesy   and large enough to share. They have a good selection of beverages--sodas and teas.
