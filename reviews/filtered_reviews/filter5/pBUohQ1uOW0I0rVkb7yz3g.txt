This is a small mom & pop place outside of the Vegas strip. Service is great and the food is even better. We've been here a couples times now and our favorites are still the various fusion tacos. Mexican tacos with Korean meats just go so well together. If you're ever tired of eating at the endless buffets...try this place! I highly recommend it and guarantee you won't be disappointed.
