GREAT HAPPY HOUR!

Tequila shots for 3 bucks? COUNT ME IN.

The margs are 5 bucks
The food ranges from 2.75-5.00

The atomic cheese nachos were good, not great.. But you really can't be picky when they cost 2.75..

The quesadillas on the happy hour menu were huge! I thought I'd be getting small portion, but it seriously satisfies like an average meal.
