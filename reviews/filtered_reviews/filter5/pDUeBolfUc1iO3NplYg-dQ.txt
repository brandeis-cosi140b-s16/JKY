We waited for over an hour just to order, but the food never fails to make me happy. I was super happy that the guy that always makes my tacos the adobada was there to help me. I secretly have a mini crush on him. He always has a great attitude and it makes everything better. 
I will continue to go and wait the hour to get my tacos.


*The wait was on Sunday*

We had also gone on Thursday and we only waited 15mn to get the tacos, same day I got to meet Adriel Favela (Mexican Singer) who was also getting tacos there before a performance.
