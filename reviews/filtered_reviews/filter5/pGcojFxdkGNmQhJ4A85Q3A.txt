In my opinion, it doesn't get better than Café Rîo. Everything is crazy fresh - I CANNOT get enough of those tortillas! You THINK you've had a good tortilla until you've experienced these. They're made right in front of you, are super light, chewy and just plain incredible. The flavors are on point, and they don't slop greasy ingredients into your bowl. 

I love the options here, too. Although I'm in love with the tortillas, I've recently gone gluten-free - so the salad (without the tortilla) was a PERFECT solution for me. I got all the things I love about Café Rîo, minus the gluten, and the servings are MASSIVE. 

Thanks for giving us a healthier option with quick service!
