It's true what all the reviews say, its the perfect place for a date night! It's located right next to the World Market Center, plenty of free parking or if you want to impress your date you can valet. We had reservations around 7:45pm, the staff is extremely attentive and friendly. There is a yelp check in deal for a free glass of wine, I don't think anyone would mind that :) When we sat down they gave us chips & salsa, be warned the salsa had small jalape√±o's in it and for someone like me that does not eat spicy items I had to make sure to avoid it when I went in for the dip.  I'm a vegetarian so I loved that they had a special section dedicated for me, I hate skimming through options and liking what I read then I hit the meat ingredient and have to keep going. Nothing on the vegetarian section seemed appealing, so I asked the waiter if I could get a simple cheese enchilada with beans & rice on the side and they accommodated to my request. The enchilada was delicious, the tomato sauce had a hint of garlic which gave it a wonderful flavor. The beans were not to heavy and good and as for the rice it was white rice with some vegetables in it, went well with my enchilada. After our meal we got desert, they have several options a delicious churro being on of them haha but I picked the tres leeches cake. I normally like my tres leeches cake liquidy but theres was a little bit more solid. What made it real good was the bits of shaved coconut slices on top, delicious! Overall I really enjoyed my experience and meal at Mundo and definitely recommend the place! If anything go in for a drink and enjoy the beautiful decor of mirror & gorgeous lamps!
