Casa Ramos is amazing!  The best mexican restuarant I have been to in the valley and I have been to a lot!  Their service is superb, food is great, and the value is the best!  Would highly reccomend to anyone looking for the best bang for their buck!  Also, if you are ever in the Heber area, check them out up there too!
