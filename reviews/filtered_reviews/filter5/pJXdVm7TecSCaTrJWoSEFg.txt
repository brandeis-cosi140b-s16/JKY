Ordered the Veggie burrito for something new and was not disappointed! The flavour was excellent and the salsa/hot sauce that was provided was also nice. Have had the green chili pork and red chiliv beef before and those were excellent as well. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Portion size is very generous and the homemade chips are great! Highly recommended!
