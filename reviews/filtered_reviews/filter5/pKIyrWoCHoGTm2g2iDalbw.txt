Lets get right to it; if you name your place after one particular dish, that item needs to really deliver the goods. Yeah, the fish taco is flat out spectacular! Here's why I like this so much ... 

When you order any of the tacos, you get 2 tacos and a side. The restaurant has  a very nice policy that allows you to mix and/or match your tacos. So have a fish taco and have a chicken taco or whatever taco on the same plate. I like that. Each taco comes to the table like a nice big overstuffed hoagie that you eat kind of openfaced. Cabo Fish Taco has figured out how to prevent this from turning into a giant sloppy mess as you munch your way through the meal. The tortilla is wonderfully crispy, a little flakey, and pliable at the same time while not being at all greezy. No idea how they do that?? It holds up perfectly during numerous pick-ups. And it tastes great ... delivering a fresh homemade flavor that will make you feel like you are sampling a family-secret-recipe.

We've eaten there for several lunches, so I have had the chance to sample some of the other non-taco dishes. All very good but I'm happily stuck in taco mode. One quick word about the sides ... the server recommended their spicy pasta side dish. It was perfectly very spicy hot and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Really nice execution.

One last thought about why Cabo Fish Taco gets 5 stars is due to the atmosphere of the place. Very nice and friendly, casual relaxed vibe. Terrific service. Very nice bar thing going on, which I haven't sampled but it's front and center stage. You can't miss it and it lends the place a nice relaxing backdrop.

Give this place a shot, I bet you will really like it!
