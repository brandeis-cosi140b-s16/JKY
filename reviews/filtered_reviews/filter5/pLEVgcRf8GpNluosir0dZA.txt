This review is super delayed, but I could not just forget to give this place the great recognition they deserve.

I recently moved to Oregon after living in AZ my entire life. I made my first trip back home to AZ to see my mom and sisters.The girls went out for a day filled with food, laughter, and love. We saved the BEST for last. RICHARDSON'S!!!!!!!

Between the 4 of us, we ordered some of the best items on the menu. Carne Adobada, Enchiladas, Mexican Chicken Cordon Blue, and ooooooohhhhh the Chili Relleno!!!!! Richardson's has the most impressive chili rellenos I have ever experienced. And I have experienced some freaking Rellenos!

I would not expect to find Mexican food this good out of a some what up scale restaurant in what my sister would call Cen Pho (FYI, I would NEVER call it that).

Great job Richardson's!!!!!
