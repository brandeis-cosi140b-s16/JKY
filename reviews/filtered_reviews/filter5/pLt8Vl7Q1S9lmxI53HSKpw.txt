After reading some of the negative reviews I'm wondering if I came to the same place but after talking to the wife(born and raised in El Paso) I'm sure I'm reviewing the right restaurant. This is the best Mexican I've had. We've been twice with equally impressive visits. The first time we ate at the bar, the second visit we brought our son (4) so we sat in the dining room.
The Margaritas are great and don't miss the Paloma(tequila and grapefruit juice).  Between the two visits we sampled most of the tacos, salsas and ceviche. All great. My son had the children's chicken tacos which he loved. The only draw back is that they squeeze bottled sour cream all over the tacos which made them very messy but he liked them non the less. The flautas are also delicious. The small guac is more than the two of us could eat. Creamy, rich and just perfectly spiced. 
If I had to find something negative, I guess our server was a little pushy but as a server myself i guess I can see where she's coming from but she needs to learn how to balance suggestions with upsells. 
We'll be back and I look forward to bringing the inlaws to see what they think of the place.
