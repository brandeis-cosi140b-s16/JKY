Ok, here it goes with my first review even though I've used Yelp thousands of times to find great restaurants!  

Looking for a highly rated Mexican restaurant near my new office I found this gem of a place. I've been dying for *great* Mexican food for a long, long time and haven't found great food since I lived in Issaquah WA and spent three days a week eating at Mi Casa (sadly closed now). 

Their stewed beef in a taco tasted exactly like the beer at Mi Casa and was to die for. The green pork chili was incredible. The asada melted in my mouth. And to top it off, the owners were super personable. I'm already dreaming of going back!
