I hosted my husband's 40th birthday party here. We rented a private room, the Tequila Room, which was wonderful. The shelves of the room are lined with different Tequilas. The room is very private. We also contracted a Mariachi Band through the help of the catering manager, Ms. Dusty, and the music was wonderful. Our server was amazing and most important of all: the food was plentiful, so well-presented, and delicious! It was nice to have a taste of authentic Mexico right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. We will definitely be going back and bringing friends and family.
