I come here all the time. Seriously crave this stuff. Workers are super friendly! It's First Friday & PACKED but workers still kept a smile on & made me a burrito with LOVE. Best taco place in town! You pay for the quality of the food, so it's totally worth it. Try it out if you haven't already & thank me later
