Seriously the best Mexican food ever.  We tried lots of dishes in our large group and everything was amazing. Can't wait to go back and will recommend this place to everyone I know.  The seafood stuffed bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp is to die for.  Want something exotic? Try the chaplulines - fried grasshoppers. Honestly: really tasty. Garlic lime version is what I'd recommend; the habanero version is seriously hot!
