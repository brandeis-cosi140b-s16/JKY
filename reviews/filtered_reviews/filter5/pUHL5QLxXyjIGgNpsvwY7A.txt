Stopped by on my way home from work yesterday on a whim for my first time because I was hungry, and boy did I have a pleasant surprise! The mature blond lady working behind the counter asked if it was my first time there to which I obviously responded "yes". She was extremely friendly and gave me the rundown on what they serve and recommended the green chili pork burrito of which she gave me a small sample. It was delicious! I ordered it and because it was my first time there she threw in a small side of chips and salsa. When I got home and opened the container I was impressed and happy to be greeted with a hot and large burrito that required two hands to pick up. The tortilla was soft but firm. The burrito was filled with the green chili pork and rice(but not too much rice), black beans(pintos and refried are available if thats your preference), cheese and sour cream. The chili had a bright green chili flavor and did have a kick to it but was not too spicy for the average American who likes Mexican food.Everything tasted fresh and their recipe is delicious. It is definitely one of the best burritos I have eaten. I am anxious to try their Carne Asada burrito next!
