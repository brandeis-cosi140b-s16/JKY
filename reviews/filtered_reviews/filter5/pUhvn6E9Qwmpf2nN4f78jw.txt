I've always wanted to try Sushiritto in San Francisco but I always miss my chance whenever I'm in town. So naturally I wanted to try this place out once I had heard of it. I got their Huntington wrap, which was decently portioned, but I didn't expect a large portion considering that it's sushi and they tend to be in the upper range of prices anyway. The preparation was clean and the flavors complemented each other well. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend to try out if they're into sushi-burrito styles. Expect to pay around the $9-14 range if you want a filling meal.
