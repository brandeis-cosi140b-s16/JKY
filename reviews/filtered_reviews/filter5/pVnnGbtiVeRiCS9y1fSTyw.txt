Wow. I am a Mexican food junkie. Mercadito is muy bueno.  Start with the fresh, warm thick chips accompanied by the delicious creamy guac. Be careful or you will fill up on the chips!  The Mexican cobb with grilled chicken was perfect to share. The chicken was especially good.  Also tried the roasted cauliflower; different prep and also very delicious. Bryant our waiter was attentive and really nice.  Thanks also to manager Hayes who sincerely apologized and comped my sister's drink when her glass had a small chip on the rim.  Class act. Hope they open a place in the OC!
