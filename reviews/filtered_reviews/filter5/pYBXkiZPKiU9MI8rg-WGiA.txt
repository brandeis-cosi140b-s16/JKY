Great bland of Asian and Mexican cuisine.  Some of the most unique tastes I've ever had!  Great drink menu as well, have the Cadillac Marg which was awesome, ok maybe I had a couple.  We've been back a few times since our first visit and will continue to visit here when we can afford it.  "Good aint cheap, cheap aint good."
