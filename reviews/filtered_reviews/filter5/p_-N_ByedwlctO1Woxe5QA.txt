What a great place for a green chili burrito.   Nice amount of heat and meat. Be careful it comes out hot. The tacos are great. Deep fried shell goodness. 
Also bring CASH ONLY note hours 11-6 Mon-Fri and Sat 10-5. Sunday and Monday closed.  
If your driving on Reems just remember it is in the same shopping center as Church's Chicken.
This is my new fresh taco place and green chili burritos. Tacos come in at 3 bucks and the burritos are from 3.45 to 5.85. 

Try it out you will be thanking me later. Enjoy
