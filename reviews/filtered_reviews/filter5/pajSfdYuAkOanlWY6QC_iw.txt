Tacos el Gordo Vegas style! I love that I can finally get good tacos without having to go to California. The set up is the exact same as you'd see at the San Diego locations. The adobada is amazing I have to get at least a couple whenever I come here and the carne asada is very flavorful without being dry like most in Vegas. 

The Vegas locations have carne asada fries too which I haven't tried yet but will the next time I go there (probably this week haha)
