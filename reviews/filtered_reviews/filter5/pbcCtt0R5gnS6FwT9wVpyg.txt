I was getting my car fixed at The Car Shop across the street and walked over for lunch.  The sign above the building calls the place Taqueros and it was not until I walked up that I saw it was called Sombrero's Mexican Grill.  The place is colorful and clean and the women that work there (the owners?) are really nice.  Originally I was struck by the way they seemed to rip off Chipotle's business model and Somburros name but the lack of originality does not even matter.  They run a clean operation!   My husband loves chipotle and I hate it (because my burrito always ends up being ice cold) preferring the greasier -burtos joints.  Sombrero's is our happy median.  I can get a wheat tortilla, pinto beans that are actually vegetarian (unlike Chipotle's pork laden beans), deliciously spicy green sauce and free chips.  It is a really good value and if you frequent chipotle I would encourage you to make the switch to Sombrero's and support local business!
