Man, what I wouldn't give to be elbow deep in another Torta Del Rey right now. 

We were half way through our Phoenix/Tucson Man v. Food tour before we finally made it to Los Reyes de la Torta. We arrived after the lunch rush and got seated right away. Everyone was speaking Spanish so it felt like we were in some exotic locale and not north Phoenix. 

They don't serve alcohol here but my wife had the Margarita anyhow. It was so good and so was my iced tea. We ordered and tried to make conversation with the waitress but she just smiled and nodded... I really need to bone up on my Spanish. 

It was a bit of a spiritual moment for me when she came back and laid that giant torta in front of me. After collecting my wits, I snapped a photo and began looking for a handhold to collect my prize. The first bite was amazing... The bun was softer than I expected and had nice charred bits for a distinct barbecue flavor. The layers of meat, cheese and veggies (the avocado was plentiful and fresh!) provided heavenly bite variety and before I knew it half was gone and I was pleasantly full. 

We packed up our leftovers and wandered the restaurant for a bit before our touristy activities caught the attention of the staff. We spoke at length to a friendly staffer (seemed to have owner-like knowledge) and left feeling like a treasured guest and friend of the family. 

I miss you Los Reyes de la Torta!
