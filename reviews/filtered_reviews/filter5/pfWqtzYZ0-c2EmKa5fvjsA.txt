The crushed habanero salsa paste at the Carlsbad Tavern is hotter than the chiseled abs of my athletically built Abercrombie and Fitch style imaginary boyfriend. They brought more tears to my eyes than the last time I drank a bottle of wine, alone, at home watching part two of the hunger games on Netflix. Nooooo Peeta!!! Why must you sacrifice yourself for Katniss?? She is so unworthy!!!
