Service is what gives this place five stars. The guy at the register the day I walked in (presuming he's the owner but I could be wrong) instantly started up a conversation with me like we were best buddies for years. The entire staff there was talkative and engaging, truly getting to know who you were as a person instead of a standard customer. It made it seem like this was a family owned business of some sort by the service, and I have to say with personalization like that... this place is a neighborhood favorite!

Tried the three tacos for $4.99... great deal! You can mix and match, and they offer you a seasoned corn cob with it. The french fries are amazing (not greasy and actually taste/look like they're real potatoes!), also might I mention the alcohol and the enormous selection of hot sauces to choose from? If you're a fan of spicy, and you want to sample an array of different sauces... this would be the place to check out. This has rated one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants around UNLV/in Las Vegas!
