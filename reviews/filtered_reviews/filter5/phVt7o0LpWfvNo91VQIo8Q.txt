Another fellow yelper on here stated it correctly with some of the negative reviews...first world problems! The food took too long, it was greasy and another I saw said it wasn't as good as Ajo Al's (gasp! Btw my friend and I got food poisoning from there so I'll never go again). I've been eating at Rosita's for a very long time. When I graduated from ASU 10 years ago, where did I go after my ceremony? Rosita's! Mother's day, my birthday, a job promotion, just because... all at Rosita's throughout the years and it has never failed me. The chips are always hot and their menudo and posole is just like mom's. The beans too! Mmm! I know many friends and family who frequent Rosita's. If you're in a hurry go to a chain but for me, I'd rather wait for my Rosita's. Thanks for over 10 years of good food and memories! I'll see you soon!
