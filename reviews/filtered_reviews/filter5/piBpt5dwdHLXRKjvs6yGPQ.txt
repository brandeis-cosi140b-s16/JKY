Yum! I so hope this place stays open for good! It's a simple menu and I love that they have Mexican sodas. Their tacos are so good, even the tortillas are grilled. Service is great, I'm pretty sure it was the owner the last couple times we've been there. Friendly man. I'm glad they got rid of those clueless little girls when they first opened. Place is clean and I love how they fixed it up.

Con: They're closed Sundays!
