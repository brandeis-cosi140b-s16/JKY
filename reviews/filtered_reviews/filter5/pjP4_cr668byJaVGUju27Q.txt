Oh my word. So good! The house rice is the perfect side. It's sweet, salty, and spicy! When I first had it I ordered two more sides to take home. Instantly addicted. Their Al Pastor tacos are perfection! Just the right amount of heat. While I'm not a fan of their ceiveche (too much fish, not enough shrimp), my husband loves it. I am, however, a fan of their sangria. White or red, they're both delicious.
