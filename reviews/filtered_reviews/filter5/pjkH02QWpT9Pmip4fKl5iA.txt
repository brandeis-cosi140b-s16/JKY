The food was amazing!  Since our family is from New Mexico and the best chile comes from New Mexico (yes I said it) :).  It's flavorful and spicy. 

Had a wedding in Vegas and needed food catered and Dave provided great customer service, very accommodating and provided great food for our special occasion. Very reasonably priced. All our guests raved about the food. We had green and red cheese enchiladas, green and red chicken & cheese enchiladas, chile verde, chile rojo both with pork, rice, beans, chips green and red salsas. All the food was just like home cooking.  

I have to say I was really nervous about ordering food long distance and having never tried it, but with all the great Yelp reviews I felt more comfortable.

Next time in Vegas we will definitely stop by and eat here. Thank you Dave!!!
