All I can say is WOW. I haven't been this impressed by a restaurant in a long time. The menu is small, but quality makes up for quantity. We started with the ceviche, which was excellent. Fresh, tangy and on point. I had the short rib tacos & I'm still dreaming about them two weeks later. My date had the pork chop molé with house rice. Don't let the house rice scare you... chorizo & pineapple are a surprisingly tasty combination. OH - and they have a full bar! Appetizer, entrées & 3 beers was under $40. Mind = blown. Can't wait to go back!
