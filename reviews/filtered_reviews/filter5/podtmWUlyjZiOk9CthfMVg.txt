This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area. I have never tried anything here that I didn't like. On top of that, every dish is so unique and flavorful that it's hard to compare to any other place. It sounded odd to me at first, being a fusion of Asian and Mexican cuisine, but I am so glad I tried it and I've never looked back. Amazing food, and I wish it was a little closer to me so I could go there on my lunch breaks at work. Five stars without question!
