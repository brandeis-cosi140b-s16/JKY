Real authentic Mexican food. Wife is very fussy and loved their shrimp. She said it was as good as what we got in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I had a burrito that was out of this world. Jose the waiter is a great young man. He treated us like family.  We will go here anytime we're in the mood for Mexican food.
