Had one of the best experiences of my life last Tuesday at Nacho Daddy!! What made the experience the best was our server Karmen!! She had such a witty personality and really made the experience phenominal  The crazy thing is that Im allergic to scorpions but for some reason I wasnt after that night due to the fact that she served me and my boy a couple Scorpion shots which really turned the night into a memorable one!! The fact
That Im still alive and writing this is a shocker?! Cheers to Karmen and Nacho Daddy
