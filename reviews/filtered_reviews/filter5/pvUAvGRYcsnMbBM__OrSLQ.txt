I was on vacation with some friends, and we decided to eat there. 

Price = very well worth it! 
Customer service = 100% Satisfied! 
Burrito = VERY VERY GOOD!

First off:
We sat down, and we got our menus then we ordered. Then she asked  if we wanted ice water. We got 6 ice waters because we were a party of 6. Like all places, I'm assuming it was going to be from the tap, but it was not. It was bottle of water and the big plus, it was for FREE. Then to make it even better, complimentary CHIP & SALSA!! Then the burritos came, and she gave us 4-5 different kind of hot sauces. While we were eating the amazing burritos, we needed more ice waters before we can even ask for more, she was already asking us if we wanted more ice water! What a service!! And a big plus on the food too.

This place is highly recommend!
