Me and my friends go to Havana grill a lot and i must say the food is really good, very tasty, drinks are fabulous, great prices (mojitos are the best!)... service is great!... Fridays and saturdays they have music and it gets pretty crowded and the atmosphere its just perfect!
I recommend this place!
