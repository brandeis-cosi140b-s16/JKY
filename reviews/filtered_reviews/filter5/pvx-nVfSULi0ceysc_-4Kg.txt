This place is honestly the greatest thing ever. They have amazing food, and the staffs are really friendly. 
My favorite thing on there is their Kim chi fried rice, I get it with spam. I got the full portion which is $10.81 after tax. I love it so much. It's a really good deal if you get half portion bc the portion is still big but it's still really good. I do think that it is a little over price for just fried rice but again, you have to pay a little more for good food. 
The parking situation is a bit ridiculous bc they're in a small plaza and have to share with other ppl. I also had their bulgogi nachos. It is to die for. 
I definitely recommend the fried rice and nachos if you do get anything. You can tell it's a family own restaurant which feels a little more welcoming. 
Overall great place and food. Just a little overpriced but well worth it.
