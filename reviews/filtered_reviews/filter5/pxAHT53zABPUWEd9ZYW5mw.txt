Poncho's is this native's favorite Mexican place, by far!! You just don't get any better than this. Simple, fast, cheap food served by super nice people. The place is no-frills but clean and casual. People are overstating the divey-ness of it, it's not that bad. I find it to be very relaxing and comfortable. Truly though, the food is what keeps me coming back for many years. Get a simple bean burrito with a side of rice and you'll see what I mean. Love, love, love this place. Getting hungry just thinking about it!
