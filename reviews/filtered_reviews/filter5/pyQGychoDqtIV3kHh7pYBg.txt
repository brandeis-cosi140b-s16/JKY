Excellent and UNIQUE food, paired with a beautiful space and good margaritas has quickly earned Taco Guild the title of Adrian F.'s new favorite taco joint! I especially love the housemade-to-order guac! The service can be a bit... sluggish... at times, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you're in a rush, but aside from this small blemish I give Taco Guild 5 stars all around!
