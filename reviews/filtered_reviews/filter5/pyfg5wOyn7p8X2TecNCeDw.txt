Wow, thanks Yelpers for leading me to this spot. Nice to have a high-quality Mexican place on the West/Southwest side of town.

The service was great, food was equally as good, and prices were reasonable. My drink stayed refilled constantly. Chips with salsa and bean dip, both tasty, to start, then Fideo soup before the meal. They've only been open a couple of months, but there is no reason (other than maybe location) they can't give Bonita & Lindo a run for their money.

Will be going back often.
