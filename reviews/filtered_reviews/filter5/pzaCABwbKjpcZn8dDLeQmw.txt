We were in Vegas for my husband's soccer tournament a couple weeks ago and I found this in a little strip mall (filled with spanish speaking businesses) across from FREEDOM PARK.  We were the only gringos in the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon.  Lots of families, soccer teams and other groups were seated.  You felt like you were in Mexico with the decorations, smell of fresh tortillas and the music.  What made it even more authentic was there was a guy selling purses, etc... just as if you were on a beach in a Mexican resort.  The ceviche was the best, the tamarind margarita was scrumptious and the shrimp tacos were like none other we have had.  This is the best Mexican food we've had outside Mexico...we'd love you to open one in Boise.
