My wife and I were looking for a place to eat off of the strip, and found this place on Yelp. We arrived during happy hour, which was perfect for us.

The chips were good, and the salsa was very tasty. Their tacos were delicious, and the tortillas are freshly made. It was nice to have an affordable meal for once.

Great ambiance, great music, great service.
