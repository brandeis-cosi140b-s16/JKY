Loved it! Everything from the food, restaurant and service was great! We sat at the bar and it was fun watching the chefs cooking from behind the counter.

We had the two most raved about plates from what I've read: 
Carne Adovada and Pasta Heidi. Both did not disappoint.

The plates came out piping hot; in temperature and flavor. The pork was very moist and tasty. The rice and beans accompanied the pork well. The spicy green chile cream sauce in the pasta was delicious. The pasta had nice texture and the chicken was juicy with nice grilled flavor. Who would've thought tortillas would go well with pasta. Although, this was probably placed on the plate to hold the sauce in with the pasta. Well, we used it with the pasta was we would with a piece of garlic bread. The servings were large and enough for sharing and then some. 

The restaurant might be a little hard to find since it is sort of a "hideaway". We didn't have too much trouble since I did some homework before coming here. Thanks to our gps to locate which corner it was on, the reviewer that mentioned it was next to Lucy's to narrow it down to an area, and the online menu that I previewed prior to coming to find the front door of this place. LOL. We luckily pulled up into a parking space right in front of their door and I immediately recognized their menu displayed outside from previewing it online.

Must go back for brunch one day!
