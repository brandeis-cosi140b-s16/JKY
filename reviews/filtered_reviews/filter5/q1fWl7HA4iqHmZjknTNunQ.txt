This place has delicous Mexican food that not only tastes great, but is a great price! Ive been to soooo many places in AZ and nothing satisfied me...My boyfriend loved it the first time we found it that we went back twice in 1 day! Dont be fooled by the graphics on the windows with specials...its what's inside the place & what goes into your tummy that counts!!! Oh, yes! They have burgers here & theyre delicous too! Our favorite dish is the burrito bowl. So filling I usually only eat half of it. I also add the fresh guacamole (extra cost but fresh!)
