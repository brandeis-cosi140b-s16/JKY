I went to Cantina 1511 after noticing Eric K's recent review of this place on Yelp.

I can't believe I've overlooked this place until now. I'm a fairly enthusiastic consumer of Mexican food, and Cantina 1511 is the best I've had in Charlotte. I won't waste too much space reiterating all the great things that have already been said about this place, but I'd like to touch on the highlights.

The atmosphere is very nice--a little more upscale than your standard Mexican place. The service was friendly and professional--I was with a picky diner and they had no problems customizing her order. The food was obviously great, and I felt the prices were pretty good--dinner for two was about thirty bucks (without alcohol). 

I had the Barbacoa, and everything about it was excellent. Presentation was great, temperature was perfect, and taste was incredible. My guest had the enchiladas and was similarly satisfied.

Highly recommended all around.
