I had the Tres Leches French Toast and it could have came with more berries but other than that it was an excellent brunch item for sure. Some of the fluffiest bread i have ever had with French Toast in my life. Felt like i was eating a cloud. The whipped cream and the sweet caramel sauce on the outside of the plate made for an awesome combination of flavors. My GF had the Poached Eggs with the Black Truffle Hollandaise she loved it.
I can't wait to come back for HH and try some of their tacos.
