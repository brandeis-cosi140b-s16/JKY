The minute you walk in, you feel the intimacy, smell the pecan wood, the spicy food.  Richardson's is an entire sensory overload.  Highly Recommend.  I had the Red, Blue and White Enchiladas and they were excellent.  My finace had the pork adovada and it was quite delicious as well.  Richardson's is great for a date, double date or family of 6 or less.
