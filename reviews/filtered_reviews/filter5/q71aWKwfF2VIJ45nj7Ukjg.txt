I live all the way on the other side of town but always have to make the trip to eat here at least once a month. The menu has a wide variety of food from mexican to korean. I love both kinds of food so i think it's a genius fusion! They give everybody free chips and salsa in the beginning of the meal, and usually give orange slices at the end. The one thing i always have to order is the bulgogi fried rice. It's delicious and comes in a huge portion! I also always try to order something new and so far, i haven't ordered anything i didnt like. Luckily, everything is so cheap here, i dont feel guilty for ordering a bunch of stuff! Usually when a place has good food for cheap prices, the staff isn't so great... But not this place! The workers are always friendly and attentive, even when they're busy with every single table filled and more people waiting at the door! 

I highly suggest this place. It does not disappoint!
