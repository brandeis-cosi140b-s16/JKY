Delicious, fun and a great atmosphere. They don't take reservations so you just have to test your luck on any given night. It was my first time here for valentines and we had a blast. Having lived in Austin, I can really appreciate the mexican art inside and out. Also, if you are a tequila fan, they have over 250 to taste! Richard, the bar tender, makes it worth sitting at the bar if you have to wait for a table. The food is fresh and very satisfying. I recommend for a casual night or even a special event.
