Unbelievable! 5 star experience. Drinks were constantly filled, chips and salsa constantly replenished, salsa was on point. The veggie burrito my girlfriend and I each got was incredible and filling but not very heavy. Our server was brilliant, and out check was under $30. And not to mention this place is ALL atmosphere, what a trip! Can't wait to bring out of town friends here and show them a great phoenix hot spot!
