My wife and I had an amazing dinner her while we were in Scottsdale!  I highly recommend trying the Chorizo Fundido for your appetizer.  The staff was extremely friendly and the food & drinks were top notch!  My wife had a platinum margarita and I just had to try the Millionaire margarita (a must try if you can splurge.)   We will certainly be back next time we are in town.
