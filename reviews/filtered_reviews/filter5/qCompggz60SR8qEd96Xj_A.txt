I came to Blanco last week for restaurant week. With a name like Blanco, I was expecting a white type of theme.  Here is my breakdown:

Atmosphere: Blanco was definitely a very modern themed "New" Mexican feel.  There was a good crowd there for happy hour and quite a few dinner guests coming in.  

Drinks: We had margaritas and white sangrias.  I would recommend the pomegranate margarita.  You get some antioxidants, lol.

Food: Even before we get to the meal, the chips and salsa was amazing.  The chips were like Pita Style Chips and the salsa had a good kick, but not too spicy either.  We got the 2 for $30 restaurant week and 1 a la carte pork tacos.  We shared an appetizer of shrimp ceviche.  I usually like the halibut ceviche or white fish ceviche, but I was quite surprised how yummy this was with the tangy flavors I love in ceviche.  The 2 entrees were green chile pork enchilada and mahi mahi fish tacos.  I am usually not a big fan of pork, but it was flavored beautifully with the green chile.  The fish tacos were very light and flavorful.  The dessert was tres leche milk cake.  I was actually not expecting much out of the dessert since I was so happy and full from everything else.  THE DESSERT SEALED THE DEAL TO 5-STARS!  It had a creamy but light spongy feeling going down my tummy.

Service: The service also brought this rating up more.  We got great attention throughout our meal.  In the end, one of the guys who brings chips and salsa was taking my food away.  I mentioned I wanted a box.  I thought he was taking my food away to box.  A few minutes passed by, and I got the feeling her threw my food away.  I told the server what happened, and it looks like the chips guy didn't know English that well.  She brought out a brand new meal boxed up!!!

Overall, this was a great experience with great company!
