How did I wait this long to review Dilworth's new gem?!?

In short, I'm absolutely hooked on Bakersfield... to the tune of - I'm going every other week now!  The vibe is perfect for Dilworth and the menu is amazing.  Not only do they serve up the best tacos in Charlotte, they have a phenomenal Tequila menu.  That's my kryptonite!  It's a blend of California tacos with the warmth of cool lighting and wood inside.  During the warmer days the doors open up for an even cooler experience.

This particular location did not fare well in the past but I can guarantee Bakersfield is here to stay!
