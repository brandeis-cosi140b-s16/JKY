ate at koemx last year and made sure we would eat here again this year, we are from hawaii, so day after thanksgiving we had lunch here, last year it was a smaller location this is a larger restaurant they have two locations.  The fusion of korean and mexican is so genious they complement each other so well.  we had spicy pork, kim chee tacos, a large burrito with everything in it and the best nachos ever
and side orders of kim chee.  please open one up in hawaii so we dont have to long for the food all year.  this place is really a must try, we were served by the owner herself, the service was quick, clean, and prices reasonable, especially the portions are so large, you can try a variety of things and your bill will still be affordable, oh also tacos are only 2.00 dollars and you can have it with kim chee delicious.

hawaii people you will love this place it really reminds you of the cooking we are accustomed to here in the islands a real melting pot of different ethnic cooking,  just so comfy and delicious
