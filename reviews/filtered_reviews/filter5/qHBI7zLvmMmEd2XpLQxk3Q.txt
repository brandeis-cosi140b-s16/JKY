Chile Addiction gives the diner a great New Mexican cuisine experience and a great value, too.

I had the rolled carne asada enchiladas and my wife had the Frito pie.  Both entrees were delicious and the portions were quite generous.  The carne asada tasted fresh and not dry like some Mexican restaurants.

We do not get dessert at restaurants that often, but I am glad we got the fried ice cream.  It was coated with Rice Krispies and the ice cream was solid.

The atmosphere featuring southwestern and Native American decor was nicely done.

Our bill before tip was only $22.
