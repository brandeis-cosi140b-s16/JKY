We stopped in late night on a Wednesday. Staff was great - very friendly. Great margaritas. Tacos were above average and salsa and queso were both very good. Service was great.  The fifth star is because they have bean bags and a whole bunch of ping pong. Plenty of equipment and stuff is in good shape. I look forward to a rematch with JB from Chicago. Oh, and they allow dogs in the outdoor Area. You rock Paz!
