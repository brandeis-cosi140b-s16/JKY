I love fish tacos and I must say they make the best crispy fish taco. When I want Mexican food I want to taste that authentic in it and OMG that carne asada both me and my brother said it was the best tender meat spicy and sweet so good. I highly recommend the Mexican slaw and the crispy fish taco yum! I will be going back soon to take other friends and to have a hard drink ;) Thanks for the joyride!
