Since it was my birthday, I went in for the breakfast nachos which were unbelieveable!  Tender chicken fried steak strips with fluffy scrambled eggs and country gravy.  The wait staff, I believe it was Ally and Courtney, were so friendly and on top of making sure I was happy.  They gave me a sample breakfast taco with avacado, I'll order that next time.  I highly recommend as the food was excellent, the service was fantastic and the place has a real beach resort feel to it that reminds me of Hawaii or San Diego.  My new 2nd home.
