Okay this place is connected to a Homosexual bar. It's very entertaining actually because they tried hitting on me. It's a very busy place we were here Thursday night around 12am and the line was to the street and we got our food ate and the line never stopped. The weekend I heard is even worse. Everyone loud, drunk, and just hungry for some good tacos. I call them gay tacos because everyone's happy and eating tacos or whatever else they want to order. The line wasn't really that long if you have some company with you to talk. The prices are amazing 1 taco is 1$ so I got ten with some horchata which was amazing! I paid about 13$ but I was hungry and I can eat so I can't complain on that. This play is just an amazing place to go if you're drunk or have a couple of friends and want some Gay tacos! Love it I will be back 100%!
