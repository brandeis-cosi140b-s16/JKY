Just got back from Barrio Cafe a few minutes ago and I just have to say how much I loved it there before I fall into a deep food coma.

Guacamole. Absolutely adored this guacamole, because I love when there's, well was it pomegranite seeds or cranberries (?), whatever it was..it just makes the guac a little sweeter and gives it a different taste. It was served with really thick baked tortilla chips.
We accompanied this guac with a yummy sangria and my hubby had a margarita. 

Next, the Quesadilla Langosta Boraccha. This had garlic and tequila lobster on corn tortillas covered with Oaxacan cheese and another white cheese. The waitress couldn't be excited enough to have us try it, and I'm glad we ordered it because it was that good!

Cochinita pibil - the achiote seasoning really set this 12 hour  slow roasted pork off!

Enchilada del Mar - Oh-so-rich enchiladas with lobster, scallops and crab topped with queso de cabra!

Since we live so far, I decided to order the Flan de mi Mami and Churros Rellenos. 
Yes, we could not help but order dessert too because we don't know our limits. Churros are perfect! The flan was thick, the right texture, consistency, and flavor (just like my best friend's mom from Guadalajara makes it)! 

Since we came on a Sunday, they had a guitarist playing from noon until 2pm. He played all traditional classic songs on his Spanish guitar. It felt "just right" being there. I can see what all the hype is about! It is on the pricer side so go here if you want something extra flavorful and with a different edge.
