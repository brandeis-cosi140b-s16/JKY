Found this place on Yelp. We were looking for taco Tuesday specials and decided to give this place a try. When we arrived, it wasn't as busy so no waiting. The service was good. We ordered Pierna torta, Ranchera de Res, asada tacos and pollo tacos. Everything was delicious! We also ordered a pineapple fresca and strawberry fresa. The fresa was the best dessert I've ever had! Not too sweet which is what I liked and well worth the $5 it cost. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.
