i abso-fruit-ley love this place! The fact its just around the corner for me is awesome!

- The bean and cheese burrito with sauce is major noms. You can get it in the mini burrito size or regular size as well. 

- the strips ... Why didn't I try this in the first place?! I try not to get it everytime, but I must say simplicity at its best. Just tortilla strips, salsa, and shredded cheese. Never had anything similar that tasted so good. 

- other menu options I have tried is the chicken/been taquitos. Crunchy but very yummy. Also chicken tacos are really good as well. 

Overall this place is pretty good. It the only mexican place worthy to visit numerous times.
