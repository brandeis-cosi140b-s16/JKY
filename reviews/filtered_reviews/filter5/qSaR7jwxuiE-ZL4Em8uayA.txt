Came here looking for some Korean/Mexican fusion and KoMex delivered. As the sign in their restaurant points out, KoMex is not fast food, but this little hole in the wall is very much casual. This place is all about the food and my favorite was the calamari taco! Crispy panko crusted on the outside and hot tenderness on the inside. A little lime and pico de gallo makes it perfect. 

The bulgogi chimichanga was great as well but it had just a little too much cheese for me personally. I'll be back the next time I'm back in Vegas.
