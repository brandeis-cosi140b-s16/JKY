So that meal was unbelievable! This place has it all put together: fantastic food, healthy options and great service!

I ordered the half chicken w/ grilled veggies and it was great! The craft beer that was paired with it was good and matched the dish perfectly. It was a fantastic meal.

The service is really what stood out-equally as well as the food-which was awesome. They let me know when my food was going to take longer, why the wait was what it was. It was really helpful to have open communication.

All in all this place was fantastic!
