This place is the bomb! I went there yesterday with my family (first time). The two guys who were working there were very helpful. He gave us some meat sample to try and it tasted very delicious. We ordered the steak and Kalua pork burritos and of course, it was very good. The papaya ranch was an amazing sauce. I would definitely go back. Great customer service and the price was reasonable.
