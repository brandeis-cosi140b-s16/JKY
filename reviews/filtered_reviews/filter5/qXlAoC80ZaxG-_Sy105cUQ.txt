Taco Tuesday has a new home!  

Everything was fresh and very authentic.  I tried a few different tacos from shrimp to fish to carne asada.  Each of them cooked to perfection with some salsa that paired well with each of the taco fillings.  

I mean honestly...this place is awesome.  I keep telling myself that I will try a burrito (HUGE) next time, but me being a creature of habit will probably just have fish tacos again!  

Do yourself a favor, head over to Tacos Atoyac and BUEN PROVECHO!
