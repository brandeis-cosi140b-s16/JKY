Found this place on yelp - thank you Yelp!

It is not a place I would go to without the recommendation of others, but yum! I recommend the street tacos! $1.75 each and filling 4 is enough for a man two was more than enough for me! Pollo and pastor for meat (everything is in Spanish so ask questions if you like to know what you are eating. I got a mini quesadilla too but it paled in comparison to the tacos, will eat there again! Super friendly staff, I live supporting small kick butt businesses!
