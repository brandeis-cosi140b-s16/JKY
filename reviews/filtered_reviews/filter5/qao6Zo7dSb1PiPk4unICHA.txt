Excellent evening at Sol Mexican Cucina...  Host staff was friendly, we gave them a cell number and received a text within five minutes to alert us our table was ready.  Kind of a shame we didn't have the chance to do any window shopping in this upscale outdoor mall.

Our servers were friendly, informative and helpful with suggestions.  They introduced us to Baja style cooking and we were in for a treat.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant.  

We all loved their special Guacamole Sol.  Goat cheese, mango.... Yummy twist and so very delicious!

The Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche was also delish.  We came in on a Taco Tuesday (live music, street tacos) and ordered fish and shrimp tacos (both yum) and enchiladas (everyone in our party joined the Clean Plate Club).  

We ended the evening by ordering all the desserts on the menu (four) and sharing!  All were a hit with the exception of the Margarita Cake, (it was doused in tequila).  Duh. Should have guessed.  Oh well.   

We loved the Nachos Dulces, the Banana Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding and the deep fried banana dish, Bananoli. Way yum, we gobbled them up.

Can't wait for our next trip to Scottsdale, Arizona.  Spring Training, swimming, sun and Sol Mexican Cucina.
