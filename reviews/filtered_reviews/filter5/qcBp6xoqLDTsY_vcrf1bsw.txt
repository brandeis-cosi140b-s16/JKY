Look, I grew up in San Diego with family in Tijuana, MX. I grew up on these tacos! I've lived in other places that never had SoCal style Mexican food. Now I'm here and so are they and I couldn't be happier than pig in shit! I'm HOME!! LOL!
I've been to their original location in Tijuana, I've been to their ones in San Diego and here. 
I could sit here and write up a play by play action about ALL of their items. SO what I'm gonna do is just sit here and YELL AT YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I DON'T CARE AT WHAT COST. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS OUT OF YOUR WAY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T GO TO THE EAST SIDE. YOU JUST NEED TO TAKE YOUR ASS THERE AND EAT! EAT IT ALL. 

Welcome to my home!
