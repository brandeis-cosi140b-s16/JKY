I guess the only bad thing I could say about this place is that it is not closer to my house. The staff truly cares for every customer, not just the regulars. Both locations are very consistent. Food is always great. Best misters in town. And the choice of salsa is like no other. I met the owner a couple times and he took every word from my mouth to heart. I highly recommend this place.
