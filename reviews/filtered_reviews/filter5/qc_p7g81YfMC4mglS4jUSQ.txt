anyone who's either mexican or is married to someone who's mexican knows one of the world's great hidden truths: mexicans love chinese food. maybe it's the fact that historucally mexico has had a high amount of chinese immigrants (mexicali, baja california used to be 91% chinese) or maybe it's the fact that both populations have had a history of being used as cheap imported labor and then kicked out of the US (Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, here we come again!) but there's no denying that when mexican families go out for a nice dinner, there will be chop suey involved.

i think the owner of Chino Bandido is somehow in on this secret, and has exploited this to great effect. they figured out that orange chicken, refried beans, and fried rice do, in fact, go great together.

don't think too much about it, just go there and try anything. tell the person at the counter that it's your first time there, and they'll give you free samples.
