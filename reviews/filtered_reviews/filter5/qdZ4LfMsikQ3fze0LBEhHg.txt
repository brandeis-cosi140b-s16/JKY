This place is amazing I go there all the time for the tacos and they're amazed la chica flaca margarita! The staff is always attentive and willing to help out with anything even if your phone needs a charge. They are always holding fun events like taco eating contest and what not. If you're in the Scottsdale area you should definitely stop by for lunch or go later at night for a crazy party!
