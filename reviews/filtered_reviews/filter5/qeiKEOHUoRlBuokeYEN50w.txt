Still a five-star restaurant. Once again, I had the Nuevo Chile Rellano, and as I've said before it's the best Rellano I have ever had. Our server was Shawn, who earned my 30% tip for being attentive, intuitive, and added so much to our dining experience.  Others in our party had their favorite dishes and also raved about the quality of the food.

I believe that all the magic from the prior location has been transferred to the new place on Higley.  The old location has different owners and has been renamed with a soundalike to confuse the diner.
