Just went to Salsa Blanca, and I gotta say, it was good.  We got to meet Jenny (owner) and were impressed.  My wife and I ordered what we were told was a huge burrito each, but we had no idea how literal that statement was.  I got the Beef Super Burrito, and my wife got the chicken one.  It was the size of three Chipotle burritos, and it was less than 7 dollars!  We got them enchilada style with green sauce, and they were amazing.  we only finished a small portion and took the rest home.

While dining, our drinks were refilled and we got to chat with some of the staff.  It was a very friendly, personable, yet professional environment.  And I love that they have Pepsi products.  Working at a restaurant myself, I can say I am impressed with the service, food, and atmosphere at Salsa Blanca.

My wife and I will definitely be back, and bringing friends.
