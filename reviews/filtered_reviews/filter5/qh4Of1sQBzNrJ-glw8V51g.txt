When we were planning our trip to Vegas, my boyfriend knew one thing: we were going to go to Border Grill for brunch.  With an menu boasting an all-you-can-eat tapas and $5 bottomless mimosas, it really didn't take any convincing on my part, especially since we hadn't really ever been able to get to the Border Grills in LA.

The restaurant itself is contemporary looking, with big line drawings on the wall and an open feeling to it.  We were sat immediately on the outside patio that looks out over the Mandalay Bay Pool, not a bad place to sit at all.

Their menu is tapa style and you order the ones want throughout the meal.  I was determined to try them all, and got a decent way through the menu.  I think we could all agree the short rib hash was the most amazing thing we put in our mouth, but the shrimp and grits gave it a run for its money.  You also cannot leave without trying their churro tots, so make that part of your selection too!

The food was so amazing, and totally worth the price (especially because you're in Vegas) and add the $5 unlimited mimosas, and try all the different types they offer!  This is a must go to while in Vegas!
