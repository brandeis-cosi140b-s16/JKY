One of my favorite late night taco spots!

I love me some Mexican food, and this spot just happens to be a block away from where I work! The best part is its open really late on the weekends so when I leave the club around 4am I can get my fix of some of the BEST PASTOR TACOS (Adobada) I've had in Vegas. They have several different lines depending on the type of filling you want: Asada, Adobada, and then Lengua,Tripas, etc. and everything is prepared fresh in front of you customized however you like. You can even order off the menu like Nopales (cactus) which is also very good. They even provide you grilled peppers and green onions that you can munch while you wait. 

I would imaging being drunk as hell would just amplifiy the already super delicious eats here cause I always see a couple people I ended up having to kick out of the club there! Its really busy and loud at 4am and it always makes for a great atmosphere! They have security there too so even if you're scurred don't hesitate to come and get some great food!
