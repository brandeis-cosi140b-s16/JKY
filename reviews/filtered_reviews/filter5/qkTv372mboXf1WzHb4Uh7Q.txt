Thank you to Yelp for this recommendation.  The food was outstanding, especially the Duck Empanada with Foie Gras, as well as the Braised Short Ribs.  Sorry Gabi, but when I eat out, healthy food goes out the window.  Although the portions  on the plate seemed small, we were too full to eat dessert.
