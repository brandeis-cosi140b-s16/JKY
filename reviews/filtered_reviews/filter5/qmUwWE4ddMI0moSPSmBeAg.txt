Chicas caliente, fresh tasty food and awesome margaritas, per my husband.  Lol. Strong and tasty house margaritas.  I had half, and was buzzed, proceeded to pass the delicious other half to my better half. a
My husband commented on feeling his first margarita.  And he can hold his liquor.  Drinks legit!  To legit to quit! Haha. This place is pretty damn good.  The veggie tacos and chili relleno burrito are delicious! The accompanied red and green sauce are hot and flavorful!  Can't wait to come back! Thanks for the suggestion Lalo!
