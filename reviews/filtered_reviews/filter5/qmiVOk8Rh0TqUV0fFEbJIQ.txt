Luna itself great.  Especially for a chain.  I think I have 16 or so check-ins here.  Food is four stars but the service there is always great (I sit in the bar), which adds the extra star.  Their Mexican Pizza is REALLY good... really good.  Chips are always light and cripsy.  Their happy hour is top notch too.  Their house margarita has a punch, and I'm a big guy.  HH is 3-7 M-F and on Sat and Sun (I think from noon-6) also.  I'm a pretty big snobe when it come to mexican food.  Much of the menu is prettty standard with some stars mixed in.  Fundito is solid.  Green chili is a good one too.  I wish they would bring back the chopped tuna tacos.  They also have a special for check-in on Yelp.  

Special note to management (who is great) too.  Please put a rail for our feet on the back side of the bar  :)
