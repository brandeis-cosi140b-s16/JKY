located inside the Palms Hotel Casino, this is a gem of a mexican restaurant. Fun and festive without being rowdy. Everything is fresh, the staff is very nice. Plus they have a well stocked salsa bar and a wide array of cocktails. The prices were reasonable. If you find yourself off the strip and want a quick bite to eat or a great cocktail, I say stop in and check it out. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
