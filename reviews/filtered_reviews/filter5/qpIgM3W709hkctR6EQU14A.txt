This place gave my friend and I (after asking if it was our first time eating there) EIGHT samples to try!!
They explained the food is named after children-which I didn't really understand, but who cares it was SUPER SUPER TASTY!
I really like their asada, and I think its called chicken jade or something like that..but you can have ANY of the items made into a burrito, a rice bowl, or a quesadilla. 
It's pretty amazing.
I ordered #5 garlic chicken with onions and tomatoes the tomatoes were not really stewed more like they were baked with the chicken, nothing really overpowered anything it was a great balance between all the flavors, and on top of plain rice it was perfect!
Atmosphere is fastfood dining, and they have outdoor seating for smokers like me.  My friend ordered the Carnitas  on top of their version of fried rice, which has meat in it -giving the rice a delicious flavor - just engulfed the plate in a matter of minutes, it was THAT good!
Highly recommend this place, the items on the menu are extremely well thought out, the prices are amazing for the food you get -5.00 for a large plate!! AND you get your choice of cookie for desert..the chocolate one melts in your mouth, its gooey on the inside in some parts of it and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They brought our order TO us outside, which they didnt have to..As far as customer service goes, they are on it.
I would say it's on a gourmet level in a fast food wrapper.
GO!
*right now there is construction that obstructs the front of the place, but doesn't affect parking, which there is plenty of*
