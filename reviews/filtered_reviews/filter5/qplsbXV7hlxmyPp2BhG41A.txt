We LOVE Cafe Rio!!! So glad that we bought a house just across the street! There is nothing negative about this place. We LOVE the sweet pork ANYTHING. They make their own tortillas right in front of you. Everything is FRESH and made to order. We have had their tacos(TACO TUES...$1.50 tacos, 3 tacos w/rice, beans & drink $8!), the burritos bigger than your head(my husband & I share), and their SALAD..heavenly!!! ;) My husband & I have shared their salad too...the portion are very generous. The salad starts with a fresh made warm tortilla on the bottom(I suppose you can order without if you are watching your carbs, but I just can't resist!), then on top your salad is built. Have I mentioned their SWEET PORK? Mmmmm...I am hungry just thinkin about it! It can be overwhelming a bit when you walk in at lunchtime(especially on taco Tues.), but do not fret, the lines go fast and your reward at the end is worth it! Oh, & they are open till 10 during the week, and for a couple that work out night, the fact that this treasure is open that late in Gilbert/Mesa...I would add 5 more stars if I could! Can you tell we love, Love, LOVE this place!?! Go, you won't regret it! ;)
