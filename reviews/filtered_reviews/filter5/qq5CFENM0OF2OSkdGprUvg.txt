Eight of us went to lunch at this wonderful restaurant. Every plate was not only pleasing to the eye but to the palate as well. The portions were more than abundant and the service was excellent. There was even a singing guitarist that entertained us both in Spanish an English.  Every employee at this restaurant made sure to welcome us and make sure we had everything we needed even though we weren't in their area.  It's agreed that it was the best Mexican food in the area. A+ from our table.
