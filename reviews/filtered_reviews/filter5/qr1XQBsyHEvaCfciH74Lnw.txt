Phoenix has so many great destinations for Mexican food, but I have to say, La Santisima is amazing and authentic.  The salsa bar is stunning with as many as 12 varieties from which to choose.  The promptness of service at the lunch hour could be improved, but it is a small spot with limited seating.  About to go there for the third time...I think I'm hooked.
