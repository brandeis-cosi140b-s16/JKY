I've been here twice now with the family and have had great experiences both times.  When you walk in, the restaurant gives you a homey feel with couches and chairs, along with the standard tables for you to lounge and eat your meal.  Big screen tvs show the latest sporting event and a full service bar is available for those who wish to endulge.  A rep is there to greet newcomers to explain how the ordering works.  There are three different lines, depending on what you want - tacos, burritos, bowls or which meat you are interested in - al pastor, asada, etc...  Cooks carve your meat selection and assemble your order in front of you.  A salsa bar is available with a variety of salsas and pickled vegetables.  The taste is very authentic and flavorful.  Definitely worth returning!
