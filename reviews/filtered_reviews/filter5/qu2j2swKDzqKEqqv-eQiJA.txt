We live very close to "Dos" so we know the manager, most of the wait staff, and just about every item on the  menu.   On the weekends, Maria is the best manager if you have any issues or want to pay a compliment - she is great.  Ask for Isla as a waitress if she's working - she's the best.  Just about everything on the menu is worth getting except the red tamales (substitute the green corn tamale and you won't be disappointed) and the fish tacos can be a little light on the fish.  If it's the chef's special night - go with the special... usually, it's really fantastic.  The chicken enchiladas mole is really good if you like mole. It's all good - including the desserts.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you want good mexican food in a laid back atmosphere - and if the weather is pristine, you'll want to sit outside!
