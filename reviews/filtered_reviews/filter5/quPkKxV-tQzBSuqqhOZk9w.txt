I've had nothing but great experiences the few times I've eaten here. The Chinese and Mexican food have been tasty and I have never left unsatisfied. 

The fact that you can get so many flavors and dishes in one sitting is awesome. Drinks have been amazing too and this place has been nothing short of an adventure each visit. Thanks for the hard work you put into every dish and can't wait to visit again.
