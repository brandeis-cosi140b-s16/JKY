I eat here EVERY time I come to Vegas. It is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at and the prices are extremely good for Vegas. I highly recommend the "lil estiffy" it is incredible!! I love the vibe of the container park and the staff has always been awesome every time I come in. Hands down the best place to grab good Mexican food in Vegas for cheap.
