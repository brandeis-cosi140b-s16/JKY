This is by far our favorite place to go to in the east valley. The chips and salsa are always spot on. Plenty of margarita options but the house margarita is very good. We usually go in large groups and the staff is always very accommodating and the service is always top notch. I tend to judge a Mexican food restaurant by their ability to make a good chili relleno and they do not dissapoint. I always have a hard time deciding what to get because everything I have ordered was great each and every time. My wife and I come for lunch occasionally and split the nachos and we can never finish them. Nandos will remain our go to place!!!
