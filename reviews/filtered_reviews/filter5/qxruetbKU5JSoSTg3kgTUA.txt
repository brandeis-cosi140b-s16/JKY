This is hands down the best overall Mexican restaurant in The Valley. By overall I mean they have excellent family style food and your run of the mill Mexican favorite's, tacos, enchiladas and such. 

Great hot sauce and the best tacos I have ever had in the 10 years I have lived here. Love the family style seafood dinner as well. Great and friendly service as well!
