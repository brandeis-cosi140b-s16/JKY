A great place for vegans (and non-vegans) who just want to eat big portions of all-American Mexican food, watch sports, drink booze, and/or relax with friends. I'd go here super often if only it were on my side of town. This place is chill and down to earth, but with a good atmosphere. 
GET THE VEGAN NACHOS. Just awesome.
