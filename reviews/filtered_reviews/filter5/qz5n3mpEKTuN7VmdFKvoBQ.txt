Best taco shop in town hands down..I love everything I have had..Horchatta is amazing! I would say they need to get a bigger place..a little cramped at times..I am on the fence about this because it makes things seem more communial and neighborhoody. I tell people at La Condesa all the time. The owner recently told me happy hour everyday 3-6pm...$3.00 natural,organic margaritas.
