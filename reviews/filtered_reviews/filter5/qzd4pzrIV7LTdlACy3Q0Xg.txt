There isn't much about tacos that I dislike. Sour cream is one of those things. Praise the corn flour tortilla Gods that these guys have it together and only top theirs with goodness, and no sour cream. 

Stopped in here on a rainy 2nd Sunday, for tacos with a friend; I got 3, (sorry, I hate being a pain, but a girl wants what she wants) barbacoa, (lamb) el pastor, (pork and pineapple) and chicken (duh), with cilantro and onions. They were quickly prepared, and brought to my table. I also grabbed all three salsa options, and put them on the side. They were all used quickly! The El Pastor was probably my fav, it reminded me of tacos in Cancun on Spring Break, oh so many years ago! But the Barbacoa was good too, nice and flavorful. Chicken is chicken, but still, so amazing. 

Can't beat the deal, or the punch of flavor! Try a Pineapple Fanta while you're at it, you only live once, and it's perfect with the El Pastor taco! 

Happy Eating!
