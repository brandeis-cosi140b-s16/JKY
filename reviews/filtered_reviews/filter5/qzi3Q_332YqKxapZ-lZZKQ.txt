Comedor Guadalajara is probably one of, if not, our favorite Mexican traditional Mexican places.  We don't usually order the regular Mexican food you can get at any place, we tend to order their specials.  Those dishes might be a little more exotic than most people are use to, but they always leave us full and delighted.  When the Mrs & I go, we often get the Tres Carnes platter or order of the specials for dinner.  When my cousin  and I go, I almost always order the Tripas de Leche......nothing better!!!!!   I have never seen them on a menu anywhere else.!  Gotta try them!
