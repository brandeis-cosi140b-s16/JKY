If you're ordering drinks, I'd suggest sticking to beer rather than the weak margaritas. The food, however, is the main attraction and it is outstanding. The chimis are probably the best item on the menu, but if you're looking to not eat something so filling, try the chicken flautas.

Parking is in the back and the restaurant is also right off the light rail.
