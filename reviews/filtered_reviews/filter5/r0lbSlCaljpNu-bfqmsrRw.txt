Before I moved to Las Vegas, all I ever had was Taco Bell if I felt like eating Mexican food.  Then I had this and now I'm a fan of better Mexican Food.  Their menu is pretty awesome, really big pictures to show what you going eat.  Carne Asada Fries! Carne Asada Chimchangas! Oh My! That's the best, top it off with spices they have!  I love this place!
