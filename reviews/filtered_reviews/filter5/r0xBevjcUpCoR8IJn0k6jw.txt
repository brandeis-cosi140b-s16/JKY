This is my favorite authentic Mexican food in Old Town.  The shredded beef in any dish is spiced well and melts in your mouth!  Their refried pinto beans have plenty of partial beans in the mix so it's not just liquid beans like most restaurants.  Hard tacos and soft are equally delicious!  The guacamole is fresh, hand made.  They recently started serving La Victoria beer-amazing and made by the same company as Pacifico!  The only negative I have is that they recently changed their rice!  It was a bright yellow, traditional Mexican style.  Now the rice is a bland, watery type (A friend told me it's now a Puerto Rican style).  The back outdoor patio is very clean and decorated well-a couple of TVs show sports.  I'm very surprised the Yelp ranking is overall just a 3.  I've been eating in Old Town for 14 years and this is the first place I tell my friends to go for great Mexican food!
