Lindo Michoacan is the best Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. The food and service are excellent. I've noticed the service is not so great on Sunday nights, but on Friday and Saturday nights it is a well run operation. I recommend any of the carne plates. Also, the home made tortillas are incredible! I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food, trust me this place delivers. I drive across town to eat there.
