What a festive little gem this is. The best customer service and everyone seem genuinely happy to be working here. Fish tacos so yummy. Chicken enchiladas are unbelievable. Low rider margaritas very fresh and not all sugary. Music started and we all wanted to dance!  They have the food and overall experience figured out. Love this place!
