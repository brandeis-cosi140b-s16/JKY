Hint: Don't come here when you're hungry, if you have kids/a large group of people, or if anyone you are with is in a bad mood/ pissed off!
My family and I went on 4 th of July & it was an hour and a half wait for food! It was highly amusing (for me) to see people getting all crazy and in fights over waiting for tables and just being aggro over the loooong waits.

Yes, it's crazy-mad mayhem, dirty, & a pain in the ass to get a table... but it's a meal/experience you won't forget! 
Definitely go in with more than 1 person, because you have to wait in separate lines for different menu items!

You HAVE to order the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos! They were the best thing we ate~ we tried all the different tacos and the Carne Asada fries. I don't know if it's cuz we were staving or if it's really that good,  but we all agreed that the food was awesome (2 friends with us that night we from Mexico, & they confirmed that those Adobada tacos were BOMB!!!)!

So if the line isn't too bad and you're looking for some authentic Mexican tacos when you're in Vegas, this place is definitely a must!
