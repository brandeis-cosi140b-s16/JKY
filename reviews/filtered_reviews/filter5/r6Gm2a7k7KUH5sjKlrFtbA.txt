Perhaps the best meal we've had in years--excellent food, ambiance, and service!  Would highly recommend this place, especially if you're lucky enough to get Tim as your server.  He was warm and welcoming and very knowledgeable about the menu, plus he made some great recommendations to us as out-of-town visitors.  The food was amazing and so reasonably priced for the quality and presentation.  Favorites were the poblano grits, the white bean puree, and the grilled gem salad.  Even on a hot night, the back patio was comfortable with the massive fan they have set up, and the white tablecloths and string lights added a nice touch. Hope to be back in Scottsdale at some point in the future, if for no other reason than to eat at this restaurant!
