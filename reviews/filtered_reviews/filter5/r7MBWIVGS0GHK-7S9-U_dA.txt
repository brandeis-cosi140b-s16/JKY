My go to place for something quick to eat! I'm glad that it's right across from Bikram yoga because I'll usually pick some up after a hot & steamy yoga session! Everything is delicious especially the huli huli chicken, kalua pig & fish with a bowl of lettuce and seaweed brown rice and the pineapple verde to top off! The nachos were too great because the bottom chips are not covered with anything.
