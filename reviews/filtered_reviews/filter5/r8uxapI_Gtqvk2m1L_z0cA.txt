Amazing authentic Mexican food. When you see Mexican patrons in a place you know they got the real stuff. The guacamole is to die for. I also like their american options on the kids menu since my little ones don't eat mexican. The place is busy. Even on a Thursday. it will take a lot for me to go to another place after trying this one.
