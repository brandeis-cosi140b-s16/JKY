Had to try this place and I will definitely be going back! I got the Vasito de Elote which was just as good as on the Cobb!! It was an appetizer so the portion was prefect maybe 4oz.They make the guacamole at your table. It's different from how I make it smashed. They dice the avacado add everything and even pomegranate! Lime juice is freshly squeezed! I saw them at the bar squeezing it  for my micheladas, which was also good and only $4. Suizas enchilada- $15 The smell of them reminded me of my nanas homemade corn tortillas And the Tomatillo sauce on it was just the right spicy! I will def go again! All staff was nice and very helpful! We even bought a shot glass$3.50 and a T shirt$20.
