On our way back from Chicago, we stopped here for some Mexican food.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  I had the PLATILLO GUADALAJARA
Steak, refried beans, cactus salad (nopales), fried onions, pico de gallo
and a deep-fried jalapeño. Served with warm tortillas.  My fiancée had the ENCHILADAS DE MOLE Two corn tortillas rolled and stuffed with chicken or cheese, covered with our homemade
mole sauce, melted cheese and sour cream. Served with rice and refried beans.  My dish won some awards and found the cactus salad to be very good.  It was nice to wrap my own tortillas with steak, beans, and cactus.  I was concerned about the spice but it was perfectly fine.  She like her dish as well and we were full and satisfied.
