Super cute neighborhood, AWESOME atmosphere and decor with good looking people all in a great mood having fun.  Excellent service, beautiful presentation and a menu you just can't decide on because there are so many great choices.  Fun with a group, especially at the community table.  Fun upbeat bar.  Decor is cozy and dim but festive at the same time.  And on top of all this the good is EXCELLENT.  Highlights we're street corn with a special sauce that is reminiscent of thousand island but sweeter and zestier, yucca fries w tangy BBQ sauce, Caesar salad with a tex-mex twist, saucy short ribs, and pumpkin bread pudding to die for!
