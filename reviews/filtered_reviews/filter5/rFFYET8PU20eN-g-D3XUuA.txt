Wherever highschool and college kids hang out ot get lunch, I'm always going to check it out. They (the hs kids) are usually frugal (cheap) and want lots of quantity and decent-good quality. I had literally driven past this place a few times right when I moved into the neighborhood and missed it. I checked it on Yelp, but I was a little put-off by the overall appearance. Don't let it fool you.

Visually the place is right out of something you'd see in TJ, They say they put the money back into the food and not the building. You'll find old plastic lawn chairs and homemade wooden tables to sit at, It adds to the legitimacy of the business - you come here for the food and VERY casual setting. There has been a lot of construction on Power road, which has made access sometimes tough if you're in a lowered car. The parking lot is gravel/dirt. 

The owners and workers inside are so nice. I once bought a candy bar from her son who was selling them for a fundraiser. They are polite and never ever rude.

It can take a little bit of time to get your order, especially if they are busy. If you're in a jam for time- call it in ahead so it's ready for you. 

I have had California burrito, taquitos (rolled tacos), quesadilla, bean rice cheese potato (BRCP) burrito, fries and chips. I haven't had any breakfast burritos... yet.

If you're hungry, I would suggest the "Shack" size on the burrito size, as its well, duh, bigger. It's not Chipotle with-every-ingredient-possible-sized-burrito big, but its moderately big.
