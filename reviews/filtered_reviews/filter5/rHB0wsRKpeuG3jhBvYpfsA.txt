The most amazing restaurant ever. Employees are amazing nd the chef, off the hook. Chef Paco is the most friendly person ever. Takes the time to come to the table and talk to us and ask us how outer experience was. He cares about the customers nd that our standards are met. I am a very picky eater nd the food here is amazing. The tacos nd the The enchiladas omg!!! You must try the flan and tres leches. A restaurant not only is great when the food is on point, but when you have good service nd a amazing chef, you will definitely come back. I live in San diego and I will definitely be returning... if I could I would score a higher score. This is my 1st review nd I don't take the time to write reviews but this place deserves my time......
