Hecho en Vegas offers great happy hour specials (for being on the Las Vegas strip) and tasty Mexican dishes. 

The restaurant itself is appealing aesthetically, with bright colors throughout the entire restaurant. The seating area also opens out into hotel and casino, which is very inviting to those who walk by. 

Their happy hour is fabulous! I believe it's Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 5p-7p at the bar. Everything is $5! Guacamole, draft beers, Carne Asada fries, margaritas, and more. They also offer complimentary chips with red and green salsa. I personally love their red salsa, it's FULL of garlic flavor!! I could easily eat a whole bowl myself. 

The staff here is great, the bartenders and bar backs are so friendly and make the bar atmosphere fun. We've had Cesar serve us at the bar several times and he is phenomenal. The restaurant managers Curtis and Fred are wonderful too, they walk around the restaurant floor, engaging with the guests. They always check up on us whenever we go! 

I've been here quite a few times, mostly for happy hour and a few times for dinner. Their taco salad is enormous! The salad is tossed in a creamy dressing and served to you in the largest hard taco shell. Very filling and tasty. I've also tried their chicken fajitas which were magnificent and probably my favorite dish.

I would recommend this place for a fun happy hour on the strip. Great specials and great service!
