I was looking for a not-so-pricey restaurant for dinner and found this gem of a restaurant. I went with the Twenty-Vegetables Fried Rice with Chicken and I absolutely loved it. I'd even go beyond and say this is probably the best fried rice I've had in a long time! It did include 20 different fresh vegetables and they came stacked on top of the rice artistically. You mix it the way you like and devour it. 

I loved it so much that I returned for more next day!
