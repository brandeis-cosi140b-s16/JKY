Frankly, I think it's going to be hard to see anyone anywhere else after you see when it's done right. I was able to go to the soft opening of this place, and glad for the experience.

What I liked:

Great sight-lines from anywhere. The stage is a perfect size, height and shape. The room wraps around it. Good sound and lights. There were 10 people playing on stage and no difficulty fitting them on there! The bleacher concept is fab, and I like that some shows will have tables and chairs.

The bartenders, especially KC, were friendly and accommodating. I notice they don't have the pour limiters you see in a lot of bars these days. Kudos.

Front lounge is going to be a fantastic place to hang out even when there isn't a concert, and they're lining up some solid DJs. And food will come from Chris Bianco and Doug Robson? Yikes that's amazing. 

I'm so looking forward to my first concert here. Woo-hoo for the Crescent Ballroom!
