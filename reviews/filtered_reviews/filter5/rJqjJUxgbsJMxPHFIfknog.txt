Food is simply amazing. Ive eaten here several times and it is my favorite place anywhere in the country hands down. Last visit was yesterday and I had the short rib enchiladas and my wife had the beef fajitas. Mine was out of this world. The wife's looked every bit as good as it tasted. The beef was tender and very flavorful. It's more like a tex mex I'd say. How people rate it so poorly I don't know. Service was awesome. Make sure to try the salsa. It's out of the world good. Sammy hagar nailed it here!
