Went to Chayo for the first time last week and loved it. The cilantro soup is the best I've had. It's just a great spot to hang out and drink beer. 
I'm a local and have friends visiting, and went to Chayo for lunch so we could ride the wheel.
We also had queso fundido and carnitas tacos - both were delicious. 
Waitress was very friendly, too. I'm a local and it is just nice to find places that are laid back and fun on the strip.
