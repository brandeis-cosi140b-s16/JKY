First off - their margaritas are on point. Secondly, who doesn't love bottomless chips and salsa. Other than astronomical wait times on Taco Tuesday's, usually the wait isn't too bad. They have a convenient text message based waiting list/app which is helpful. One Busser in particular is AMAZINGLY INCREDIBLE at always keeping my water full (I drink a lot of water). If you're part of the world that's okay paying more than $3 on a taco - you need to try their delicious creations!! Free side with 3 or more tacos too I believe- which is also a nice way to have a full meal. It looks cool, it is cool, and they take good care of you! 

Good drink prices for happy hour!
