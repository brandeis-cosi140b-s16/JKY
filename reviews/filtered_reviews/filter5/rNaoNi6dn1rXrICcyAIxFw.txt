Chicken Tinga & Braised Beef Tacos were awesome,,hands down!
Salsa (charred habanero) was hot but delicious!  If you can't handle the heat, get the pico gringo. 
Staff was attentive.
A little pricey but worth the extra $.  Doesn't pay to waste your money for lower priced mexican food.
Architecturally, their building is very modern and unique and clean.
Would go again and again.
