Ah, Las Vegas... it  has never been a destination for me. I mean, I'd go rockclimbing at the world famous Red Rock Canyon (20 miles outside of LV), but always stay away from the seedy strip, despite its glitz and glam exterior. That is, until I discovered Taqueria Canonita. 

It was by force of circumstance that I was stuck in the Venetian, and being always hungry, I stumbled into the taqueria. Immediately, the place made this Texas girl feel right at home, the waiters and the chef were all hispanic and you can tell it was a tight knit group- like a little family. Everyone was incredibly nice, and their passion for food, and particularly Mexican food, showed. 

My waiter, Ricardo, recommended a number of his favorite dishes, just like (or as the case may be, better than) his father would make, he said.  I settled on the tasty Sietes Mares, and was very impressed.  When I finally met up with my party, we came back (just 4 hours later) for a second dinner. 

I specifically requested the same waiter, and he recommended more tasty options. My next dish (and arguably my last) was the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco. The pork was so fantastic, slow cooked so that it melts in your mouth when it hits your pallet, that I had a total food-gasm. The pork's complex, perfectly balanced flavors mixed with the cilantro rice, made me think I had died and gone to heaven. 

In the span of just over a day, I ate there 4 times (including three servings of the Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco). The staff was so amused by my reaction, that they gave me the recipe and the chef's e-mail address in case I ran into problems cooking it at home. 

Of course, I've never actually done it 'cause it takes 48 hours, and I lack the patience. Still... fabulous food, fabulous service, and they have "river side" dining. I surprised myself by saying... "it doesn't really get better than this."
