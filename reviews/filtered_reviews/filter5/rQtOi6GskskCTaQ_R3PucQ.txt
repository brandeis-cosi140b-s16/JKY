I had been to the restaurant here when it was the Mondrian....then for a brief period it became the Theodore hotel....now as The Saguaro it's new restaurant space is called Distrito. We rolled up here on a bike crawl last night-which was a surprise because usually this type of swanky establishment does not cater to our booze cruisin' crew. 
I was immediately impressed by the very cool (and colorful! the stark white is gone!) decor complete with gold sparkly tables, dia de los muertos skulls, and pop art style wall paintings. There was a different feel to the place too. No longer did you get the sense the staff was giving you the stare-down. It seemed younger, hipper, more fun and whimsical rather than upscale pretentiousness. 
We enjoyed some cocktails but the food seems like it's getting some great reviews! Definitely worth a try, it will change your mind.
