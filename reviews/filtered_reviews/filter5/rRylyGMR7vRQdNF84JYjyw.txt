You will not find better mexican food in Madison, that's a sure thing, possibly all of Wisconsin, maybe something decent in Milwaukee. This is the closest thing to the kick-ass mexican offered in Los Angeles. If you expect to be seated in a middle of the road white surburban scared of foreigners sort of way, you're way out of your league. Go back to Applebee's. This is a family owned and run authentic mexican joint. They know what they are doing and they do it well. I have found the tamales to be pretty awesome, the burrito is okay, the fresh salsa is amazing and spicy, I love the roasted jalapenos, of course I do that at home myself now, my wife likes the tortas. I've had the Guadalajara plate, which was pretty good. Try some things that you would not normally try, and have some new experiences. It might not be super duper fantastic to you, but then you know what you like and what you don't.

If you go to LA ever, try La Fogata's on Van Nuys in Sherman Oaks. That is truly kick-ass, the fresh salsa, the burritos, the tamales, etc. That would get 5 stars for sure, and compared to La Fogata's in LA, this place in Madison would probably be 3.5 stars. But I gave it 5 based on Madison, and what little quality food there is in Wisconsin in general, unless all you eat are brats and cheese, then you are in the right place! Go Badgers?
