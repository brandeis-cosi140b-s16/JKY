My wife and I enjoyed the fajitas with chicken, steak, and ham - delicious!  Can't believe we haven't eaten here sooner!  Easily the best Mexican food in the area - good flavor - solid - fresh - delicious.  Good sized portions.  Spicy FRESH salsa and FRESH fried tortilla chips.

The margaritas are excellent - wow! - one of the best margaritas in champaign and we like top shelf margaritas...

Don't judge the restaurant from the street!  Parking is sparse and seating is limited but the food and drinks are excellent!  Good service - fast kitchen.  

Hoping they open up a second location with an outdoor seating area - I'm picturing sitting outside in the sun with a pitcher of their delicious margaritas or a bucket of modelos on ice enjoying a skillet of fajitas!
