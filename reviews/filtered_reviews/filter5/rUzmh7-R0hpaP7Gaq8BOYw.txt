OMG we just ate here for lunch and were blown away by how good everything was! I usually get enchiladas when I go out for Mexican food and these were the best I've ever had.. Super moist, juicy chicken, amazing sauce, and melty cheese all over. Husband got a beef burrito which was super moist and juicy too. Rice and beans were great. Chips and salsa were perfect- warm crispy chips and just spicy enough salsa. Highly recommend this place!
