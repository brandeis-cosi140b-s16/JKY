It took me a while finding Dick's Hideaway.  It's nestled between some smaller businesses across the way from a strip mall, and I didn't see a sign over the door until I decided to get out of the car and find it on foot.  The doors were nothing fancy, and there wasn't an outdoor menu to check out, but I later figured after I had eaten my meal that if Dick's cared to advertise, there'd ultimately be lines down the block of people waiting for a seat at their three tables, or their bar.

Whether waiting for the good drinks, the cozy atmosphere, the amazing food, the kind service, or a chance to watch your meal being made over a fresh draught beer, there'd be people waiting.  I am thankful that Dick's is such a hard place to find, and even happier knowing it's certainly worth the search.

Dick's menu is strictly American.  Good American.  They only have one burger stowed away on three menu pages bristling with bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, roasted chicken and cheese steak sandwiches.  Just one burger, and yet I'd not want another to take the place of every other delicious option you'll find.  In fact, if there's anything wrong with the menu at Dick's, it's that there are too many amazing plates to choose from.  I ended up having half my drink before I found what I wanted, but the service was quick, attentive, and ready when I pointed out the cheese steak and watched it made fresh.

Sure, there are only three tables.  You can order food at the bar, if you're lucky enough to score a stool.  But I can't dock Dick a star for being a hard-to-get treat.  If there were more tables it'd feel too big.  It'd be louder, full of people who take the place for granted.  No, Dick -- keep it small.  It's quaint, personable, and OHMYGOD delicious.  If I was made to wait half an hour for a chance to enjoy a meal at Dick's, it'd be well worth it.
