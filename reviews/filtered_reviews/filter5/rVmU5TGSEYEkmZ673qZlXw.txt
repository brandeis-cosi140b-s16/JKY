Viva Las Vegas baby!

The Good. Location-location-location.  We are staying at the Golden Nugget and it was only about a 10 minute walk down Fremont Street to the location which is inside a very nice area called the Downtown Container Park.  This location houses cute boutiques, novelty shops and dining.  Let's continue with the Good.  The food.  It is a walk in and order go find a seat kinda place.  We walked in both I and my girlfriend ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans.  We each got the two chicken and one carne asada tacos.  Both of our meals were very tasty and as I mentioned came with rice, beans and chips.  The chicken was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The carne asada was delicious with minimal grissle like other places have.  My date is very picky about Spanish rice, but she loved there's.  Me, I am picky about my Frijoles and these were the perfect blend and seasoned well.  The chips were very good, thick, hot and crunchy.  Price.  Wow!  Was only $9.50 per plate.  Great bargain especially for Vegas over priced food.  Would go back again and again.

The Bad.  When I was done I hungered for more......don't want to be a piggy.

The Ugly.  Nothing ugly about this place and location.  The atmosphere was very family friendly with music playing and entertainment all around.
