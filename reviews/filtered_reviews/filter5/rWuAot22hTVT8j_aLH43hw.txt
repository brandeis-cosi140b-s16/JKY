I suppose truly this must not be for everyone, but as far as i am concerned, this is a great little chinese/mexican fusion place. Keep in mind the word fusion describes the food to a T. it is a wonderful combination of spicy and sweet and ... amazing.

Not expensive and at and so if you are looking for something different, then you have found it.
19th avenue and greenway and also a location in chandler.

give it a try

have fun, be safe and good luck
