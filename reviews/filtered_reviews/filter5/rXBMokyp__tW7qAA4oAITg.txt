I've been coming to this location almost right after they opened. I always enjoyed their food and service. After all these years, I keep on coming back for more! Jeanine was our favorite server until she moved to the Mesa location and now we have 
Christine who is always on top of her game!  A couple of  suggestions: Easy on the salt! you can always add salt to the chips. I assume most people like salty chips but If you decide to stop adding salt to the chips, announce it as part of a "healthier decision". The second suggestion is to have a mild salsa if your only salsa is going to be this hot. (I always put a sugar packet to make it milder). Your new additions to the menu are tasty and well made. Keep up the good work!
