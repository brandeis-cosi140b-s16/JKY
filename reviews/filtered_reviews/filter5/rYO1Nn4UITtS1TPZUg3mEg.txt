Wonderful Mexican restaurant in the Aria hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Cool ambiance with an amazing wood art piece design inside. The chips and salsa are so delicious. You will be asking the waiter for more! Delicious and tasty drinks. Tacos, enchiladas and rice are delightful. For dessert I ordered the flan. It comes with carmel on top, so scrumptious. Friendly and attentive  staff.  Sometimes there is a long wait on the weekends , so call ahead!
