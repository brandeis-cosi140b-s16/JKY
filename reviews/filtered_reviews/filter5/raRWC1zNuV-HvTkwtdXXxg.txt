I stumbled across this place as I was making a road trip from California to Texas. What a great find!! First look into the place, I was a little confused about what kind of food they served and what to order. I was kindly greeted by one of the cashiers and asked if I would like to try a sample of some of their items. 

Ended up ordering the Chinese Bar-b-q Pork and the Jade Red Chicken.

The Jade Red Chicken was amazing. For those who think that panda express's orange chicken is pretty good, this had the same kind of texture, but bumped it up a notch with their Jade Red sauce. 

The Chinese Bar-b-q Pork was average.

Plus, Guy Fieri has been and recommends this spot!
