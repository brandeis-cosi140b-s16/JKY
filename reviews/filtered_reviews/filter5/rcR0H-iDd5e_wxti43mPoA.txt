I've been here many many many many times and it's REALLY great food but I warn you, don't sit at the bar. The bartender who's name is "Juan" (not the owner) can't multitask to save his life. I waited 15 minutes and he never even acknowledged me or said hi or anything at all. There were only two people at the bar and I was one of them. He just stood back there making drinks pretty much staring straight down not caring about anything else. I asked to be moved into the restaurant because of terrible service in the bar and then on the restaurant side my order was taken immediately by my waiter as it always is on my visits. Customer service goes a very long way in my book and unfortunately that guy has none. They might want to tell him to step his game up or get rid of him.

UPDATE: I was served again by that same bartender last week and he was on point and very helpful, so maybe the first day he was just having an off day.
