Fantastic service and food!

My wife and I stopped in for a Arizona Southwest experience and we were both really pleased with La Hacienda.

It's in the Fairmont resort which we weren't staying at, but is very fancy. The restaurant seated us right away and even moved us from our first table which was very high traffic to a lower traffic area. I hadn't mentioned anything to the hostess or waiter, they just read my mind.

Our server, Julio, was super happy to see us. Not sure why, but he sure made us feel welcome there.

We ordered 3 dishes, we weren't crazy hungry. The fresh made guacamole, the tacos de puerco, and the empanadas. The guacamole was made table side and it was very good. Their chips and salsas were very good too. Not chunky but fresh and flavoful. The serrano chile in the guacamole gave it a little kick of heat.

They tacos and empanadas arrived next. The tacos were incredibly tasty. A two bite portion bursting with bacon and pineapple flavors. The pork was browned and cubed finely and the the salsa had bits of pineapple, yellow bell pepper, onion and some other deliciousness. Combined it was better than I thought a Hawaiian taco would be.

The empanadas managed to hold their own to the tacos. The pastry shell was perfectly cooked, delicate and crisp. The filling cheesy with bits of shrimp in there. Fantastic too.

They were all small dishes split between the two of us. We left sated and feeling like we had some amazing service. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale.
