This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for years.  Won't even consider any other Mexican restaurant.  The wait staff is superb, friendly and attentive. They remember you when you come back and don't hover over you and question you when your mouth is full.  My husband's favorites are their steak tips and chicken mole.  Both are delicious.  My favorite is the fajitas or the vegetable enchiladas.  I love their red sauce, it is not overpowering.  Their black beans are delicious, or you can get refried beans. The salsa has just the right kick and I can't get enough of it.  The quacamole is the best!  All in all a very cozy place with delicious food and friendly staff to help you.
