Well, I found The Stand on the web after searching for a place in the PHX area that might have brisket tacos.  The short rib tacos sounded equally as good and I decided to make the trek from N Scottsdale to The Stand.  Being a late Saturday morning, I expected the weekend lunch crowd.  

My eyes might've been a little bigger than my stomach, however I ordered two short rib tacos and one chicken taco and a side of fries.  To say the least, it was worth my trip to The Stand for the tacos as well as the fries that remind me more of Five Guys fries, however with much more flavor.  The manager, Miranda, came out to see how my meal was.  She stayed to talk for a second, noticing that I was a "newbie" to The Stand and she was very genuine in her conversation with me (not fake and "checking off the box with the customer" like a lot of other places).

In my opinion, The Stand is worth the trip from any part of town and I'll definitely be back!
