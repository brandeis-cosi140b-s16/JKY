Well I just got back from Elmer's and again as always their Green Hot Beef Burrito or as I call ity was out of this world. Here's a small little restaurant that the kids at Chandler high have been growing on for decades. Whether it's a Burrito ( My Favorite) Taco or Machaca you' never be disappointed. Filaberto's doesn't hold a candle to it and neither does any of the other chain slaughter houses in town.
