This place rocks! The food is quite different then the Mexican food I grew up on in South Phoenix. This place as become my all tie favorite Mexican restaurant. Food is great, the staff is awesome, nice and very friendly (they all seem to really enjoy their jobs) and the building itself is very clean. They now have a lifetime customer!
