My FAVORITE Mexican food in Vegas!! From the service to the food I'd give 5 stars all around!!! Everyone is always friendly and welcoming!!! 

I can't ever get enough chips and salsa and margaritas!! My mouth is watering just thinking of it! 

It's Soo fun too see the FLAMING fajitas being served to tables and the smell is to die for!!!! It can get pretty busy though so I'd recommend making a reservation if you're looking to go in the evening time, or try to catch a seat at the bar! It's a great family place but also perfect for a date night!!

My husband loves the chicken enchiladas with red sauce but my favorite is the Mulitas!!!! Although I prefer the lunch portion because it's a HUGE serving and I can rarely even finish one!! No worries, you can always take the leftovers to enjoy later at home!!!

Really no place compares in my opinion to Juans, it's just excellent all the way across the board!! Soo happy to finally have a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood!! Good job Juan!!! :)
