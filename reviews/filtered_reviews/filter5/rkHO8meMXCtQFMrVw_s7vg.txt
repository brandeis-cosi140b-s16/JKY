One word to describe this place is FUN! We had a groupon, paid $25 for $50 worth of food and drinks and plus we get to see the Treasure island pirate show from the inside, not outside with the crowd. The waitress was very nice, my husband tried to order the Tex Mex Tacos but she warned him about that dish and he changed to Baja Tacos. I ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi. Both were delicious. They also give out free shots if you answered correctly simple questions such as the name of some old and familiar tv tune, etc there were also girls going around giving us cool balloon hats. Try to go on groupon Now daily and get this deal before they are over. They sold out fast in the morning...
