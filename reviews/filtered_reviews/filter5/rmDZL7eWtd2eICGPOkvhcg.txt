I'm from Seattle. We don't have a lot of options for good, cheap Mexican food. Tacos El Gordo hooked it up with spicy al pastor-style spicy pork, rotisseried to perfection. They threw on some good onions and sauce and veg, some guacamole on the side, and even a cut of pineapple on top. Also got a carne asada taco, which was awesome as well. Service was friendly, prompt. 5 star would eat again.
