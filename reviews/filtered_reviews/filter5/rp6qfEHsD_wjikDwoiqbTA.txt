This place is my favorite food spot downtown and my favorite Mexican place in Vegas. Great atmosphere. Amazing service. Incredible food. Quickly served hot and delicious. I recommend the burrito. Can't go wrong with this place and a table overlooking the fire mantis on top of their "container." About a 20 minute drive from me but worth every mile and every penny.
