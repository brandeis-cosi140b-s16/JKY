I took my daughter who was visiting from DC and discovered this jewel of a restaurant!

Ordered the margaritas,quest, chips , and salsa and immediately knew it was authentic!  

It is clean no frills but friendly stomp sphere.

The tacos al pastor & chilies poblano a were absolutely delicious!

It is must visit when in the vicinity of the airport...just 5-10 minutes away!
