As they say never judge a book by its' cover.  Its' not a very posh place but the food is wonderful.  This is my new favorite burger place.  The food is delish, the service is friendly and the fries are soooo good also.

I have been told the milk shakes are wonderful also.  That will be the next thing I try.

You have to try it.
