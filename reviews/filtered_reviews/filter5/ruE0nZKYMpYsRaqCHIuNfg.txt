Delicious! Everything was amazing...beans, rice, shredded beef tacos, cheese enchiladas, shrimp enchiladas, tostadas, margaritas, shrimp cocktails, salsa,  chips, customer service, wait staff.. Everything was great. Absolutely no complaints. First time here for my husband and he already wants to come back!
