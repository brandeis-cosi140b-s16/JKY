We visited Abuelo's in January and just did a return visit.  This time there were also six people eating.

The best part of the whole meal is the Guacamole dip.  That was fantastic and I would even go back just for that.  I love the choices of their "papas" and also the charro beans. 

Service was great and again, we would definitely return when in the Chandler area.
