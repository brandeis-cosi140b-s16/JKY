I've walked by several times and always wanted to go in. Had great service from my waiter Doug who was a wealth of suggestions.  My new favorite drink is the white peach hybiscus margarita.  Not over the top but just perfect after work.  This place had a great vibe,  awesome staff with great training and knowledge. The management staff doesn't just stand around,  they get in and help out and let the staff be awesome and friendly.  We will most definitely be back again and again!
