Organic Margaritas?  That means I drink all I want and I'm being healthy.  I have had mahi mahi tacos all across this land and they have hit it out of the park.  The steak tacos came in a close second.  All in all this is the real deal, I'm still thinking about those drinks and that meal.  The foodie knows.
