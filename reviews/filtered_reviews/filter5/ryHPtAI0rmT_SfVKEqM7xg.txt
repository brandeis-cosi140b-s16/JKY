This was stop two on our East Charleston taco trek.  At Los Tacos, you order at one of the registers and your number is called when your order is ready.

I ordered a carne asada with everything.  The thing that distinguishes this taco place from the others is that they use two thin tacos, but one of them has been grilled a bit longer so you get a crunch along with the soft taco.  It's quite a nice contrast.

With the asada with everything, you get whole beans, guacamole, pico. chopped onions, and sour cream.  It is pretty much everything you'd want.

I also ordered a cantaloupe agua fresca.  Wow, what a really refreshing drink and a good accompaniment for the food.

There is a patio here and we could have gone outside, but we pushed some tables together and the 10 or 12 of us sat at a long table except for Roger T. who was at a separate table with his kids and some of his family.
