My fianc√© and I dined at Mercadito not long after it's opening so I went in under the assumption that there would be some kinks that would need to be worked out, but that was definitely not the case. The staff was super friendly and our busser was very attentive. 

The food was excellent (definitely try the guac with bacon... Mmmmmm bacon....). Enchiladas were hot and flavorful. Cocktails were great and the chocolate cake lava dessert? Fantastic! I'll be back!
