I've been to several different cafe rios in California and utah. This one is no exception! Food is on point and delicious!! 

I got the pork salad and queso and chips today and they were both amazing!!

Love how they make quesadillas for the kids for free!

Right now they have a coupon for buy one get one free salad or burrito until the end of the month! You can find it online!
