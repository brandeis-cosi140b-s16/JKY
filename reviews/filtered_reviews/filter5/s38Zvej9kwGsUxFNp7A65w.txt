I stopped here on a recommendation from a local while I was on a business trip in the area. Wow! The tacos were fantastic. I had the pork shoulder and the black-eyed pea. The pea one was full of creative toppings (savory seasoned rice crispies, goat cheese crema--I don't even like goat cheese), and the pork had a perfect, sweet flavor. I'm only in town for a few days, but I may return.
