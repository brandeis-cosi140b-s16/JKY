I'm a little stingy with the five star rating, but three words describe how I feel about Gallo Blanco: "F*ck yeah, Jesus!"  I eat at Gallo Blanco at least twice a week, and I think they serve the best tacos and tortas in Phoenix.  Hands down.  On this past Monday night, I went on a taco bender and ate nine tacos in a row - three cochinita pibil and six carne asada.  I really couldn't get enough of them.  And they have Negra Modelo on tap; I don't know why I ever eat anywhere else.

Gallo Blanco is a Mexico City style taqueria, and based on my visits to the D.F., it succeeds in its authenticity.  But Gallo Blanco is also a pretty cool place to eat in good ole Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A.  Good food transcends ethnic boundaries.

While the tacos are delicious, Gallo Blanco is more than just tacos - a standout on their menu is the elote - a cotija cheese and paprika spiced cob of corn.  And the guac; where to start with the guac . . . whoever came up with the recipe was a culinary genius.

Did I mention that Gallo Blanco is a great value, too?  Their chorizo and egg breakfast weighs in at an easy-on-the-wallet $5.00.  The tacos hover in the $2.00 price range depending on the ingredient.  Dinner for two, with drinks, can be had for a very reasonable price tag.  Even the drinks are kick ass: I had the opportunity to sample Gallo Blanco's margarita ($7.00) one Thursday evening, and then Barrio Caf√©'s "Cadillac" margarita ($12.00) the next day.  Edge: Gallo Blanco. 

Here's a tip: try Gallo Blanco's chilaquiles for breakfast.  Chilaquiles are best described as "breakfast nachos;" they are basically corn tortilla pieces cooked in salsa, and sprinkled with cheese, served for breakfast with eggs.  They're very popular as a breakfast in Mexico, and I think there's a good reason for that: they're damn tasty.
