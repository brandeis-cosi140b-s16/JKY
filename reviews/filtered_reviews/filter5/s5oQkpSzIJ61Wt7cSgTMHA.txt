This is a go-to for us. Whenever anyone is visiting from out of town, we take them to this spot. It feels local, it feels clandestine at times, it feels authentic. 

Wine list is stellar and I have never had a wine there I didn't like. I mean, I have never really had a wine anywhere I didn't like, so take it for what it's worth.  Pretty decent beer list and the martinis and margaritas are solid. 

Food is consistently one of those meals you are still talking about the next day. Went there recently with a group of 6. Roasted garlic as an appetizer? I was hesitant, but it was subtle buttery goodness that we all raved about. The carne adovado is a classic, never go wrong dish to order for dinner that a few people got. I typically order one of the fish specials and they are always creative dishes with an interesting sauce option. This time I got the seabass which was cooked to perfection and swimming in a chipotle orange sauce that I could've poured over anything (and everything) which I did with the accompanying vegetables. 

Not a place for kids-- in fact, I don't think they even have high chairs, so its a date night kinda place. Good news is-- if you didn't bring your kid, you aren't stuck next to another kid anyways. And I have to appreciate that.
