Kevin Sousa truly is a gem.  The combination of ingredients in the tacos is totally unique. I guarantee it will blow your mind.  The wait for the food was a little long, but we were occupied with warm tortillas and two kinds of homemade salsa.  I ate a tofu taco with red curry, edamame, yams and some other ingredients I can't remember. It was spicy and delicious.  My other taco had wild mushrooms, greens and roasted red peppers.  Both were as colorful as they were tasty.  The atmosphere is very simple but sophisticated and the drink selection is excellent.  Paying $4 or $5 per taco is a pretty awesome deal and I was plenty full after 2 tacos and plenty of chips and salsa.  I can't wait to go back and try more!  As a vegetarian, I was also pleased that I had more than one or two choices.  I say Yay Rita!!
