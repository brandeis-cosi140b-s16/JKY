I came here during lunch and was expecting your typical Mexican food. I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. The portions were huge, I got the enchiladas and they could have fed two people easily. The meat was also very savory and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to get a bite in container park. The water melon juice was also extreme delicious.
