I drove from the Strip location here after realizing they moved to this address. I got there around 9pm and there were no tables to sit and the lines took up the whole business. Needless to say, it was like the darn tacos were free! I saw a ton of people dressed up and I wondered if this was a pre and op clubbing spot to get grub at? Personally I wouldn't want to show up at the club smelling like onions but apparently tonight were the Latin Grammys. Here I though going to El Gordo was a new prom tradition but I hear it gets crowned at night regardless of the day. I can totally see that given the tacos are delish. Let's start with the Adobada or Al Pastor as I know them by are one of the most popular kind of tacos in Mexico. Right away you will see this huge trompo roasting with delish meat sliced right into a warm tortilla a "Taquero" artisan can prepare for you. I specially love how El Gordo serves them with a signature avocado crema sauce besides the all trimmings of onions, cilantro, salsa and if you're lucky and there's still some left, a slice of roasted pineapple usually dripping juices onto the meat at the top of the trompo. 

There will be another line for different kinds of tacos. My favorite believe it or not are the beef tongue. The meat is not chewy and nasty as people would imagine. It's meat that's as soft as American BBQ brisket, falling apart tender. Try suadero, those are soft chopped meat and usually the 2nd most popular taco consumed in MX. 

Finally, the 3rd lane is reserved for specialties to include sopes and chorizo. I don't particularly enjoy chorizo, I like 
longaniza and this chorizo is a bit over condimented. Everything else deserves a 5 star. The tacos are on point!!!
