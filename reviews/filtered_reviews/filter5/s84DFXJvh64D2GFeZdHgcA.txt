Came to Las Vegas for a conference. This gave me the opportunity to try Frijoles, which I heard about from the video blog "The Trejos", which is hilarious. We have some good Mexican food on the east coast, but this, this was something else. Each dish had a hint of east coast Mexican, but the rest of the favors were like nothing else we had ever tasted. 

The small tacos were only a few bites, but each one was bathed in a rich, red sauce. The carne asana was full of beef flavor, even in such a tiny taco. It was full of additions I couldn't even recognize, but all the favors pulled together to create a party in the mouth. 

I got the shrimp quesadilla for my main. It cost something like $6.50, and was so big I had to take half home. The shrimp were big, and bathed in some kind of creamy sauce that I don't have words for. It contained veggies, guacamole, cheese and I don't know what else, but I didn't care because it was delicious. 

To top off, Arturo, the video guy came over and chatted. He was funny, delightful, genuine and truly interested in us. I hope this restaurant takes off; Las Vegas is lucky to have it.
