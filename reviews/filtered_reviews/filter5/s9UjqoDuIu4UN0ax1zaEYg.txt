In spite of the fact that I wrote a scathing review of Viva Mercado's shortly after their reopening in their newest location, I'm revising because Bobby has made sure that positive changes were made.  

The food has greatly improved since my early 2014 review. It's just like I remember it if not better, and I'm back to ordering on a regular basis again. 

I'm glad I didn't give up on them because they do listen to their customers' concerns and I thank them for that.
