LoCo is always a great place to go! It's one of my fave TT spots! The crunchy fish tacos are my fave along with the salt & pepper wings! All the bartenders & waiters/waitresses are prompt and very nice. They have a ton of TV's so if a game/fight is on you want to watch just ask. Nice new seating outside with a fire out. Inside can get really loud. I frequent here often with friends!!!
