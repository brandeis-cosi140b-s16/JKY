DELICIOUS!! Our first time in today and we loved the food and service. I had chicken fajitas with refried pintos and every bite was dreamy!! My husband loved his soft chicken tacos also. The beer was cold and we arrived right in the happy hour zone. It was a 5 star restaurant (in terms of enjoyment, not a fancy 5 star) and our server, Dodie, did a great job too. It was a bit of a drive for us but we will be back for the food!!
