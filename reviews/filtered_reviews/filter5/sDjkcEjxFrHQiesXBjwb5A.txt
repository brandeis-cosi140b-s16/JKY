I heard of this place word of mouth. I decided to go. As i pulled up, i thought it looked like a dump. I was already there, so i might as well go inside. Complete game changer. Its done nicely.  The food was amazing and well proportioned for the money. Its not expensive, its about average.  I like that the waiters are all in a tip pool, so they help each other out. When you get service like that, you wont be waiting for your waiter to get help. Its a great place, great environment, and great food. Finally, i have a true fall back place if i cant think of anywhere else to go!
