Best Mexican food in the valley, hands down. Excellent happy hour in the cantina after 3. 

I was back about a week ago and noticed that Valle Luna has undergone a slight facelift on the restaurant side. It seems like maybe some of the menu pricing has gone up to compensate for the new decor, but not sure about that. Either way, still great food and worth the price!
