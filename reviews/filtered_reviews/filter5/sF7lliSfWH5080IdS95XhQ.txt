I went here last night for a friends birthday . He rented out a cabana which was awesome. Our waitress was extremely friendly and hot btw! We never had a empty drink in our hands. There was about 15 in our party but she stayed on top of the drinks which I thought was impressive. Also they have a girl walking around selling cheap shots. This place was a experience that I would suggest you doing at least once. I know I will continue to come here even if I'm not renting a cabana. Very fun atmosphere.
