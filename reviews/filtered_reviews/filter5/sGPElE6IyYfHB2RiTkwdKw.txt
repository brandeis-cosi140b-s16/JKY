Had a wonderful experience.  Great drinks, great food and the best is LIsa!!!  She is a breath of fresh air.  We had a Groupon (fantastic savings) and enjoyed everything - from the table side fresh made guacamole to the Mexican apple pie and everything in between.  (including yummy Sangria and mojitos)
