I stopped on way home to pick up dinner yesterday after a pretty bad day. Bought tortillas, and quarts of hot sauce, green chile, machaca and beans. I had everything in a box. As I went to put everything in my truck, it all spilled in the parking lot. Instead of crying, I went inside to ask for something to clean up the mess I created. They cleaned up the mess and replaced all of the food I dropped without charging me. They did not have to do this and I was very grateful since it was my mistake. Not only is their food some of the best Mexican food in town, their staff and management are awesome. Thank you CAROLINA'S for making my day!!!!!
