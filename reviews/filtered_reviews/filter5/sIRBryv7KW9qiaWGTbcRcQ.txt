This is a new Vegas tradition for us. Found this place off-strip on our way out of town and decided to try something new.

We ordered a buffet fit for kings, bulgogi burrito, bulgogi and kimchi nachoes, stir fry, wontons. Yum. The food was delicious. I don't think you can order the wrong thing here, it's all good.
