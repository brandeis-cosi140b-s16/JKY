We had a wonderful experience here. Everything was just perfect. Excellent service, great food and a fantastic ambience. 

I ordered the beer battered fish tacos and my wife got the Diablo shrimp. The shrimp was just too good. Couldn't resist having it though it was super hot/spicy.. I highly recommend this place and will come back for sure when I'm in Vegas the next time. It is way better than the overhyped buffets at all the casinos.. 

Additional stars for the excellent service.
