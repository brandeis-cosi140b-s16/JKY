This taqueria serves up some of the best street tacos ever, and definitely in town. Stopped here over the weekend with some friends who had been before. The prices most definitely can't be beat; I got 2 tacos, a mini carne asada quesadilla and water for $5. The carne asada was flavorful and the toppings just added to the flavors. 

The location makes for some great people watching and the workers are friendly. If you're in the area it's a definite must-stop for some yummy Mexican favorites.
