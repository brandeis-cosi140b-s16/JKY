The food here is great! We had the nachos, beef tacos and sabana de pollo. It was so good and great service! I still can't get over how fresh and tasty the chicken dish was (all were), the chicken was pounded flat and everything was tucked in-side next to this beautiful black bean mash. Had the patron watermellon drink-yummy!
