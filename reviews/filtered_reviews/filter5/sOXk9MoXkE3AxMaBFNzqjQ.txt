Believe the hype!!!
It was my first visit to KoMex Fusion today and it is already in my top five Vegas restaurants. I am seriously smitten! 
We tried the chicken fried rice, tofu fried rice, the beef tacos and the bulgogi nachos. The bulgogi nachos were the stand out, but all four dishes were insanely good. Like, dream-about-them-for-days-until-you-finally-give-up-and-go-right-back-to-KoMex-again-good.
Baby-friendliness rules my world and Komex definitely has it. Our waitress was super quick with a high chair, was very careful about placement of the spicy salsas (all three of which were excellent, by the way!) and even engaged my baby in sign language when she saw us signing with him. Awesome!
Don't hold off any longer...and don't keep KoMex stashed in your yelp bookmarks for even one more day...just go!!:)
