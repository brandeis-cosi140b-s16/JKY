Homemade tortillas? Check. Delicious burritos? Check. Dirt cheap food? Check. Carolina's is all that you can want from a Mexican taqueria. The outside of the restaurant doesn't look like much, but walk in here during lunch and you'll witness a cross-section of Phoenix society - old and young, black and white, rich and poor. People of all different walks come here to enjoy the food, and it takes just a few bites to understand why.

My favorites are the red and green sauce burritos and the chorizo/potato burrito. They sell for under four dollars, but they are rather small (think Taco Bell-sized burrito rather than Chipotle size rotund burrito). You can make it a meal with rice and beans for a little bit more. In terms of beverages, I was skeptical of the horchata being dispensed from a fountain drink machine, but it's actually very good. I definitely filled up my cup before leaving to take on the road.
