Best Mexican food!  My favorite is the carnitas quesadilla w/ a side of baja sauce. The baja sauce is amazing! It is a cream cheese/jalapeno sauce. Your taste buds will thank you for trying this. I actually used to work here years ago but I still go here to eat all of the time! I am telling you all that I used to work here b/c when you work at a restaurant you see everything that goes on behind the scenes. While I worked here I never saw anything bad. Everyone washed their hands, everyone had great personal hygiene and everyone helped each other out. We were like a family; I loved working there. I gained about 10 pounds while I worked here because the food was just fantastic so I always ate there. No matter what your diet is they have something for you. From salads & calorie watchers, to vegetarian, to meat lovers, to I don't care how fattening it is I'll eat it! There are Macayo's all over the valley so go find one & enjoy their wonderful food. OH and they have amazing drinks too! Their margaritas are delicious.
