Best street tacos that I've had that aren't from KC! Nice to know there is a place that truly has authentic Mexican tacos and they stay true to that! Shout to the night crew especially Rico and Angela! Ya'll made my tacos de pescado THE BEST I have had in a very long time and I am an avid eater! My friends if you are ever in on Las Vegas strip check them out! The two dollar tacos are WAY under priced for the quality of food you get! Shout to good food, good people, and great atmosphere!
