I just finished another delicious meal at America's Taco Shop in Old Town Scottsdale! The have the best bean & cheese burros I've eaten, and I'm a burrito connoisseur. I appreciate the fact that their burritos are made lard-free and no pinto beans. And the staff is friendly and hardworking. Special shoutout to Connie--thanks for the great service!!  I Highly recommend this family-owned business!!
