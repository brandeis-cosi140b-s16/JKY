Best Mexican food we've found so far. Great bakery, sometimes they have trays of what I call Mexican sliders. Small round sandwiches, one has ham, a sliced jalapeno pepper, and shredded cheese. If you order the fish dinner it comes with the head on. Very tasty. Meats you won't find anywhere else, cabeza, lengua.
