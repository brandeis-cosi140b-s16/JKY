The food is really fresh and delicious, but you'll find yourself bumping elbows with your neighbor a lot if you get caught in one of their periodic mealtime rushes. Their kitchen is larger than their dining area. There is also no bike parking here at all, but even that cannot dissuade me from repeatedly patronizing the best Mexican restaurant in town. They are vegetarian-friendly! Try their delicious corn smut! 

Maize, if you are reading this: Get some bike parking! Seriously.
