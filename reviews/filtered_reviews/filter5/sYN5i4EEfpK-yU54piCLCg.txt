Finally they opened this place up in Henderson on Horizon & 95 and this place is awesome.  

No matter what your taste, meat eater, vegetarian, they have something for you.  The food is awesome, the drinks are plentiful and the staff is very friendly.

We used to stop at this place on Rainbow & 215 and it is great that they finally have one on this side of town.  If you have never been, you need to go.  The food is great, the prices are right and they also have gaming and a bar for the drinkers and players.  This place is a must to try at least twice....
