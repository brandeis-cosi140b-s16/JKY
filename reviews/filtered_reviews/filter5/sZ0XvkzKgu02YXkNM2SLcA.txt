WHAT'S UP COLLEGE?  THis place was the FAVORITE when I was in school at Carnegie Mellon.  Given that was nearly a decade ago, and who cares that I'm reliving my youth through memories of a kickass restaurant, I still think this place kicks ass.  And I'll kick the ass of those who don't.  (fine, I won't).

Seriously Mad Mex was a place that was known for its after 11 "half price food" and kickass drinks.  I remember a night with my friends where we sat across from a table of girls that were more interested in each other than us, we ate a shitload of food with habanero sauce on it, and we drank a lot.  College was exactly that.  The observance of women, the ingesting of food, and the imbibing of beers.  Awesomeness that I'd love to repeat.  Daily.

Just go there and love it.  Don't debate its qualities of food or its noise-issues.  Just love unconditionally like a dog.  I do.
