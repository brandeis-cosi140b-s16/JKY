I was thrilled that V.M. had reopened. We had dined at the former occupant of the location and it was horrible. My husband ordered the fish tacos and I had the Chile Colorado. Neither disappointed. The chips were fresh, the complimentary bean dip yummy and service was very good. The waiter understood that I was gluten-free and was happy to accomodate my needs.
