I held my wedding reception at Taco Guild and it could not have gone any better. The ambience is unique, fun, and the set up lends itself to easy conversation. This was the atmosphere we wanted for our event. Athena is the event coordinator and she worked tirelessly to make it easy and perfect for us. They were able to give us everything we wanted to have the event tailor-made for us. We were able to display our wedding photos on two big screen tvs. The food is gourmet tacos, incredible margaritas, and everything is very fresh and delicious. Everyone had a blast. I couldn't recommend this more highly.
