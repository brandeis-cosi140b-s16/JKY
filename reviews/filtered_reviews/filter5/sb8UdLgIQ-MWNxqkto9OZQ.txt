Amazing tacos in Vegas? Seriously?  Didn't see that one coming. 

I meant to hit a cheesesteak place (which has closed down) and something looked appealing about this place.  
Grew up in L.A. and Arizona so have had TONS of tacos and this place has suddenly rocketed on to my top 5. 
The tacos are the way to go. Great tortillas, good fresh salsa bar and some of the best taco meat (asada, al pastor, pollo) that I've ever had. The Gran taco has extra "stuff" on it and worth trying. 

Next time I'm trying the Vampiros and a few other different meats. For a place just opened 7 months, this place has figured it out pretty quickly.
