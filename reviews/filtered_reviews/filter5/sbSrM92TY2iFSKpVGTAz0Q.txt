We had the fajitas for two, oh yeah! Perfectly grilled caramelized juicy goodness. Tons of food, definite doggy bag treat for lunch tomorrow. There's plenty variety on the menu to choose whatever you're feeling like. This is the best Mexican food I've had on the East Coast, no doubt in my mind. Quite clean and the patio gives you that dinner-on-the beach
-while-you're-still-in-your bikini feel. 
The place started filling up at a good pace after we drove in at about 12:30, so the employees stayed very busy. People seemed to be enjoying the food and atmosphere. A true laid-back, delicious pleasure!
