The good was fresh and delicious!  Te service was exceptional. Our server, Sandra, was very polite, informative, and friendly. My wife and I both had the Loaded Carnitas Burritos Enchilada Style and it was amazing. The flavors were explosive and the texture of the meat was spot on. We started with the Guacamole and Salsa and ate it all! If you're in gate A check them out!
