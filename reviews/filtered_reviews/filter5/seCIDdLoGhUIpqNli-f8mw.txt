Wow.  The perfect combination of creative and authentic.  Small, funky, hip and intimate.  Great service, killer ingredients, and a fun atmosphere.  We literally loved this place; oh, and we are serious foodies.  Guacamole was a fresh spin on a classic, yet truly scrumptious.  We devoured it.  Tacos - slow roasted Mayan pork - were crazy delicious.  The serving was 4, with double corn tortillas, so I divided them and made 8 tacos - holy mackerel, they were good!  My wife won the Mexican food lottery, however: Chile Relleno Nogales or something like that.  It was sweet and spicy; a chile stuffed with cheese, fruit, nuts, and lightly layered in a sweet, nutty sauce.  Literally the best Mexican dish I've ever tasted (including in Mexico itself).  It combined the best of savory and sweet.  We didn't leave a single morsel on the plate.  Amazing.  Tip:  order a simple margarita (off the menu), with tequila, lime and agave nectar.  So simple, yet so tasty.
