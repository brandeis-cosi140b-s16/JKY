I love Mexican food and this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  

Word for the wise.  As others have mentioned, food here is very HOT and SPICY.  If you do not like HOT and SPICY food (or your guest(s) do not) do not go here.  

The food is excellent.  They've got some great pitchers of house Margaritas.  And the salsa (especially the green salsa) is fantastic (and spicy).

They do charge for refills on chips and refills on salsa, FYI.
