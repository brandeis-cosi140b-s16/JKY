I have been going to Roberto's for over 10 years. First off, the service is fantastic. I am always greeted, and even if it is super busy, they have time to smile and make you feel  at home. I am a creature of habit, so I always like to get my normal meals; bean and cheese burrito, or the taco and cheese enchilada combo. Sometimes, I will ask for a recommendation, and they hook me up with something new! 

Out here in Phoenix, Mexican food restaurants are a dime a dozen, however for the quality, and for the service and atmosphere, my family and I will go to Roberto's as long as they are here. Keep up the great work guys!
