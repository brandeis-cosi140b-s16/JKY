This was our first time in Charlotte and a friend suggested this restaurant. We made reservations but were still subjected to a 30 minute wait. The management MORE than redeemed themselves with their excellent service and attention to us. 

The food was soooo good! Fresh guacamole made right in front of you and the BEST queso we had ever had. Fajita's were great, too, with huge proportions. Some items (like the guacamole) were a little expensive but really worth it. Huge menu as well!

We are so sad that there is not a Cantina near us but are already looking forward to our next trip to Charlotte.
