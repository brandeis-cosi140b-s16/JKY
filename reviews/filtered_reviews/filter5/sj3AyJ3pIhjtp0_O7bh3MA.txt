Just had lunch at Fiesta Mexicana and we're impressed. Salsa is roasted with enough spice to hit the spot The shredded chicken in the enchiladas mole was tender and flavorful. I'm very picky about the quality of the meat and there was absolutely no fat or tough bits - uncommon for your average Mexican restaurant. Husband had the pescado frito and enjoyed it very much.  Service was attentive and sincerely friendly. We'll be back.
