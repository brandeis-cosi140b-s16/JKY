I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't "feel" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.
