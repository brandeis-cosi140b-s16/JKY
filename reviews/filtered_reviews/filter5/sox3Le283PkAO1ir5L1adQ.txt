2nd time here. Had lunch today. Corn on the cob appetizer is messy, but unbelievably good. Tacos are fun and different. I like some of them more than others. You've got to be willing to try new stuff. Atmosphere is unique. Old church - stained glass. Open environment. Can be a bit noisy. Everyone seems to be having fun here. Looks like a great happy hour place. Not convenient for me, but I will return when in this area...maybe even whenI'm not in the area.
