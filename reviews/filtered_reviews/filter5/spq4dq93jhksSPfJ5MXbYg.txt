Best tacos I've ever had hands down (except for spicy pork tacos at Tacos El Gordo) nice clean kitchen. Located in a gas station and was helped by a friendly woman as a gentlemen was cooking in the back. Soccer match on the tv and soccer memorabilia on the walls. Small and simple with amazing food. Can't wait to go back.
