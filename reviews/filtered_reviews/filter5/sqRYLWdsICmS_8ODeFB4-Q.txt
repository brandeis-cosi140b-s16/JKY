Excellent food quality and preparation. The tableside guacamole is great. I had the vegetable bowl which was grilled vegetables over rice, with beans. I added a fried egg on top. Very large portions, it was a very nice dish.

The desserts were extraordinay. Flan was brought out by the chef himself , who told the story of how it is his grandmother's family recipe.

Will go back for sure. It is open 24 hours. Don't be put off by the fact that it is in the same parking lot as a strip club. Once you are inside the restaurant you will not know the difference.

Classy and upscale interior and great service. The wait staff knew to ask about ingredients and all the food is non GMO, if that is important to you . Highly recommended.
