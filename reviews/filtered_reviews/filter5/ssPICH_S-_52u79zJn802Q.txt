400th person to review this amazing establishment. Hat's off to the owner, the crew that works here and the amazing food!

I had the ever-so popular Carne Adovada Benedict. Words can't describe this dish. They've perfected it for sure. On point on key! MUST TRY!

I also was brave enough to order the Green Chile Cheese sliders. Brave I say because all this food I was prepared to take down. The C.A.B was enough but to add this was madness. (Mind you I ordered all this at the beginning). Those sliders definitely had a nip to them. 7/10 for those. But the C.A.B  was definitely a 9.5/10.

Go here, be amazed. 

Cheers!
