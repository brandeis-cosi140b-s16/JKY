Oh....my god. I'm usually super skeptical about "fusion" foods because they often seem to be a shortcut for claiming creativity and innovation in cuisine. But. KoMex is the real deal -- freaking fabulous Korean-and-Mexican-influenced food that is executed absolutely perfectly. The dishes themselves seem sooo standard (omg fried rice and nachos, how quaint) but that is seriously misleading. They will be the most amazing fried rice and nachos that will ever grace your unworthy tastebuds and there will be enough portioned on your plate to serve a medium-to-large family (pace yourself).

The location is vaguely sketch and sort of random, to the point that I drove by it three times searching for a likely storefront -- don't make this mistake, it *is* in that plaza that looks straight out of the Walking Dead.
