I absolutely love Salsa Blanca!! We frequent here at least 1 time per week if not more. I have introduced several of my friends to this great food and they love it also. The Happy Hour is awesome!! Dont think their happy hour prices can be beat anywhere. I have tried many different food items here and they were all super flavorful. My favorite is the beef tacos and the chicken quesadilla although I think the chimichanga might be right up there in ranking too. Jenny and all of her staff are very helpful and friendly. 

We will definitely be back again and again!!
