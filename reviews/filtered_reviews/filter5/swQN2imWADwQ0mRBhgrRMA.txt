Went to Macayos in Mesa last night and let me tell you. The greatest waitress/ hostess by far is Fannie. My family has eaten there lots of times, they have all been pretty good, But Fannie is pure perfection. She can anticipate What you need before you need it.Her attention to detail so impeccable I had to tell her manager Mark,I believe his name was. Thumbs up to Fannie.. The stars for Fannie. The restaurant gets a 4 star..
