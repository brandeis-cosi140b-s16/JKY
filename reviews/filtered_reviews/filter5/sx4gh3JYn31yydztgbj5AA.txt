What can I say about a place that provides intensely flavorful treats at an affordable price; FINALLY! 
When you enter the door the restaurant is plain, nothing over the top, just comfortable and intimate. We were seated and brought drinks and free chips and salsa with homemade guacamole. Who does that? How awesome! We then were told about the $5 special that was 3 bulgogi tacos and a drink. It's less than eating McDonalds, but quality food. I cannot say enough nice things about what we ate or the service. For the first time in my life after eating we ordered 2 more specials and a plate of fried rice to go to eat for dinner. Such an awesome experience.
