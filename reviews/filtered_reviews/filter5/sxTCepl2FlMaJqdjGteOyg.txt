Oh man. This place is delicious. The first station is pork rotating on a big spit w pineapple cooking above it. Get the pork taco and don't forget the pineapple. Then move on to the steak station and get everything on them. They also have tripe which I passed on. All the meats were tender and packed. I love Carne asada fries but me and Warren got pork fries fully loaded. A medium is big enough for two people to split. Nom nom nom. And they have roasted peppers which aren't hot but mild and delicious.  The employees are all friendly helping you along if you've never been there before.
And they have orange whip. The place can get packed depending on the time you go. And prepare to get messy. Nom nom nom
