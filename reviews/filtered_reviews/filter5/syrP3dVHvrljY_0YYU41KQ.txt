I have been wanting to try Arriba's Mexican Grill for years but only recently got around to going. A friend of mine was visiting from back east and we went here for lunch. I have to say I think Arriba's is a far better place than Macayos. found the food, service and prices to all be great. If you go at lunch time they have specials and I mean huge chimis and burritos for like $6.00 and the portions are more than adequate. We each got a lunch special and shared the loaded nachos which were hands down some of the best I've ever had. If you have room for desert they also have some really good choices. I've read some say the service is slow but I didn't experience this. Wait time was only like 10 minutes from order to the table which is really about average. In the mean time they bring you tortilla chips with a mild and hot salsa and a bean dip. No complaints. I have already recommended to others and will return!
