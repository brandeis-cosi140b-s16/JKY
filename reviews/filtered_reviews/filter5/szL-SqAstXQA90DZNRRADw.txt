Ahhhh I love it when a great place forces me to get off my ass and write another review. 

We were driving around and I had this unrelenting craving for fresh, delicious tacos...with a catch: not a chain restaurant and PLEASE not another fast food joint. So, I am combing through places on my yelp app when Habanero's pops up. How had I never come across this place and I live a mile away?!?!?!? Oh, and I forgot to mention, that this was on my last day in Arizona. Glorious. Secretly, I was hoping that this place would underwhelm me, just so I did not feel like an idiot for running to Taco Bell all those years.

We arrive and judging the place from the outside...well...I was underwhelmed and happy since my ego was still in place. Then we entered and I felt as though a permanent dunce cap plopped on my head. The menu looked delicious and my mouth was watering from the smell.

We ordered chips and salsa/guac, a fish taco, carne asada taco, blackened shrimp taco and calamari taco (the chips were $2.25 and each taco was $2.50). Everything was AMAZING. I would have a difficult time picking a favorite taco. 

Please go and give this place a try...avoid the dunce cap.

MUST TRY: shrimp taco and carne asada taco
MEH: chips (a little too thick for my taste)
AVOID: nothing...try everything! Then run home to work it off. :)
