Excellent food and service.  We had the beef fajitas.  The flour tortillas are made fresh  (not from a package ), so it may be a problem when I go to other places who don't do them fresh because this place has set the bar pretty high.  Iris,  our waitress was very friendly and provided excellent service.  We'll definitely be coming back while we are in the area
