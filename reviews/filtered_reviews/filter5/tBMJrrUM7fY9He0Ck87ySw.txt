This was place was one of the best hamburger places ever! My husband and I went last night with our kids (ages 4 and 8) and everyone left happy and full! We don't usually go  to new food places with the kids, but after reading the reviews we knew we had to try it. I am really glad we did, we will definitely be going back. Although next time I am going to try the Lucky Charm Milkshake.
