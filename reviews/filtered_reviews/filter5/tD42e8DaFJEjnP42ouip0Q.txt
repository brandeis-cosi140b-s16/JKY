Great 'authentic' Mexican food! 100% replaces 'other taco place' down the street.

Food: The chips were homemade and just came out of the fryer when they were served (and refilled... and refilled again). The complimentary salsa was delicious with a ton of (spicy) flavor. We both ordered vegetarian tortas and both loved them. Again, full of flavor and a great combination. Finally, we split tres leches for desert which was excellent as well. Portions are very large. Food was all prepared very well and plated with care.

Service: Seated immediately. Our waitress was phenomenal. She was always there to refill our waters and salsa/chips without hovering or interrupting. Food quick, but could have come a tad quicker -- it was a Friday night, so can't really complain too much. 

Atmosphere: Nice. We ate outside in colder weather and the heaters made it cozy. Inside was chill, less cramped than other restaurants, and the music wasn't obnoxiously loud.

Prices: The food is all really well priced. Two entrees and a split desert came to 26$. Drinks were rather expensive -- about $10+ for anything but bottled beer -- so we decided not to order any.
