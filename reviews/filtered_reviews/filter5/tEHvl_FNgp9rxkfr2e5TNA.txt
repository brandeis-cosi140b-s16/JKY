I ate here about a year and a half ago and really liked it. We went back last weekend and it is just as good, if not better. I am surprised by the fact that it only gets 3 1/2 stars because it is a really good restaurant. To begin with, the service is very friendly and very fast. The margaritas, especially the guava margaritas, are incredible. The shrimp tacos are definitely my favorite item on the menu. The flautas are very good. The guacamole here is made fresh and is absolutely delicious. What I really like about this place is that not only is the food really good, but it is served in small portion sizes that actually fill you up pretty quickly. This allows you to only order one or two plates per person and be able to share it with the table.
If you are looking for a laid-back place, with lots of fun and great food to eat, this is the place to come to.
Easily five stars all around and I will definitely be going back.
