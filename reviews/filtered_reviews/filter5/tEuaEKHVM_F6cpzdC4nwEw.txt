My fiance and I were in Vegas this past week and it was sooooo worth it! We took a cab from our hotel initially the cab driver wasn't sure about where we were going. As we got closer he laughed and informed us that it was located next to a Gentlemen's Club. No biggie! The margaritas were killer, the guacamole was flavorful and the cool part is that they make it right in front of you! I had the Chicken Enchiladas and my fiance had the Taco Dinner! Both were really good and I can see why they're rated high! The wait staff was also awesome! If you can make reservations. If you have to wait, you can always people watch cause it's Vegas!
