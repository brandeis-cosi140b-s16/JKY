My dad and I go get tacos every weekend and when I heard about RuRu's I knew it had to be our next spot. We went on Sunday for lunch and it was the perfect time, not too crowded and attentive service.

First thing, the menu is riddled with movie quotes and characters and it took us 10 minutes just laughing at all the famous lines before we even started looking at what each one actually was. We started with the Three Amigos, salsa, guac and queso. The salsa was amazing and fire roasted but the real winner here was the guac, it had so much flavor and I couldn't get enough! We were both drawn to the Friend Zone margarita which was refreshing with the orange juice and lime juice, so  naturally we ordered two rounds. 

Finally and most importantly the tacos. The "Long Duk Dong" was a favorite, korean beef was tender and so flavorful. "Fat Guy in a Little Coat" was also a great taco with the grilled skirt steak. There are so many more tacos on the menu and I want to try them all. Can't wait for my next visit to RuRu's!
