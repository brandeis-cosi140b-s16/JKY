Stopped by here last Sunday with the boyfriend for a late brunch.  I had the huevos rancheros and he had chilaquiles.  Both were amazing!  My huevos was served on fresh made tortillas formed into a thin quesadilla.  The sauce was fresh very well seasoned without being over powering.  The salsa they serve with the chips is fresh made in house daily, and you can taste it.  The V8 for my bloody mary was also freshly made, with a great flavor (not too tomato heavy, not too spicy, just perfect with lots of fresh herbs).  
I am pretty sure they put crack in the food here. So yummy!  Now stop reading this a go EAT already!
