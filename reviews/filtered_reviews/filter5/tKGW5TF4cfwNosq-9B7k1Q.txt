I have never tasted French fries seasoned like these. I was skeptical until I took my first bite. WOW! Amazing flavor and texture. My friends had burgers and one person had the taco salad. Everyone was satisfied with their meal. Don't let the outside or inside of the building fool you. They are serving top notch food. Will definitely go again!
