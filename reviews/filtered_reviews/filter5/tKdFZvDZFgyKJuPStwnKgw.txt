AMAZING!! The restaurant is very unassuming, a small joint, but they have the best food, very tasty, and the service is beyond awesome. You truly feel like family here! My partner and I had enchiladas, tacos and tostada platters. The chips were nice and warm and the salsa was on point. Great place, and inexpensive!! Give it a shot!
