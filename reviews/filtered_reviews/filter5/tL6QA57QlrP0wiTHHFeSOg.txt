There sauces compliment the food, where most places use sauce to cover up the food. The service is bar none! Everyone is so helpful and sincere. The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had! By far the best mexican food i have EVER had! Btw, free shuttle service to and from the strip!
