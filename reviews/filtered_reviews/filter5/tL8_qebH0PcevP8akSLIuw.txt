Being right down the street, Joyride is a great place to go for a quick, delicious lunch.  First time I went, i was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the food.  The carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly, had great flavor, as did the pork carnitas.

Their salsa is good...a little mild--ask for the hot, you'll love it.  Only thing I would recommend is dialing down the music a bit as it's a little loud if you're talking biz.
