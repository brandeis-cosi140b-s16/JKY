"if youre in Vegas, you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO go to tacos el gordo!"

"and you HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE TO get the tacos adobada!!"

Jasmine went on and on, but how could I resist texts like this?  After all, she's a fellow foodie.  

Let me tell you, all it took was ONE.BITE.  I was hooked.  

Ok, so this location isn't the safest place to head to at 1:30AM, but if  you grew up in my neighborhood it will only bring back memories, lol!  I'm sure you will mull through the other great reviews of this establishment, but at the time I rolled through there (1:30AM) there were five people eating inside, and two vagrants outside asking for spare change.

  LADIES... I highly suggest taking a friend or friends if heading here late at night or before they close. 

That being said, their ADOBADA tacos are just short of orgasmic.  Seriously, if my taste buds were capable of such activity, they did it.  The pork is marinated and cooked just right, with incredible flavor that remained very distinguishable even past the fresh diced onions and minced cilantro.  All of this is succulently nestled in perhaps the freshest tasting corn tortillas I've ever had.  

They do not skimp on the amount, either... they are generously filled!

And what's up with that green sauce?  Jasmine and I agree, the main ingredient in it is crack, because it.is.addicting.

(just kidding about the crack...)

They have locations all over the Southland (LA) and in San Diego.  As far as Las Vegas goes, I will definitely make this a regular visit from here on out.

If you're a fan of street-style soft tacos, you owe it to yourself and your friends to give this place a try.  Go for the food, not the ambience!!

Mahalos!!
