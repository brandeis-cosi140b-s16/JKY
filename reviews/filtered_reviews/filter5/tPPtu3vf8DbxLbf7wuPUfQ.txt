This restaurant has some of the best, freshest Mexican food I've had in my life. The atmosphere is casual and the service is great. We had everyone from chefs to managers checking on us. Our server, Jesse, was great and helpful!

Their free chips and salsa actually comes with three different sauces, going the extra mile more than most (be extra careful with the habanero!). Their drinks menu was very varied in terms of cocktails. They even have a handmade juice they'll turn into Margarita! 

Our dishes were delicious. Normally I don't care about GMO-free dishes, but everything we ate was nice and fresh, from the Carne Asada to the Torta. Mexican food tends to leave me feeling a bit gross due to all the grease, but you can tell the stuff here is quality.

Even though the venue is a bit odd (right next to a gentleman's club :P), it doesn't detract from the quality of the restaurant. I recommend everyone who likes Mexican to come here. A+!
