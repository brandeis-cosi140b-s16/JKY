So we visited this place about a week ago thanks to Yelp. Yes it's next to a strip club but that shouldn't stop anyone from coming here. The food and service was awesome. The corn chips and dips which came out to start tasted so fresh. The habanero one was no joke. The head chef/owner I believe came and spoke with us after our meal to make sure everything was fine. He was so excited to hear what we thought and explained all the recipes had been passed down from his mother. He was very proud of the place and so he should be. We are visitors from Australia, it's a shame we probably won't be able to go back again!
