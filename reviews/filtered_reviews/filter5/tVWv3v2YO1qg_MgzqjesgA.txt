This place is always good. The food is fairly cheap and tasty, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is decent. This is a bar first and foremost so don't expect traditional "sit down" service, but this is what makes this place great if you ask me. Keep the drinks and food coming! Highly recommended for a quick flavorful lunch or dinner stop with friends or even alone!
