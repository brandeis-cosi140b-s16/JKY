The love and I ordered lunch from Rudy's. It was delicious!!! We tried their tacos(carne) and burritos- one with chicken the other with carne- (and no we couldn't finish it all!) The service is pretty fast 5-10 minutes even though other people were also waiting for food. The churros were your standard treat, really sugary! Definitely will be returning! Oh!!! And I forgot to mention.... The Guacamole is amazing!!! We love our chips and guac, and after recently moving out here, we can both say we have found our new favorite mexican joint! They were out of tamales that I was a little disappointed about. But I'll just have to go back and try again!
