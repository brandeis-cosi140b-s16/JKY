We absolutely love everything about Crescent.  We've been about 5 times now and always looking to go back.  Intimate setting with patio and front restaurant/bar and full service bar in the venue portion.  Food is really good and inexpensive.  Shows are always really inexpensive with a close up experience and quality sound.  Love the quaintness and service.  Well run place and highly recommended!
