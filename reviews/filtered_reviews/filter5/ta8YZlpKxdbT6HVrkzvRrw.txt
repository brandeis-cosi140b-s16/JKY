The atmosphere, food, a servers are all great here! I've been here 3 times, and each time is always better. If you can, ask to be seated by the windows; its so pretty especially at night. The coca cola pork is my favorite thing to get, its sooooo tender and the flavor is mouthwatering. Also the the chips, refried beans and red chili sauce they give you before your meal are so good! One more thing, the frozen mango margarita though...it's everything (I'm not even big on alcohol).
