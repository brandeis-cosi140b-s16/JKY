This was my first visit as I've heard great things about this being one of the few great places to eat Mexican food and I wasn't disappointed.  One thing I always find that's a hallmark of a great restaurant is great service from being greeted at the door to when you sit down and how you're attended during your meal and Viva Zapata was all those things and attentive to my drink, chips, salsa, and bean dip.  I just want to mention that bean dip with chips is something few places offer but always wins me over in a Mexican restaurant. 

I ordered the Torta de Pierna which is a pork sandwich that came out with some time that shows it wasn't just heated up and made with care.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.   I didn't feel a hot plate nor was warned about one and that's something that always makes me feel great before a bite.  

I'm looking forward to future visits and trying more plates from this place due to the food, service, and overall atmosphere.
