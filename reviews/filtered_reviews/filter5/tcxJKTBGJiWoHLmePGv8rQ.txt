Hussong's was awesome!!

First off our waitress Brandi (sp?) was UNREAL!!!  Cute, nice, intelligent, well spoken, knew the menu and was very accomodating to our every need!

The food was good, hot and authentic...beer was cold and served quickly...margaritas were fantastic.  If you are in the area...this place should be on your list...skip by Ri-Ra and go get some Mexican!!!

Awesome is the simplest way to put it!
