Ok I saw this place on Yelp, looked at the photos and since I saw corn on the cob Mexican style which I like and buy all the time from street vendors decided to hit this joint during my stay here in Vegas. 

The corn on the cob was good but not better than the usual street vendors that sell in Orange County , Ca - Anaheim. 

However I decided to try a taco el-pastor and I can tell you that it was the best taco I have ever had. 
I used to think that Pollo Locco had better food than Del Taco and Taco Bell. This place puts both of those so far behind that they seem equal. 
If you try the taco el pastor go to the salad at and dip it into their spicy red sauce!

The "red sauce" which is what they call it is AMAZING. 
If you know of better tacos than here throughout Vegas please let me know.
