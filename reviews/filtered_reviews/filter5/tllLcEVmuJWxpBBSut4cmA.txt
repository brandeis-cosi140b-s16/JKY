Heard this place opened two months ago, but waited a bit to let the hype go down. The wait at foodie fest for a sushiburrito is usually obnoxious and I've heard the lines were crazy at this place at lunch peak hour, but have also heard nothing but good things... so we checked this place out at 5pm on a Saturday. About 10 minute wait time in line, but honestly well worth it!

We ordered the Rockaport (soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce -- also comes with jalape√±os, but I'm not a fan & skipped those!) and the Long Beach (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, surimi crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla chips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce). Made one a meal by adding a drink with taro chips & cheese dipping sauce. 

Everything was 100% satisfactory. Ingredients are fresh, flavor is on point, and no complaints whatsoever. The taro chips are coated in a sweet layer of furikake that pairs so well with it too! There was a bar with condiments but honestly, none was needed. This isn't a place I would come if I was starving, as I could probably devour two easily... but I was surprisingly full after one sushiburrito. Definitely impressed & can't wait to try out other things on the menu! Will definitely be back... what an awesome Japanese Mexican fusion spot!
