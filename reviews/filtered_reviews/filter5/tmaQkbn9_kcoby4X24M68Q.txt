Really, really great tasting burger. I wanted to try a burger in their standard menu so I ordered the Beach Burger.  I was tempted to substitute Cheddar for the Smoked Mozzarella since I tend not to like "smoked" cheeses, but I followed the Yelpers before me and put my faith in the good guys at PVB and their awesome combinations. Turned out to be such a good flavor combo, it might make me re-think my attitude towards "smoked" cheese!
But what really made me want to return and try another PVB combo was the bun. Buns can make or break a burger IMHO.  This bun was light, soft and just big enough to serve its role as burger holder. 
Superb!  I'll be back!
