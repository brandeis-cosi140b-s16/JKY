Let me just start off by saying that as someone who is Mexican American, I rarely am impressed by Mexican food restaurants, however, Santos Lucha Libre Taco Shop has revealed itself to me in all it's glory. The food is authentic, perfectly spicy, fresh and reasonably priced! They have a selection of 8 different meats with different salsas ranging from classic carne asada, chicken, pastor, to home style Tinga (MY FAVORITE) and you can combine it with your choice of either a burrito, tacos, nachos and some other things I can't remember. I got the three taco combo with Tinga, adobada and cochinita! MIND AND TASTE BUDS BLOWN AWAY! I can't get over how excited I am this place opened. The place is Lucha themed with amazing colors, paintings, disco ball, huge wrestling pictures that is perfect for families, kids, parties, maybe even to go after church on a Sunday with everyone. The tortillas were so soft and cooked just right and to wash down that hint of spice the horchata was just amazing and so authentic tasting as if my grandma just made a fresh batch. Go to Santos, you will not regret it.
