Ever since La Barca closed I have been looking for a Mexican seafood restaurant and found one. Only complaint I have is the chips. They need to step up their game and have fresh tortilla chips. The salsa was good. Our appetizer was the mixed seafood ceviche which was spectacular. Michleadas are great. My kids ordered Horchatas also great. Big ass mugs for both. Our entrees were a shrimp cocktail (excellent), carnitas which were moist and very authentic, Carne asada that was very good and a mixed seafood cocktail that had plenty of seafood. Crab, scallops, an oyster, shrimp and octopus. It was to die for. My wife also ordered shrimp empanadas. Wow so good. I got a little crazy and on top of my seafood cocktail I ordered a dozen oysters topped with ceviche. First off they gave me more then a dozen. Is that norm I don't know but I'm glad they did because the whole family dug in. Even my 15 yr old and 9 yr old grabbed a few. 
     This will be a monthly outing for us. Be careful it can be missed. It's tucked away behind a tacos Mexico in a shopping center that looks half abandoned. Trust me it's well worth the adventure. Enjoy it.
