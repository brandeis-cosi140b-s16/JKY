I have been to Blue Agave every Sunday, when my favorite football team plays. They have a very solid staff in place with a good selection of food. Everything tried may not fit my style, but it's highly recommended to everyone to try. That's what unique about the Blue Agave. The staff is friendly and has a great atmosphere on any occastion.
