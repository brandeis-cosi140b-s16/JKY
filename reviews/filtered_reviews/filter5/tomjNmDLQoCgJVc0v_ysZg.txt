If you have time in Phoenix airport, come to The Barrio Cafe! I love this place. This is the most inspired menu I've ever seen in my domestic travels, and the artwork is awesome. Is that a Chihuly light? The food is great, and there is an interesting cocktail menu. This is not just an over-priced beer and burger place. I love flying through Phoenix with a layover so I can come here. My favorites are the nachos (unexpected sweet and savory flavor), fish tacos, and seafood enchiladas. Oh and the Cadillacs. :) mucho gusto!
