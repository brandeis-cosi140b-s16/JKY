This is some kick ass Mexican food done right. Visiting from California, we heard that this was a great new place. We were not disappointed. Everything we ordered was fantastic. We ordered one of each taco... each done a different way. My favorite was the chicken with pinon cream. The corn appetizer and guacamole are MUST order items. The Pozole Verde...Wow! Better than mine and mine is good! I have to say coming from SF Bay Area, the price for drinks was nuts. Fifteen plus for a Margerita????
I did notice that the website reflects much more reasonable drink prices now though. Having said that, this place is very unique and cool. I loved the Low Rider/ Day of the dead motif. Must stop place for Mexican food in Scottsdale.
