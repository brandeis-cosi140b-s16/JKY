So finally made my way to Tacos Atoyac after hearing so much buzz from it for a while. I think it's the fact that they are closed Sundays and Mondays that held me back. Man I wish I would have came here sooner. Simply the best street tacos I've had in Phoenix. Finally there is a place that I can have my street taco fix when I'm not in San Diego for my still all time favorite Tacos El Gordo!  

The price is right, about $2 per taco. My wife and I shared several carne and pastor tacos. My favorite was the pastor..I could eat a hundred of these.lol.

I'll defiantly be coming back here. A little hard to find and not much if any decor inside, but still the best street tacos in the valley!
