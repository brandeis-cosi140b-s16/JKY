I'm going to go ahead and add my 5 star rating to Bruddah's collection. If you haven't tried the food here, you've been missing out. 

The steak - oh my, the steak.  I could go on and on about it. I don't know what they marinate their meat with, but I find myself craving the steak. It's incredible. Their seaweed rice, the salsas, the chocolate covered coconut bark.... Ahhhh!!! Why do you have to be all the way across town?! Rumor has it, they are adding more locations. So in the meanwhile, I'll have to trek it to the west side while eagerly awaiting a Green Valley location. 

Owner: Please come to Green Valley. 
I need more of your steak in my life. Period.
