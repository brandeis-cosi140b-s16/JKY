Valle Luna is the BEST Mexican food place in Phoenix! I have never been disappointed and always leave stuffed and oh so happy! I'm not a big tamale fan at all from stores/restaurants but this place does the so good! Chips and salsa are the best always! Margaritas are yummy yummy with 1800. Everything I have tried I have loved and so has my fianc√© and another person I've gone with!! Service has always been good to us...the first time was the best "/ but I have not seen her in awhile. I love the coupons I get all the time for free dinners!! GREAT way to get me in there even on my diet ") thanks for making some good Mexican food!!
