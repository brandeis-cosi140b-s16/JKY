I have been eager to try this place after several recommendations. Green chilli burro was amazing!  Probably the best I've had anywhere!  It was spicy enough I didn't have to add any salsa, the chunks of meat were tender and the perfect size, the sauce was runny but I didn't mind.  Their salsa is quite enjoyable as well.  I will be back.
