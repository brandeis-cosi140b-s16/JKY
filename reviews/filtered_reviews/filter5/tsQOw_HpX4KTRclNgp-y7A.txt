I've been here a few times before and have had really bad service so I didn't plan on coming back, however my friend was a fan and so I came back with her and I have to say, I'm glad I did! Drink specials are awesome. During happy hour all drinks are half off!! And it seems like there is a completely different service staff, our waitress had personality and really took good care of us, drinks never were empty and she refered the guacamole and hawiians gone fishing (both were yummy). Everyone seemed to smile as they walked by and helped clear empty plates or glasses. Even the girl that brought out the food (not our server) made sure we had everything we needed,..definatly had a good time and now ill be the one bringing my friends back!
