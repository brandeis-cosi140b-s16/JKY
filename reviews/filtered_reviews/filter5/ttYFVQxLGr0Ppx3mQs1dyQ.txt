Even though this place only dedicates about five hours, one day a week to its breakfast, I think this might be my favorite breakfast place. Literally everything I have tried on the menu has been simply wonderful. My favorite is the eggs benedict. Too much yum.... Maybe one day I will come here when is not 9 am on a Sunday and do some more menu exploring :D
