I was looking around for a new spot to live and drove by this spot and was like shit America's Taco Shop and had to make a U-Turn... I had been to the one dow town and loved it so it was a must stop. I entered to a friendly staff and looked over the menu and went with the Breakfast Burrito and the Carne Spicy Assda Taco with a Mexican Coke... I rate the experience as followed.

Breakfast Burrito - B
Carne Spicy Asda Taco - A++
Mexican Coke - A
Staff - A

I would have to say American Taco Shop has some great street style tacos... If you get a chance to visit the downtown stop or Tempe order the tacos to start you will not be disappointed.
