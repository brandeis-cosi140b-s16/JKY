This was really a great experience from the food to the service. Are waitress was very knowledgeable about every item on the menu. She also was extremely attentive to everything we needed. Can't say how impressed I was. When we walked in we were greeted by the Owner. Who actually seated us as well. Every dish we picked out and that the lovely waitress also picked out and sent to us was some of the best food we have ever had. Strongly suggest the table side guacamole. Spicy is you can handle it. The fish dishes and the beef dishes were to die for. We will be back for sure next time in Scottsdale.
