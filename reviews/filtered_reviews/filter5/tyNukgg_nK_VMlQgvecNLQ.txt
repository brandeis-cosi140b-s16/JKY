Loved this place!  The restaurant has cool paintings and the patio is large and comfortable!  The food and drinks were delicious and inexpensive. I had a carne asada taco and a chicken taco and they were fantastic. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was very friendly. I will definitely be back.
