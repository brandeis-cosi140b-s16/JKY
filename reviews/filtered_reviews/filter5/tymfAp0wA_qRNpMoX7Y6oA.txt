Last night after a few drinks my fiancée and I were in need of some quick, cheap and delicious drunk food. At first we were thinking fast food but then we passed by tacos and beer and thought, why not! And we were not disappointed at all. We ordered guacamole and added corn, bacon and cities. It was absolutely delicious, had some hint of spice, lots of crumbled, crispy bacon and sweet corn. Our tacos came out shortly after. The prices were amazing, most expensive was shrimp at $3.95 and a lot were under $3. I got shrimp and carne asada, and they were the best tacos I have had in Las Vegas. They were big, over flowing with pico sauce, guac and meat. If you are a fan of shrimp tacos, you have to try the ones at tacos and beer. My fiancée got lengua, carnitas and beef barboca and each of his were better than the last. Each taco had an array of fillings and sauces and the flavored were perfect. We didn't try any drinks (had just come from a bar) but next time for sure.

The only downside is that it took a pretty long time for our waitress to come over and get our order, but the food quickly made up for that minor misstep on the waitress' end. 

We will definitely be heading back to this place very soon and often.
