Two words to describe this taco joint... Authentic-mouthwatering-delicious-up all night-dreaming of these bomb tacos! Oops! That was more than two words! 

Being pretty new to Vegas I find it really difficult to find ethnic foods that I enjoy. Most "ethnic" food joints lack authenticity in Vegas. Food is either to greasy or lacking flavor. Nothing like good ol Cali...but that's besides the point. I felt like my soul was set free when I took a bite into the carne asada tacos. Brought me back to the streets of LA. 

The carne asada fries are HUGE and made with perfection! The french fries are crisp and not floppy and soggy. Washing all this down with an ice cold horchata....a blissful intoxication!
