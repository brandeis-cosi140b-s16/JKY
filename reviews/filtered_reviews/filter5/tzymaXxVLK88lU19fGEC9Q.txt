Great food and excellent service. The restaurant was crowded on a Good Friday but we only had to wait about 15 minutes. The service was attentive but not overbearing. The food was served quickly. The portions were generous. The Epic Tuna burrito was tasty and the Salmon taco
Salad was delicious. a wonderful evening!
