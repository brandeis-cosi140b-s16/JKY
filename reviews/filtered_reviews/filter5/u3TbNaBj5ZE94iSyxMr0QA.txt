GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Went searching for breakfast and ran into this cool little spot.  We were able to be seated right away.  The server was very friendly and attentive to our needs.   The breakfast was delicious!   My friend ordered the Mexican Scramble and it was GREAT.  I ordered steak n eggs and it was also very good.  To top it off, we ordered $3.95 breakfast drinks that were GREAT.  After a good breakfast, I decided I wanted the big tall frozen margarita (with the plastic cup that you can take home).  Not a lot of alcohol, but it was very tasty.  On top of it all, the place has TV's everywhere so its a nice spot to catch the games.  Not sure how lunch / dinner is, but I would definitely go back and try it.  I encourage you to check this place out for yourself!
