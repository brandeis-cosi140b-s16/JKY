Carlitos' is very authentic! I am originally born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I felt that both the green and red chile were above par and tasted very well. The pork is probably the best meat I have tasted in so long. I don't even like pork and I felt like this place could totally convert me to loving pork. I also ordered both chicken and carne asada enchiladas. I would say in this order pork, chicken, and then carne asada  ranked in best to last. The restaurant is a little bit small in space but overall if you are looking for a great new mexican food stop in!
