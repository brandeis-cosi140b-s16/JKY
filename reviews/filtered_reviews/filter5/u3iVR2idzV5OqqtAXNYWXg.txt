We dined at Barrio last week on a Monday night and the place was packed. I was super impressed by the menu and the food. Very generous portions and the sauces were amazing. Don't go here is you are looking for New Mexico food....the flavors at Barrion were bold and creative. Also, don't expect New Mexico prices but, for me, the food was worth the prices. Very cute atmosphere too. I will make this a priority on my next trip to Phoenix.

P.S. I did fell our waiter was arrogant. Almost like he didn't want to be working that night or we were too much trouble for him to be serving us. He's the guy with the goatee. Needs an attitude adjustment.
