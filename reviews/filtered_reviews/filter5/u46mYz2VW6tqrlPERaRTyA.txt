This is definitely one of my favorite places! I go there all the time & I'm never disappointed. Great service, great food & great drinks! 4-8 happy hour is the best.. it's 2 for 1! Their sangria is my favorite, as well as every margarita I've tried and the other drinks like the pina colada and lava flow. I love the chicken nachos, their chicken tacos & their enchiladas. One of my friends always gets the taquitos but I haven't tried them yet.. though it's obvious he loves them. I personally love the decor.. it's really laid back and there's always a nice mix of people. Check it out!
