We decided to stop here Friday for happy hour to try out their tacos and margaritas. Although their happy hour was pretty limited (2 dollars off house margaritas and a dollar off drafts), we had expected it to be on the pricier side after checking their menu online. 

Nevertheless, both their food and house margs were well worth the price. We ended up getting the DIY family style tacos with chicken and shrimp, a salsa trio and the guac appetizer. Three of us split all of it, and were comfortably stuffed post-feast. The chicken was juicy, with a hint of spiciness, and the shrimp was coated in a cilantro-lime mayo that I wanted to bottle up and take home. Although it came with 6 tortilla shells, we ended up asking for more because we still had chicken and shrimp left in the bowls! Also, their guac and salsas were on point. I'm not typically a fan of salsa verde (the green one) but thoroughly enjoyed this one. It had a little more kick than they normally do. The guac was so good, we ended up getting two. 

The margs were only $5.5 during happy hour, and the bartender didn't skimp on the tequila. It was one of the more tastier margaritas I've had in the 'Burgh, and it was only their house version! I'm looking to head back to check out their speciality margs and their infused tequilas. Oh and brunch!
