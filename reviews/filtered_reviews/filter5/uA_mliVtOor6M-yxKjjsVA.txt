The best Mexican food I ever have eaten. My date said it best, "I've died and gone to Mexican food heaven."

My mom had lamb on special. It was superbly cooked, with one side slightly crisp and the other delightfully tender. Garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly grilled zucchini rounded out her plate.

I had shrimp tacos, which were plump, juice and fresh. The complimentary guacamole made fresh at the table with avocado, cilantro, tomato, pomegranate, salt and pepper put me on another planet.

My cousin always orders the pulled pork torta, which is amazing and gigantic.

And my lady had halibut topped with lobster, shrimp, crab and scallops -- a seafood-lover's dream.

The only low point on the menu is the sangria, which she returned to the server in favor of a glass of quality red wine. 

I refuse to visit Phoenix without making a stop at Barrio.
