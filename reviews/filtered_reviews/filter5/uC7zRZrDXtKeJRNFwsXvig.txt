This is a fabulous restaurant...very cleverly decorated...wonderful service and personnel...very friendly. The personnel make you feel like family. The food is  delicious delicious delicious.  My favorite when, it is so hot, is the shrimp tostado....wonderful...refreshing during the hot weather.  But the rest of the menu is wonderful....I have tried at least once.  We go there at least once or twice a week.  Very good....
