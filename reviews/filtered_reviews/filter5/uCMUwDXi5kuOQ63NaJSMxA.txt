Had dinner there last night. The salsa they serve was just ok--it was very tomato-y, and I'm not a tomato person. We ordered the queso for an app and it was yummy! The only problem is, if you let it sit, it will harden (yes, we left a wee bit in the bottom of the bowl.  My husband and I both had the carne asada, and it was pretty effn good! I like that they weren't stingy with their cheese! The staff there is awesome! We were asked to change tables because the dj was coming in, and that's where he sets up. It was really no big deal-especially since we just ordered. They were so nice that they comp'd 2 margaritas which were $10 each. I definitely recommend this place!
