Fridays are shrimp tacos days! The bomb. Every other day of the week is fish taco day. The fried ones. Really, really yummy. This location has relatively new owners who have changed many things. Most importantly, the food quality and recipes have evolved, the original awesome staff remains the same (Nacho has been working the grill for years).
