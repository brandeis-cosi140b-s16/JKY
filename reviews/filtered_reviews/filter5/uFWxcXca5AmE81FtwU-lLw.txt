Loved it! Tried it out for the first time and were so pleasantly surprised! Started with a refreshing mojito, followed by their complimentary salsa and bean dip. I ordered the fish tacos and my boyfriend got the chicken steak skillet. The fish tacos were so goood!! Fish was flaky and tasty. The flour tortillas were out of this world and all the toppings brought the entire package to the next level. Their guacamole was fresh and tasty. My boyfriend skillet was seared with tequila table side, mini show :), the meat was tender, juicy and flavorful. They also had live music by a very talented gentleman, makes for a great atmosphere. Would highly recommend this place for a night out. It's a little on the fancy side, but then again it's in Summerlin, so it should be. Service was great! Our waiter Miguel was super friendly and attentive.
