I found this place originally by chance. I walked in and absolutely loved the food. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito. All of their food is fresh and homemade! My burrito wasn't greasy, very flavorful and the tortilla was light and delicious. If you dine in, you get their freshly made chips and choice of three salsas. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. It is probably once of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley!
