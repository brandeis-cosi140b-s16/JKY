I am a phoenix native but have been living on the East coast for more than 12 years.  My immeadiate family is still here in Phx and every time I come to visit I have to go to Mi Patio for my Mexican Food fix.  

Start with the green chile chese crisp and then dive right into green chile burrito or their uniquely delicious baja chicken burrito.  Actually, every time we go everyone loves what they get.  Dont forget to ask about the specials which are always great.  

It is definitely a family run place, in fact the Dad and Son work at the bar!  If you are ever in need of a solid mexican meal, this is the place.  Highly recommended from someone who knows good mex when he see's it.
