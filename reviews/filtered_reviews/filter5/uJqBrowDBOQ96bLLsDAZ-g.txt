My boyfriend and I discovered this little gem on a Tuesday afternoon. It was lunch rush, but the line still moved fairly fast, and gave us time to look over the menu. They had a taco special for Taco Tuesday and they were each a very generous portion, served with homemade tortillas being rolled and warmed right in front of you :) It was a nice change from Chipotle. I got the bbq pork barbacoa and a side of beans. The beans were kind of slopped to the side and spread all over the plate and foil, but they gave me a large amount, so it didn't matter too much. We also shared an appetizer of guac and salsas, which was huge.  It included drinks and we only paid about $20~ Everything tasted very fresh and we are anticipating the Scottsdale location!

P.S They have horchata
