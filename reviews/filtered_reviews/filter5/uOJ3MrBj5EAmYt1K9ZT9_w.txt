Service:
Great service from our waiter, it really stood out and made the night. The hostesses lacked the friendly factor and seemed like just pretty faces with no smiles or warm welcomes. 
Food:
Chips and salsa - awesome! My girlfriend and I shared the La Tabllia(?) plate, the carnitas was the highlight but it all was great. 

Will come again next time I'm craving Mexican in Vegas.
