My husband and I absolutely love this place.  It is just across the street from where we live, so it's very convenient for us.  We love the food.  I definitely recommend trying the Carnitas Burrito chimi style and my husband absolutely loves the Chicken 
Burritos az style.  Don't forget the green salsa.  It's amazing.  For the price that your paying, they give you a pretty big portion.  I usually don't get any sides, because the burrito is more than enough to keep me satiated.  They also serve margaritas and cervesas.

It's a nice place to sit down and relax while eating and since it's not in a busy location, there's never a line and always plenty of places to sit.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I wish more people knew about this place.  It's 100x better than Filibertos and more affordable than Chipotle.  Heck, even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place.  Check it out.
