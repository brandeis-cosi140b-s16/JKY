Luckily we didn't give up on the Yelp map location, since it was about a mile off and just googled to get the correct location.  We had the Sunday bucket of Corona light special and got 2 servings of the red and green salsa which were nice and spicy.  Our six year old had the bean and corn salsa which wasn't spicy, but tasty.  Our food was out super fast and the Christmas adovada pork stuffed sopapilla, carne Adovada ribs, shredded beef farmers burrito ala carte, the New Mexican traditional burrito adovada green ala carte, and kids cheese crisp were all enjoyed and we all had plenty to eat.  We all agreed we would go back and as we were leaving we found out they are expanding into the space next door for more family dining space.  The decor was very cool and a few of us can't wait to try some of the tequila selections next time.  The service was very good as well and not to be left out of this review.  The bad news is we live in ahwatukee, but the good news is that La Rista is very close to Gilbert polar ice which we frequent at least once a week!
