I think this has the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  I've been here many many times.  I like the food because it represents authentic mexican food.  The servers are always very friendly and attentive and the food has never disappointed.  And the margaritas...yummm! Don't forget to try to pina colada.  

I want to tell you my favorite dish here, however I can't choose just one.  The tableside guacamole is amazing, and cool to watch them make it fresh.  The shrimp ceviche is great.  Fajitas, fish tacos, flautas, carne asada, burritos...yep its all good.  And what I really dig is that they don't throw black olives, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream on top of everything like many other "Mexican" restaurants.

Another cool thing is the live music.  I think its on weekend nights there is a guy singing traditional spanish songs.  Love Love Love Lindo Michoacan.
