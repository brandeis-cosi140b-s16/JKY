I used to not be a fan of Mexican food but living in Vegas it's hard not to. 

My friends and I came in craving tacos, and boy we went to the right place. Ordering was a bit confusing though because you order different things from different "stations." The grilled stuff, like carne asada, you should order on the far left and the adobada line is where the giant pork leg is being shaved off, and anything else is on the other side adjacent to it. I was very lost the first time I went there. 

I got lengua, carne asada and pork adobada tacos for $2 each. They include (or you can ask for) the grilled green onions and chili's, which are freakin' awesome! The service was fast and very friendly. They help out those who are obviously having a hard time ordering (like moi). I know they have other stuff on the menu aside from tacos, but I don't pay much attention since their tacos are the main attraction. I guess I'll try their carne asada fries next time.

This place is open late, until 5am on Fri & Sat. That's why after clubbing, my friends and I go straight to this place and get our late night (early morning?) grub on.
