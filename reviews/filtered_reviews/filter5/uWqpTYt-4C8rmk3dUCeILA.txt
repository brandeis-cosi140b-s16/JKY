I never in my life would have thought that mixing Chinese with Mexican would be a good idea.

I was wrong, and boy, I am so happy that I was wrong.

Chino is a strange fusion restaurant in a slowly dieing shopping center, but keeps up the business alone.

They mix bold flavors together,  and it comes out great. Cuban Black Beans, spicy with a hint of sweet,  Caribbean Jerk Rice, that stays absolutely spicy, and their mexican and chinese choices are amazing. The chinese ones have great sauces, and the mexican ones have been stewed to perfection.

Also, they give you snickerdoodles, fresh ones.

Excellent restaurant, I will continue to go as long as they last.
