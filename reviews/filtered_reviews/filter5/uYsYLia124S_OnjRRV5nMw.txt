Best authentic tacos in Las Vegas - hands down.  They make the corn tortillas fresh - grabbing the masa and throwing that stuff right on the grill.  You can taste the freshness and care they put into every taco.

This place is packed at 10:30 on a Saturday night (totally full) and for good reason.  Their spicy pork taco is out of this world.  Also really enjoyed the lengua (beef tongue).  

I'm gonna have no problem driving from Summerlin to this joint on a regular basis.  It's just that good.  

FYI the line on the far right is for the spicy pork tacos, the middle is for brain and tongue, and the left one for everything else.  You order your tacos, get them, then go to the register.  Piece of cake once you know the system.  The pork line is always longer than the others.
