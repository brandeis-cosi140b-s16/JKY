Amazing! Don't let the strip mall deter you since most amazing little gems are usually hidden in strip malls it seems. 

I had the Beach House burger which was super favorable. The pico mixed with smoked mozzarella and green chili. Wow.. Had the sweet potato tots and BBQ chips which were both tasty. 

Friends ordered the French Toast fries which weren't my thing (don't like French toast in the first place, I know I'm weird) but he was in love. 

We will definitely be back as I want to try their tacos and carnival corn.
