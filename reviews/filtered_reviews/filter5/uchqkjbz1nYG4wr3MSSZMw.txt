I'm always on the lookout to try one of my bookmarked spots for lunch and I decided to give this place a try when I was having a major elote craving. 

I arrived around 12:30 and the place was pretty busy but not too packed. I decided on some Mexican corn and two tacos al pastor. Everything looked really fresh and handmade and it all smelled so good. While I was paying I chatted with the cashier who asked how I heard about them. I told her about Yelp and she was glad the word was spreading about them so well. All the employees were really nice and friendly. Before I left with my goodies I had to stop at the famous salsa bar to get some delicious toppings. They really keep everything very clean, which makes me happy and they have so many salsa options which is nice. They have a really and clean dining area and everything is super cheap.

I enjoyed my tacos right away and they were amazing! Some of the best I've ever had. They were so juicy and had amazing flavor. I was absolutely in love after the first bite and it just got better and better as I ate. I finished my two tacos and was sad that they were over. On to my corn. This was really great. Very typical Mexican corn. I liked that they kept it a little more on the crunchy side, which I prefer. 

Everything here was fabulous and I am already planning my return really soon!
