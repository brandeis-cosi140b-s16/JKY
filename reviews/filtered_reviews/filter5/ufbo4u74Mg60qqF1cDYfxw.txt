Tried this place for the 1st time....it's amazing. Fresh food and excellent service. Went there with my daughter, boyfriend and his children. The food was hot and done to order. The chips were served with salsa and a spicy bean dip. Both were tasty. I had the fajitas with chicken. It came with rice and beans which were perfect. An awesome little out of the way place that I will recommend to anyone.
