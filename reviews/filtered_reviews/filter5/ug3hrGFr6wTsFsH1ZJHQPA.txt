We love the New Mexican Grill.  It is a little hole in the wall.  And we love taking their food for takeout.  They have the BEST breakfast burritos you would ever want to eat.  And the salsa is amazing with green chiles.  Super yummy!  Their dinner meats are not quite as good, but still good.  Plus it is affordable.
