We just dropped in for lunch. What a pleasant surprise. Linen tablecloths and classy soft Mexican music in the background. The menu is not the standard Tex-Mex tacos and burros; rather it is Central Mexican cuisine. The chipotle sauce is smoky with a nice hot finish, the tomatillo sauce is bright with a great flavor. The bar is well stocked with 65 tequilas, the Marquita's are made with fresh squeezed lime juice. Every bite was a pleasant surprise. I cannot wait to come back for dinner.
