Great dining experience! Tacos were tasty, try the baja fish. The beast burrito was excellent and their carne asada had a ton of flavor. $5 pitchers never hurt anybody's feelings and the mos def dessert (vanilla pudding graham cracker, carmel, walnut miracle) was a solid finish. Friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere, nice patio and really good music. Awesome visit, thank you Richard and Valerie, we will be back soon.
