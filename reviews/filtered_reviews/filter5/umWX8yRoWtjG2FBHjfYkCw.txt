I like everything on the menu.  The food is great but I especially like the chorizo and the flour tortillas.  My two favs are the Oaxaca Special and the foot long chorizo with beans.  It gets really busy at breakfast and lunch.  I would suggest you call in your order if you will be going during their busy times.  It can take a while to get your food if you place your order at the counter when it's busy.  Also,  when you get your food to go make sure you get knives and forks because it might not be in the bag with the food.  The area isn't the greatest and the restaurant itself isn't much but the food makes up for it.
