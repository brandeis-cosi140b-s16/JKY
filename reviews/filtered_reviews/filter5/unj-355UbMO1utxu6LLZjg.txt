FINALLY! I grew up in and around Tamaulipas and I miss genuine homemade Mexican food. This is it. The real deal. The carnitas are so amazing, the chicken is flavorful and moist. They hand cook everything, no premixed anything here. Deserves a visit from Food Network but I'm terrified it'll be ruined afterward. Only have about 10 tables inside so try to come after the lunch rush. So worth the wait.
