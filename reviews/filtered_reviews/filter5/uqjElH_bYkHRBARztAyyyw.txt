I came here for breakfast on my birthday and it was great! I had the chilaquiles rojos with the 2 eggs! Delicious! The chips and salsa with bean dip were excellent! The staff was prompt and friendly! The menu gives you the history of Emiliano Zapata which was entertaining to read about. Will definitely go back to try some dinner entrees!
