This place was delicious. Was seated quickly & the server suggested a señorita drink and chips and salsa to start. Both were delicious!! The señorita especially BC it was like a strawberry moscato mmmm! 

Then we ordered steak fajitas & lobster tacos. Both were so delicious and flavorful...not too spicy but just right & the corn that came on the side was heaven in my mouth!! The blonde manager stopped by to check how everything was, she was really sweet & reminded us to check out taco Tuesday! 

Everything was really good & I can't wait to come back with my family. The decor was really cool & everything wAs great. Next time I want to try the sopes & I was disappointed I didn't order the guacamole when the table next to me did and it looked so good, so I'll definitely try that next time too!
