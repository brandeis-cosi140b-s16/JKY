I'm not a fan of tacos (or Mexican food in general), but the chicken taco I had from Gadzooks was one of the tastiest tacos I have ever hda!

This innovative taco fused the flavors of American South and Mexico by bringing together roasted tomatillo chicken, sweet and spicy cornbread, and honey vinaigrette slaw. The tasty taco was drizzled with jalapeno ranch and cotija cheese, all atop a fresh corn and flour tortilla that was perfectly crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside.
