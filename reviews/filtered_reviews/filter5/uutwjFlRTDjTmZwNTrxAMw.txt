We have loved La Pi√±ata since the 80s when we moved to Phoenix.  The chips and salsa are fresh, the margaritas are tangy, and the green corn tamales are the best ever.  I usually get the Aunt Carlotta's green tamale special, as I did tonight.  I'll be miserable before I'm done but I can't quit eating it!  So good!
