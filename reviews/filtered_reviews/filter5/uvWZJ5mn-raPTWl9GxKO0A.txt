I love this place! I lived in Henderson for 2-3 years and everytime I go back for a visit I have to go here.  It reminded me of the food I grew up on. Homemade corn tortillas, awesome mole, and Milanesa.  I have taken family and friends there and everyone loves it. It does get busy on weekends but there is plenty of parking and they have a bar if you want to have a maragrita while you wait.  

The waiters are friendly and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.
