The salsa and food was amazing. It was very flavorful. It's one of the few restaurants that i've gone to several times (moved to Phoenix recently). I grew up with my parents cooking amazing food, so it's nice to find a place that has chicken that is juicy and has flavor. Many places have big pieces of chicken in their burritos that are just dry. 
Highly recommend this restaurant.
