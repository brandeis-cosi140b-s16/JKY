Hernan was our waiter and he was exceptional. Every time our glasses were close to 1/4 empty he was refilling.

Drink were amazing, strawberry margarita and corona magarita.

Fajitas were quite a show, they looked delicious. Hernan recommended the steak and shrimp and it was money. 

The strawberry sopapita was fantastic.

Definitely recommend that you try this place , great atmosphere and service to back up great food.
