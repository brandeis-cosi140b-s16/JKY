We came back for the entrees as last time we only did aps and dessert.  I honestly am in love with this place!  The chef paco has came out to greet us both times and the servers we have had have been exceptional.  Thanks kendall h for a awesome guac making conversation.  You are missing out if you dont give this place a try.  The best part is you can feel good about eating here!
