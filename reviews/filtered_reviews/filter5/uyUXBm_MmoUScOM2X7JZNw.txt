Went to Zoc's last night and enjoyed a beautiful night on the patio listening to the awesome Freddie Duran and eating dinner.  By the time we left live Salsa music had started playing inside and they were preparing to make their famous street tacos out on the patio.  The energy and atmosphere reminded me why I love AZ!
