Was looking for a place to take my in-laws. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try it. Was a little apprehensive about the location,  but looks can be deceiving.  The place was amazing!!! Excellent service, food was delicious, and it was wrapped up in a very authentic atmosphere!  My husband and I rarely go out for dinner and we've already gone back.
