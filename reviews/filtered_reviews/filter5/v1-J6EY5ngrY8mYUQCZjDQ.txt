This place is so amazing, and totally worth the long walk from the busier part of Las Vegas Boulevard. Even in the middle of July! 

I feel it's best to come here with at least one or two buddies. One, because there are multiple lines that you'll have to stand in if you want different meats. So if you want three tacos with three different meats that are in different lines, just bring two buddies! You can each order everything everyone wants and get it all hot at the same time. 

I highly - HIGHLY - recommend the cabeza tacos. The head meat is SO tender and flavorful, that putting it simply on a taco is the way to go. An absolute must here are the loaded fries. We got them with adobada, but the fries are so perfectly cooked and LOADED with cheese, guac, and everything you would ever want to put in your mouth, that you could top it with mothballs and it would still taste good. My bffski and I went here and completely gorged with tacos, sopes, horchatas, and a full order of fries for only $20. I was also so pleasantly surprised by the large outdoor seating area. It has a roof, so you're not burning in the desert sun. Perfection.  

If you asked me to, I would probably fly into Las Vegas just to come back here. Maybe I need to rearrange my priorities?
