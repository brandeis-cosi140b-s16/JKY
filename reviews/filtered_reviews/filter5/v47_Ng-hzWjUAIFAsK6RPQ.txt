Omg - their Salsa bar is amazing.. A bit spicy but I like spicy.. Horchata was delicious.. their  guacamole has tiny pieces of mango and cranberries - it's semi sweet and just so good.. I hear mole sauce is just heavenly but since I don't eat meat - wasn't able to taste it :( do try their rice - it's flavoured with cilantro and garlic and has tiny pieces of corn.. Everything was just perfect..
