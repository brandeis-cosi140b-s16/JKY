This is hands down my favorite restaurant. I love everything about it and have been eating here since I was a small child.

Order the chili con queso - best cheese dip that I've ever had. And do yourself a favor and order fajitas (duh) -- chicken, shrimp, and steak are all delicious but my personal favorite is the shrimp. The tortillas are made fresh (you can even watch them do it) and are the best tortillas around. The salsa is also fresh and delicious, and the nachos and tortilla soup are good as well.

I have never ordered an entree other than fajitas (though they do have many options) but I think that speaks very highly of the quality of the food considering how many years I have been dining here!
