this place is GREAT!
Came on a Friday night on my last trip to Vegas and I loved it! We had a late dinner at midnight and the service was great, friendly and attentive.
I had the carnitas plate, which was very delicious.  After dinner we went to the club they had inside. Not only was there no cover for everyone all night(!), They were also playing latin music. Cumbias, merengue, etc. Just how I like my clubs! 
I didn't drink much that night (I know, it's Vegas, I was lame...) but I'm sure the drinks are just as good.  Will DEFINITELY come back for dinner and dancing next time!
