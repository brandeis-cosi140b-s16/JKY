I had never gone to this place, until some friends that live in Las Vegas took us there for some real Mexican tacos. The food was freakin' awesome!!! I was dieting for a weight challenge for 3 months, and nothing made me break my diet until I came here to Taco Y Taco. Los vampiros are the best. A definite must do in Vegas!!!
