LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is my new favorite place in town. I just moved here and I will be going to this place every time I crave authentic and cheap Mexican food. The margaritas are awesome, big and cheap! I seriously recommend this place. The staff is very friendly as well. They treated us just like family!
