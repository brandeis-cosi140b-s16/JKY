We thoroughly enjoyed this place! It's a bit pricey, but worth every dime of it! The first time we set-out to go to this place for dinner, we drove around the block 3 times using our navigation and we didn't see it so we gave up. This time we asked neighboring shops and at our second stop, we were guided through their kitchen to the back alley to a random door that looked like a storage closet from outside and mind you, it had no signage on it. And then you enter through the kitchen of Dick's Hideaway as if it's the norm to be directed to a very dark dungeony cave-like dining room. How on earth would even the above average patron find this place??? But I guess that's the concept, hence "Dick's Hideaway."

After such a voyage, I needed to wash my hands, so I was pointed to the bathroom, or should I say "washroom." Never in America have I seen a shower in the restaurant patron's bathroom... until now. I dared my daughter to take a shower but since there was no towel, she opted out.

On to the food. The menu is very southwest (in a good way). We ordered the special of the day, fish trio (smoked salmon, swordfish and mahi) with grilled veggies and hollandaise, 3 enchiladas (pork, beef and smoked turkey), and the garlic butter pasta with grilled chicken for the kiddo. As a cook, I can appreciate all of the freshest ingredients used from the farm fresh grilled veggies to the homemade hollandaise sauce to the fresh made tortillas and mole to my daughter's amazing noodles, which I'd gamble that they are home-made. They have a nice selection of specialty brews, fine wines and their libations are made with fresh fruits and pur√©e which were very tasty and pricey. But my mom always says, you get what you pay for.
