LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I used to think I would never find tacos like this outside of Tijuana. I first tried Tacos el Gordo in San Diego and now this is a MUST stop in every trip to Vegas.  

My favorite tacos are the al pastor and their quesadillas are to die for (I get just cheese on a corn tortilla).

Thank you Tacos el Gordo for making my taco dreams come true!
