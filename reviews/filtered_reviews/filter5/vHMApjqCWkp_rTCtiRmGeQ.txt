Great place.  For the first timer, they let you sample everything on the menu, then teach you how to properly order.  Based off of the taste test, I knew what I wanted and thoroughly enjoyed the tasty fusion experience.  Great food, hope to get out there and visit it again sometime.  Jade Red Chicken is very tasty.
