It's hard to believe it's taken me this long to try and review SOL. I am not much of a happy hour guy but SOL happens to be listed in the top ten places for happy hour in Scottsdale which piqued my interest.

The decor and ambiance are great with light music and very attentive service. I started with a frozen strawberry margarita which was delicious and included fresh strawberry pulp and puree. The menu is quite extensive and varied but only one item caught my attention for consumption: the duck carnanita, a scrumptious deep fried duck leg confit served with three small corn tortilas enough to make three of your own little tacos accompanied by a blackberry sauce, chopped onions and avocado...it was truly a mini feast...and enough to warrant ordering a second one !

The finish ? as brilliant as the rest: a banana bread dark chocolate bread pudding with cinnamon crema and freshly made whipped cream...enough was enough well maybe not I was naughty enough to wander off the premises after signing off our check to go grab a small latte a Press coffee down the street !

Overall, I was very impressed with SOL and it was my very first time tasting Chef Deborah Schneider's cuisine and I must say she is truly a master of her craft !
