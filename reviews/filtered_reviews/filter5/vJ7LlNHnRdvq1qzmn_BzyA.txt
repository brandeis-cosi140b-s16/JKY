I don't get why this place has only 3.5 stars, the food is awesome, the ambiance is really nice and relaxed, and the prices are reasonable. 

The guacamole is so delicious with a sweet sauce on the side... I also had the fish tacos and the veggie burrito (I shared both don't judge me) and both were very delicious - fresh ingredients, not processed, yummy. 

And the patio area is really lovely. Thumbs up all around.
