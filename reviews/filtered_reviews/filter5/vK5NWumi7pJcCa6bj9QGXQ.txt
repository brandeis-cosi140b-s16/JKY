5 stars all the way! I've dined at this location dozens of times and I am always fully satisfied. Try the street platter appetizer. The components vary day to day but it's normally a winner. Also, I am a huge fan of every single taco on the menu. Not crazy about the crab guacamole but what do you expect. Definitely one of my  favorite locations in the area!
