It had been a while since I was here.  Used to go all the time when I lived in the neighborhood, but I'm quite a ways away now.  Still, my wife and I got the urge to stop by.

With everything that has changed in Tempe over the years (I miss Eastside Records being next door to this place), it's nice to see some things haven't changed.  The price may be slightly more than it was, but you can still get a great meal for under $10.00 or, in our case, just getting and sharing teh whole chicken for $12.99 (it will make two meals for two people easily).  

The choice?  Grilled marinated chicken or steak (or a combo plate of both) with corn or flour tortillas and beans, salsa and marinated onions on the side.  And, to note, these are whole beans, not the typical refried you get at most places. It's simple and delicious, and you don't feel like you just consumed a lump of grease and cheese after you're finished eating.  

Yes, they still only take cash or check, but typically regulars know this and make sure they have money on hand before going in.  Also, I'm sure everyone who has eaten here has finished off the rest of their condiments by just mixing the beans, onions and salsa all into one cup.
