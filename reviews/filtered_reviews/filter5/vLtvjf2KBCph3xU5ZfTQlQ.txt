Elmer's is our family's favorite! I'm picky about my beans & rice (after growing up with my nana's homemade) and this is one of the few places I love both. We recently used them to cater a party and everyone commented on how good the food was. Last, but not least, I just saw on the news that they had a perfect health inspection. I  Elmer's!
