okay - we CRAVE this place - it's probably one of our favorite places to go when we have a free afternoon.   the strip mall that it's located in is pretty sketchy, but the food is totally worth it - you'll see!  I've converted tons of my friends to be Chino fans and they are all hooked, too!!  Go in and tell them you've never been in before and they'll hook you up with samples and help with the ordering process (it took me awhile to master that one). The emerald chicken quesadillas are to die for!!!  love it!!!!!
