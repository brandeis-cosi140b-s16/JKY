First time in. I heard a few good things about this place and was intrigued. I got the pork tacos made "T" style as the lady who was helping me called it. Her name was Tea and she was very enthusiastic about it being my first time. She was polite and very devoted to the quality of the product I would be receiving. I must say the pork tacos blew me away. Just enough crunch and great flavor. I will definitely be going back and will bring people to experience the awesomeness.
