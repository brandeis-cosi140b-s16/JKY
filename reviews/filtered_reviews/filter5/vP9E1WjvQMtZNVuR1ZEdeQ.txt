this place is a local favorite but I have either heard people that love it or hate it. I love it. I stick to my favorites as I'm done exploring the menu. their carnitas are not bad their jade red chicken is great. the jerk fried rice is delicious and u always gotta get the black beans! the atmosphere is not the best the employees are nice but the place needs a remodel. it reminds of a soup kitchen. it's totally worth the wait and the environment too!
