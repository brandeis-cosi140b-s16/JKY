The food here is amazing! I came here on lunch with my boss and had the Adobada Torta, their signature sandwich. I have had nothing tastier in even the most expensive sit down Mexican restaurants. Frank knocked it out if the park on this one! the flavors are incredible! between the secret sauce and the carmalized meat its just surging with flavor. I'm soo impressed that I signed up for a yelp account just to write this post. Frank's is one of those small hometown gems, family run that is just so lovable. Thanks for the great food, you have a customer for life!!!
