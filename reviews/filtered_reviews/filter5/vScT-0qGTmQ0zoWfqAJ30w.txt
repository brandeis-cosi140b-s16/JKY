This place is very close to my work and I absolutely love it. The food is wonderful, I have been favoring the guild chicken tacos which is probably their most basic taco but it is full of flavor. I have yet to try the burritos but I have seen them and they look spectacular. They have a touchtunes system so that you can throw on whatever music is available. The church that this restaurant was constructed in is very nice and well maintained, they have even kept the churches stained glass windows! The bar is very inviting and Eric the bartender is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and of course any drink you can think of. Just an absolute joy to be here, I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys Mexican food. Don't pass this place up!
