No clue how I didn't know about this place before...went after a recommendation from a friend and I officially found my new favorite spot. Had the cilantro rubbed shrimp, tomato mozzarella pizza and chocolate fudge/ice cream dessert. Sat next to the fireplace and relaxed for 2 hours, it was like a time warp. In a good way.
