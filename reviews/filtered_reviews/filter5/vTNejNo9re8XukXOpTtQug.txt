My mom is from Santa Fe. I lived in New Mexico for over 20 years. I have eaten my way up and down the entire state of New Mexico. I have eaten at every well known and every hidden little dive in that state. So I think that my opinion should carry a little weight (just my 2 cents).

The food at Dick's Hideaway is on par with the very best in Santa Fe. All of the dishes are made from scratch. I don't think there is anything in that kitchen that has ever seen a can. Every time I eat there I don't wanna brush my teeth for a few days so I can lick my chops and relive the  whole thing all over again.

I plan to go there this Saturday morning again, and invited my two brothers to join me. We will all enjoy Huevos Rancheros, over medium eggs, with beans and fried potatoes smothered in beautiful dark red New Mexican red chile..YUM!!!
