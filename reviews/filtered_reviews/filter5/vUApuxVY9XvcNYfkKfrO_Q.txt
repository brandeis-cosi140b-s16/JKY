Absolutely the best meal I've ever eaten in any airport anywhere (and I've been in a  lot airports).  At the waiters suggestion, I ordered huevos rancheros (without sour cream) and coffee for breakfast.  The food was awesome -- the perfect mixtures of sunny side up eggs, potatos, sausage, beans and cheese.

Not good for a diet -- a guilty pleasure for sure.  Will always eat there when in Phoenix.
