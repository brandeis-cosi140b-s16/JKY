We were craving Mexican food and happened to stumble upon this place. The first thing we noticed was the Amazing view of the valley. You can see the strip perfectly! It was my first time here and they immediately brought us chips and salsa with beans. Yum! Hector was very friendly and Jorge was very knowledgable. 

I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and they were spicy, but so good. The flour tortillas they came with taste like they are homemade. I also had the Margarita and it was a pretty good size. 

All in all this place was a great experience and we will be back.
