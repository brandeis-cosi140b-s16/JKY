Actually awesome. My friend and I shared the mushroom enchiladas and paella, so we could get a taste of each. I was nervous about the seafood in the paella not being fresh, but I was wrong. It tasted great, not fishy at all. The mushroom enchiladas were good, nothing special but still quite tasty. The service was nice, too. For a college kid, yeah this is a bit pricey, but go here on a date, for a special occasion, or with your parentals! Loved it.
