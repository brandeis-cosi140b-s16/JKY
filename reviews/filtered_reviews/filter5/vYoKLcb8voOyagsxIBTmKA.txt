Emiliano's has never ever disappointed me! I have been here several times and never had a bad experience. The food has always been awesome here. My favorite drink is the coronarita and my wife's favorite drink is the margarita which is the one of the best one you can find in Pittsburgh. If you are in the South Side area and craving Mexican food, this is the place for you!
