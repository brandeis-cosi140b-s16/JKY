I love los favs! Everything that I have ever ordered here has been super delicious. This place puts all the other fast food mexican chains to shame! I order my usual burrito (bean and cheese with rice, potato, and guacamole). I get my food fast and it is always right! Friendly service and cheep! And I love how quickly they're expanding. Go los!
