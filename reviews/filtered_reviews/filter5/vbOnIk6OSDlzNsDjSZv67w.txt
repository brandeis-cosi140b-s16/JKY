This place is in my TOP 5 of all time restaurants!!!

I had the Spicy Pork sopas and that was on of the best foods I had ever eaten. I had 2 sopas, the beef tongue tacos and carne asada taco. If you are on the strip and want an explosion of flavorful food, this is definately the place to come. The spicy pork name comes from the spices that it is marinated in rather than a hot spicy marinate. I will be back whenever I come to town.
