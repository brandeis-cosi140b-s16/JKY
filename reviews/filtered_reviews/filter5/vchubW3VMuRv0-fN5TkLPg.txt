I just EASILY had the BEST lunch I've ever eaten!  It was THAT good!

The chicken tortilla soup was out of this world...light and delicate...fresh and HOT!!!
I had two fish tacos with no tortilla.  One was a regular fish taco and the other was a beer battered fish taco.l

The fire roasted salsa was EASILY the best salsa I have ever had, too!

This place is a serious gem!  I could go there every single day!

Thanks guys!!
