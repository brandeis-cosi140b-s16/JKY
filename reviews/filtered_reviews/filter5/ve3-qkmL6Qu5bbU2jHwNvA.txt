Great Mexican place! My husband and I found it randomly and we were very satisfied. I was very pleased with the Enchiladas Verdes and Enchiladas de Mole, they are way better that the ones at Lindo Michoacan and half the price! 
The place is convenient located and looks very clean. Staff is friendly and helpful.
