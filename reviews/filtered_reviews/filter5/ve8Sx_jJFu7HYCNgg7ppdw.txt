Maybe I just had an usually smooth experience here, but I loved it! I fully expected it to be douchey as hell, based on the whole marketing B.S...but I was really pleasantly surprised and will be back!

My experience was around 8pm on a Wednesday evening, we were seated immediately at a good table, the service was EXCELLENT and very attentive, and what I ordered was fantastic!

I had the huarache, which was fanTAStic. The meat was seasoned well and everything just came together perfectly. Even the chips & salsa they put out are amazing...some of the best tortilla chips I've had at a Mex place.

My friend had the carnitas platter, which he wasn't thrilled with but said it was OK. And we shared a pitcher of margaritas. I think the total tab was $70...not too bad, seeing as we had 3 small margaritas each, plus food.
