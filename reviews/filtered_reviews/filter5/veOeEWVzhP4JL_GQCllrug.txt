I have found the hidden gem of Phoenix. Woohoo!

I was recommended Gallo Blanco from a bartender at Windsor, another awesome place to check out. Being new (4 months) to Phx and coming from LA, the land of amazing food, I was asking around for some good places to check out that only a local may know about. 

Gallo Blanco was a perfect recommendation. Off the beaten path, this place is located at The Clarendon Hotel. This boutique hotel is awesome. Great pool, cool furniture and light fixtures, bar on the roof, AZ license plates as door numbers. Anyway, Gallo Blanco is next to the lobby and on the front patio of Clarendon. The vibe and aesthetic of Gallo Blanco is hip but not pretentious. The staff is very friendly and informative with recommendations. My new obsession of Ceviche was fulfilled here. A lot of places don't have good ceviche, but Gallo Blanco's was amazing!

I also got a Halibut Fish Taco and a Carne Asada Beef Taco. These were good but next time I think I will ask for some Pico de Gallo to go along with them as I think it was missing a little something. My boyfriend enjoyed his beef, fish, and cochinata tacos. I also loved my Horchata. AND the prices were great!

This is going to be my spot. My default place to go out, my place to bring visitors, and more importantly my place to rave about to locals who don't know about it. I don't mind sharing :)
