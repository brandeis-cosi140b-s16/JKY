Everything here is delicious and the prices a very cheap. We saw this place in yelp and I knew I had to have it. The first time there we ordered the fusion tacos and the fusion tostadas which are made with rice patties. Both of these items tasted heavenly and we have definitely been back to that place time and time again. If you are a food fanatic this is the place for you. ENJOY!
