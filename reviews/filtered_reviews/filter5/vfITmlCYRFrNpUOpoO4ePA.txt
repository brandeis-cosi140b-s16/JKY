Great food. All the ingredients are fresh. The staff was always cutting and prepping. The server was very nice and was smiling and genuinely cared if we enjoyed our meal. 
I ordered a chicken salad and my wife ordered chicken quesadilla, and of Course two Mexican corns which were amazing and only 2 bucks!! I will come back without question. Oh and they have real Mexican coke which is a plus.
