Really outstanding cuisine, brilliantly yet simply executed (and I consider myself a Mexican food aficionado).  This resto will not disappoint.  From the build your own guac to the street corn (you must try the street corn), the poke - yummm!!   to the tacos (the "tako," the "korean," and the "carnitas").  The specialty cocktails, the service, the food- everything lived up to our expectations.  They even brought two specialty salsas without cilantro.  Went to a few other restaurants during a recent trip to PGH and felt like leaving them to go back to täkō.
