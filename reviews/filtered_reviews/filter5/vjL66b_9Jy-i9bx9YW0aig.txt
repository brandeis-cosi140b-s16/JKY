Just recently I relocated to Las Vegas from San Diego aka "The Land of the Best Mexican Food" lol ok ok Maybe that's just my personal opinion. Since we've moved out here we have been on the hunt for decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. My friend Lacey introduced me to Lindo Michoacan in Henderson location. I so impressed with the beautiful setting over looking the Las Vegas skyline. I've been to the Henderson location a few times and every time I have such a great experience. The food was amazing!!! I enjoyed the "Gallo al Chipotle Estilo" and the freshly made Guacamole. They have live music, freshly maid tortillas, the Henderson location has the best night view of Las Vegas and how can you beat fresh Guacamole!!!!!??!?!?? Great costumer service, great food, great ambiance, hands down my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas.
