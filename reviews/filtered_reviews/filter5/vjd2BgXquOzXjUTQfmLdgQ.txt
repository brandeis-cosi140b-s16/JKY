My husband had a meeting for work in Charlotte. I decided to tag a long and while searching for a place to have dinner, we realized Pacos Tacos was walking distance for us from the Marriott. Not knowing what to anticipate... Our expectations were met for sure. Great food, wonderful drinks and a fun atmosphere. We would highly recommend this restaurant as a date night or for families. Also would recommend the cucumber jalape√±o margarita! Cheers
