Was in the Phoenix area this past weekend with the family for my wife's reunion with old high school friends and classmates.  Chino Bandito was the last stop before heading back to California and it was worth it.  My family and I are fans of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and have been to 7 places from that show and none have been disappointments. In fact, Chino Bandito is probably the best Triple D restaurant we have eaten at with HRD Coffee Shop in San Francisco second.

We arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before opening but they let us in anyway instead of waiting outside.  We told them this was our first time eating there and they gave us samples of their most popular dishes.  Each dish tasted very good individually, but the secret of this place is when you eat them together.  I couldn't believe how Jamaican, Mexican, and Chinese flavors could match so well.  Re-fried black beans with jerk chicken fried rice, combined with emerald chicken and BBQ pork?  A very unusual combo but it actually works...and works almost to perfection.  My wife and my mother loved the food as much as I did.  Finally, to cleanse your pallet, Chino Bandito also gave us complementary homemade Snicker doodle cookies, which were also fantastic.

This place is like a perfect storm of flavors.  You can taste each individual dish and then find new flavors when blended together.  I could go back again and again and still think I am going there for the first time.  Chino Bandito is that good.  The only criticism I can think of is that it may be a little expensive, which I always complain about, but in this case it is well worth the price.

If you are in the area, Chino Bandito must be on your to-do list.  You won't regret it.
