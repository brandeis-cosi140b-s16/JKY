I have been looking so hard for GOOD Mexican food in the Phoenix area and I finally after 8 months found it here. The green chili burrito is SO amazingly good. Try it enchilada style, even better. The owner Richie is a great man and knew my name the second time I went in (over a month apart) and every person who came in and out he knew by name. If you haven't tried it you need to. The only disappointment, they are closed Sunday and Monday :(
