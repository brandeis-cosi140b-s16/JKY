Ate here last night with family that was visiting and it was delicious! We had the traditional guacamole, trio of salsas, pastor tacos, pancita tacos, chile relleno, coconut flan and the spiced chocolate cake. Everything was amazing! It is served traditional tapas style so the food comes out as it is ready and that was fine by us. We will definitely be returning here.
