Staying on the Strip in Vegas and Yelp'd this place on our way back from a day trip. This place IS as good as they say! Don't be put off by the strip mall location. It's very nice inside. VERY friendly and attentive wait staff. I informed our waiter that my wife can't do cilantro (I happen to like it but it bugs me when chefs toss it on everything but oatmeal (Bobby Flay do you hear me? So he made sure that there was no cilantro (except some on the side for me). He even had the chef slice up some nice avocado instead of giving us guacamole which had cilantro. Super margaritas. Chip, salsa you expect, but the EXCELLENT warm bean dip was a delicious surprise if I lived near here I would come in for margaritas and chips and the bean dip. We had fajitas for two, chicken and pork. SO MUCH FOOD! And skillfully prepared. Very fresh and al dente veg. Cup of soup included was delish as well. Can't tell you about dessert, we never made it through HALF of our fajitas!!
