Digging it , went in really quick wanted to try something new , very tasty reminded me of smothered (wet) burritos back in Colorado , I had the pork chili verde, if you eat pork I would recommend it , guy who helped me was very nice , food was made very quickly but well , everything was good , if you want a step up from something like Robertos or anything like that this is a good option for sure . Prices are fare as well .
