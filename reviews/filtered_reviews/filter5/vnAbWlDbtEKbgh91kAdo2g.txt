To begin with, get Omar the Bar Manager to make you the best Cadillac Margarita you'll ever drink.

Next up: Sonrisa Grill's tacos are made on a unique hard/soft taco shell prepared individually on the grill for each order.  Best tacos I ever ate, period. If you go on a Tuesday It's all the tacos you can eat for one price.

They are located in one of the coolest architecturally designed buildings you'll ever eat in. A great patio for outdoor dining too.

There's a classical style guitarist that plays incredible Santana songs.

The owner is a wonderful Thai lady who aims to please and she hits her target every time!

I've never written a review anywhere before but you can't go wrong at Sonrisa Grill.
