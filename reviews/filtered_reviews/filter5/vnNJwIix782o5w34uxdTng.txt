Ate here with a friend and wow was it ever delicious. The peach lemonade was absolutely delicious. The burgers were awesome. Seriously one of the best it's a double burger we added cheese and bacon and it comes with lettuce onion and tomato. Now the fries! Oh my they are great with skin on, they have a salty and slightly spicy thing going on. I will come again even if I have to drive across town to get here
