My girlfriend and I went out for date night here recently and really enjoyed the food and service. I have a difficult time paying high dollar for Mexican food because there is such an abundance of authentic Mexican restaurants around the valley, but this place is a bit more upscale and the drink selection is extensive. Highly recommend.
