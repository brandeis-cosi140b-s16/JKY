El Hefe is one of my favorite spots... whether it's a packed Saturday night or a laid back Tuesday evening. Either way, it's always a good time! Their churros are unreal. They are cooked to perfection and come with 3 different dipping sauces. Their tacos are bomb too! And let's talk about the drinks... the beer-garita is awesome. Margartia + Corona? Genius. And the fact that you can pour your own beer at the tables using taps is pretty kickass in my book too. Overall, my go to spot in Old Town!
