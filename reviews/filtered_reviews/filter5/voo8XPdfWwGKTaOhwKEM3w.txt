Really impressed with this place.  We got takeout and my friend Trish out ordered me, luckily we were sharing :)  

She got the pan fried fish and I had the chicken bulgogi.  The fish was lightly fried and really fresh...hence all the great fish taco reviews here as well I guess.

Service was a bit slow but they brought us free chips while were waiting.  There is a really good vibe with the people that work here.  They seem to be happy to be working here, rare for vegas!

I can't wait to try more at KoMex...wish I lived closer!  :(
