I've missed authentic arepas since I moved to Charlotte, until I found this place that is! Great arepa will flavorful meat and sauces. Plentiful portions and great queso. Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get and the quality of the food. This will become my new go-to place for authentic South American style food.
