How I missed reviewing this place in my Yelping escapades is beyond me. 

Bold statement in 3...2...1....Chapala's is the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas...I know, I just blew your mind. But seriously, the food is that good. It's a staple dining option in the Jason L. household.

WARNING, please do not let the following statement deter you from going. Their salsa is below average. If they had great salsa I might give them a bonus star. Not sure why, it's pretty generic mild & hot soupy salsa. An improvement here and this would be a huge bonus.

I've eaten various things on the menu, my favorite would have to be the Enchiladas Ranchera. The creamy white sauce they use is awesome, and hard to find elsewhere. Always cooked to perfection. They have outstanding beans and rice to compliment the entree. Service is generally very good. If your not feeling the Enchilada vibe then go a little lighter with the Grampa Tostada. You have the option of a meat (chicken is juicy, moist, and you receive a generous portion). Their traditional enchiladas and tacos are also excellent. Ground beef always has great flavor and their enchilada sauce isn't weird (you know what I mean, that mole/cinnamony strange sauce we all come across from time to time). 

Another warning and tip...they offer coupons in the LV Review Journal on Wednesday's in the Taste Section and Friday's in the Night & Day pull out. *warning* They will not accept the coupon if it's not presented prior before placing your order. Do not test them, they have signs (every-friggin-where).
