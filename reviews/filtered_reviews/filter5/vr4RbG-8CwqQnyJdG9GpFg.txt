The best thing about this restaurant is the waitress Marcia. if it wasn't for her then we would never go back. she is so kind and pleasant and thoughtful and attentive and the list goes on and on. we only go when she's there and we only sit in her section she takes care of all of our needs and more. we love her and we love the food and when she's not there we walk right back out she is their biggest asset and she deserves a raise and a bonus and a plaque on the wall I love Marcia I love this restaurant
