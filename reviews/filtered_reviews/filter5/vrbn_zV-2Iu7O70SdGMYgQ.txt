The NEW America's Taco Shop  opened today and I was the first most #1 customer.

As usual I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was fantastic.

So good in fact that I went back and got a Carne Asada Burrito to go for dinner (which also makes me the first repeat customer).

Great new location on 7th Ave just south of Campbell.
