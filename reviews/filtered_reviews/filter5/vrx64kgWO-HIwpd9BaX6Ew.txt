Omg swoon!!!! Best food I've had since moving here from San Francisco actually made me feel like I was back in my familiar foodie scene in s.f now where are the shots of jager... Oh shit right I don't work here just eating here. 
Ok so here I go I had the diver scallops.... Amazeballs!!!! They were grilled to perfection not at all over cooked which happens all too often with scallops! Had grille octopus on top and serano ham slices that I think were flashed fried... On top of a delicious sauce. Seriously I would injure someone for another serving. Also a great selection of wine which I'm always a fan of.
We all shared the espresso churros came with a milkshake that used all my will power not to try (lactose intolerant and all) boo for that btw. Anyways I'm not a dessert person but damn those were tasty deliciousness! Coffee press with dessert too coffee was amazing I'm still on a coffee high. So this is why my friends won't let me drink coffee after 3... It's  all coming full circle now. :) 
Totally try this place out! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm yummy in my tummy!
