Tried Rito's for the first time last week (thank you Yelp) and was very pleased. The food was excellent, the place was very clean, and the service was outstanding. I had the red chili burrito enchilada style and loved every bite. There isn't a lot of flash (no secret ingredients or unique options) but the quality is very high and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get. 

I should also mention that they use certified Angus beef, which is pretty impressive for a small burrito shop in Surprise! Will definitely come back!
