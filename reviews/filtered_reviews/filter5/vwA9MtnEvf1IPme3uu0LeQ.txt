When you arrive here, you could be a little put off by the location. Don't worry, go in and enjoy! These guys are fantastic, and they really make you feel welcomed! Get the pork adobada tacos, infact get 3 and then add a carne asada into the mix! This place is the real deal and is as close to authentic as you will get this side of the border. Can't wait to go back!
