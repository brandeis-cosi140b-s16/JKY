I have dined at Milagro Grill numerous times and not once have I had a bad experience. The staff is friendly and efficient, the food is to die for, and the cocktails are unique and refreshing! **Be sure to try the raspberry habanero margarita** The Johnson family did an amazing job at making this a friendly spot for the whole neighborhood. The managers always make it a point to stop by and greet the tables when they have a chance, and that is very important. The patio is my favorite, it puts Milagro above every other restaurant in the valley. Everyone should try the place out, its great!!
