We came for Christmas Eve and had a spectacular meal. The service was attentive but relaxed. We were not rushed through our meal as the other reviews indicated.  We would highly recommend the guacamole by the table and the glazed pork belly appetizer.   Margaritas were delicious.   A wow experience. I wish we lived around here so we could experience it again.
