I bought a adobava "navajo taco", rice,beans, sopapilla, and a soda.  The total was around $10.  It wasn't that great of a value.  The meat was really good.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  The refried beans were really dry, which was kinda gross.  A "navajo taco" is apparently some sort of flat bread thing.  It was okay, but I think I'd rather just have a normal corn tortilla.  All in all the place is alright, but I don't feel I got my money's worth.

Edit: From 3 to 5 stars.  I was young and dumb when I wrote that review above.  While I'm still not into the navajo taco or the combo deal, there are a couple of items that are simply amazing that I love.

The carlitos special burrito is great.  Just meat and sauce.  No beans, no lettuce (which doesn't belong on a burrito anyways), no rice (which also never belongs on a burrito).  Gotta get it covered with sauce and cheese.  Both the red sauce and the green sauce have an appropriate amount of kick that makes it spicy but not overbearing.  I usually end up with the pork verde when doing the burrito.

The nachos are the best nachos I've ever had in my life.  The chips are seasoned with this stuff I can't explain.  They go real easy on the refried beans.  Guacamole is great.  There's a touch of sauce in there too (can't remember if red or green) which gives the occasional burst of spice.  No lettuce (doesn't belong on there anyways).  I usually get the steak which are good sized chunks and flavorful.  The best part is that they somehow found a way to get cheese on every bite.  Melted gooey/clumpy cheese.....yummmm
