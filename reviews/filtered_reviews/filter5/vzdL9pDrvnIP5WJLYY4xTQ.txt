Wow. The food was absolutely amazing. All organic ingredients, simple, authentic and delicious recipes made for some really great dishes. The guacamole was made fresh right at our table and the margaritas were perfection, no syrupy super sweet sour mix was used. The staff was really down to earth and attentive. Chef Paco even came out to deliver our ridiculously awesome flan dessert. He cooks with love and you can tell.
