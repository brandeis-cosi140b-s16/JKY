Love this place.   It's nice to sit back, play trivia, have a drink and have chips and salsa.  My favorite is the chips and bean dip.  The pork and sour cream is so yummy!   Roy the bartender/Manager takes good care of us and remembers what we like with food and drinks so half the time we don't even need a menu.   Everyone is always nice to us whenever we come.
