Chino's is as good as it gets. 

The food is creative, delicious and simply amazing!

I love the different combinations of items, and more than anything else, I love the fun, homey, comfortable atmosphere and the incredibly friendly and generous owners.

I think this restaurant concept is perfect for franchising. The food is super creative and different than any other "fusion" restaurant (or at least from what I could find on the Internet!) I wish there were chains of it here in California so that I could get my Chino's fix everyday instead of twice a year!

My favorites are :
- Jen red pork 
- Hen grenade (in a quesadilla or burito)
- Emerald chicken (on its own with fried rice or in a quesadilla)
- I don't like beans in general, but I LOVE the black beans as well as the refried beans here. Don't know what their secret recipe for these two dishes are, but whatever it is, I LOVE it!
- Snickerdoodles!!! I pick up a dozen or two and bring back with me to California each time I come. If I am lucky and I happen to be there during the weekend when they make "Volcano" cookies, then I am really LUCKY cuz these are the BEST!
