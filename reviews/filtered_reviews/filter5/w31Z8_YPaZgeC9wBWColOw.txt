The food here was definitely on point. I ordered the fish taco dinner and they were some of the best fish tacos I have had. They also had a wide variety of Jarritos flavors, including grapefruit. The outdoor seating is a little bit close to the street, but it is a relatively quiet street. The wait staff was also extremely attentive and refilled waters and got us more tortilla chips. Also the salsas were delicious. Wish it was closer to campus, because I would go all the time!
