My name is Duncan and I'm an 8 year old Staffy Bulldog. My mom and dad have taken me to eat on the patio at Verde 3x's. The first 2 times Dad shared the his absolutely fabulous chicken dinner with me but last night both of the P's wanted something spicy. Mom got the scallop special which she LOVED! She still can't figure out the exact combination of flavors that were in the corn creme, cilantro? dried peaches? very tasty and interesting. Dad got the fish tacos and YUM! So what was I to do? John, my favorite waiter in the world, sold my dad a small bowl of chicken they roasted in the kitchen just for ME! I'm so glad Mom and Dad love the food at Verde and that dogs are welcome on the patio, they said we will be going back a lot!!!!
