It's opening day and this place deserves an excellent review! I have been to the other locations and I can say that this one is right up to the standard of the others.  I got a steak and chicken bowl loaded with rice and other mix ins. This food is loaded with flavor and quality at a great price. I'm glad they opened this location here close to my work. The fusion of island flavors to a line style ordering system similar to chipotle or cafe rio makes this great for a quick lunch stop with a different twist. They have a regular in me and hopefully you will find the same opinion.
