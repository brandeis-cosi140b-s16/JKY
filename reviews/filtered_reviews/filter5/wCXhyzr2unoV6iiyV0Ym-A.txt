I love this restaurant it is my absolute favorite! I love the vibe of all the workers and most of all the food. The food tastes fresh and the flavor is amazing. I bring all my friends and family to show them the wonderful food. This is my favorite location too cause of the workers, I especially adore Tea! Every time I come in she has a smile and provides the best customer service I've ever seen! She's amazing!!
