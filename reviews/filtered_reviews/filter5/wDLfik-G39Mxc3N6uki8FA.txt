Just ate there for first time with a good friend visiting from out of town. We sat at a high top in the bar area to catch up, and to watch a little of the Denver game. Dyana was our waitress, and she (and the whole experience) was Awesome. Her recommendations were excellent, service was fast, and she was totally accommodating. We started with the ceviche and pitcher of sangria, had an assortment of tacos, and finished with the flan. GET THE FLAN :). I live in the East Valley but if I'm ever near the Biltmore, I'll be heading here for sure.
