It is a Butcher shop and a Cafe combined. Heard about this place on the Jan D'Altry radio show and could not remember where it was until it popped up on a review by Lindsey D. Thank Goodness.

Great place to get some really good Hobe Meats in Scottsdale. I like it better than the 16th Street location. Nice fresh selection of prime cuts. Service was extremely friendly and helpful. Being a sausage maker myself we talked about making sausage at home and recipes for quite a while. Very cool. They also have exotic game in the freezer for those that are feeling adventurous. I brought home a little of everything to try and it was delicious.

The Cafe has a sit down menu with Mexican selections that you can choose from for a great tasting meal or snack. I saw some colorful items coming out of the kitchen. One being the Tacos al Pastor. It both looked and smelt awesome. Can't wait to go back and eat something off the menu as well. Five thumbs up!
