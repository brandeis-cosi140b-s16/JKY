AMAZING "street taco" place. Only $2 a taco! RIGHT??
I have been to both locations, this one and the one on the strip.
Both are fantastic!

I love it SO MUCH! It reminds me of when I have visited Tijuana, then I found out that is where the original one is! YES - so happy!

Yes, it kind of looks like a dive. Trust me,Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO! - And I am frequently the ONLY Gringo in the place when we are here!


Here is the deal- the food is super tasty.
The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked "gyro style" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a "Mulas" taco here. Which is basically a melted cheese, meat of your choice taco sandwich - OMG SO GOOD!

Go to either location and enjoy!
