So I didn't actually go there to eat, but my friend and I went to VIDA!, the late night club there on Friday. It's mostly Latin music.. reggaeton and some salsa bachata and merengue. I went to Puerto Rico last summer and this transported me back there for a couple hours. DJ Gil Barba and his boy did the damn thing! WHAT! I walked in dancing and walked out dancing. My feet were on fire when we left (and our drunk asses did the 'smart' thing and walked back from MGM to PH).

The guys and the girls really know how to move (I'm not so bad, either, at merengue and salsa) here so bring your A-game. The guys will actually ask you to dance, instead of grinding their pelvises against you and then asking you..maybe, if you're lucky, like at some of the other clubs.

Definitely the sleeper club in Vegas. It's not crowded to the point of a mosh pit, the music's good, the people actually KNOW how to dance!! People get your sh*t together and go to VIDA! Friday nights!!
