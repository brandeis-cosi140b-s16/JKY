I cannot believe I have not yet Yelped that Bonito Michoacan es muy bueno! I've eaten here several times with friends when I visit Vegas, but this time brought family here! I know they thought I was crazy leaving the strip, but I told them it was well worth the short trip! Two family members are Mexican and took a long time to study the menu. They are both from California and have never seen some of these entrees on a menu except in Mexico!

The complimentary bean dip is good and the tableside, fresh-made guacamole is the best! My niece does not usually eat guacamole and she loved it here! I've had some of the lengua dishes before and they are the best I've had! This trip I had the Biria de Chivo (a type of goat soup). I have not had goat since I was in Greece in the 90's and this was so tasty and tender with excellent spice. My only issue is that I did not have room for more! Oh, and let's not forget the margaritas! They actually make them with tequila...good and strong...wink, wink. Fantastico!

If you want to enjoy REAL Mexican food at a fraction of the price of restaurants on the strip, then this is the place! Great food, great service, great prices and more money for Blackjack!
