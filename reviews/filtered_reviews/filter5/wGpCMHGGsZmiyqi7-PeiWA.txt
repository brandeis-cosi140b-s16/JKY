My group had Fry Bread, Tacos, and Burritos. Carne, chicken, beef. All were DELICIOUS and flavorful. Love the look and feel of the place (reminds me of my favorite taco stop in Tucson). When you go in it's like you've found a delicious surprise restaurant hidden away from public eye. The fresh ingredients on the plates were refreshing.They have an open kitchen so you can see everything that's going on. Then, on top of that, expansive menu was impressive.
I want to go back- and I'll tell people I had great food+service there.
