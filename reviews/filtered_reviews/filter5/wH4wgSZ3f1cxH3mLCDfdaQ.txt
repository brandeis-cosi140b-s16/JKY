Went here for the first time today and I have to say that they have the best menudo I've had so far in the valley.

Service is a little slow but I kinda like that for a Saturday morning breakfast place... never feel like you are being rushed out the door.

I would like to come back and try some of their other food but for now I'll be coming back for the menudo
