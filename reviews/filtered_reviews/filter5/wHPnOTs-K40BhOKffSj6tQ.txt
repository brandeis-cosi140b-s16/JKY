Located on the west side of 16th St. between Osborn and Thomas Road in a tiny old strip mall in the heart of the 'hood, it's not called Barrio for nothing.  This has gone from great neighborhood find to being written up in the New York Times as a "must do" when in Phoenix, so be early or be prepared to wait.  The food and atmosphere def have a funky yet festive, artsy feel.  The food is along the similar vein of Padres; but featuring a guacamole appetizer that shouldn't be missed as it's mixed for you fresh at your table and served with big round chips ...yum!  Again with the desert ...some chocolate creation to die for!  Moderately priced.
