Literally my #1 good spot for Mexican that isn't too heavy.  Great margaritas and theres never a wait for seating.  Nice patio, bar, or dining room seating options.

Pros:
Organic margarita
Sonoran rolls
Ultimate chimi
Grilled fish tacos
Requested hot sauce
Friendly team service
Great parking and location off 101 & Scottsdale rd

Cons:
House chips not homemade
House salsa is bland, prob not homemade

The hunny and I here keep coming back here each month to get the Sonoran rolls or grilled fish tacos- so yummy!  We made a date night a few times at blue agave and then picked up dessert from whole foods across the street . :)
