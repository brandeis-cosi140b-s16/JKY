Jose knocks it out of the park again. Everything works in this place from the downscale but crisp decor to the lobster taco to the Mexicana mommas hammering out freshly made tortillas. 

You might think Chinese and Mexican a strange mix but this food is playful, creative the really tasty. It just works, the flavor profiles fit like a hand into a smooth fitted kid glove. 

The air salt margarita and lemon drop served with chopsticks (because you need them) are just the icing on the Jose Andres cake
