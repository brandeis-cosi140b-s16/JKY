Normally I wait until at least a second visit to write a review but in this case there is no need. My companions have dined here several times before and commented extensively about their experiences.
TYou might think just like I do Mexican food is Mexican food, in this case it is a totally different flavorful experience.

The food here taste fantastic! So I had to ask our server what the secret is. Of course she couldn't divulge it all but the basics is a lot of marinade and smoking. Even the refried beans have a wonderful smoky flavor to die for.

In addition to wonderful food was excellent smoky flavor there is a wide variety of sauces to choose from, and the servers are all very happy to work here. Lastly the place is decorated way over the top for a Mexican food restaurant it's eye-candy for the Sonoran taste palate.
