Beautiful restaurant.  Great food.  Great service. What more could you ask for.  I read a review below that said the portions were small.  Um... not sure how much that person eats but there was definitely no issue with portion size at this restaurant. I had the Fajitas... they were fantastic!  We also did the table side guacamole, and of course this was after the complimentary chips and salsa you get first.  And they give you two types of salsa, one medium, one mild.  For dessert, the Flan!  Everything was fantastic!
