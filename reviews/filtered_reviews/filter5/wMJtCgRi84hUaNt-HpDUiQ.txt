Came here with a small group of coworkers today and we all had a great time. The staff was very friendly and fun. Our particular waiter looked like he was training someone, but that did not stop him from providing great service to us. Our chip, salsa and drink refills were great. Everyone seemed to like being at work and help out with all tables. It is a little confusing when you aren't quite sure if the man or woman walking by is a waiter or guest, name tags or something would be helpful lol. The menu is nice and simple and the presentation is very clean. Our beans and rice needed a little salt, but that's probably that healthy effort kicking in. I had the carne asada, carnitas and standard tacos, they were sooo good. I WILL be back to try more of their items, I would like to see this place in the evenings. Seems like a cool place to sit and have some drinks. No complaints from anyone in our party, definitely happy with this establishment.
