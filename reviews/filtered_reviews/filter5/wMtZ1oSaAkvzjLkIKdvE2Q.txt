I come here almost every time  I visit Vegas! I've tried their tacos and sopes de asada and al pastor and both a freakin delicious! Their asada fries look so good, I may have to try it next time. 
I visited their location on the strip once and it was pretty bad. Yesterday we found out they closed that location and relocated. I honestly prefer this one anyways. Food taste way better here.
