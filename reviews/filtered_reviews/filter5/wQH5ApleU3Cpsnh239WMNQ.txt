Gluten free! I love this place. I can't eat everything her including the fries and the gluten free bun didn't fall apart! The staff was friendly and happy. The shakes were to die for. This is our new go to spot for sure! It has a drive through as well, which is pretty convenient. I'm telling everyone I know about this place. So good!!!
