The service is off the charts.  Always friendly, attentive, never pushy.  Food is good, prices are very reasonable (especially compared with Lindo).  I don't know any place where you can get lunch fajitas for less than ten bucks.  Seems word has gotten out as well, it's getting more crowded as we visit more (which is great).  I hope they do really well.
