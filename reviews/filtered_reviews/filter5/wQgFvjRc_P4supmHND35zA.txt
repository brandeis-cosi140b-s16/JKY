Gardunos is AWESOME! Free chips and salsa to start. Played it safe and ordered a quesadilla, probably one of the best I have ever had. Large enough portions to fill up my boyfriend which I previously though was impossible. All for under $30 for 2 people. Great atmosphere, fast service, and awesome food!
