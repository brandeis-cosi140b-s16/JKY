Wow.  You gotta go here.  The food was great.  Salsa was good.  Plates were very hot.  Enchaladias were perfect.  I will be going back here.  We took taxi's there.  When we wanted to leave, we found that they have a very nice sized shuttle.  So they took our party of ten downtown.  Very cool.  As always, it is a good idea to make reservations.
