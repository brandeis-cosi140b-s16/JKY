We decided to try this place because of the reviews. We walked in and they were super friendly (We must have looked lost because they walked us through how to order. They also offered us a lot of samples of the different meats.  After trying 12 different ones (including cows tongue - which was really good until I found out what it was) we settled on the Asada Burrito and a couple of tacos. The shredded beef is awesome so is the Al Pastor (marinated pork). I found the salsa bar had some great variety and the ones I tried were really good.  I'll stop again next time I'm in Vegas.
