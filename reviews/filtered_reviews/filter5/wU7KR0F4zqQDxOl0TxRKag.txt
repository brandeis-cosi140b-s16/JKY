This is a Mexican restaurant with class and style. We were greeted at the door with a smile and hospitality. Although you may order the typical dishes you would see at other Mexican restaurants, our table ordered some of the more unusual items such as Buey Al Cilantro (rib eye with verde sauce) and Carnitas a la Coca-Cola (pork cooked in Coke). The flavors were great. Service was pleasant and prompt.
Not impressed with the cramped width between our booth and a nearby table of twenty nor the AC blowing directly on us.
Why the 5 stars? For focus on the customer. 
We had a $15 cab ride from the LVH to the restaurant but were delightfully surprised to be offered a ride back to our hotel via their own shuttle at the end of the meal (no charge). Good job!
