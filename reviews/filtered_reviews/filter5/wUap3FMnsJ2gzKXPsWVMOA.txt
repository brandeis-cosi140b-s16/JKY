The service here was amazing.  The food was just as good.  We were visiting family and we love coming here with them each year. I ordered a taco, thinking it would be a regular taco from a sit-down restaurant- kind of soft, without fresh veggies.  This taco had two layers of tortillas on the tacos and the veggies were the freshest I'd ever tasted.  Our meals came with rice and the rice was a bit cold.  I told our waiter it was a little cold and only two minutes later he came back out with a new bowl of rice.  If you are coming out near Mesa, I highly recommend this stop to you.
