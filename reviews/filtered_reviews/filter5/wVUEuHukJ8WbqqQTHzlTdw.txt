First came here years ago with my mom and sister after leaving a club.  We were drunk but remember it being delicious.  Came back a week ago now that I moved back up to this side of town and it is still the same.  Great authentic food, a nice salsa bar in the middle, Coca-Cola products (THANK YOU!)...and decent sized dining room.  Great prices.  I'll be back!
