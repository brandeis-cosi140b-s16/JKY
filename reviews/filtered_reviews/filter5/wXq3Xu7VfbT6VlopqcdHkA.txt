Best Taco place in Las Vegas... It is kinda hard to figure out the system is you don't speak/read spanish but once you figure out that every line serves a different meat you are good to go. They just serve Tacos and they are dang good. This is a no frills type of place but the tacos are to die for. You have to try the spicy pork it will change your life.
