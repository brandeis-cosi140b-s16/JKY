Incredible!  It's not too often a native Arizonan, raised on mexican fare, finds a new mexican restaurant this good.  I'd put it up against any, in CA, AZ or TX.  Their Quesadillas are the best!  And we really enjoyed the salsa bar - wow!  That's a lot of different kinds of salsas!  We're definitely coming back to this place.
