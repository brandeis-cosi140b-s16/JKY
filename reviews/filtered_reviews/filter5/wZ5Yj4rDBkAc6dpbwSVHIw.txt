Who would have thought the best grilled cheese I've ever had would have come from a burrito place... and a Korean/Mexican fusion burrito place at that. 

Seriously, the grilled cheese is three dollars and is the best I've ever had. Bulgogi beef, melty cheese and sourdough. Where has this been all my life? 

Other appetizers than the grilled cheese included short ribs and some sort of fried fish, which were good but not great, but maybe had an unfair shot being put up against the grilled cheese... which i think i mentioned was pretty good.  

As far as the actual specialties... the fusion burrito is a combination of what you would find in a traditional Burrito (rice, lettuce, cheese etc), but with Bulgogi beef and kimchi (ask for it inside). Throw on on spicy fusion sauce and you've got something that makes you wonder why this "Komex" country doesn't actually exist, if only for the food.  

Service was good, prices reasonable. Only drawbacks are

1. The inside feels something like a mix between the DMV and a classroom
2. Chips and salsa/guac seemed like an afterthought - but hey if you are giving it to me for free I will not dock you for it.
