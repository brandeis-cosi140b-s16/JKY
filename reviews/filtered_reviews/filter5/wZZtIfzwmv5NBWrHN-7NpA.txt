If you are looking for fancy folks lounging around fancy furniture eating tiny overpriced meals... this IS NOT the place for you! Rito's only offers one thing... the best traditional, home-style Mexican food the Valley has to offer. Simple, tasty and made with pride and care. It is pretty much a take out place although they do have a small amount of patio furniture outside for when the weather is nice. 

Anyone who knows will tell you that Rito's has had the BEST green chili burros you may rver find although everything they make is above average. The prices are all very reasonable as well. I can feed my family of 4 for only $20.00!

So if you are in the valley of the sun and aren't an ambiance snob... give Rito's a try. You can't go wrong!
