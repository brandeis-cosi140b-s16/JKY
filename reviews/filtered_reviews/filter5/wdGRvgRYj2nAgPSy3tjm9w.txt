Wow - what a nice surprise!  I hadn't been to Aunt Chilada's in 10 years and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience this evening.  The homemade tortillas and salsa was addictive...I could just eat this for my meal.  I enjoyed a traditional chicken burrito enchilada style with red sauce and cheese...absolutely delicious.  The beans and fideo noodles were fantastic too...so tasty!   I can't wait to go back with our furry friend and enjoy the pet friendly patio.
