Carolina's has the best tortillas in town, hands down.

I'm going to pretend like I didn't read some of the reviews about the place being in the "ghetto" and not wanting to be there after dark, etc. My office is just across the street, and while I will admit that the neighborhood is different than the one I live in, I've never felt nervous about being there. Most of the residents of the neighborhood whom I have met and worked with are hardworking individuals just trying to make ends meet. Ok that's the end of my soapbox tirade. 

Moving on, we eat at Carolina's quite often since there aren't a whole lot of other options within walking distance and I'll be damned if I give up my covered parking space in the summer! I actually like the "cafeteria" type style of the place, and will occasionally eat there instead of ordering food to go. 

I love the Machaca burritos, and the breakfast burritos are to die for (and at $3 a pop, you can't beat it) 

Bottom line, I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food!
