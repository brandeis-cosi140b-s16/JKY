Don't quite get the wrestling theme, but the decor is very eye catching and Macho I guess.  Love the chandeliers and sparkly touches every where.  There is plenty of room and the booths are super comfy and private due to their high backs.  
Now the food and service: like other reviewers mentioned, the owners let us sample the meats which really helped with choosing. The woman who I presume is the young man's mother was also very nice and accommodating.
 I prefer pork to chicken or beef therefore I got a spicy pork taco.  The black beans were perfectly cooked, not too dry, not too soggy, I asked for them well drained and did not get the usual dirty look, he said "of course" and carefully drained the black beans before placing them in the flour taco.  I also ordered a vegetarian taco with beans, guacamole, corn, pico, cheese, and sour cream.  The two tacos I had were so filling, I ordered them a la carte because I knew I couldn't eat three, but I found that even two were so heaped full of goodness I could get away with just one and walk away more than satisfied.  My husband is low carbing it so he ordered lettuce and meat and really enjoyed his meat choices. 
We were really impressed with the freshness of our food and wanted to get the word out to support this local business, good tacos are very hard to find in this area of town, fantastic addition to the neighborhood!
