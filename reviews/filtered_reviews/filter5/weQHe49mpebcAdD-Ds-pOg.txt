Pinches Tacos is the reason I came to Container Park again. I looooove their food here! 

The first time I came here, I got the Chicken Nachos which were BOMB. They came with queso fresco too, which I love and is such a deal maker kind of topping for me. I also got their Watermelon Juice which was just a lovely as the nachos.

The second time I came to Pinches Tacos, I got their Elote, which tastes just as good as the elote you get from the neighborhood carts! I tried the Blood Orange Margarita, but ended up just trading it for a Watermelon Juice because the margarita was much too strong for me at that time.

Anyway, go to Pinches Tacos! They have real Mexican food that you will love!
