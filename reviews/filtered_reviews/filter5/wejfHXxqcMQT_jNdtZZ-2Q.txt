Z'Tejas is kind of what you would call a mini chain restaurant. My husband and I gave them a try the other night at Fashion Square (I had been to Tatum for drinks only) and were very pleased with our experience. The only think lacking was being seated practically on top of another couple, to the point I think we were all trying to speak much quieter than normal so as not to interrupt coversation. Our server was nice and friendly, and very prompt, and bought us a free dessert, totally out of the blue! The shrimp tostada bites we got as a starter were out of this world fantastic! Everything was piping hot, fresh, plated well, and tasted delicious! I had chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin which was cooked perfectly, and my husband had a homey, southwest style macaroni and cheese. All were great. Our favorite was dessert, the ancho fudge pie. Rich, sweet, salty, spicy, warm, chocolatey, heaven. Now, it does still have that chain restaurant vibe, but overall, we were really pleased and will be back again for sure. Good value, great food, great service.
