Good food, good service. I come here often, actually all of 4 of the upward projects stores. Happy hour is the best at any of the stores. I particularly have been enjoying the fact that the soup is ever changing. The shotgun lunch special is great. 2 tacos and a side for $10. Must do it with soup or salad. They are sooo good. I hope they bring that potato soup back. The braised beef taco has so much going on for flavor. The carnitas are really good as well. If you're coming with more then one person and wanna share something, go with the nachos(a personal favorite). The staff is usually super friendly and upbeat. I understand when its super busy, you can get overwhelmed and frustrated, but they still tru their best to be upbeat. I really love the open window to the kitchen. Its funny watching the cooks have fun with each other. Overall a great place. If you don't like huge crowds and wait times try stopping in for lunch.
