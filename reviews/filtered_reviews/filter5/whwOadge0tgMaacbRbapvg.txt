The outside of this restaurant does not look like much, but the inside of the restaurant feels very festive and exciting. Our waiter was quiet nice. Right after you are seated, you get a bowl of chips with 2 dips: a red spicy one and a green, sort of mild one (it is not guacamole, by the way). Then, after you order, you are served a complementary fish cerviche, which is quiet tasty. We ordered the fried Tilapia,  the shrimp in green sauce, and the shrimp with peppers. All came with beans, rice, and a salad on the side. The fried Tilapia was quite large, it could feed at least 2 people. The outside was very crisp and the inside tender and steamy. The shrimp in green sauce was like a soup, and it was very good, creamy and the shrimp was tender, The shrimp with peppers were excellent also and were served with tortillas (wheat tortillas or corn tortillas, your choice.)
