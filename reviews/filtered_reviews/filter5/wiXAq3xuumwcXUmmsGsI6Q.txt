Coming to Vegas can get really mundane, especially if you never leave the Strip. Luckily we had a car & so off we headed to a hole in the wall taco shop called Tacos el Gordo. What a fantastic find! The bf & I came here based on other yelp reviews & it proved as delicious as people claimed. The tacos are stuffed w/meat which makes the price very reasonable. I had the carne asada tacos & the bf had the chorizo tacos. My only regret is not being able to put away more of these in one sitting. 

Two words of advice for those coming for the first time: (1) there are 3 different lines depending on the meats you want so pay attention to where you're standing & (2) try to go during off hours because the lines get long & confusing otherwise.
