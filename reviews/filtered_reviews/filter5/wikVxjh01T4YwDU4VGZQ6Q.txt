Aaah the unassuming, small restaurant in a questionable part of town. I should know these happen to be some of the BEST places for a meal. 

We decided on this place after my son did a little research on Mariscos Restaurants in the area. It was in celebration of my hubs "26th" birthday and his craving for Mariscos. 

Upon pulling up to the restaurant we gave each other questionable look due  to the size of the restaurant and neighborhood, but it quickly discipitated upon entrance. Beautifuuul, colorful decor. Very clean and plenty of seating with a full bar. We chose seats and our waitress came over for our drink order. In addition to the traditional chips and salsa we were also brought ceviche tostadas.. ON THE HOUSE. I personally liked both salsas and the chips were thin and crispy and fresh. Hubs wasn't feeling either the red or green salsa.

I ordered the fish tacos - FABULOUS. I was expecting fried fish and cream sauce but received fresh grilled fish with a sprinkling of cheese. I was a liitle doubtful but with my first bit I was in love. Sooooo good and so flavorful without the guilt that comes with eating fried food. The rice is not a tomato based rice, flavorful nonetheless, white with veggies. Very good. The beans were also very good, reminded me of grandmas.

We all tasted each others food and there was not one thing I didn't love. My daughter got the Shrimp Ranchera.. fresh, delicious shrimp and veggies in a light, lemony sauce. My son got the Molcajete Caliente.. GREAT dish to share. The meat, and the fish were the BEST. The sauce was nice and smokey and had just a full great flavor to it. Hubs got a seafood cocktail depsite my coaxing into getting a pescado frito. I wanted a taste :/ His cocktail was very good despite them using canned clams rather than fresh. 

This has quickly become my new favorite Mariscos spot in AZ. Can't wait to visit again and try some of the other dishes!
