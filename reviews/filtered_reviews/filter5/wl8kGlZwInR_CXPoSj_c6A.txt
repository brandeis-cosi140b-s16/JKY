These are the same people that own Gallo Blanco in the Clarendon Hotel. The food is the same superb, zesty, creative fare I've come to love but now in a more hip, urban chic, upscale environment. Perfect for a date, business meeting, or hang out with friends.
Dont forget happy hour every day, including weekends, from 2-6 pm. Carne Asada tacos for $1.50 cannot be beat!
A great modern twist on Mexican food, well-prepared, fresh, great taste, reasonable prices. Great salads too.
On 7th St next to Healthy Habit just north of Bethany Home Rd. 
I think they are opening another Gallo Blanco at the Ling & Louie's place at the Biltmore too.
