Excellent family owned restaurant!!  Very affordable prices and friendly people that actually put their heart into what they do.  I am happy to see a hard working family reap the rewards of the American dream.  I have been eating at Habanero's since they opened, and the portions and quality have not diminshed to the slightest degree.  Expect lunchtime to be crowded, however, the wait time is never more than 5 to 10 minutes with no sacrifice in quality.
