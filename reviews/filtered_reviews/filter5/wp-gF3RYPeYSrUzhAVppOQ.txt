We have eaten here 5 times since 2006. Great affordable option in the Venetian. Next to the Canal. Presentation and portion are exellent for the price. Flavor is way above average. Recommended: Guacamole, Mexican Chopped Salad, the Steak Torta, and the Pork Tenderloin in Pinapple Mole. Never had a bad food or service experience in 5 visits, Good Sangria
