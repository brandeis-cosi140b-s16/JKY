This is going to sound like hyperbole, but out of all of my dining in Vegas during the past week's trip, Los Tacos is right up there with happiest memories. So delicious. So simple. So fresh. I had the Taco Cabeza (beef head, fellow gringos), Mrs. H. had Carnitas Burrito (she was not going to be talked into the tongue), both were awesome. The shared shrimp cocktail deserves special mention, bathed in juicy tomato salsa, avocado, red onion, lime and cilantro. 

I had zero problem with the price, factoring in the quality, freshness, and quantity. If I were looking for a taco under a buck, I'd just go to Taco Bell. Staff was friendly, helpful, and yes, English was provided. Los Tacos, you're not exactly near the airport, but next time I'm in town you're very likely my first stop off the plane!
