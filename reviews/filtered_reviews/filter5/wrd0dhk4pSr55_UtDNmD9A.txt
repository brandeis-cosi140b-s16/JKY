I came back to Eldorado Cantina because my last experience was fantastic. This time I made my reservation for Monday to take advantage of the half off for locals deal, and they were slammed! Even though my server Amber had a full section, she didn't neglect our table one bit! The service was great, and the manager Sean checked on our table a few times and made us feel like VIPs. Thanks again Eldorado Cantina for another perfect night out!
