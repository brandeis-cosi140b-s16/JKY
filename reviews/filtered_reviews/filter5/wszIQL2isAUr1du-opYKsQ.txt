I've sat inside and on each of the patios (front and rear). The rear patio is equipped with a mega fan; keeps the area super cool for a romantic evening! The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit...good for date night. The service, as with the food, has always been amazing. This last visit, I ordered the spinach salad and the scallops (phenomenal!). The waitress was very attentive and knowledable of the entrees. Great place to go before or after the theatre or for brunch after the Saturday morning market!
