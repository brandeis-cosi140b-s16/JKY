What is there to say about La Condesa? It's simply amazing. 

I'll admit, we found this place searching for more of a day-to-day, less expensive version of Barrio Cafe. We found that and more. In our one month since we've moved to Phoenix, we've eaten here three times. By far the best item we've had is the fried quesadilla with mole chicken. Oh, and the horchata. Best. Horchata. Ever. It's not your typical horchata, so watch out. Mole poblano tacos are also heaven, as is the cochinita pibil. Salsa bar is to die for. 

I love the hole in the wall vibe. Only bad moment was that I got trapped in the bathroom, but that was my fault. I swear the door opens out, not in. This place is super casual. Plastic cups and nothing fancy, but the vibe is uber awesome. It is very small, and seating can be limited, but it always seems to work out. I don't recommend this place for very large groups. 

We'll be back, about once a week.
