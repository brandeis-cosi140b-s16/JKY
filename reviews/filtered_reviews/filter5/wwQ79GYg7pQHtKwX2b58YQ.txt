So good, I eat here at least once a week and never tire. The pickled onions are crack! Chicken and steak both marinated, freshly grilled deliciousness. Beans, rice, and salsa all delicious a fresh too. Cheap and high-quality. Combine tortillas, rice, steak, onions, salsa and sour cream to make tacos then thank me later. Crazy good.
