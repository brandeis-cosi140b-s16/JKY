After two visits here I can now attest to the consistent excellence of this place for fine authentic Mexican cuisine.  Here, besides an addictive mild, mellow, and very tasty Bean Dip that is presented with homemade Salsa and warm tortilla chips, fresh guacamole is made three ways, two of which I have sampled.  Maiz Y Chipotle Guacamole features green avocado and large yellow kernels of corn, and is adorned with twisted Fried Onion Straws.  It packs a powerful spicy backbite that put my mouth on fire after downing just a few scoops.  While I liked it, I found much milder and chunkier Guacamole Classico, with avocado, tomato, onion, and cilantro, to be cold,  refreshing, and more to my liking.

Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp with a bit of melted Monterey Jack Cheese was excellent and succulent, with or without Adobo Sauce.  Coming eight to an order, and served with cucumber and tomato slices, and half a lime, this porcine app easily serves two diners, which Diane and I learned after initially ordering two platefuls.  This was just one of several leftovers that came home with us the first time, to serve as a great lunch the next day.

For a main dish I savored both a Casero Burrito Carnitas and a very nice Casero Burrito Verde, in addition to a very good Shredded Beef Crispy Taco just for a change of taste.   Diane had Chicken Mini-Chimichangas with the chicken marinated in a Chipotle Sauce, and a mild, well-melted Cheese Quesadilla filled with shrimp.   

Both times Janeth was a friendly, attentive, and very competent server.  On the first occasion, Diane's appetizer plate was chipped.  But everything was in order on the second visit.  To add to Jalisco Cantina's allure, free Nevada Poker League tournament play is hosted here on Friday nights.
