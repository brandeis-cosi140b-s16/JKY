I can't judge this place from its beginnings so I can only judge it for the now. If you can get by eating out of chintzy aluminum take-away containers with flimsy plastic forks on folding tables then you'll be rewarded with damn delicious food. 
There are not many places you can get two flavorful entrees, a specialty fried rice, beans and a fresh baked cookie for only $9.08.
