So I gave this place another chance and yes it was good. 
REDEMPTION! I ordered the burger and it was the best burger I've had in a long long time. I've given second chances to places that I thought had potential and those places failed me but, this place more then made up for it. Its the first redemption of a restaurant I've seen in a long long time. 
Megan or however she spelled it was a good waitress and it my meal was handled seamlessly.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood. 
Dessert is also amazingly good. The flan was probably the best desert I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant. 

So in a word
REDEMPTION!
