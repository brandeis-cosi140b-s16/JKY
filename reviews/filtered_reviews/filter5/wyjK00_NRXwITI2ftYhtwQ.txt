WOW!  Is all I can say!  We went here on a whim for dinner Saturday night, based mostly on the positive Yelp reviews, and that it was close to where we were staying.

All I can say is the food was AWESOME!  But, making that even better was the fantastic service.  Everyone was so friendly and polite.  We had a little trouble making a Margarita decision (they all sound so good!!!), the waitress kept coming back, understanding the whole time, offering suggestions, but in no way overbearing.

We ordered the the Skinny Margarita, and I had a Beer and a tequila shot.

For dinner, my wife had the Tenderloin Rellenos, and I had the Carne Adovada.  Simply spectacular!  They were delivered by the owner himself, now I know where the staff get their friendly nature from!!

Michael asked if there was anything he can do for us, and after some thought, we've decided he can.... OPEN IN VEGAS!!!!

Too bad we live in Vegas, but next time in the Phoenix area, this place will defiantly be on our schedule!
