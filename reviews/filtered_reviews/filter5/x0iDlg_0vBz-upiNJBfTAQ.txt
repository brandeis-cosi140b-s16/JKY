Amazing food! Couldn't explain enough. All ingredients are fresh and organic. Opens 24 hours! Amazing staff. Enrique and Maria were so friendly and just fun. We live in San Diego; I wish they open closer to us. We will definitely come back every time we are in Vegas. Table side guacamole delicious. Best Mexican food I've ever had!
