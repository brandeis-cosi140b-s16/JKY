This was my fourth visit to this amazing restaurant. We typically go little early, so the line is not too long. When you go in later on weekends there's music, which can sometimes make conversation little difficult.

The restaurant is small but the service is excellent. There is a man who clears and sets tables so skillfully that it is a show in itself.

Now for the food. The chef won a James Beard award and it shows. On this visit, I had the Veracruz which is a savory fish dish prepared with olives and capers.  I've had this at other restaurants, but never as good as this.  My husband had the pescado del mar, which was heavenly.  The guacamole is pricey, but prepared at your table and well worth it.  Portions are generous, but save room for some crepas de cajeta- glorious caramel with cinnamon pecans and a ball of ice cream...worth every little calorie.

We go out to dinner pretty often, but this is our favorite.
