Came in for dinner had a daily special #9 Carne Asada Burrito & 3 roll tacos W/Guacamole & drink for $5.99
Like this little hole in the wall on Broadway Street. Was very clean inside the people who work here are very friendly and very helpful with the menu. The place was very nice and chilly must've had the AC down to around 64Â° Yes I would come back and order again trying different combinations on the menu.
