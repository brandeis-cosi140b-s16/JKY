We used to eat this food before they turned it into a restaurant when it really was "backyard" tacos. 

The carne asada quesadilla is legit. Best meat and salsas to add to it. 

The gordita, never had one before, was a little different. It was kind of hard but yet soft. The meat was delicious. 

The salsas were awesome. 

Great looking and clean interior too.
