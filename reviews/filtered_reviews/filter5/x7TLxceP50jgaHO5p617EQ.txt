We came here based off of the reviews on Yelp.  Headed to Cave Creek for a bit of a break from Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  As we rolled into town I was ready for chips, salsa and a great marg.  This place did not disappoint.  We had a family of 4.  The chips came with 3 salsas.  All were amazing.  My husband had the Prickly Pear marg and I had the Cabo Wabo.  Delicious.  Food was great, the place was on point all the way.  My only wish is that they had one near Denver, CO.   When in the area we will be back again for sure.  Good stuff!
