Came here with friends last night and the food was delicious. 

My enchiladas came out looking exactly like the menu photo. My husband really enjoyed his chicken fajitas that came out sizzling on the platter.

Our friends enjoyed their burritos.

Everything  was reasonably priced.

Our server Anthony (i think that was his name )was great and attentive.

Really enjoyed our first time there and definitely will be returning!
