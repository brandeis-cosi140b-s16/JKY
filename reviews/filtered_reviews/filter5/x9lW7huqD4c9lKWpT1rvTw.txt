I have been to Verde a handful of times now. I agree with some of the earlier reviews that the service was not perfect when the restaurant first opened, but I it has gotten consistently better and my last two experiences have been great. Being a huge fan of the food at Verde in general (especially the Guacamole, Tacos de Camote, and Tres Leches), I was super excited when I heard they were introducing a brunch menu on the weekends. 

In general, the food is a unique twist on traditional Mexican food, always surprising me with an unusual and unexpectedly pleasant combination of flavors that I would never have dreamt up on my own. The brunch menu is consistent with this theme, making it tough to narrow down the choices. In the end, I ordered the Camote Hash (sweet potato hash) and Chilaquiles (almost like a breakfast version of nachos). I was not sure I would like the Chilaquiles when I ordered it - (tortilla chips and a sunny side up egg together in one dish?) but again, I was right to trust the chefs at Verde to fuse these ingredients with an amazing poblano crema sauce into a delightful and extremely satisfying meal. 

Also, I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. Fresh squeezed juice is hard to find in Pittsburgh, and it is definitely worth the price (so much so that I ordered a second glass). I did not try the Brunch Bottles, but they sound perfect for a group brunch, or just a couple planning for a lazy afternoon.
