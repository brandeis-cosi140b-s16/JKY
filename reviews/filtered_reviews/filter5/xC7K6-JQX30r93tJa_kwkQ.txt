I came here three times in 10 days. That should say something! Not your typical Americanized Mexican-type food. Very authentic, and their carnitas and carne asada grande tacos are fantastic! I also got the carne asada burrito bowl with no rice. The red and green sauce here is far better than many of the other Mexican restaurants I have attended.

The best thing here is that they appreciate individuals who observe lent by offering grilled fish and shrimp in taco, burrito, and bowl form(s)! Their jalapenos are the best! I love this place!
