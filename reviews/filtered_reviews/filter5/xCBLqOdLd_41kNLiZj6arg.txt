Best Mexican food I've had! I love Mexican food and I feel like I'm pretty picky to what meets my standards for damn good original Mexican food. This place blows any other fast food Mexican out of the water. 5 bucks for a small bean burrito, asana street taco, 5 mini tortillas for $.50 and a water!
The salsa bar is one of the freshest I've ever seen too with lettuce, pico, carrots, onions, cilantro and great hot sauce!
I would drive from Peoria to come back and would love to see a location further north as the Mexican food up by me is subpar:(
This good took about 10 minutes, which for fast food most people think is long but trust me it's worth it bc nothing's pre-made. It's all prepared by hand right there behind the counter.

This is an authentic taste of a restaurant in Mexico, make the trip it's worth it!
