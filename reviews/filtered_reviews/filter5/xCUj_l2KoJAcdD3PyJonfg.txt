I am so glad my girl Johnie showed us this place. The food is beyond delicious. It's unlike any Mexican food I've ever had.....gourmet Mexican, if such exists. We had queso fundido  with mushrooms, so perfected seasoned and accentuated with fresh herbs n veggies. I wanted to try the veggie tacos, but the one drawback was the chef refused to make them without celery for me. So, upon our exceptional bartender, Greg's, recommendation I got the Mahi tacos. So delicious and fresh.  I'm super-picky about seafood and this is tops! 
The mango margaritas were on point and half- off for locals on Monday made the slightly - high but totally worth it for the quality so easy to bear. Another drink, please;)
