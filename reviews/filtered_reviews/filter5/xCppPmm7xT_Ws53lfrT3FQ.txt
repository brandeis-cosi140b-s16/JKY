I came here on date night with my boyfriend, and we were blown away! Our server Maria was awesome, she was super nice, and seriously was one of the best servers I've had in a while. 
We started off with chips and guacamole, which were amazing... And I also ordered the skinny marg which was HUGE and equally awesome! We ordered the fajitas for two and it was super tasty and a TON of food. We will definitely be back!
