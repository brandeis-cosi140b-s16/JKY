I LOVE this place! I've been here a few times on a whim and each time has been great. So far I've had: Spam Masubi, Teriyaki Chicken, fusion tacos, fusion burrito, and fish tacos, but there is still SO much more I want/need to try! The Spam Musubi was huge (probably why they call it "Flintstone" musubi) and you get two big ones for 3 bucks. The Spam was nice and crispy, but the rest of the musubi seemed to fall apart very easily (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lNZd5fEHGYDhJ-FJYp-oDg/l.jpg); Not a big problem though because I love Spam and rice anyway. The tacos are exploding with flavor and you can't beat the price ($1.29 a pop, really!!?). I've had the pork, chicken, beef, and fish taco. The fish tacos were a little too salty for me, but the rest were amazing. The burrito was also very large, but that didn't effect the quality. It was very flavorful, juicy, and oozing with deliciousness. I ate about half and brought the rest home to my brother who nearly killed it in one bite. 

I can't wait to come back here. Every time we've gone, the service has been very fast and friendly. They even give you complimentary chips, dip, guac, and oranges (after the meal). I wish it wasn't so far from my house, but at least my boyfriend lives down the street from it, so I can get KoMex to-go ;)
