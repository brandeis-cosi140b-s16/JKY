At first we weren't sure if we could bring our 12 year old. No worries. Food was great. Service was great. We ordered table side guacamole to start. We tasted each others dishes. I had the Carnitas Rojas Burrito. My wife had the Carne asada street tacos and my son tried the beef taquitos. By our third bites we were planning on what to eat on our next visit. Next time we'll come as a couple minus the minor and focus on cocktails too. The Assistant GM, Sean, checked on us to make sure everything was ok, and it was. We'll be back and this will be the spot where we bring our out of towners. 

Snap, just found out that Mondays are for locals. I guess we'll have to come back on Monday. 

My son also noticed  the wait time on food was awesome and it was. My wife can be picky when trying new places, but she was all smiles 

Chef Paco stopped by our table and talked about how we were about to eat his grandmother's flan recipe. Top shelf.

Don't want to forget our server.  Very attentive while training another server. She rocked the table side guac. Thank you Amber.
