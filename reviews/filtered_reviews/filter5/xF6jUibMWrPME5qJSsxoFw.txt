This place is amazing!!! My boyfriend lived in Guadalajara Mexico for 2.5 years and was dying for a good torta in Arizona.  I must admit that it is tough to find and we drove by the place like 3 times before we found it; it was worth it though!  The place is tiny and only has 20 seats, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. I spoke English but my boyfriend went to town ordering in Spanish, both ways were welcome.  The food is truly authentic and everything we ordered was delicious.  I suggest the green salsa especially if you like it hot. This will become a regular spot for us!
