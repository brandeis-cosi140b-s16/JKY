I've been coming to Taco y Taco for a few months now. It's our go to place for tacos and burritos. The tacos al pastor ($3) are the most authentic I've had outside of Mexico. The burritos ($5.50) are large, filling and a great value. The salsa and veggie bar is a can't miss too. Love those roasted peppers and onions!
