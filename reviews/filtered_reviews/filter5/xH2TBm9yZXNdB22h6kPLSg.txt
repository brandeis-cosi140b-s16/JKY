The reasons I go here

1) The food is good

2) It's hard to find mexican food that is healthy, and this place does not load their food with a lot of grease.

3) It's very affordable

What I don't like

1) Selection of drinks. Lacks fountain drinks.

To Brian J., maybe you should try Taco Bell. There's lots of flavor in the "Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Taco Supreme", my god. I'm going to try your suggestions because I love Mexican food, but your review of this place in no way deserves 1 star. 

And also, Brian, this place was referred to me, and I refer it to others. Nothing to theorize, there.. I hope I'm not too much of an "embarrassment" for you. /rolls eyes

EDIT   7/19/2013:

Brian, I tried Los Taquitos  by ordering the Street Taco Combo. I ordered the Chicken, Pork and the El Pastor. I would have to say it was average at best and the rice and beans that came with it were HEAVILY salted. I must say though, there are a couple eye candy that look like sisters. Now that may bring me back to order another average meal :P
