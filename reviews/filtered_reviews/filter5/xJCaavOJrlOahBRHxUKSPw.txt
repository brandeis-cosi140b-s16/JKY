I have lived in the Valley of The Sun for seven years. Before that, I lived in the other valley 400 miles West. This is the best Mexican food we have found in all the time. Most places out here to put it bluntly, suck. Closest thing to L.A. Mexican i.e. Carnitas Michoacan or El Taco Llama we found in all that time we've been here.  The girls at the counter are great. Almost hate posting this. Might have to take it down. To the guy who says it's "two stars better than those 'bertos places.", go check your head cause you ain't right. If someone thinks that meat, beans and tortillas are cliche, why the heck would eat at a Mexican restaurant? Hello? Is this thing on? Go eat at Mcd and do us a favor. What's it like to go through life with no taste buds?
