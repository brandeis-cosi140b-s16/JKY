I am not a seafood fan at all. The only time I eat it is when I am by the coast and that is out of obligation.

That being said, when someone decided we should go to a place that serves fish tacos, I could think of nothing more disgusting. But because I am always willing to try a restaurant's staple dish, I bravely tried a mahi mahi fish taco.

I don't get surprised by non-desert foods a lot, but wow!! I loved it! In fact, for the next several days I actually had fish taco cravings. Since that experience I have been to a few places where they recommended their fish taco, hoping to satisfy the craving I would eat them but they were horrible compared to Cabo Fish Taco.

I have now been back several times and have even guided a few friends into trying a fish taco. I still don't eat seafood but love these fish tacos. The complimentary homemade salsa is really good too.

Word to the wise though, if you have a group bigger than four people, show up really early or plan on a wait. They don't take reservations. And only have a few places that seat bigger parties.
