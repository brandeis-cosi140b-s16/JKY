Went again last night. 
The entire dining experience was both flawless and un- compromising. 

We walked away from the table to watch some of the live performance (super entertaining) and our waiter took the liberty of placing our food under the heat lamp so it didn't get cold AND put covers over our waters. Customer service at its finest. 

******Oh, and I found out they are opening a SECOND LOCATION!! It's going to be more of a venue/lounge. Roof/patio and larger stage, BIGGER BAR= LOVE- How exciting!  I'll keep updates on the "detes" as soon as I find out more.
