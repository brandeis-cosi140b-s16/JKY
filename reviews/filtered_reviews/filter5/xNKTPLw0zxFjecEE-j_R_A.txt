This place is AMAZING! I have never had tacos this amazing in my life! The place is pretty small however it is very crowded! I understand Why it's crowded the food is delicious! I ordered three streak corn tacos and I was in heaven! The tortillas were soft and the steak was juicy and well seasoned. Can't wait to go back!
