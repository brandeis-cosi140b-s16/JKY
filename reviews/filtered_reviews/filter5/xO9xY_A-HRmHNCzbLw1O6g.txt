I am an incredibly picky Mexican food eater, and after having lived in Scottsdale for two years, was disappointed nothing came near authentic...until I came here! I've been here three times in the last week already and have tried their tacos al pastor, chile rellenos, and chicken burittos. All were amazing (not to mention their awesome home-made flan and horchata!). I'm so glad I found somewhere decent and authentic!!

Side note: they only take cash! And its a really small venue so it can get crowded.

Edit: they now accept most major credit cards, and are expanding to the next door space! I love this place.
