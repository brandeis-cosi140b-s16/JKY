I feel really guilty writing this, because this is my Madison Mexican secret place (MMSP), but I'm feeling generous.

Yes, this place has good food; really, really good food. *You cannot get better/more authentic Mexican food in Madison. Plus the name is fun to say.

No, it's not a nice place- It's the first floor of someone's house, which makes it even more legit in my book. Actually I''m currently on a waiting list to move upstairs of Guadalajara.

If you are looking for mediocre chain Mexican food - skip this and go to Pedro's.
