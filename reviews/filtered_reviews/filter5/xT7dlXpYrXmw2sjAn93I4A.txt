I bought their Red Chili Sauce from their restaurant and it was awesome! I cooked about 3.5 lbs of sirloin meet (cubed) and added the whole jar is red chili and it soo good. I would recommend you give this a try. After feeding my friends I had enough left over to have with fried eggs the next morning!
