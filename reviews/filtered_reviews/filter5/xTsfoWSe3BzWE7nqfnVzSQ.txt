This place is the best Mexican food I've found since moving to Vegas! It's Mexican food that is up to par with my favorite Mexican food from LA. 
I'm so happy to hAve found this gem and can't wait to go back. 
I had their strawberry margarita, but the bartender told me to try the prickly pear (I think that's what she said) next time and of course I will! The chips, salsa and bean dip was my for sure favorite. Although a little more chorizo in that bean dip would make it even better!
See you soon!
