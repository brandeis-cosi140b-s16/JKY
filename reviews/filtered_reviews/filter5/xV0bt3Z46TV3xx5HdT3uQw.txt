Great spot! Was looking for a spot close to where my kids were taking a class and was sold when I saw the name. The tequila menu was impressive and I will be back to try more! The green salsa was amazing, I think my friend wanted to slurp it straight from the bowl. We both had a variety of tacos that were delicious. It's a bit far from home but will return anytime we are in Scottsdale.
