Chicken mole tacos, crazy salsa bar, HORCHATA.

I have been living in San Diego for three years, and had never once had homemade horchata loaded with fresh strawberries and cantaloupe, pecans, and cinnamon. But now I have, and I'm not sure that I can go back to the soft-drinky stuff of various fill-in-the-blank-bertos.

They could start a lucrative business just selling that horchata, but the food is amazing as well. My friends and I slid through the door about half an hour before closing, and were immediately greeted with menus and chips. We ordered, then proceeded to raid the salsa bar. It wasn't at its full glory at the end of the night, but 'twas still extensive. Honestly, I'm kind of a ho when it comes to condiments, so trust me when I say we looted that baby. Hard. I can't pick a favorite, but I was particularly fond of the avocado-cilantro, as well as the chipotle salsa. 

Them tacos is the stuff of dreams. Layered corn tortillas, rich and steamy chicken mole, fresh onions y cilantro. For all of a few minutes, I was in heaven. And then I was in a food coma. Two tacos don't sound like much, but it is definitely a good amount of food. Especially if you've been sucking the life out of your horchata.

Service was fast and friendly, the dining area was clean and pleasant, and I am officially crowning La Condesa my favorite taco shop of all time. Big words coming from a California girl, I know, but I wasn't even drunk when I went. (FYI, I got drunk after... and it all stayed down!) I will be back, La Condesa. Mark my words!!!

361 miles can't stop my love for you.
