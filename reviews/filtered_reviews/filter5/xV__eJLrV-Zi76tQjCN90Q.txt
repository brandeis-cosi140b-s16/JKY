I was in Las Vegas with my Dad for the 4th time in my life.  Had the opportunity to walk from the Circus Circus and check out the city,   We came across this establishment, walked inside, and BOOM!   Best Tacos in Vegas.  Just great, fresh, authentic, tacos.  We ordered again, and made a point to come back on another occasion before we left the city.  Five stars, love those fresh green onions!!!
