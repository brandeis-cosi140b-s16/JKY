Every good thing you read here is right. UH MAZ ING. 

Only thing I can add is the guac based green salsa is the best thing ever. We had it in Austin, TX and they either called it green salsa or Salsa Dona. It is really hot but worth it. Go now. Go often. Go again. 

Only negative is that I wish it was about 5 times bigger to accommodate everyone.
