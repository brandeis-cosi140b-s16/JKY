This review would be best served by a story. Imagine you're a cowboy in the old west. Think Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter. But you have a cook that travels with you in a chuck wagon. This cook is trained in all things amazingly tasty & secretly, he's trying to kill you - slowly. What I had at this place is what he feeds you every day.  Eggs Benedict Adovada. It is the most amazing decadent irresistible thing I've ever eaten. So as the cowboy, you'd eat it every day & after a few weeks you're too fat to get on your horse, your gun belt no longer fits & your chest hurts intermittently. And so one day, as an overweight, unarmed coronary walking the plains, you're shot by vaqueros & the cook smiles. YOU MUST GO HERE.
