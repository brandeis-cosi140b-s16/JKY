Talk about great food, service and atmosphere. This is hands down the most amazing quality of food and service I have received in a long time. Chef PACO, (amazing chef by the way) had cooked myself chicken enchilada's and my significant other had ordered, posole. Was delicious, tender and had all the right spices.  Not to mention the huge margaritas, with the perfect combination of salt and tequila. The food was amazing and the presentation when they brought the food and drinks out, looked out of a magazine. The quality of this restaurant and experience I had was something no other place has ever topped. Can't wait to go back and dine again.
