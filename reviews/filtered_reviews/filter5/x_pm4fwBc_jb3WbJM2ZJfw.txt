At a dental office next door to this place, was super hungry so i went a cross while wating for my GF, and was surprised with the quality of food here and the taste, i would call this place an Upgraded version of Chipotle, I loved it. Same concept, fresher and more options than chipotle including fish... great Salads with amazing dressings, they give you a lot of food and are not stingy with the portions. 
I just found out that there is one in Tustin right by my house as well. I am sure they are going to be popping up everywhere pretty soon, so if i were you i would try this place out, amazing taste, friendly staff, super fresh...

My new go to place over chipotle for sure!
