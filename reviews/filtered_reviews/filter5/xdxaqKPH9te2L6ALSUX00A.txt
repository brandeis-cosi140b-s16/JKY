Let's see . . . what did I like best? My thirst quenching Blood Orange Margarita? . . . or was it the incredible Guacamole and fresh chips? Or was it the two together, sitting on the patio with a warm spring breeze late on a Saturday afternoon? 

Hard to believe that I'm in Uptown Phoenix Rising and I could have sworn I was sitting next to the beach in Mexico.  So relaxing. I just wanted to take my shoes off and wiggle my toes in the white sand and sit and enjoy the afternoon and evening . . . have another Margarita . . . or two. This is life at its best. 

You know you've hit a good spot when it can conjure up day dreams that wash your cares away with each wave rolling in . . . just from a little Margie & Guac?  Maybe I had too many? Naught!  You're driving, right?
