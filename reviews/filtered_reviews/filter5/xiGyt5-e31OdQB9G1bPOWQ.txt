I enjoyed my first visit to Distrito for lunch with my team the other day. Their lunch menu was easy to order off of, and priced pretty well. Although the portions seemed a taaaad small, my nachos were very tasty (and unique) and my carnitas tacos were fresh and left me wanting another. They were up there with some of the best tacos I've had. The place has a pretty cool vibe and I wanted to check it out more but didn't have time. We sat in their pretty good size outdoor patio, and our server was constantly checking in on us. To sum it up, I want to go back.
