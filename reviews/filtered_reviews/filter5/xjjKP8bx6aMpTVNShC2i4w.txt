I am a businessman. After a long day of business, I have quite an appetite. I also often need to fuel up for the next day's business. Well, lo and behold, Pedro's has just the meal. It was fantastic. First, Tim G. is right. The salsa is bomb. And the beef, while not shredded as Shane A. says, is bomb. But I digress. Back to the business person's special. I recommend the beef burro with green chile salsa. It is fantastic. And bomb. As Sharon M. says, the mini taco salad is bomb. The beans were creamy. Although she couldn't finish it. She is not the business person I am.

We also learned the story of how the business person special got its name. It was a hot July day on 1972. A tall, dark, and handsome man sauntered in to Pedro's. He wore a large hat, a bolo tie, boots, and a thick mustache. In a deep voice, he explained he had just finished a long day of business and had quite the appetite. He ordered a beef burro, and quickly ate it. While delicious, he was not yet sated. "How about one of them tacos," he bellowed. The business man made quick work of the taco. Still not satisfied, the business man asked for a cheese enchilada. "Dios mio," said Pedro. He had never seen someone eat so much. Pedro hesitantly obliged the stranger, and watched in awe as it was consumed. Finally satisfied, the business man stood up, left Pedro a silver dollar as a tip, and proudly walked into the sunset, never to return again. The legend only grew, and the stranger's meal remains on the menu to this day.
