My fiance and I love this place and frequent it often. We love their chips and salsa and to be honest, we share the same meal every time (Pollo Rico) because we're too chicken to branch out! I wish I knew how they cooked their chicken because I am so picky about ligaments and chewy stuff and they have never had any! The Perfect Storm margarita is our favorite and consistant every time that we go in. The only fault I would find is that if you're not a huge cheddar cheese fan, they cover most meals with a ton of it. I work around it to get to the good stuff!
