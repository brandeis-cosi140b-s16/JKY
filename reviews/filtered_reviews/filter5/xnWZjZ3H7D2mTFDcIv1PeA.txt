I am an old school Vegas guy when it comes to service in this town. This place has only been open for a couple weeks and all I can say is wow! I've witnessed the owner and GM personally go to each customer to see how everything was going. I've seen this on ALL of the four times I have visited. The hardest things to convey to a service staff is to anticipate guests needs and recover from mistakes. They have obviously done a great job of that. Kudos!

I love the Cajun style fish and shrimp tacos. Really fresh on perfectly soft, corn tacos. BTW, their happy hour is pretty freakin awesome to take advantage on their indoor-outdoor patio. Way more of a bargain and laid back atmosphere than Kona Grill --in the same lot. I just hope the Lambo-driving, Affliction/True Religion wearing-Summerlin douche bags- that scare away all the cute girls away, don't ruin my new favorite spot.
