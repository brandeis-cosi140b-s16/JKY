Delicious! I normally frequent Nando's for their lunch specials with coworkers. The Pollo Fundido is absolutely amazing, but you can't go wrong with anything there. The chips and salsa are on par- I'd recommend mixing the two for the best flavor. My coworker normally gets the taco salad with ground beef and it's evident they use fresh ingredients. All the portions are very large so come hungry!
