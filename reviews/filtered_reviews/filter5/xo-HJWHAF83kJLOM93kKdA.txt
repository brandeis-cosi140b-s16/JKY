I love this place!  I went there on a total whim with my dad once, and then again with my husband and both times I was extremely impressed.  The huevos rancheros was delicious, and the green chile is sooooo good!  I even really like the chips and salsa.  The price for the quality and portion size is really great too.  I would definitely recommend this place to somebody that is looking for a unique and tasty experience, especially the breakfast (which is served all day).  Yum!  The atmosphere isn't the greatest thing in the world, kind of a small hole-in-the-wall type place but still felt cozy and clean.  I like that it's just a small/family type shop.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
