Holy burrito! We came here because my friend is living in Boston and hasn't had good Mexican food in forever. I had been wanting to come here, so it was a win win. I got the Asada burrito. SO FREAKING GOOD!!! She got the mini chimi combo and said it was amazing. The staff is friendly.. We're coming back in a couple of days before she leaves.
