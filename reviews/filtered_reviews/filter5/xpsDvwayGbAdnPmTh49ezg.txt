Sat at the bar for a double date. Had carnitas tacos with pineapple and a carne asada burrito- delicious. 

I think the thing that topped it off was that the bartender was super professional and was just attentive enough to help without being annoying. The chef came out to check on us and asked for us to review - thanks Chef Paco, that was good.
