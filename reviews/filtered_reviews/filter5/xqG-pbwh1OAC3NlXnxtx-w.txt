Absolutely love braddahs! Just like a chipotle or cafe rio, you are able to select if you want a bowl, tacos, a burrito, or salad, with your choice of protein and toppings! The best part is that it's hawaiian style! Yummy flavor in the food, great customer service, and good ambiance with the island music and vibes :) definitely recommend to everyone!
