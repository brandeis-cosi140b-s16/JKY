Wow! After landing in Phoenix, AZ I was incredibly un-impressed by the dry, plain, boring looking atmosphere. Honestly, it was a bit of a disappointment at first site...but, Phoenix might be one of those places that grows on you after a while. And, I think it's because of these unassuming gems like Barrio Cafe. I was so impressed by the professionalism, kindness, and knowledge of the staff. They know their food! 

When it comes to food, let's just get to the best - Cochinita Pibil A.K.A. pork taco greatness! This juicy pork is slow roasted overnight and marinated in achiote and sour orange and you know what, even though it says that on the menu they really don't have to describe it. You can taste every spice in such a clear way. I can tell they take great care of every ingredient, and if anyone can get me to actually enjoy pickled onions they must be a genius. Yes, it's true...the chef at Barrio Cafe is a genius!

Other recommended items include: 
Horchata (not your average Horchata either, this one's special)
The Camaron - Shrimp Taco, was really good too

Listen, if you're in AZ this weekend because of the Superbowl or another sporting event, you'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you don't come by Barrio Cafe and give their food a try. You'll be really satisified with the truly authentic Mexican food
