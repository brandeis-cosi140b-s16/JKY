I'm all about their red chile burrito.  Green chile and carne asada were pretty damn good too but there's something about the red chile mixed with the gooey cheese, rice, beans, meat, sour cream that hits the spot.  It essentially feels like mexican (or whatever...mexican-american..) comfort food.

Prices are good (comparable to chipotle/qdoba's of the world) but the flavors are not the same at all (burrito house is better...).  They do a good job mixing the burritos here too. No one bite of only plain white rice, one bite just beans, etc. Only complaint is it needs to be even spicier!
