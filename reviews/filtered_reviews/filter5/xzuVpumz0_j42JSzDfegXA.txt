Awesome! If you like quality, very flavorful tex-mex you will love this place. Margaritas with good (100% agave) tequila and fresh made mix that's not from a bottle. Blue corn chicken enchiladas were wonderful. Carne Asada tacos with a little bit of pickled cabbage on top are to die for. If you like run of the mill, cheap Mexican food, this is not the place for you. This is the top end.
