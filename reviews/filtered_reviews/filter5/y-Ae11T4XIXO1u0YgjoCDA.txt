Our experience at taco guild was great! Our server Latim (I hope I spelled that right) was knowledgable and well trained. Our chips came out fresh and hot and the salsa to go with it was delicious. I ordered the margarita - one of the best I've ever had, you won't be disappointed. But the highlight of the night was the duck taco - get it. Everyone at our table loved it!
