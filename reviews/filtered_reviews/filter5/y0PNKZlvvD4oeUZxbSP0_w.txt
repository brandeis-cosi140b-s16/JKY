I don't like burritos.  I don't like refried beans.  I don't really like the red/orange rice either.  I had an excellent meal made up of the best parts of Mexican cuisine with none of the mass market, dumbed-down sort of stuff going on.

My bf and I had the tasting menu - which was very economical.  I had one of the best margaritas I've had that I didn't make myself.  He had a tasting of several mescals on the advice of our very knowledgeable waiter. 

The decor is chic.  The staff was lovely.  A la carte and alcohol prices appeared a little spendy, but it is Vegas after all.  Don't expect Taco Bell.
