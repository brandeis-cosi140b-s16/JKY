Great atmosphere! Great Chips and Fresh salsa! Service is OK...nothing special, nothing bad. Their margaritas are much better than Las Fuentes. Rio Mirage know cocktails are about proportion and consistency. Even their Tuesday $.99 margaritas are good. I had Rico's special burrito with chicken....FANTASTIC!!!! It's loaded with flavor. Great variety of ingredients. This is a great alternative to nasty Las Fuentes. The atmosphere, drinks, service, and food....EAT HERE!!!!!!!
