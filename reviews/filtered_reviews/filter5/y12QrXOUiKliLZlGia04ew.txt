Perfect atmosphere and amazing food.  Both the outside and inside represents a very trendy atmosphere. An illuminated wall is made of Himalayan rock salt bricks and if you order tacos, your soft tortillas are served on a heated brick of the rock salt!

If you order tableside guacamole, a waiter rolls a carry over to your table and makes your guacamole right in front of you! The chorizo porchetta was amazing and one of the best dishes I have ever had! 

Waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.
