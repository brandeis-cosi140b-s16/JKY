We absolutely loved the entire experience of this lovely place. We had a wonderful waiter who took so much time to explain this Asian/Mexican fusion  concept that was new to us. The decor is pretty and tasteful and the atmosphere had a cool vibe. 
We loved the edamame and the eggplant.  I had the sangria which was yummy. This will be our new go to place. 100% recommend.
