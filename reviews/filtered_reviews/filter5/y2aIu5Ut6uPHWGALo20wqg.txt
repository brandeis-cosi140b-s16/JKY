Blanco is by far my favorite Sam Fox restaurant. It's about two minutes away from home, so my husband and I come here at least several times a month. The first thing I notice about Blanco is that every single time, we have good service. I definitley can't say this for some of the other Fox restaurants, but Blanco's staff does great everytime. Hostesses don't act snooty, servers are attentive and friendly, and even the bartenders are very nice. We have often been sat at tables near the bar, and the bartender has offered to refill drinks if our server wasn't around. The food is also amazing. I don't have super high standards for Mexican food, so I'm happy with the quality handmade guacamole and other regular menu item staples. I LOVE the happy hour at Blanco. Half off all appetizers and drinks. You can easily make a meal sharing appetizers, we usually get the guac, the steak quesadilla, and the chicken taquitos. All the margaritas I've tried have been good, but their blood orange marg is one of my favorites out of any mexican place. Would highly recommend. The food never disappoints and servers seem to actually care that you are enjoying yourselves.
