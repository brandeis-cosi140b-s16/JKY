The best Fajitas in LV. Great service too....can't go wrong with this place. Chips come with not only salsa but with bean dip. Quick tip...the bean dip they serve is NOT vegetarian. They do however serve a vegetarian version of it...just ask. They make their own tortillas...to-order. Generous portions and about a 20 min drive from the strip. Well worth the drive.
