I saw Volcano Choir here last night. It's my first time visiting Phoenix, and this was just part of an all-around great experience. Excellent venue. Intimate and on the small side, but never crowded (it was a sold-out show). Staff was friendly, and everyone I encountered was courteous and behaved themselves.  It made for a spectacular show.
