Very fun and hip atmosphere.  Seating isnt the most comfy but I love the ambiance and the decor.  It's a little asian and a little bit mexican.  The food is excellent.  There are really fun choices.  The mango sticky rice was soooo different than the traditional kind that you get at normal Thai places.  You have to try it to understand what I experienced.  I loved the barbacoa tacos and wished they were bigger but at least I had room to eat other things.  The carnitas taco was also good.  The langosta was so rich and tasty.  The mole fries was not my favorite since it was too heavy on sauce and made the fries soggy.  The pozole was also really good but too large - share it with someone.
