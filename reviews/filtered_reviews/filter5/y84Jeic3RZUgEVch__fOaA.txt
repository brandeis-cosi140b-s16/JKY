My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night.  Great Mexican food. This place has been open in Manhattan Beach for over 40 years and their first expansion is in Vegas by Downtown Summerlin. They're doing something right. We love the So Cal decor and lively vibe inside the restaurant. 

What I'm going to rave about are the margaritas. I love the use of fresh fruit! The flavor is so much better than the sugary product other establishments use for their blended cocktails. 

Jos√© and Ivan did a great job making sure our table was not left wanting. Very friendly staff overall. We will be back.
