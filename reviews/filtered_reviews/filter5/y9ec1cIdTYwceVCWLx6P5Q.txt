A couple days ago, I flew in from Denver and was staying at hotel near the Biltmore. Ended up finding a tequila bar called blanco that had sweet happy hour deals so we decided to go in to have margaritas. Our server was Jordyn, totally made the whole experience worth the stop. Highly recommended... they were super cool!
