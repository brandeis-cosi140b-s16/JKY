Me and My wife went for lunch and were in the mood for some really good fajitas, We were not sure about this place since we are Mexican food snobs.We walked in and were impressed with all the out door and patio seating and the style of the place. The margarita was so good and the shrimp and steak fajitas were awesome, beans and rice were OK but I never eat that anyway when Im pinching bites of fajitas with warm corn tortillas and dippin it in their bomb salsa..It was good the best fajitas in town on the eastside other than going to mesa where there are some pretty good spots as well but these fajitas are done right.. saw someone who ordered the civic he  and that looked really good too.
