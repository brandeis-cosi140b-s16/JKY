Very impressed with the service, food and atmosphere. As soon as we sat down cold glasses of water, chips and three types of salsa was placed in front of us. We don't care for the heaviness of rice and beans so we ordered sides of vegetables instead. This was an excellent choice that I highly recommend.  The portions were large and the food fresh.
