Hands down the best, most unique, and freshest Mexican food I've ever had. If you've been to any of the Barrio restaurants you'll know there is hype behind the name... Well I've been to the one in old Scottsdale and in Gilbert and neither live up to he hype of the original, which after eating at today I will go nowhere else for median food. The guacamole is fresh and he perfect combo of ingredients, again in a league of its own compared to the other restaurants around the valley linked to Barrio.  I ordered the Chiles en nogada as that's the signature item and the dish made on DDD. Is didn't disappoint and I will definitely order again.

It was also happy hour here on a Saturday with half off drinks and buck-fifty tacos. The tacos alone are worth coming for. 

They don't have beans, rice, or flour tortillas... So if you're looking for cheap filler foods go somewhere else.

This place was amazing.
