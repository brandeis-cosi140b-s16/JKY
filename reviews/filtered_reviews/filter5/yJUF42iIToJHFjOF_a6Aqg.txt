Revo Burrito is my go to local spot.  Lunch meetings for work, not in the mood to cook, after traveling with nothing in the fridge, and my go to for a quick meal with out of town guests.  There are healthy options - whole wheat tortillas, gluten free options, brown rice, vegetarian dishes.  

My favorite is the carne asada bowl with organic black beans, guacamole and peppers.  The portion sizes are good, you will not be hungry (and may have some leftovers).  I also like the old fashion lemonade made with Stevia. Tart and refreshing! Hurray and thanks to Revo Burrito for providing clean eaters with healthy and tasty meal options!
