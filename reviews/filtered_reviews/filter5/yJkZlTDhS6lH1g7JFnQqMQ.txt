If you are looking for a delicious burrito, go no further! My husband and I are huge fans and eat here weekly.  The carne asada burrito is my go to choice. The ingredients are fresh and the tortillas are made in house. I highly recomend the salsa/chips and horchata, if you are looking for a little something extra. We always get friendly service and the building is well kept and cutely decorated.
