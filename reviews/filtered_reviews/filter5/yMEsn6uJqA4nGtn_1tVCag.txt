Had a classic fish burrito, it was so good, with white rice. Excellent Tea, and a nice Primo beer of the month. Its a brand new location off the 215 and Rainbow by Boyds gaming. 
It has a full bar, 8 tvs by the bar, gaming machines, huge dining area. This is the best location I have been to. Its all new, clean, I hear its 24 hours.
BTW it opened 10/26/11.
Cool surfer, skater, fish taco place. I want to go back and check out the bar, it wasnt open when I was there at lunch time, it probably is by now.
wahoo fish, carnitas, shrimp tacos, chicken, tofu, or carne asada.
Tacos, burritos, salads, or have it in a bowl.
Huge fan of this place, feels like a healthy lunch or dinner.
