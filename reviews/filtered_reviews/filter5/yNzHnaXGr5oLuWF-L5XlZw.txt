I've been going to Silvia's for over a decade.  They have always had great food and very good consistency.  They recently remodeled and have a open flout plan that is much more inviting. Full device restaurant, great service.  The patio is more open and multiple entrances. Love this place, great breakfast and green/red chili burritos!
