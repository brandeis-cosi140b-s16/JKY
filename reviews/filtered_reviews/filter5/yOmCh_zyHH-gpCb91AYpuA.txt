I'm not sure why it took us so long to try this place.  We used to live close to this place, but didn't try it until we left.  Sure this is a chain restaurant, but it knocks it out of the park for me.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside and the food matches.  I always order the chile rellenos and they are stellar! Usually we order the avocado cream dip for an "appetizer" to go with the chips that come to the table.  It's probably just avocado with sour cream mixed in, but it is so flipping good.
