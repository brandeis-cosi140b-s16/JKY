I don't understand why their rating isn't higher. My family and I eat here pretty often because the salsa alone is just the best. The medium and mild are to die for. They have some interesting nachos. Florentine, BBQ pulled pork, and cheeseburger nachos are the only ones I've tried. I thought all were pretty good, florentine being my favorite. Overall, I think they are pretty good and definitely worth giving a try.
