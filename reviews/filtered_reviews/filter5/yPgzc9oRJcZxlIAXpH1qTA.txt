We love this place.  The wait can be a little long and the bar crowded, but if you have reservations (esp for downstairs) then this place rocks.

One of my fave things -- when the economy was melting down, they had a "stimulus meal" that included two salads, two side dishes, and one entree -- for LESS than the price of the regular entree price on the menu.  

Gotta love a place that does amazing, tasty food and helps the customer out.

One warning:  don't gobble too many of the apps as the meals are big and you'll get filled up.  But damn, the apps are pretty amazing.  Or maybe just make a dinner out of them?
