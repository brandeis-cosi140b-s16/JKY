When I show up to a typical Mexican food joint, if I see carnitas in the menu, you've already got my attention. 

But Pinches' has an unfair advantage: they serve beer. Another unfair advantage is that Pinches is located inside Container Park(an awesome atmosphere with live music usually playing 90% of the time), but one of the big reasons I give this place a five stars, is their serving system seems to be nearly perfect. This is my third visit, the first time being given a wrong order, but a mere SECONDS later, the correct food was on our table(nothing worse than being hungry and seeing someone else's food) and we were chowing down.

I like my burrito made a certain way and they served it up exactly how I like it with no guff. Great food. Great atmosphere. Beer. How can you go wrong? 

With Taco y Taco and Roberto's in town, it's nice to try excellent burritos and fish tacos with great flavor. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Las Vegas
