We have now become regulars at this place.  It is family owned and give wonderful service.  The people greet us as if we were family and already know what we are going to order!
Highly recommend the tacos of carnitas!  The hard shell tacos are also excellent.
For desert recommend the arroz con leche or the corn on the cob.
Highly recommend this place and you too will become a regular!
