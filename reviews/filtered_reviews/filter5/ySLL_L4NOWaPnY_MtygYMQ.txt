Wow!!! This place knocks the socks off ANY other Mexican restaurant I've ever been to! It's located inside the Aria Casino, and its grand entrance with large ropes hanging over the open bar lure you inside. It's simply stunning! I never thought I would use the word "pretty" to describe the interior of a Mexican restaurant since so many are kitschy, but pretty it is.

My husband and I were seated in the bar area for lunch. We had a large rounded booth all to ourselves... in case we wanted to take a siesta after our meal, I suppose. The fresh chips and salsa are so addictive. We went through a basket and a half before our entrees arrived. What can I say? I'm a small girl with a large appetite. 

I ordered three separate items... chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and chicken soft taco. The chile relleno was awesome! It had a crispy coating and a thick cheesy center. It was my favorite of the three, though all were extremely good. My husband ordered chicken mole, which came with flour tortillas and all the fixings. The chicken was still on the bone, but was so moist it just pulled right off. Both meals were served with rice and beans. I normally don't eat the rice and my husband usually doesn't eat the beans. On this occasion, we both cleared our plates. All ingredients were so fresh and the flavors just jumped out at you.

I would come here again in a heartbeat the next time I'm in Vegas. I need more Javier's in my life... Bring a location to St. Louis!
