God bless this restaurant. I thought good Mexican food didn't exist in Madison...then I realised I was talking to people who thought a to-remain-nameless local tex mex chain was "pretty great" "Mexican" "food." and then I found Taqueria Guadalajara, and my life hasn't been the same since. 

They have super friendly and fast service, insanely good prices, cute decor, and amaaaaazing food. They are super busy on weekends so prepare for a wait but it will be worth it! Try the pozole, available only on weekends. It's incredibly soothing and satisfying, the perfect cold weather and/or hangover cure. They also have the best horchata in town. Taqueria Guadalajara forever!!!!
