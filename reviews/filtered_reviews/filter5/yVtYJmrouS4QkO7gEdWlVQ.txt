I am a California resident. I just happen to be in Vegas for the weekend. I yelped this place on my android phone since i was staying at the Palms on Las Vegas Blvd. I was surprised by the 5 star rating on this mexican and korean fusion restaurant.

The people were friendly and helpful.

The Bulgogi Burrito is my favorite and its only about 6 bucks. Its by far the best fusion korean and mexican burrito i've ever tasted. I've had them all in LA but nothing compares to this one...!!!
