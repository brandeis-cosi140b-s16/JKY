Everything about The Stand is delicious. Everything. 

Everything at The Stand is fresh...right down to the homemade lemonade. 

The staff? Friendly, helpful, and welcoming. 

I usually get The Standard with cheese (Two house-ground patties, fresh lettuce, tomato, onion and lettuce). Once in a while, I'll add Niman Ranch bacon to the mix. 
The burgers are consistently delicious...every single time.

Yesterday, I tried the short rib tacos, only because it's so hot outside, and I didn't want a heavy meal. They were TO-DIE-FOR delish! BIG hunks of tender, perfectly seasoned short rib meat, and fresh onion, cilantro, pickled cabbage and cojita cheese. They were FABULOUS!!! 

This place is small, and usually a little crowded, but don't let that deter you. It's definitely THE place to go for wonderful burgers, freshly made fries and the best tacos I've ever had...

My only suggestion? A single burger for the smaller appetite...
