Mi Patio was a pleasant surprise!  We did not know what to expect but relied on the yelp reviews to dictate dinner.  The staff is extremely friendly and recommended great stuff,  3 of us got the chicken burro and loved it.  another got the Quesadilla and loved it.  The margaritas are not only really good and have a good amount of liquor but the price was ridiculous.  Being from LA Margaritas in my area are 7-10 bucks.  The large here was 3.25!  amazingly good too.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! After eating, we all said we have to review this place on yelp!  Will definitely go back again.
