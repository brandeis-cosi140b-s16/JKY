We ate here last night for the first time.  We have been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant since moving here a year ago.  This is finally it!!  The chips and salsa were very yummy, so right off the get go we had high hopes.  They had a pretty extensive vegetarian menu which made me happy.  I had a crunchy taco and a relleno, and my husband had a carne asada burrito.  All delicious!  Ended with a fried ice cream to split.  It was very good.  We will definitely be back. =)
