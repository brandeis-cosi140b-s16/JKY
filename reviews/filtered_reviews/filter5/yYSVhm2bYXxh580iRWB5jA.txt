I first discovered Wahoos in while doing business in SoCal and I fell in love with the amazing food and drinks at a great price.

When I found out they built this location down the street from me, I thought "Cool! But will it be the same? Especially being so far inland..."

I can tell you that this place has gone above and beyond anything that the SoCal locations have going.  The food is still great and cheap! $2.50 for a taco?  WTF are you kidding me?!  Pacificos $2?! So stoked!

Great food combined with a great staff led by bartender James "Big Poppa" is the recipe for a great overall experience!  I've made this place my home away from home.  I'm here almost 5 times a week, it's like having my own version of Cheers in my backyard... I sit down next to Norm, and Sam Malone already has my beer poured and my food on the way.  Couldn't ask for more.

If you've never been to a Wahoos start with a Cajun Fish taco and go from there, everything is good!

Sunday Brunch is also a great deal.  $6 gets you Carnitas with Eggs and all you can drink mamosas for an hour....  Sunday Funday! Give it a go if you can get up before 11:00am.

Thanks Wahoo's crew for making my neighborhood a better place!
