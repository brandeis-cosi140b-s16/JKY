Went to Poncho's on a football  Sunday and sat in the lounge. We had the chorizo cheese crisp, which was really good. And for entrees we had the Muchacho Grande and the Pollo Fundido. As good as they both were, we liked the Pollo Fundido a lot more. Maragaritas were decent. Would definitely go back.
