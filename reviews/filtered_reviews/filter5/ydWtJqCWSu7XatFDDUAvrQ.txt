I cannot explain how pleased I was with this place. If I lived closer to this place I would have gone again the next day!!! They let me mix some of the fillings together, which I thought was very cool. I cannot stop talking about this place, and telling everyone that I meet about how great my experience was here. They flavors were spot on. I would say the only thing is, I had no idea what this place was or how it worked and it was kind of hard to understand what to do at first. There were 4 of us however and we all had different types of tacos and shared a bowl of soup. Not one of us had a complaint!! Everything was delicious!!! We will be back for sure! I hope you open more locations!! :)
