Food was great - anyone who has ever eaten GOOD MEXICAN food will know this place is where its at.  The portions are HUGE - food is YUMMY, Decor is relaxing - and the dining area is Clean... but most importantly, this restaurant is ran by a Family and when you ask for the Manager - you get the Owners - they are Great - and care about your dinning experience with them.   I have recommended Salsa B to many Sun City Residents - most are picky food critics all LOVED Salsa B - they felt the food was good, prices GREAT ( some thought the prices should be raised) all will be going back - all will pass the word to their friends and family - all wish these Great New Entrepreneurs  the BEST OF LUCK w/this One of a Kind Mexican Food Restaurant --- Chili R's and Beef Taco's ARE  TO DIE FOR - I am SOOOOO Hooked ... OOPS - Try the Margaritas -- Nice Buzzzzzz
