We actually ate here twice during our short stay in Vegas.  The second night were we going to eat elsewhere, but the crowd looked big so we moved along.  We decided to eat here again after hearing that the wait would be 30 minutes.  (It was after 9:30PM on Friday night so we figured that would the norm at other places.)  We had our table in less than 5 minutes.   The food was amazing.  Quick and good service.  Great sangria --- a bottle provide 6 full glasses.   I had the shrimp enchiladas both times.       Will definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas.  

Oh, I forgot, they have cilantro rice -- very good.
