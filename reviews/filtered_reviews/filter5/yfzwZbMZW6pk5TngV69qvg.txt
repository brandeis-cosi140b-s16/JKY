The first Russian Grill/Hookah lounge I have ever been to! And I'm very happy I found this place, the Turkish coffee is a MUST have!! And they make really good hookah!! Not only that, but the environment is very exciting and a lot of fun, the owner Alex makes you feel like you are family in his home.  Come after midnight and you can experience some dancing and karaoke!
