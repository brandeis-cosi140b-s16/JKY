yep...restaurant mexico is back on mill avenue...been here for about twenty years, maybe thirty...it's authentic but not sonoran (that is what you usually eat when you eat mexican food), super fast, locally owned and just remarkably good...not your standard overly fried (though sometimes that is tasty) americanized mexican food...white cheese, not yellow, super fresh, lovely salsa, guacamole to write home about....RM is my fave....and their new location is their best yet....try the clare burro......delish
