Pleasantly surprised! I know this sounds weird, but great water is hard to find if you aren't a drinker! Great service, surprisingly high quality, fresh food and great prices. It seems like all the reviews are only for the bar, but hey- where can you find fresh food that is actually good until 1am? Comfortable, up-beat atmosphere. Tiffany our server was very nice, attentive, and recommended the shrimp tacos which I loved. -- this place is under-rated! :)
