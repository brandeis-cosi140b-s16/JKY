I want to give this place 6 stars- I LOVE IT! 
Firstly love how they try to locally source all their ingredients, produce ect-
Secondly its not trying too hard- its not overdone or upfront, it has a nice ambiance to it that is comforting, come on in and feast your face!

I ordered two carne asada steak taco, one ahi taco, and a quesadilla-- I really wanted to try the guacamole- but it was to go and didnt want to risk it going bad ect ect.
The carne asada steak brought me oddly enough to the comforts of a street vendors shawarma on the best streets of any large middle eastern city- yes the spices were totally different but familiarity of the tenderness, freshly cut beef off a rotating grilling machine..... I could eat 10 of these.
The fish taco was good, but nothing extraordinary, tasted slightly mayonaise-y, Im not a cheese person and the quesadilla was good especially with the salsa.
I would love to go back to this place more frequently!
