I give this place 5 stars, although if it were there food alone, I would say 4 stars. 

They have the best service in all of Las Vegas when it comes to restaurants. The atmosphere is fun and exciting with often times live music. 

Free chips and salsa as well as being dip with any meal. Try their tableside welcome moly, they will prepare it fresh right next to you.

I like all sorts of dishes on the menu, but I prefer to order al la carte 3 tacos with shredded chicken. 

Their fried ice cream or churros are absolutely amazing! Try this place out, it will not disappoint.
