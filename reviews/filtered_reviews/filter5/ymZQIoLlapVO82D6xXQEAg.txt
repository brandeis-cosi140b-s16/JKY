I recently held a banquet here for my mother's 50th birthday. It was recommended that I use Valle Luna because they are easy to work with. I made a couple visits to the restaurant before booking the banquet. What had me sold was their beautiful view from their back patio. I was able to set up the menu for the banquet. They answered all of my questions. What really had me sold was on the day of the banquet I had an excellent server called Ricky. I can tell Ricky is a pro. He made sure to ask me all the questions he needed to help me make the party run smoother. There was a very small mix up with a menu item we ordered and he resolved it very quickly. Ricky really made the party. I was able to focus on the guest of honor and other party guests. The service was good and the food was excellent. Everything tasted good and there was enough food for everyone. They were even able to accommodation a last minute desert order. I will consider using Valle Luna again for a banquet!
