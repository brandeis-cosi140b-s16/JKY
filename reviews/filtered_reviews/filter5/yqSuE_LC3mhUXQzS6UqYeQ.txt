I love the carne asada burrito it is the best I have ever had!!!  It comes with a slice of lime, radish and a homemade salsa that is great.  I order an xl carne asada burrito because the normal carne asada burrito is just a wee bit to small for me.  This is the Cadillac of carne asada burritos the meat is great has a nice char to it and yet still juicy.  The homemade horchata (mexican drink) is on point and has my girlfriend hooked.  What also is great is that unlike those other Mexican quick food places you can grab a Mexican beer, Margarita and they even have Mexican bottled Coca Cola made from real sugar rather than our high-fructose corn syrup Coca Cola we get in the good ol' U.S of A.  This place has been added to my list of regular grub spots.  

This is another downtown spot that was previously someones home.  I am still not used to the squeaking sound that the floors of these old houses turned into a business make when you walk on them.  I sometimes feel like my big self is going to fall through like you see on cartoons.  The dining area is small.  If you have a group I would suggest you have someone snag a table because bye the time you order there might not be somewhere to sit.  The place can fill up quick.  Hey but that is the charm of these places downtown.  If you don't like it go to the burbs.
