I love this place so much! There meat are just juicy. The price is defiantly worth it, I crave this every month, and is defiantly a place I would bring my family and friends to try out when then come from out of town! The restaurant seem just like no other Mexican restaurants , when you first walk in, everything just seem simple, nothing special for first impression, but once you got those tacos on your hand, everything about the restaurant don't matter, the food are just great, I went there for lunch time today and bought some Togo for my sons snack ! I defiantly recommend tacos lover to try out this place, just right near the strip!
