The salads are what makes this a MUST for my wife and I. Fresh as it can be, they make everything right in front of you however you want it. They even make the tortillas fresh in the restaurant, straight from little dough balls! Both my wife and I order the salads without the rice and beans (neither one of us can really finish the salads otherwise, which is saying quite a lot about portion size here since I RARELY am unable to clear my plate, oink oink), I get the pork and she gets the steak with extra pico on top. They give you a choice of two dressings to choose from but we've found that the best choice is to get a bit of each and mix them together, they complement each other wonderfully! No need to get chips and salsa if you are ordering a salad for yourself, this meal will fill you nicely!

Now, if you really aren't craving a salad from here (tsk tsk), then the burritos are pretty damn good as well. I tried one the other day just for the sake of it and i was rather impressed with it. Very filling and it held together nicely, though I did have to eat it with a fork and knife due to size (not complaining though!). 

I have yet to try the coconut shrimp tacos though, they are a special on tuesdays and I just can't seem to get there those days!! Grrrrr...
