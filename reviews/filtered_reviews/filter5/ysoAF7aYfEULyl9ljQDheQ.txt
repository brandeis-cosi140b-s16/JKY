This place is is fun. It features two of my favorite foods on 1 plate, At first I thought it was a crazy idea but said hey let's give it a try. They let you sample everything on the menu before you order. I liked that. i did not like how you order your food. A bit confusing but so worth it in the end! I ordered the jade red chicken with pork fried rice and a side jade red chicken quesadilla....wow. So delicious! The service was pretty good as well. I have been back many times with my boyfriend. The only complaint is their location. It is very hard to find, but when you do I promise it's worth it!
