I don't understand some of the bad reviews here. I have been driving to South Phx for years just to eat a Pollo Fundido at Ponchos. Last night we took a couple of friends who had never been. We have not been in over a year. Everything was great. Service, food was exactly as is always has been. Friends love what they ordered, one the beef chimi, the other pollo fundido. The totally enjoyed it as did I.
I would highly recemmend this place as I always have. Its a family restaurant, cozy fun atmosphere. you  might wait a bit on a friday night and the bar is noisy, but it has a fun vibe .
