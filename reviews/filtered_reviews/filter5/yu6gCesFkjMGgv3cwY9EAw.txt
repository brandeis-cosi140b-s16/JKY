Easily the best Russian restaurant in town.  My wife is originally from Moscow and is quite persnickety when it comes to pelmeni and borscht!  The Green Dacha passed with flying colors!  The borscht was right up there with my mother in laws recipe!  I said right up there Olga, put down the bat! Pelmeni was great, potato salad was very tasty and beef stroganoff will make you lick the plate when no one is looking!  My favorite dish was the khachapuri...it could be its own food group!  Can't wait to go back and try the blini, drink more Baltikas and try the home made Napoleon!  Alex was our waiter and he was awesome!  If you're already a Russian gastronome or just want try this hearty fare The Green Dacha is definitely the place to go in Vegas!
