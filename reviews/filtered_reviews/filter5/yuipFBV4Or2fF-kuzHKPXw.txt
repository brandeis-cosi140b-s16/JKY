Christopher T. is correct in stating that this place should go into your usual rotation.   I had the chicken soup - and while I did see a review that this wasn't authentic Pho - WHO CARES!  It was amazing.  If you are looking at reviews, considering dining here, just get in the car and come.  It's good, and you will like it.
