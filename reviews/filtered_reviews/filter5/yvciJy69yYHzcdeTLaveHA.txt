Amazing combination of flavors!

I love the ambiance of this venue - modern chic!  They also blew out the back wall and created an open floor plan leading to an outdoor patio! It totally brightens up the place. The bar leads from the inside and continues outside. We sat at the outside bar area and even though it's HOT out, it was actually nice so we decided to continue dinner there as well.

Try the following and you won't be disappointed (Mind you I didn't order any shellfish because of the boyfriend's allergy, so the list is small today):

V-9 Cocktail - This is now on my top five cocktails I've ever had!
Toreado Guacamole - My favorite (I think it might even be better than mine!)
Tocino Guacamole (Bacon & Corn) - My 2nd favorite
Carne and Pancita tacos are equally delicious. We couldn't decide which were better!

The Pancita tacos had pork belly sprinkled with CHICHARRON!

When I go back next time, I will definitely try the short ribs and every single shellfish dish. So sit tight for an update!
