Ok so being from Los Angeles I know Mexican food. After we saw all the stellar reviews we figured we would stop by and this give place a try... Once again yelp was right. If you love seafood this is a must go to place in Las Vegas!!!

We tried the shrimp with green sauce (sorry i don't remember the name now) and it was delicious. The flavor was very natural and overall delicious. We also tried the large shrimp in a spicy red sauce (sorry I'm writing this in Vegas and I don't remember the name) and that was also amazing. We almost licked the plate clean it was so good.

The server was attentive and informative. Took the time to explain to us the items on the menu. He also asked us to tell him how spicy we wanted our food from 1-10. We chose a 7 and to us it was perfect.

So my wife now says this was her favorite seafood place. We're definitely going back now! 

The prices were reasonable since they give you a good amount of seafood and the quality was great. Not cheap but not expensive either. Instead of going on the strip for a healthy alternative try this place out.
