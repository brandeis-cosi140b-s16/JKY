Finally, I had time to stop by the new location!
I LOVE the original Taco y Taco on Trop and Pecos.  I knew I'd love it here, and let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed!

I haven't been to this building since it was Fado's, about 5 years ago.  
I absolutely love what they've done with the space!!  

The main room is very open, with plenty of space, which is good.  This place was PACKED at lunch time!  I even ran into Shirley B!

The setup is the same as the old spot:  different stations for what kind of tacos/meats that you want.  
This time, I had an al pastor (duh), a chorizo taco, and a chorizo mulas.  My friend and I also tried tripas for the first time, which was surprisingly good. :)

Same quality food, more space, and it feels more like a modern bar/eatery than a cantina.  I really like it.  My only sad point is that its a bit far for me to drive.  Luckily, I have the original spot whenever I'm not in Henderson. 

Great job, Taco y Taco crew!!!!
