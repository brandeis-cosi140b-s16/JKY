We came in last night because of good yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. I had probably the best tacos I've ever had...ever! I tried my partner's wet burrito and it had the such a great flavor. She had a spicy beef and I had green chili, another spicy beef, and the mild chicken in my tacos. When we walked in the owner invited us to try their different meat options and they were all phenomenal!!!!! The medium salsa was my favorite. I loved the atmosphere....that whole strip mall is nice, with Scramble a few doors down, another great place to eat!
