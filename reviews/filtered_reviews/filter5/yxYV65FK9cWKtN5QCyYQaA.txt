This place has awesome asada tacos. They are filled with avacado and salsa. This restaurant stays open till 3am on weekdays and 5am on Friday and Saturday night making it the best after-party stop.

This has become my favorite taco place in vegas. The carne asada tacos are awesome. I stopped there for lunch and later after going to a club stop there for dinner. this place is a great place to stop after a long night . it's open till 5 o'clock in the morning on friday and saturday nights and 3 o'clock in the morning on other nights of the week. my only complaint is the meat later on at night is fatty.
