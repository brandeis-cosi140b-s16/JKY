This is an amazing find on the Vegas food scene. Fresh ingredients, skillfully prepared with TLC in a beautifully decorated locale. The price point is excellent for organic, gmo-free ingredients and the flavor palettes are so much deeper and nuanced than you find at most mexican influenced restaurants in the United States.

The creamy tomatillo sauce on the seafood enchiladas was brightly flavored, rich and balanced without any hint of heaviness from the cream. Chef Paco was happy to accommodate a substitution of corn tortillas for wheat in order to keep this celiac's stomach happy and even comped us an incredible strawberries and cream dessert when they ran out of flan. He's a sweetheart of a guy who happily chats with customers when there's a lull in the action. 

The second visit (the very next night) to sample the 24/7 breakfast menu was no disappointment and we were well taken care of by Rafael, who demonstrated genuine concern for my gluten issues and was an all around delight. I hate to say they were better than the version I had in rural Morelos Mexico...  But frankly, the traditional huevos divorciados were elevated to new heights. It's amazing how the chef takes a common dish and turns it into something of memorable execution and presentation.

We're headed back over for round three before reluctantly returning to Denver in the morning. I'm not a gambler, but I'll be back to Vegas sooner than later just to get another taste of Eldorado's top notch cuisine... Because the quality here is NO gamble!
