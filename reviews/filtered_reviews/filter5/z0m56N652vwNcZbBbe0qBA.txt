I expected this place to serve food with a hint of Hawaiian flare and it delivered.
I ordered the 3 kalua pig tacos with tomato and grilled onions & a bowl of huli huli chicken with seaweed rice and charred pineapple verde & guacamole on the side. The kalua pig is so similar to authentic Hawaiian style and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but not near as authentic Hawaiian huli huli chicken. However, it is very difficult to make or find authentic Hawaiian huli huli chicken as it requires Keawe wood from trees grown in Hawaii.
I have to give this place great credit for having "Island Style" food with a Hawaiian flare as it was very tasty and portions were great for the reasonable prices. The service was very friendly on a Sunday night at 715pm and FAST on the drive-thru.
I didn't leave without trying the Coconut Bark and it was very authentic Hawaiian candy from long ago similar  to Almond Roca made with Island Style like Ed & Dons Macadamia brittle candy from the 70s. It was so onolicious that I will buy it for my family and friends from Hawaii because I know they would appreciate it alot.
