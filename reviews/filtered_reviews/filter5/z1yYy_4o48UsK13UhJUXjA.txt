I was in the area and decided to see how awesome this place is. I have got to say, the service is outstanding.  I came in during after lunch hours and the place was fairly empty.  So I got served well.  
What I had: I ordered the half order of bulgogi fries and the kimchi fried rice with egg.  When she brought out my fries, the cheese on it was great.  The quality of the cheese is of course better than average because when I pull a few fries out, the cheese actually streches out instead of snapping on instance.  The bulgogi meat in the fries were delicious, not hard as a rock like some places that make terrible carne asada.  Good thing I ordered a half because it was very huge.  The kimchi fried rice was a full size dish.  I have got to say, it was very different.  The flavor was light and not overpowering.  The meat, was of course the same as the fries.. GOOD.  

I have got say, that the pricing is very decent for the portion.  The service is excellent because when I asked for a togo box, she brought me my box and half an orange already sliced up.  Always nice to have something that's like a dessert.  BONUS.  I noticed they had all the condiments up front (Tapatio, different hot sauces, etc.).  She also brought it out with my fries.  

I WILL come back, just sadden that it's far out of my way.  Place also accepts AMERICAN EXPRESS!.. Whoo! Parking is might be a drag at certain times since it's a shared lot with other stores.
