Who would've thought that this little place would be so awesome? I'm glad I read the reviews bc I would've never thought to go here. It's not like the other crappy Mexican places that are everywhere. This is amazing food and our server was so nice and very attentive. Can't wait to go back. And yeah.....the enchiladas rock.
