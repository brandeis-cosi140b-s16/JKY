This place is so awesome for frugal drunkards like myself. Most people probably dont know about it as its tucked away in the back of Ballys and not really something you're likely to stumble across.

If you're in Vegas, plan to make a trip here if you like really cheap drinks, friendly and appreciative bartenders and a really casual, almost homey atmosphere.

Here is what you need to know. $2 shots of tequila, margaritas, draft beers and tacos. They also have a $15 margarita pitcher and a $25 128oz. bowl of alcohol poisoning. All the time. 24/7. 

You wont see club chicks in skimpy black dresses here or douche bags in Ed Hardy shirts. You may see an inebriated man in a hawaiian shirt and khaki shorts slurring his words at noon. If you do, stop and say hi to me!

Me and my girlfriend chose the margarita pitcher at the suggestion of our super friendly bartender. He said we might be happier with that than ordering separate $2 ones. He liberally poured booze into the pitcher right in front of us and seemed to keep pouring when he noticed my pleasure at the amount of booze he was providing. We tipped him well.

About halfway through our pitcher a couple of complimentary tacos showed up. He said they were extra and he thought I might want them! Thanks bartender! They are pretty good too for $2 tacos. Nice and fresh, decent size and the chicken was well seasoned and tasted pretty good. 

I miss the Tequila Bar and I want to go back. My only complaint is that they couldn't sell me the plain black shirt that said "Tequila Bar, Bally's Las Vegas in a very standard font that the bartender was wearing and I wanted so badly as a souvenir.
