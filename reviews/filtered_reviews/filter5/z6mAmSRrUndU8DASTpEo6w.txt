We were in town from Kansas City and staying at a hotel close by. My wife and I are crazy over some Mexican food and we were looking for the closest place. Julia's stood out with their "fast food" type building and neon paint. When I read that they served "Mexican and Burgers", I was skeptical. It's been my experience that when a place serves Mexican food and something else, neither one is stellar. I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, it's Chipotle-style, but this is hardly fast food caliber. For starters, you can see the flames from the open grill and watch the food being grilled fresh. The tortillas are homemade. They have a salsa bar with 6 or 8 types of salsas. We love spicy salsa and most places fall short. Julia's had very hot salsa that had a flavor as good as its "kick". We got a burrito and a burrito bowl. The chili verde was wonderful. This stuff was so good and portions so large we took our leftovers to the hotel and had them for lunch the next day. Don't overlook this spot.
