Idk why this place has such a bad rating. I would never come here for a romantic dinner, but for a quick lunch this place was perfect! Of course the prices are high it's right on the strip, but they have a Groupon that helped. They also have someone come around and take a picture of your table, you get a free postcard pic even if you don't buy the framed pic they try to sell you. Not that exciting but it was fun. The food was good and they breaded the fish for my tacos even tho it wasn't on the menu. Plus I heard they have 99 cent bloody Mary's for breakfast, what!
