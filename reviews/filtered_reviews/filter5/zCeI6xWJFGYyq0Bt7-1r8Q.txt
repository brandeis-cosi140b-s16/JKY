I saw a promo for Milagro Grill's opening on TV and thought I would check it out with a girlfriend of mine. We had a great time. The service was good and food awesome. We shared the Salsa Trio (great chips!) 

We tried the PB &J appetizer (from TV) Very unusual-loved the sauce. Also had the Papa y carne (flatbread with skirt steak) yummie.  The Habenero Margarita (think rasberries!) was awesome. Finished up with the Churro's-the mousse was delicious and Avacodo Cheesecake-cheese cake was ok, but the mango salsa was out of this world. They are still working out the kinks, but looks like it will be a new neighborhood hang out place. Can't wait to try the patio out when it gets cooler.
