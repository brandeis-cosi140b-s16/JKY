I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino and this is conveniently located across the street next to CVS. My servers name was Cassidy and she was very sweet and attentive. I don't eat meat and she was very helpful with suggestions as to what my options were. I decided on the rice bowl and it was a big portion and above all delicious. I also had a house margarita that was well blended and strong. I highly recommend this place and will definitely return.
