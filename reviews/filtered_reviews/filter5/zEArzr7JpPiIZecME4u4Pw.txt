This place is as Guy would say "Out of BOUNDS!" good! I could eat at this joint every day until the day I die. If you like traditional meals and salsa that is actually spicy, this is the place. 

Customer service means something to this establishment. You'll be treated as well (if not better) than you treat them. Smile and thank them and they'll jump for you! 

Best plate in my opinion is the Carnitas. It's always juicy and the beans and rice never miss. I've had just about everything on their menu and nothing made me want to send it back.

Margaritas? Yup! And they do them by the pitcher if you want!! This place is a win!
