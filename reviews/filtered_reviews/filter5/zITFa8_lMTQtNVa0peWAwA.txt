This place was a total surprise! From the outside it looks like just another run down mexican restaurant, but I was impressed with how clean and well kept the inside was. The staff were very friendly and patient with me as I asked a lot of questions about their menu. 

My food was fantastic! The fish tacos were awesome, nothing was overly greasy like other mexican restaurants I've been to. This is definitely a place to try at least once.
