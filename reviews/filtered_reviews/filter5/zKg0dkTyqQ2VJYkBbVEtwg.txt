Out of all the places I've been in Vegas, this is probably my favourite. We ended up here completly by chance, and I was blown away. The local was casual and not crowded, and the staff were very friendly. Make sure you order a cocktail (or three, it is Vegas after all) and no matter what you have to eat make sure it includes the guacamole they make for you at your table. Best guacamole of life! Can't wait to go back!
