This was for a dine-in experience:

Food: We had the Texas burgers and fries combo. Despite being in the peak of lunch hour, the food arrived fresh, hot and on time. Burgers and fries are made fresh, and I suspect the ranch sauce I got for my fries was as well. I do not usually indulge in restaurant ranch dips, but theirs was perfect. In the Texas burger, the onion rings and the bacon were crispy and tasty. Price was extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of food we got.

Staff: The staff was friendly, fast and courteous. We received a warm greeting through the door. Our waitress had a great personality, and knew our Dr Who references when we were chattering. She was very helpful with directions to our next stop, being we are very new in town. She was the one to suggest the ranch dip for my fries, which was a huge plus for me. I love out-of-the-box type ideas like that.

Location: Very clean, very good ambiance despite the crowds of hungry locals and tourists. We felt very relaxed despite it being in the peak lunch rush. It is in a good location for people window shopping on 5th avenue and the galleries. They had their daily specials posted at the front door, which was what brought us in in the first place... but the Texas burger just looked too good to pass up! The fact that they serve breakfast all day is a huge plus to me, as someone who happily eats waffles or scrambled eggs for any meal of the day.

This place was friendly, the food was great, and the price is right. They are officially our go-to restaurant when we want a burger, tacos, or breakfast while cruising Downtown Scottsdale.
