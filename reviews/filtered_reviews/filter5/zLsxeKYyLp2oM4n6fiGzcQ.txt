Came here because we saw this place on Triple D and Guy goes to some delicious places... So, I had to check it out.
It was delicious! The customer service was on point! This friendly girl helped us out with ordering and also let us sample the six most popular items on the menu. Now that really helped me decide.
I ordered the red jade chicken and carnitas combo with the pork fried rice and black beans. It was so good!!!  All of the combination of favors- Asian and mexican is one great combo. I order a quesadilla for my son and they accidentally made it with the wrong meat- the guy let's me choose a whole new order and.... It was on the house!!! So I had ordered the same combo but this time the red jade chicken in a quesadilla.... One of the best quesadillas I've had! And I'm from San Francisco where they've got bomb ass Mexican food!!! 
This place was great, and with each order you get a free cookie. The place is in a tiny strip mall and it's practical but very clean. Customer service was just as good as the food!
When I come back to Phoenix, I'm def hittin this place up again!!
