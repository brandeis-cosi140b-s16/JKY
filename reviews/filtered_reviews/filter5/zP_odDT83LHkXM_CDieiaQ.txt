I was looking for a nice hookah lounge to sesh at on my trip to Las Vegas for New Years. Green Dacha grill and hookah lounge surpassed my expectation.

The Food
I ordered the chicken Kiev with a side of ranch and it was very tasty, they have one of the best ranch recipes I've ever tried. 

The Hookah
I ordered their house blend OMG which was a mixture of many different berries. The clouds were thick and the flavor was rich.

The Atmosphere
The interior design of Green Dacha  is aesthetically pleasing, a lot of work was put into this place. Couches were very comfy. 

Overall, great experience.
