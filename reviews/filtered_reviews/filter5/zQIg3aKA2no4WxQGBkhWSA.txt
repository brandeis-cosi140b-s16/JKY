ENVIRONMENT 
Small shop in a strip mall with indoor seating, including bar seating and a few outdoor tables. The place was packed when we visited, which is a good sign

MENU
Lots of unique offerings and combinations. Brûlée burger, jalapeño ranch, Lucky Charms Marshmallow milkshake.

BURGER
Beach House - amazing burger with poco de gallo and some kick

MILKSHAKE
Lucky Charm Milkshake - WHOA! The lucky charms marshmallows are ground in just as you would expect, but the shake itself tastes of homemade ice cream, which is awesome.  

GRILLED CHEESE
Havarti - Excellent

SIDES 
French Toast Fries -- COULD BE THE BEST THING ON THE MENU
