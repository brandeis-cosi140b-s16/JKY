Awesome as always! Me and my family have been eating here for a few years and I'm just getting around to writing a review. Customer Service is top notch. This last time we dined in we had Lucian as our server. He is FANTASTIC! He was very courteous and polite and brought out our daughter's food first so she wasn't starving. He made sure our drinks were always filled and had extensive knowledge of the menu. We ordered the Nachitos Fritas as an appetizer and built our own burritos. Everything was perfect!! We couldn't finish everything so we got the rest of our burritos to go. I have to say it was just as good the second day!
