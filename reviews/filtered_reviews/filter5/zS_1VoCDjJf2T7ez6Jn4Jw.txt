The best fish tacos I have ever had and maybe the best fish tacos in the world.  I think the tacos were $1.50 each.  How is that possible?!  My wife loved her chicken tamale, comparing it to the world-renowned tamales made by a family friend.  The guy running this place is really nice and helpful.  My highest possible recommendation.  A+
