Where do I start.  Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  The place isn't the biggest, but its well worth the wait.  I met a buddy there for dinner on Thursday.  They offered chips and salsa, just like most standard Mexican places, but the green salsa was excellent.  Asked for more cause I loved it so much.  For appetizer I ordered the ceviche and a dozen of oysters.  Both tasted super fresh and were awesome.  For dinner I had the fried fish, which was cooked to perfection.  I devoured the entire fish.  My buddy ordered the fish tacos which were delicious as well.  I was too full to try any dessert, but the coconut cake did look really good.  Overall I spent a little more than I wanted, but for the service, atmosphere and the quality and freshness of the food, it was well worth it.  I consider myself a foodie, an this was one of the best meals that I have ever had.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed.
