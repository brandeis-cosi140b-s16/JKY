The Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Diggity!  This place has the absolute best tacos I have ever had.  I'm from Chicago and I thought we had some pretty awesome Mexican food there.  After trying Los Gordos in Las Vegas, the tacos here in Chicago just don't measure up.  Freshly made tortillas are amazing.  The adobada is to die for.  Carne Asada is good.  If you're looking to try something different, try the Cabeza (so tender and delicious) or the Suadero (slow cooked Beef shoulder).  They give you grilled green onions and peppers with every order, which is a huge delicious plus.  I can't wait to be in Vegas again for these tacos!
