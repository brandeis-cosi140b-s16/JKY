I love this place! 

Man, the Chicken Machaca burrito I had for lunch today was s-c-r-u-m-t-i-o-u-s!! OMG so good... and super filling. 

We go here all the time, especially on the weekends. Their breakfast burrito is amazing.

I really like the decor... it's mod and minimalist, without being over the top. 

Also they have alot of GF (gluten free) menu items, which is a +. And they have their signature lemonade drinks available with Stevia. ++
