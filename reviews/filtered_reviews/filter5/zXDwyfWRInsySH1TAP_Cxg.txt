This little place delivers in a big way!  They have a creative menu with a lot of vegetarian options.  The Sandia & Citron Salad is great.  Combination of watermelon and greens.  Also, the guacamole app is phenomenal.  

Several sangria options.  I had the red and it was delicious. 

Service was friendly and professional. 

Will definitely be back.
