this place is DELICIOUS! the workers are very nice, the portions they give are HUGE and full of flavor. you can eat in or take out and no matter what, the food is always the best quality. they have mexican, chinese, and korean food and everything always has a good twist to it. i recommend the fusion tacos with chicken and a lettuce shell, and also the orange chicken where you get a BIG serving of orange chicken and white rice. they have something to offer for everyone and its not expensive at all so go try it!! :D
