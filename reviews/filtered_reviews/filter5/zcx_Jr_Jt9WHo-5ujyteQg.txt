I can't say enough good things about Casa Reynoso. I just wished I had known about it earlier! It's tucked in the corner of a Fry's strip mall, so for an entire year we never even noticed it was there.
I'm so glad we found it, because it really is a little gem. I love the green chili chimi and there 4.00 Margaritas are awesome. The family that owns this place are always there and are SO nice. They love to talk and will recommend all the goods. 
Kids are also extremely welcome here. This is just a great little Mexican place with awesome service, yummy food, and a decent atmosphere. 
We love it!
