I have been coming here for as long as I can remember and I absolutely love this place! The chips and salsa is amazing and I love the fact that the salsa actually has a kick to it. The margaritas are always delicious and the service is always great. Whenever I have to go to Phoenix this is definitely the one place I stop by.
