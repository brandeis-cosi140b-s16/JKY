I was recommended to this place by a family member and it turned out to be exactly what I expected and more. I would say that it is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been too.  I had no problems finding parking (right in the back of the restaurant by all the cool murals) and found nothing dicey about the neighborhood and we arrived around 9pm and were coming from out of town. The spicy margaritas were excellent and the cochinita pibil were super good. We also ordered the Chiles en Nogada dish and it was not only super unique but the TASTIEST dish I have ever had.  Thumbs up!!
