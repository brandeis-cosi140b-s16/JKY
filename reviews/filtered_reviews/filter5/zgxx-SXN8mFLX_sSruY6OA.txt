This place is awesome and has great deals! We got some chicken burritos and some queso and they were really good. They have fresh ingredients and don't skimp. Some people said they take their time but I'm glad they did! They made sure it wasn't a soggy mess. They actually want it to taste good and seem to care about what they are serving rather than some chain restaurants. The ladies working there were really really sweet. This is our new spot for Mexican!
