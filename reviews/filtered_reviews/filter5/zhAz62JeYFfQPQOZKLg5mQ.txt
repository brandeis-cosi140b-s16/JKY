I haven't had Mexican food this good in L.A.  Don't expect standard Mexican food drowned in gooey cheese-they use a different type of cheese that crumbles on the top.  I had been going there since they opened up in 1978, and whenever I am in Tempe I have to go there.  Their green enchiladas with tomatillo sauce are addictive and very spicy!  And their beans- heavenly!
