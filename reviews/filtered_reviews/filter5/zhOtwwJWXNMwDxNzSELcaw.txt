OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!

So many options - So many Tacos!! And you can order all different kinds - as in singles - plus they are so little ordering 2 or 3 encouraged : )

The cilantro french fries are the best in town. The Mexican corn is good too, but spicy.

Best Tip about this place: They have outdoor seating, they have roll-up garage style windows if it's nice out. 

*Side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms.
