I really shouldn't be reviewing this place because I only have been once and only had soup...but I couldn't help myself.  The concept is absolutely hip.  Super cool.  The menu looked amazing.  When I first arrived I thought "7.00 for a taco?"  That was for THREE.  The wall menu doesn't indicate that and I suggested they fix that.  They have pastries and ice cream and I sampled the Pecan ice cream and it was amazing.  The young girl that works there was a wealth of information and very very nice.  She offered me a tasting of the soup within seconds of me walking in.
We will definately go back!
