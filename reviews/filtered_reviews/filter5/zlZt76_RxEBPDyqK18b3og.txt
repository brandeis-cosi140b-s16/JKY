OH MY GOSH!

I had no hope or expectation that this would be any better than average at best.  Holy Moley!  The Spotted Donkey Delivers!  This place is in a nice area, yet still out there enough to feel like a destination.  It is very well decorated and service is phenomenal.  The food is out of this world too!

Here is a prime example of a place that charges a little more than normal for Mexican food but does a stellar job of making sure you get the value that they are charging you for.
