I went here for lunch based on yelp reviews, I was craving shrimp cocktail. I'm pregnant and what the baby wants the baby gets. When I first pulled up, I was like... oh... uh.... I contemplated going somewhere else because it definitely looks sketchy from the outside. But I decided to trust the yelpers and I went in, and my whole mindset completely changed. It's small, but it's totally clean, organized, and nice inside! A lot of places to sit and it was all just very clean. I was surprised. The lady who took my order was nice, didn't speak too much English but enough to get my order right which is all I cared about. 

While I waited for my food I got some of their hot carrots/jalapenos and was happy to find there was also hot cauliflower in there, which I love (the baby loves). My food came out in a few minutes and I took it back to work to eat. My shrimp cocktail was really good. Just what you'd expect, nothing super fancy but the shrimp was very big and they were not stingy. I only ordered the medium, at first I wished I got the large but while I was eating I kept finding more and more big shrimp in the cup and it was definitely satisfying enough for lunch. Also they were generous with the avocado too, which always makes me happy. 

I ate my hot carrots and cauliflower by themselves after and it may sound silly but they were soo good. They were really spicy and tangy all the way through, but not mushy or overly hard with no flavor like some places. It was so good I wish I had gotten more!

5 stars, even though it's a little shady on the outside, I can't knock them for that. I will definitely be back again soon for the carne asada everyone is talking about!
