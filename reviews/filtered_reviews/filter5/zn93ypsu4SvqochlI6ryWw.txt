This is seriously one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. It NEVER fails. 

We came a few weeks ago on a crowded night and were sat and waited on promptly (we had a reservation).  We ordered drinks that came quickly and the tableside guac - which you HAVE to order because it is so delicious. I got a blood orange margarita, which I always get, and I swear it is the best margarita I've had.

I usually go for three tacos - although every time I order 3 tacos I remember I cannot eat 3 of their tacos. So delicious, you can't go wrong ordering tacos. You can select a combo of any of the tacos on the menu.  

The service is great, the atmosphere is lively and fun, we will continue to be Paco's patrons!
