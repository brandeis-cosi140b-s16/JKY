This is a local spot with the best chicken in town. Only serves a few things. Cash only!!! Very casual! It's packed at lunch with workers. Most dishes are served with onions and beans. I like a side of sour cream and make mine into tacos. I saw David spade last time I was in. There is an ATM in the shop next door if you need one.
