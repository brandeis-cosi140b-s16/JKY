It is the superlative bean and cheese burrito in Phoenix! Classic taste and the refried beans are not cooked in lard, which is nice for vegetarians to know and whatever oils they use give them a good savory taste. No bland beans here! If dairy is not your thing, the Ghandi Vegan burrito has fresh guacamole and black beans matched by no other. And if the entrees weren't enough, there is also THE best salsa bar of all time. The red chipotle salsa must have some sort of addictive substance in it, as I cannot stop at just two servings. 
The service is top notch and the atmosphere is mellow. 
My only issue is that it's kinda hard to see from the road. But you can see the sign pretty easy if you're looking for it.
