I have been here for happy hour margaritas and appetizers two years in a row. Both visits were great. The service at the bar was exceptional and the food was much more traditional than what I expected. This isn't tex mex, people - the flavor is much more fresh and I always feel great after leaving and ready to continue my vegas tyrants. Our bartender was very friendly and maybe a bit too concerned as to whether we were enjoying the food and drinks; but that would probably be an excellent aspect to someone else. I definitely recommend this place.
