Why all the hate? I don't get it. I eat here at least once a month and I have never had anything but delicious food and great service. My favorites are the Chef's Steak, the seafood enchiladas, the shrimp tacos, carne asada, and mole', in that order. If you are wanting a traditional steak house steak, that is not the steak for you. It's usually rib-eye with tons of flavor and very juicy. It's thinner, maybe a half inch but takes up s fair amount of plate real estate. The potato puree that comes with it is a cloud of spicy deliciousness. 

Every restaurant makes mistakes but Rosa's always fixes them quickly and offers wonderful food.
