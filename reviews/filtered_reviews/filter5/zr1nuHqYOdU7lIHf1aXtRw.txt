I live in southern California and I've had a ton of enchiladas in my lifetime but the enchiladas at Diego's are THE best I've ever had. I went with 3 girlfriends and they all agreed. Definitely get a pitcher of margaritas if you are there with friends. We were there Sunday night (2.19.12) and the staff was great too.  I definitely recommend.
