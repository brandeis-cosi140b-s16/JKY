Always yummy. Nice cheap place for dinner. Chips and salsa, 2 decent sized tacos and a beer for $11 plus tip. Service is so quick! Was served everything in my meal within 10 minutes of sitting down. Happy Hour is only a deal on the drinks. Tacos are only 50 cents off 3 varieties. Who needs happy hour when the prices are so reasonable. Haven't had a taco here I didn't like.
