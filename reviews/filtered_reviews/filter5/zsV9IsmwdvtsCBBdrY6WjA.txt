So I went here for the first time yesterday despite having lived in the area for almost a year. My advice? Go. Go there right now. My life has been changed by this place, that's how good it was. No bells and whistles, easy, simple menu, and kind helpful staff. The food was delicious. Plus it's also super affordable (I got a combo meal for under ten bucks). I don't know what I was expecting, but I definitely wasn't expecting it to be that good. If recommend the #7 with white rice and refried beans. So. Good.
