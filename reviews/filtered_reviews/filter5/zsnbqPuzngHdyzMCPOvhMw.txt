The fiedo soup is great. The side of warm refried beans with our chips and salsa was a welcome surprise. Our server was amazing with great service during the entire dinner. The food was amazing and we'll definitely be back. Couldn't believe how many people continued to visit our table for;  refills,  chips,  extra napkins,  tortillas,  cleaning,  etc...  A well oiled machine.
