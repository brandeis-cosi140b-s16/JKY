Three Amigos successfully combines the best of Mexican dishes for American customers and "down home cooking" for the Mexican patrons in one cozy setting.  The place is quite unpretentious-the focus is on the  food and quality service.

I've been several times and enjoyed the carne asada tacos immensely.  They serve them on flour tortillas with onion and cilantro. The chimichanga is quite decadent: a fried burrito with melted cheese.  Unlike alot of Mexican restaurants, the menu is not complicated with lunch combinations of more of the same.  You can skim the menu in 2 minutes flat and get an idea of what's good.  And yummy dinner entrees for less than $10 are worth yelping about.

Helpful hint-They bring bland gringo salsa with chips.  Upon request, you can try three more spicier salsas.  The spicy avocado rocks, albeit in small doses!  Its all made IN HOUSE!  I think that when I establish rapport with the staff after several visits, they would be willing to make some avocado sauce with a little less kick.  

The word "flavor" sticks out in my mind when I think about Three Amigos.  Don't believe me, try it yourself.
