Great chicken burrito. Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.
   These things stand out here:
1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)
2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito
3. Homemade Horchata
4. Free Homemade Chips with your order

This guy knows how to roll one too. The ingredients were all super fresh and the burrito was one of the better ones I have come across. It's in a strip mall and it just says Taqueria on the outside, but this is my new go-to fast Mexican place. It will blow away any chain and my total bill was $8.18 for the burro and drink. Thanks to previous Yelpers for uncovering this local gem.
