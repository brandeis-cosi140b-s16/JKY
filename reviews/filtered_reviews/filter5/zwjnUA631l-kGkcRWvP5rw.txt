Holy crap!! What a gem! Dick's is amazing food with an amazing ambiance. I rolled in for brunch on my own when I was in town on business and I am so glad I did! I ordered the Carne Adovada eggs Benedict bc if the reviews and it was phenomenal. The bloody marys are amazing and so Spicy that they give you a tiny beer on the side to cool your mouth off. The mimosas were $5 and huge in a Nice big wine glass. I made friends at the bar, and it was a blast being there. The staff is friendly and trust me, you will want to go back and try more. It's My first day in town and i'm already thinking about how I can get back there for dinner To try something else!
