Fat Boy is my favorite place to get a burger on this side of town. Every visit I've ever made here has been met with great customer service. It's not made until you order it and everything here is made fresh, that's another thing I really appreciate. If it's your first time here, I'd definitely recommend the pastrami boyger or a Hawaiian boyger paired with their signature chencho fries. The pastrami burger is a burger topped with pastrami and it's always oozing with a white cheese. The Hawaiian includes all the typical burger ingredients with pineapple and barbecue sauce, it's exploding with a medley of flavors. The chencho fries can be ordered with fat or skinny cut fries and they're topped with cheese, green pepper, and little pieces of chicken; they're amazing but you have to eat them before they get soggy. The Philly cheesesteaks, pastrami sandwiches, and chicken fingers are also delicious. I've never ordered anything here that didn't make me proud.
