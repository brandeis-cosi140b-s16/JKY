Javier's is located on the casino floor at the Aria Hotel and Casino lobby level, just steps away from Alibi Bar and the hotel's tower room elevators! From the moment we got there, and before even entering Javier's, just standing there my initial thought was "Now this is one hip, trendy, happening place!"  Its' locale is perfect in the heart of the Aria! The ambiance is beautiful! The restaurant is warm, welcoming and inviting! This is a great place for fine Mexican food, or just hanging out with friends while having cocktails! The restaurant can get a bit loud, but then again it is Vegas, and situated on the casino floor! It is the perfect place for mingling, or even meeting new friends!

The dress attire is casual, however, this is Vegas! Most of the guys were wearing coats or dressed very trendy or stylish, just like Javier's! And the women? Dressed to impress and looking good all around!

We did not get a chance to dine here, since we had dinner earlier in the evening elsewhere, however, we were there for after dinner cocktails and just hanging out with, and meeting new friends in the process! Always a good thing! One thing led to another and a "few cocktails" led to a lot of cocktails! Teehee.... It's a good thing our room elevators are only skips away at the tower elevators! Hehe ;)

The next time I am at the Aria, I will surely look forward to dining here, as I have heard nothing but really good reviews as well as by word of mouth! I am already looking forward to my next Las Vegas trip and looking forward to returning to Javier's! Updated review on my dining experience forthcoming on my next visit! :)

There are ample parking in the Aria hotel parking lot, either by valet or self-park. Next time you are staying or passing through The Aria, be sure to check out Javier's!
