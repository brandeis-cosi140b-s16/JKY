One of the best bean and cheese chimichanga's out there, and by far the best one for the price.  I would eat here more often if I enjoyed feeling super bloated after a single meal from this place.

Small parking lot, minimal seating, but the drive thru has always been quick and convenient for me.  Definitely recommend this over the bland boringness of Filiberto's.
