I'm almost hesitant to write a review because I'm afraid of this place being "discovered" and getting so crowded I won't be able to get in.  I've been driving by for months and have been curious but something about the little strip mall was a turn off.  However, one night last week I was on my way home around 9:00 PM and saw it was still open so I figured I'd get some take-out.  OMG!!  The food is ridiculously good!!  I couldn't stop eating it and I can't stop thinking about it!!  I can't really speak about how it is to hang out there because I've only had one chance to go back, and again it was for take out.  That said, the food is AMAZING!!  It's hard to find tacos this good.  I can't wait to go back and try everything!!  So far the street tacos are my favorite.  The gourmet tacos are good too, I just can't really tell a difference except in size and the amount of meat they use (more for the gourmet, obviously...and they don't offer the shrimp taco in a street size).  I want to try all the salsas but I'm having a hard time breaking away from the unbelievably tasty habenero salsa.   I love this place and am telling everyone I know.  It's hard to find tacos this good!  I can't wait to take my friends and family.  I am going to eat here as often as possible!  I hope Urban Taco stays open and does well because it is wonderful having such a great place in the neighborhood.
