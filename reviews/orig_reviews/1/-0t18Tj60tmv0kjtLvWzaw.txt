Food is okay but do not order from here unless you have at least half an hour to spare. Had to abandon one (of two) of my burrito bowls today after 15 minutes because my flight was loading. There were only two people in front of me, and one of those guys was about to have to abandon part of his order too. Now I get to look forward to a packet of stale peanuts for dinner.
