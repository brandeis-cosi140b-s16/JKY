Tried to come before but it was closed.for thanksgiving holidays... Should not.have bothered trying again

.  Tried 4 tacos, asada, lengua, cabeza and fish. All were lukewarm/ cold and or bland. So disappointing given the reviews expected a lot more. fish taco tasted like it had been fried hours before just hard and cold. Best part of the meal was the rice and salsas... Side onions were also good.despite being cold... If I looking for tacos there are way tastier options available
