Highly disappointed after insisting we had to go here. Chips were stale and sent back twice. No refill on ice tea. Order was improperly served to table. Taste was way below the standard we are used to there. Our server had a horrible attitude. Spoke to manager on the way out and his response was: what would you like me to so about it? I was floored. Very rude and probably will not return.
