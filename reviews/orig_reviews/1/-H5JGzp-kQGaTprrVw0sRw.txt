The only good thing here is the fresh tortillas. They are SO skimpy on the cheese (if you want enough cheese to actually TASTE, you have to pay extra!), the black beans were flavorless and not fully cooked, the rice is bland. The queso is lumpy. I'm vegetarian, so I have no opinion on the meats. I tried it three different times to give it a fair shot. First time I got black bean tacos, fail. Second time I got cheese enchiladas, fail. Third time I got a vegetarian salad, fail (and they put enough lettuce on top to feed an army of rabbits. I guess lettuce is WAY cheaper than cheese). I will go out of my way to drive the extra miles to a place that cooks the food properly and has some flavor. Won't be going here again.
