ok i heard that this place was awesome as the food and service so i took my girlfriend to eat there and  the place is nice and the service is amazing BUT the food was disgusting I expected something better as most of the people say that its an amazing place but the food is just horrible this restaurant serves  mexican food if the food they serve is mexican then tacobell is the place to eat if you dont know about mexican food then you should try another places so you can get a better idea of the real mexican food plus if you like to pay for the service and not for your food then you'll  be fine in my case ill pay dont matter the price as long as the food is delicious something that this place doesnt offer thats just my idea
