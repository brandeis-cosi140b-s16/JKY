Terrible service and terrible food. Our waitress said under 10 words to us none of which I could even hear. I ordered cheese enchiladas plate with no salsa and received cheese rolled in tortilla with no sauce what so ever on them not even red sauce. Rice wasn't cooked and neither were the beans. Yuck. Best part of dinner was my Pepsi & the chips and salsa. Huge waste of money.
