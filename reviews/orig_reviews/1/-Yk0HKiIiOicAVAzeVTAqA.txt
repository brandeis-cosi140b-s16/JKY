Worse Mexican food I have ever ate!  I come from Ohio and had better food than this place!  Had a chicken dish with no seasoning or veggies!  Dried chicken with a dollop of creamy white sauce does not make a good dish.  The manager even came by and stated he would not charge me for the extra sauce I requested to help give the dish some flavor!  Also who serves a margarita in a water glass???? Never again, a waste of money!
