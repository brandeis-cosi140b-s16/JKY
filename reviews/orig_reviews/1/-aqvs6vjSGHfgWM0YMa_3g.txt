After reading fantastic reviews we went searching for this place. Great greeting, bright, clean but I was a little sad because I am a picky eater n do not eat pork or organs. I was really looking forward to chicken but alas it was not to be. Please go but be aware that if u r picky or with someone picky, might want to go elsewhere. Sorry all.
