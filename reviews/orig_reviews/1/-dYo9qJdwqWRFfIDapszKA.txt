Walk in and the place smells like a group of people urinated on the carpet a long time ago.  
Next, the food was overpriced - to say the least.  
Here is our example:  I had a tortilla, with egg, beans, cheese.  The price: $13+tax+tip.  We would have walked out immediately if not for the restaurant.com coupon.  When we saw our bill we were shocked:  the tiny cup of green salsa that normally comes with a burrito: $3.  A tiny bit of guacamole inside the burrito:  $4.  
Even with a $15 discount we wound up spending $12 each for the crappiest (cheap tasting ingredients, awful general taste) lunch I have had in a long time - in budget friendly Phoenix  The only other diners looked as if they were old enough to have lost their taste buds, but I doubt they will be back either from the look on their faces.  There must be drug money flowing to keep this place afloat.  
We were treated so shamelessly that even if I rarely spend time to write a poor review I took the time to write this one.  You will find that positive reviews here are from a previous ownership.  This really deserves 0 stars but the minimum is 1.
