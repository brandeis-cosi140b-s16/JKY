If you are looking for tasteless Mexican this is your place.  Besides no flavor, the dishes don't come with any garnishes such as sour cream or guacamole. I had a chicken tostada except there was barely any chicken and was about five inches in diameter. My husband had a Chile Relleno and Two Tostittos plus a coke. No rice or beans and our bill was $28!
