Hi Yelpers, this is my first review, and to be honest the first time I have been absolutely compelled to write a review. I only wish I had pictures to illustrate my point.

My story goes: I spent all night driving to Vegas with a jonesing for some tacos and I stumbled upon this spot. The ambiance, menu and staff were great (4.5 out of 5). Now the food was... horrible. The chips were stale (I dunno how that even happens?), and the tacos were uneatable. No flavor whatsoever, and the ingredients seemed a day old. The final straw was when I opened my al pastor taco and saw a single piece of cilantro! Just one piece! These cooks bestowed no pride or effort into making these tacos, I would have been better served at TacoBell (and I hate saying it). My only mistake was taking my food to go, or else I would have demanded my money back! I wish this restaurant well, and maybe they can turn it around but until then, stay away, far far away from this place. 

In a nutshell: The taco's are equivalent to cafeteria food, but the ambiance is great, and unless thats your thing don't waste your money.
