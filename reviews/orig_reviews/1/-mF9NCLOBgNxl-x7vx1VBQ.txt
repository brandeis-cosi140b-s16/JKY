El Torito used to be good, I have been going there since I was a kid.  Lately, past few years, it has been getting worse and worse. Meals come out cold half the time, portions are smaller (specifically the rice and beans which are not half of what they use to be) and the service is not that good.  Servers are friendly but they rarely remember to bring your soup or anything else you ask for (every time we go there not just once or twice) and are slow as hell.  My mother in laws enchiladas kick El Torito's enchiladas asses.  Food is just not that great, not authentic as some here claim and is continually getting worse.  Hopefully they can eventually change this and right the ship, as I use to love El Torito.
