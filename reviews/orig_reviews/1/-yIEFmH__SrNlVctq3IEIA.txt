Wow!  A swing and a miss.  I read all the reviews and was very excited to try. Very dissappointing.  Not really anything like New Mexican food.  I think a quick trip to Santa Fe might show the owner what type of food he is really peddling.  Being from New Mexico,  I am still in search of something close.  

The Red Chile is about the best thing on the menu, the Green Chile is subpar, not very much actual chile in the green chile.  Machaca taco, carne asada, (not New Mexican cuisine).  Burro? In NM, it is called a burrito (should have been a red flag to not waste my money).
