If I could give this place 0 stars I would- this was absolutely terrible. I ordered the two combination plate with both chili rellenos... I found fish in my food... I ordered food with no meat in it for a reason. That was the first error. My friend ordered a shredded beef burrito and half of the beef was raw. Absolutely terrible....
