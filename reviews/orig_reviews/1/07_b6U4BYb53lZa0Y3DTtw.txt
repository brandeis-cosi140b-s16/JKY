This place is a total rip off. They have their employees out front saying free entry with purchase of 1 drink, but the catch is they charge you 30 dollars at the door for that drink. Ridiculous. I know drinks are pricey in Vegas but 30 bucks that's crazy! I bought 3 drinks at Hakkasan for that price. I definitely don't suggest going there unless you like being hustled.
