I have been going to Mattas for 15 years. Tonight my family came in and it wasn't busy but it took 20mins for the girls to clean off a table for us. After sitting down we got chips and that was it. No one brought us water or anything. We waited 10mins and started looking around and saw servers sitting and taking a break instead of helping us. I know that this place is not known for fast food, but completely ignoring us is crazy. I have 2 young children with me and it is not easy waiting for service when it is fast. We decided to leave and told the girls at the front that we never were helped out. They gave me a dirty look and didn't even say a word....not a sorry or let's make it better. I am very disappointed because Mattas has been a part of my family for a long time. I will not go back.
