We were in Vegas this weekend and as we waited for our flight home to SD...we browsed through the food options in concourse B and found 360 Burrito. We actually didn't eat here. We checked out the menu through the window and it seemed great. Different, fresh, healthy! However while observing the kitchen and employees, we saw how unorganized and unsanitary it was!!!! It was horrible! In the 5 minutes we stood there...the female cook (with tattoo on neck and red glasses) although did have gloves on, kept touching her face to straighten up her glasses. Then continued to wrap burritos. Then she went to the corner (next to door that leads to storage room, it seemed) and munched on some food. Then went straight back into the kitchen, while still chewing and grabbed some tortillas to put on the grill!!!! Disgusting!!! All of this in front of tons of customers! Makes we wonder if Vegas has any health inspectors! Or if this place even has a manager!!! I only gave this restaurant 1 star for the concept! Great idea, that's all!
