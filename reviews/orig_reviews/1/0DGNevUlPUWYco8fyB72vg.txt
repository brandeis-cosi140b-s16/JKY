I went here during Cinco De Mayo with two of my friends. I read a review on CBS Pittsburgh saying it was one of the best places to go for the holiday. Their website and even when you walked into the door said that they had specials. We get seated and the waitress tells us that they don't have any normal specials because it's Cinco De Mayo... WHAT? It was posted on a stand downstairs as soon as I walked in. Her response "oh. We meant to take that down." It was still there as we walked out... Overpriced tacos. Seriously. Three tacos for $12 that aren't anything special? Ridiculous. And we got margaritas and they weren't even frozen. I'm never going here again and I'm highly disappointed.
