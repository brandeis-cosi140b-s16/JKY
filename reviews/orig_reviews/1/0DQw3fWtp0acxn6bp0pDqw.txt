We had a very bad experience here last Saturday.  Our server took 15 mins to greet and take our drink orders.   We decided that we did not want to wait another 15 for shots so we went up to the bar.  Our bartender was also very rude and unwelcoming.  We took the drinks back to our table and was lectured by our waitress for not ordering through her.  I've waited tables for a couple of years and I would never argue with guests.  She made us feel very uncomfortable after the confrontation.   I will never come back here and would never recommend this place.  The food is below average and overpriced, but yeah, these types of businesses are dime a dozen in Las Vegas.  Avoid this place if you can help it.  You work hard for your money, don't hand it over to a business that does not deserve it.
