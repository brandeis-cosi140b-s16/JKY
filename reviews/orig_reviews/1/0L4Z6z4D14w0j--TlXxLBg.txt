Wow! Where to even start. First I'm not a picky eater so I ate. Salsa was old and the cilantro that was in it was almost black. I got shrimp tacos: tortilla are cheap I had to make my own taco, and it came with lettuce! Really? Where's the cabbage like it suppose to come with. And no limes on the side. After I was done with my toco I had a random bowl of cilantro brought in. If I could give this place a zero I would. Totally white people ingredients and style of cooking Mexican. First and last time I come here.
