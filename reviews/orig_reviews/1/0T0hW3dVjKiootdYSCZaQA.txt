Dont Waste your time!!

I wish I could tell you that the food was either good or bad...unfortunately, we did not even get to taste our food, as they were somehow unable to successfully deliver it. When we called back 90 minutes after our initial order, the food had not even been made yet, as they were having "problems with their driver". Again, don't waste your time...they certainly wasted ours!
If you aren't able to competently deliver food, then perhaps you should consider removing delivery as an option. Honestly, this is a first...and will be the last for this place!
