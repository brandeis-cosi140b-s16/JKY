I was walking on the strip with my family and needed a bite to eat. We were kind of in the mood for some authentic Mexican food so we went to Cobo Wabo. When we sat down our orders taken right away so the services pretty good. Me and my wife both ordered the Carne Asada. When it came to the table it looked like dog food. We thought it was just something they marinated it in. So we gave it a try but it was terrible it taste like dog food to. The management was nice but the food was terrible. And it wasn't just the state that was bad the chicken tenders for my kids were bad and my mother-in-law ordered pork. And it was disgusting. If you're looking for authentic dog food this is the place if you're looking for authentic Mexican food Look elsewhere. Don't eat here unless it's an emergency.
