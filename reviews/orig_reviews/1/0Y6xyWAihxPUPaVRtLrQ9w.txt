I had a very poor experience last Sunday with a waiter. She was no where to be found 90% of the time. I was sitting at the table with about 8 other people and I stuck my card in there as we were all going to split up the tab. Heck I even whipped out my pen figuring I would make it easier on the poor girl and circled what items where mine as well as putting the last 4 digits of my card next to these items. We were all mid splitting up the card, got interrupted, turned around and what do you know someone snatched up the bill and put it ALL on my card. ALL 8 people's orders food drink ALL of it on my card. Some of the items I was charged for we didn't even receive as we had been "forgotten". So I ended up having to go through the hassle amongst 8 people's orders and my debit card and cash when this all could have been avoided if she hadn't so hastily ran to swipe my card out without even reading any notations I had made on the receipt or even simply asking if we were finished. It was all so quick and all so inconvenient. I had been to the Tempe location and I really enjoyed myself and the food. I really want to like this place but it just turned me off entirely to El Hefe.
