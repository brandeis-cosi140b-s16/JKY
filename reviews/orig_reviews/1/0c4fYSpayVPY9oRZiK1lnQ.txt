Vida is total garbage, and the price on this Yelp page is wrong. It's easily a $$$ restaurant.

Vida is the kid who's trying desperately to be cool but isn't wiling to put forward even the most basic of efforts. The biggest issue I have with Vida is the pricing, which to me is absolutely arrogant considering the quality of the food. 

The cheapest way to eat at Vida is to get a $10 lunch special This will get you two of their super-thin quesadillas or 2 tacos, with a side of bland black beans and even blander rice. If you're not at lunch tough: their cheapest burrito that can't even hold a candle to Chipotle is $12 minimum. Anything else and you're looking at $15 +. Their excuse for a margarita is maybe a single shot of bottom shelf tequila in a tiny little 10 oz plastic cup. Their queso is good, but when the kitchen doesn't even bother microwaving it for you beforehand what's the point? Oh, and it's $7.

Whenever I've eaten at Vida I realize that the food tastes about as good as a place where I'd say "I want combination A3" instead of the pretentious titles the menu seems to use in order to suggest nonexistent quality. The only difference is I'm paying an extra 40% for their premium spot in the epicenter.

If you're on the fence about Vida, do one thing for me. Before walking in, go past the sign on the walkway towards the train and take a look at the kitchen entrance. Notice how it's regularly black from kitchen grease. Take a deep breath to inhale the stale, rotten smell and examine the trash they hide behind the sign. It's disgusting.

Vida is a fourth-rate hole in the wall that blew too much money on a graphic designer and gives exactly nothing about the quality of their food. There are easily half a dozen places inside the epicenter that are an order of magnitude better. Don't waste your time.
