I love mexican food. Be it upscale, street food, or even tex mex. This place was not good...even if given the choice to be in any category.

The beans and rice were pretty bland, nothing special. I ordered carnitas and it was pretty terrible. It was not recognizable as meat, just dry greasy bits. It was clear that it was cooked, then reheated on a flat top with a ton of oil. Not to mention the fact that they did not trim the meat very well before cooking because there was a lot of gristle. The only good part was the tortilla.
