Went here with low expectations and it didn't let me down . Bartender was odd to put it nice . If I had a staff member that said is food good or bad I would let then know it isn't cool to put negative thoughts in customers heads . Also shouting out soy sauce is secret ingredient was super lame because that's all I tasted after it was said . Place has potential but needs to get back to basics of customer service.
