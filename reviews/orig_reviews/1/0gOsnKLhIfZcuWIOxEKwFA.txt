I saw the Yelp review but came here anyway with coworkers as they wanted to. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas (as was mentioned on yelp). I asked the waiter if it had corn or flour tortillas, was told that it was corn, however it was flour when I received the dish. The possibly worst spanish rice I have ever had, it wasn't seasoned at all and tasted more like it just had butter in it. My coworkers black beans were not cooked all the way through and she said they were crunchy, although mine were fine. The "red" sauce on the enchiladas tasted canned. They did not have fresh brewed iced tea and only served Pepsi products, I am a Coke fan myself. I opted for water. Chips do not come automatically to the table, if you would like to order them as an "appetizer" I think it was $4.  And absolutely no heat to the dish at all.

We had a coupon otherwise I would have been highly upset as it cost $13 for the lunch dish.  However, with a choice I would not go back here even with a coupon. 

On a positive note although I did not look at the drink list, I have heard that they have a lengthy drink list, which will hopefully work to their benefit as in my opinion the food will not.
