We were calling up to get information about the brunch buffet costs, we were told that a child is half off.  When we said a 1 year old costs 17 bucks to eat? the worker Nikki laughed under her breathe and said yes.  What poor customer service, and what business charges a one year old 17 bucks for a brunch buffet? I've never heard of that.
