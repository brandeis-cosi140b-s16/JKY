Worst!!!! Barf!!!! Nasty!!!! Wish I had gone to Taco Bell it would have been better and cost less. Zero stars. Frozen Margarita was just slushie lime water, 711 has better slushies for the money. Never again. I paid the bill because it is illegal to dine and ditch. I also tipped the waiter, as he was nice and it wasn't his fault the food was less than sub par.
