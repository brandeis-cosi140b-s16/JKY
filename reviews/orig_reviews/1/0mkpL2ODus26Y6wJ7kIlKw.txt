This is the second time I've been to this place and both times have been HORRIBLE! The service is literally THE WORST! We went here for the first time on my birthday in December, sat on the patio, the place was barely half full so we were thinking it would be a quick in and out, WRONG! Not only did it take 25 minutes to get our drink orders but it took almost an hour to get our meals which were just street tacos and chicken enchiladas that were pretty measly. They completely messed up my order and brought me something completely different the waiter told me he "grabbed the wrong plate and would be right out with the right one" umm...ya 15 minutes later after everyone else was finished and it was my damn birthday! hahaha. We also had to find our own silverware because we were not brought any and the waiter was no where to be found. Thank god we had a gift card to this place, it was hard to even tip at that point.

Our second experience here was over the weekend when my family was in town, decided to try it again since we wanted some mexican and were spending the day in downtown Tempe.  The place was empty so again...we figured it would be a quick in and out, HORRIBLE again!! Took even longer for drinks, took forever to get a couple ice waters, and took even longer to get the food again! When we asked for silverware our waiter brought over 3 sets and there were 5 of us sitting there...what the? This place sucks...for lack of a better word. We will never return.
