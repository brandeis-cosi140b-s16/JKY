Apparently my review was erased. I thought the purpose of yelp was to give honest reviews about the restaurants. That's why I went through the trouble of creating an account because the service changed so much I wanted to let management know. So let's try this again below is my review and also a test to see if yelp is actually reliable. 


Wow!! We first went there about 3 months ago the food was alright decent for being Mexican food but we loved the customer service great waiter and service manager was friendly, great at checking up on us and making us feel welcomed. However we just went back last week in the morning and the service manager was a different person and she was a nightmare didn't greet us, didn't help, you could tell they were busy and she walked around looking but didn't bother to help. If I can remember clearly her name was meleny? The waiters all seem like they were new, very scattered brained. And the worse part you could hear screaming from the kitchen. Someone obviously stressed out by the rush. Not very professional at all. Just a tip for the owners get your old team back together, that was true customer service. At least that's why we went back, not sure if we will be going back with the change. Better training too, you can tell who the new people are, that's never a good thing especially if they can't keep the standards from before. Management needs improvement.
