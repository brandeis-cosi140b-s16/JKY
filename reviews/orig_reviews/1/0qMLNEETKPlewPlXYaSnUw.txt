I must have gone on a bad day, because this is possibly the worst mexican food I've had. Honestly, tasted like Taco Bell on a poor day. I ordered a California burrito, for almost $10. The tortilla was stale, and the flavor was just not there. Being from California, I'm offended that they call this a California burrito!
Other than that, the salsa was not fresh at all, and I'm guessing it came straight out of a can. Not even a jar-- a can.
Overpriced, stale fast-food. How has this place been there so long?! I felt robbed after seeing the bill.
