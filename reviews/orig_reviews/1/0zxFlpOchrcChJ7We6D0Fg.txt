I was a weekly customer until today. The waitress made a simple mistake today by confusing the order, no big deal right? Wrong, she went on to take an accusatory tone with two insulting remarks and then told us next time she would charge us for the wrong order. She should have just owned the mistake and made it right rather than insult our family breakfast. I won't be back, way out of line.
