Lets first start off with , we eat mexican food 4 times a week , and the name of this place has nothing to do with mexican , should have guessed .
This place is cute, severs are good, chips are good, hot sauce is good, but not chucky..
All that said the food looked good delivered , we all bite in and wow,no taste, blaned , , the cheese enchiladas was so bad couldnt eat them , cheese was melted , but the homemade wrappers under coked, black bean tasted like they opened a can of black beans and poured on the plate, not drained, no spicy, my husband refired beans the same way . We all three couldnt eat our meals , such a disappointment .
I guess thats why happy Hour is from 11am-7pm

My feelings are never go in unless your thirsty , not hungery. .
So giving it a 1star is pushing it , and thats chips
