The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the ground beef burrito and the tortilla was extremely dry, as if they had 5 week old flour tortillas in the back waiting to be served to me. I also ordered a Dos Equis and it wasn't cold. Warm beer and dry burritos isn't something that my stomach agrees with. Not to mention, they didn't inform us that the bar was closing, so we couldn't order more drinks. I was not satisfied with the quality of the food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
