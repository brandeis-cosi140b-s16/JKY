First round of chips came by and they were stale asked the waitress for fresh chips she came back with two other baskets and they were worse. She said they fry them up every shift and in my mind it might have been last weeks shift. As an appetizer I ordered the queso and I should have gone to food lion for that one. It was a busy place and I wish everyone complained but my guess is people like stale chips or they just don't care.
