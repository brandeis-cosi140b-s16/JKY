PEOPLE BEWARE!!!
Do not be fooled by these reviews! This place is a joke at best. I am from this area and would have to say that this particular establishment is hands down the worst experience you will EVER encounter!!! Honestly I have no earthly idea where or how these wonderful reviews come about! I've been to EVERY Mexican restaurant in the Queen City and without doubt this is the bottom of the barrel! The wait staff act as if their last job was at the DMV!! Horrible service, less than friendly would be putting it mildly!!! Totally reminded me of a Mexican soup nazi attitude!!! Do yourself a favor and mark this one off the list!!! Azteca, taco veloz and carnita's is the way to go!!
