Showed up at 7:45 and was told by the hostess it would be an hour-hour and 1/2 wait...waited an HOUR and 45 minutes!!!  Countless people kept walking in and being seated before us, since they had larger parties.  We were a party of 2, so apparently we weren't important.  There came a point in our ridiculous wait where we almost left and went to Filibertos...we would have been better off.  The food was mediocre, at best.  Just a bunch of stuff smothered in cheese.  Do NOT waste your time.  It was horrible.  The hostess was more concerned with keeping the fire going than seating the patrons.  She even told us she would "get in trouble" if the fire went out.  SERIOUSLY????
