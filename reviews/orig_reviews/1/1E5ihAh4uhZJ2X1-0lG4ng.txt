I just ate there last night. It was highway robbery! They only offer apps and tacos which are extremely over priced! The lamb taco is $9 and it had no flavor. Worst of all the margaritas were the same price and no bigger than a small orange juice at eat 'n park! It was the most expensive dinner I have eaten with no flavor or adventure. I will never go there again and do not recommend it even for the drinks. The atmosphere could be cool if there was more room but there isn't. Worst experience ever!
