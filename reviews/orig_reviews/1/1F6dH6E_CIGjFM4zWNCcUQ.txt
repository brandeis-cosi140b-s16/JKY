Read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  Could not have been much more disappointed.  Mole Poblano Enchiladas were in factory tortillas, chicken was flavorless and the Mole sauce was from a jar an way too sweet.  Chile Rellano was the same.  Rice had been reheated enough it was a lump and Frijoles were heated right out of the can.  Service was good but the tables were dirty.  All in all plastic strip mall food
