GOT VOUCHER ? too bad , you lose
 
We attempted to visited this place numerous time. Each time we were told the "event menu"  was the only menu available because of an event that day. Even though the event was 8-10 hours in the future, they still used the event menu. Went there on a day with NO events at Westgate..... still using the event menu. This menu consists of "food court" type snacks.
 
It took numerous calls to get the truth : they no longer have a full menu !!!   But they continue to sell dinner deal vouchers on sites like KGB Deals. When the General Manger (Bill Walsh) was confronted, he became verbally abusive and refused to honor the coupons for ANYTHING..... 
 
You have choices when going to Westgate...save yourself the grief.... Maragritaville is right next door !
