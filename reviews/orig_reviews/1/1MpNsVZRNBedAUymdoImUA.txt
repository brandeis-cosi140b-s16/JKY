I'm not one to write unfavorable reviews about any business but in this particular scenario it screams for it.  The last time I went to Chipotle I was more satisfied. The guacamole was very good but other than that, I can not find much that was actually good with my meal. Too small of taco's and too over priced considering how little of actual food there was. You will get the tacos then question, Is that it? You will not miss much by missing this, I know I will definitely not be back any time soon.
