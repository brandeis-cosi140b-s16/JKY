We have been coming here for the last year. We really liked the food. One of a few restaurants that serve salsa with a kick and three flavors. The food has steadily gone down hill. We were there last night and it was really bad. I ordered the Carne Asada  and a cheese enchilada on the side. The carne asada was so over cooked, one side had charcoal on it. That side was served face down to hide the cook's incompetence.
Beef jerky would have been better. The enchilada was cold, The cheese inside was solid as a rock, almost as if at one time it was melted and cooled. I could barley cut it with my fork. The beans are can beans and pretty much flavorless, they don't offer refried beans. My wife ordered the enchiladas with an egg on top. The egg was solid as a rock, It must have been left under the heat lamps or the incompetent cook left it on the grill with my Asada. Enchiladas had very little sauce and was dried out. These meals were so unacceptable. The manager came over and apologized and gave a "free" desert. I really just want them to serve good food. As my buddy The Big "T" says "I won't be Bock, Hasta La Vista La Ristra"
