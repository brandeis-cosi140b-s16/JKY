The worst gringo'd out Mexican joint. The rice & beans were probably their best thing on the menu... usually I would turn back the food I didn't like for something else but gave up after eating a bite from the rest of my friends dishes. Also smelled like rotting fish + bleach? How they manage to pay their rent is what really boggles my mind. 

Their only saving grace is the quality of customer service. Poor things can't be held liable for this venue's overrated kitchen staff based on the original Lindo Michoacan.
