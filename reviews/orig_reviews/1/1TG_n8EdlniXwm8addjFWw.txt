Bar review only.

Stopped in for their $0.99 margaritas. The expectation wasn't high because it's $0.99, but it was still pretty bad. The husband got a beer, which for HH, came in a small glass and tasted light watered down coors light (it was supposed to be a Mexican beer). Granted, the beer was only $2, but we'd rather pay $1-$2 more for a better beer at other HH spots.

The bar itself looked a bit grimy which deterred us from ordering any food. In addition, the food that we had seen at other tables wasn't appealing.

Well, I satisfied my $0.99 margarita curiosity!
