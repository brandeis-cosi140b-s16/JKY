So I show up. I sit at the bar. 7 or 8 people are at the bar. I watch the bar tender and even the manager or possibly the Ownet behind the bar. I sit...and sit...and sit...sort of like last time when I sat for  10 minutes  never being recognized...I look at myself to make sure I'm not made of glass...except this time that good bar tender who rescued this place last time wasn't here to do the same...and I sit...8 minutes goes by and I'm not even acknowledged by the bar tender or manager...I leave. You lost my business forever...you need to perform at least the basics folks!!! Acknowledge a freaking customer!!! Immediately...you're failing at training your employees!!!
