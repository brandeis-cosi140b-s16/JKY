It started out great. I loved the decor and came here due to a recommendation. Unfortunately it took a turn for the worst and we will never come back.  The server was awful.  My educated guess was that he had been drinking.  I smelled alcohol on his breath.  The restaurant was not busy and this server only had us and one other table.  We had small dishes piling up and we stacked them at the end of the table and had to ask him to take them away.  He seemed to be annoyed that we asked.  I saw server go outside and make out with his girlfriend in the parking lot.  Unprofessional.
