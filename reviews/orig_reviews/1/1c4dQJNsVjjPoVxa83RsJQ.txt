I'm dissapointed by this place for several reasons. First I was looking for a lunch place after just arriving at my hotel and the hostesses totally ignored me and continued to talk with each other, even after I went inside to look at the bar and then came back up to them. Needless to say I left.

 I went there again later that day but not by choice. It was my cousin's wedding reception and they had reserved it there, including open bar. We were about 20 minutes early and they wouldn't let us in even 5 minutes before 8, even though we had already paid for everything and were just looking for a place to sit down. So they made us wait until the very last minute. 

Lastly, while the appetizers and drinks were ok, the main course unfortunately not. Several guests didn't even eat theirs and I only ate mine because I was so hungry. It was paella and it was way too greasy without any flavor.

So combination of bad service and food did them no favors.
