Been here many times and it's always great, but not this past visit (today, 20 minutes ago).  We sat down at the bar and we're promptly told we couldn't sit there because the bartender needed time to 'catch up'.  WTF does that mean?  The manager was there watching the baryender, not helping of course, so we asked her again and she said no seating there yet. That is the strangest thing I've seen at A BAR - no sitting at the bar when there are seats available. The manager on duty should be retrained, at the least, or reassigned to be a bartender so she learns how to help when needed.
