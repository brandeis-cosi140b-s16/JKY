I'm only giving it 1 star because I have to. Queso is runny, chips taste like they are from yesterday, salsa is too spicy. After waiting for our tacos for an hour we asked the server to cancel the order so we could go elsewhere. So disappointing. I was looking forward to this. Cool atmosphere though. Too bad I'll never come back.
