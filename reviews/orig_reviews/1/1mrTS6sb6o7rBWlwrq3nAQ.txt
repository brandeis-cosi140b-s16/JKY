Went on CINCO DE MAYO, the world's most popular day to EAT, DRINK, and ENJOY anything (wink wink) thats spicy or from south of the border.  Ok- so we never tried Los Dos before and kept hearing amazing things about this place.  We were so excited to hear about its new location in Awhatukee since we live in the area.  We walk in around 3pm...
Ambiance: It was dark, put our name in the hat and there was a hour wait. ok fine, we drank on the patio patiently while listening to the speakers outside play COUNTRY MUSIC (at a mexican joint???)
Service:  Bar was out of corona??? (on cinco de drink-o???) yet, about an hour later we saw them being served to customers inside.  
Salsa- ok, so the salsa was bomb. and super HOT!! caliente! I felt in the next day after my morning coffee.  i'd go back for the damn salsa.
Service ONCE seated... we got sat down and were handed paper menus that were all wrinkled from having water soaked in them a few times then dried out.  We sat down and 2 seconds later our server asked what we wanted to order.  We said we were still deciding and he asked "DECIDING WHAT? LIKE WHAT TO ORDER OR IF YOUR GONNA ORDER?" basically- attitude.
We left our table and walked out the restaurant.  LOS DOS is phoenix i hear is amazing though?
