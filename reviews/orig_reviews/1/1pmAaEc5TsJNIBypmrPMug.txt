I feel horrible for giving them a bad review. But I need to warn people. I've been extremely sick the day after eating here. Two times now. I shouldn't have given them another chance last night. The horrible service, and mediocre food that is way too spicy to even be edible, is just not worth being sick the whole next day. I'm sorry. Gave this place multiple chances but I will never be going back.
