If I could give zero stars I would. I've been to the one in Henderson and this place looks like the ugly stepchild that no one likes. I come in and automatically get stared down by two lazy women sitting on the tall chairs gossiping like always. Then I proceeded to go order the people there take forever for 2 tacos and while waiting it got cold. I go to ask for guacamole and chips and the idiot making my boyfriends fries was busy talking to some guy and not once did she stop talking to him. Absolutely unacceptable. This ghetto place puts the one in green valley to shame everything from the decor to the customer service and food. Never will I give me money to this place again worst $33 dollars spent and I'm in this place as I type that's how bad the service is I had to write it instantly. Terrible
