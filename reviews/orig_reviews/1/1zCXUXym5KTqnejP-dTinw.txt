Where can I start...

Margaritas served in a standard water cup.  Hello !!!  
And you guys are FAMOUS  for your Margaritas.. ?????? 

Ice cold Guacamole like it was pre-made and sitting in the freezer to keep it from turning brown.   It was also flat.  Most high end restaurants make this fresh at the size of your table, and ask you the level of peppers to add and will mix it to taste.  Why not here ?

As if we did not have enough corn chips  ( they come with the meal )   they severed a steak on an enormous bed of YES  more YES  MORE CORN CHIPS !!!     Geeez  Enough is enough  !!!! 

Waitress did NOT know the menu.
I ask what the Fish is served with and she says it is a SOUP and is not served with any sides. and then she recommends
the Scallop and Shimp dish instead....  OK  . so I order this and GUESS WHAT....  it is a  SOUP !!!
