Nothing ticks me off more than having to spend a lot of money on food that doesn't taste good. The patio atmosphere was nice, and our waitress was attentive, but the prices were very high and the food was bland at best. Even the salsa was lacking. If you are looking for good Mexican food, don't look here.
