Love their food, but their service did not impress me. My husband and I went to the new San Tan location and we waited in line for 45 minutes before ordering, and the line was not that long to begin with. There was not sense of urgency with the employees. Once I finally ordered my tacos, they were sitting on the grill for a while before the next employee had to be told to get them off. He was more interested in talking with and goofing around with his co-workers than giving a very hungry customer her food, who had been already waiting in like for upwards to an hour. We LOVE their food, but this location's service is terrible. I would much rather prefer to drive the extra distance and go to the Gilbert and Baseline location. Even after the longer drive, we would STILL get our food before we would get it here!
