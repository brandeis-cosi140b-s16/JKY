I should have known better. I went anyhow, more for the landmark quality of the place and the quirky architecture than anything else. That is what the two stars represent. 

The food was horrid. What happened to the authentic Mexican that use to be served here? Everything was bland, obviously under a heat lamp too long, lacking salt, spice or taste. Apparently anything can go out to a table if 2 lbs of cheese is melted over the top of it. Burned beans, cheese crisp swimming in grease and
tacos with a hair baked into the shell. 

This place really needs to pull themselves together and make some changes - too many other options these days.
