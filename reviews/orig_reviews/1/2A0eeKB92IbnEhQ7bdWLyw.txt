I ordered the spinach enchiladas at about 5:15 on a Thursday evening.  I waited way too long for the food to come before finally flagging down my waiter to ask, "Is there a problem with my order?"  He answered, "No, it will be right out."  Sure enough, he brought it out a few minutes after I asked about it.  After taking a few bites, I noticed it was barely lukewarm and that there was no spinach in the enchiladas.  I flagged him down again to ask him if he brought me the spinach enchiladas, and it turned out he brought me the wrong ones.  He offered to have the cook prepare the correct ones, but  I didn't have time to wait, so I told him I'd eat what he brought.  It was bland and way overpriced.
