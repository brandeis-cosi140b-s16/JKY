Walked past this place while in Scottsdale, noticed tables outside were littered with garbage and people's left over food. An hour later, returned to try out luck at this place, noticed the tables outside still were not cleaned up. My girlfriend sat down at a booth that wasn't secured and hanged over the edge. She almost fell flat on the ground. It was just after that, she pointed out the giant cockroach that was making its rounds from the to table. We just got up and left without ordering. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
