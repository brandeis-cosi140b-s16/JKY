No parking!!!!  

Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.

OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time, gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes, after 20 minutes went by, another 15-20 minutes, etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!  

Wasn't greeted when we entered, not even a "Hi, can I help you?"

Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I don't have a big car!

The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.

Well, the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad, one appetizer, 1 sandwich, 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!

No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork that's for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.

The female waitress, again, seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food, plates were plopped down on the tables, she came to check on us twice, 2nd time, the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came. 

The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!! 

Service and the meals didn't match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!
