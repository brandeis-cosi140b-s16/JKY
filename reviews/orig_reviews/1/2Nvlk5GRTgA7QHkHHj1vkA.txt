I would really like to enjoy this place but sadly after many attempts~ I just can't.  I live one block from here.  We have eaten at La Casa Blanca several times and we always vow that we won't be back.  We decided to give it one more try with friends on Cinco De Mayo.  We arrived at 3pm and asked for a table outside to enjoy our drinks and food on such a beautiful day.  We were told we could not sit outside because they were going to decorate later............hmmmm?  I explained that we wouldn't be there long and we really wanted outdoor dining (the patio is quite nice).  So I asked if they would rather turn a table of 6 away rather than let us dine outside and the hostess response was......"I'm just following orders!"  So.............we left.  Most joints are quite happy to accommodate paying guests.  This time we will stick to our word, that we will, in fact, NOT be back!
