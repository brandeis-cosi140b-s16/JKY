One star because the food was actually good when we got it, unfortunately the service was so god awful I will never return. Were they busy? Absolutely. However I have never had such bad service. When we first sat down a couple different waitresses came up to our table, they couldn't figure out who was going to have our table. Once this was settled we got chips and guac which came pretty quickly however nobody came back to the table until we were good and done with the appetizer. We finally order dinner, 20-25 mins goes by and the waitress comes by to see if we needed anything else, she didn't even realize we hadn't gotten our food and was gone so quickly we couldn't tell her. 40-45 mins has gone by and she finally comes back to see if we were ready for the check to which we laughed and said we had yet to get our food. The waitress blames the kitchen takes our order again (taco salad and 2 tacos with rice and beans) and finally 10 mins later we get our food. But wait, the tacos are not anything close to what my friend had ordered. The waitress comped our dinners but still handed us a bill for the guac and one margarita. It seems nobody in that restaurant knows what they are doing, and I sadly will never go back. Don't waste your time with the God awful service.
