Well one thing, you really feel like you're in Mexico because they have no air conditioning! (8/14/14) Miserably eating experience when you're sweating while eating, and that is no joke. AC in Arizona in August is a must, come on! 

The AC was the first problem but we let it slide and thought bean burritos were a simple meal to prepare, wrong. Burritos were bad and still had unmelted cheese in them!? Wtf!?

I would recommend going in the winter months and for drinks, who could mess that up?
