I stopped going there a few years ago: Can you say "Cheese?" Way too much of it on everything. Maybe it's changed, but why spend the dough for food one can get elsewhere and better? (I just came back to this review because Yelp told me it was unfinished, whatever that means).

Because I'm intimidated by Yelp and women, I finish it with this: If you want a "lump 'o cheese," and at best mediocre Mexican food, go and enjoy yourself. It is definitely better than McDonald's.
