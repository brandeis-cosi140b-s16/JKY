Gosh yelp really fooled me on this one. I saw the reviews thought this place would be good and it was not close to good at all. I was so disappointed. We had the chicken and steak fajitas. The veggies underneath the protein was mushy and old. Felt like they had the veggies sitting there until someone decide to order the fajita. The steak was okay and chicken was bland. The sides for the fajita seriously came out of a can I do not think anything was fresh! We also ordered the firestarter Margarita and that was horrible as well, there was no liquor just juice and jalape√±os :( watered down. I should've walked out when I stepped into the old, run down decor. Our server was really sweet too bad the food fell short.
