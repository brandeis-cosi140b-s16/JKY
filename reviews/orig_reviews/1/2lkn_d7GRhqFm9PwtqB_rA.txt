I had last minute company for football game today, and before the game started we wanted Menudo. This place is the only place that sold it that I could find, I called and placed my order to go and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. We made tortillas and got everything else ready at home and I came all the way down to pick it up right before the game, and they told me they were no longer serving Menudo. Even after I said I had already ordered it, and they did not even bother to call me back. I did not have time to go anywhere else, and this ruined my day and my experience with this restaurant. Even if the food is not the best, having exceptional customer service and being honest with your customers is always number one in my eyes!
