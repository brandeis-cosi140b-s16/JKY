I've been going to this Cafe Rio several times for the past 3 months.
In general my observations are.. 

Pros:

Generous portions, fresh tasty food.

Cons: 

Can be pricy (let's remember this is still fast food), about $10 for a 3 taco steak order and no drink, you be the judge.

Consistently rude staff at the food assembly line (see other reviews)

Food although fresh, tends to be soggy and messy, and generally looks terrible.

Not sure how clean this place is, as I've seen dirty tables and cross contamination when staff refills and prepares the food.

Rude staff (I know I mentioned this but I must reiterate) 

Anyhow, ultimately I'm dissatisfied with this Cafe Rio location and I wouldn't recommend going. 

However, if you don't mind the rude staff that gives you plenty of condescending looks just because you take more than 2 seconds to decide between pinto or black beans, then go for it.  

The last time I checked, we were the customers and that used to mean something.
