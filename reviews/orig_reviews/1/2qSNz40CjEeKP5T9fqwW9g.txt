This location sucks. Didn't know you could desecrate chipotles perfection but you can. They run out of super basic things every time I'm there and just expect you to deal with it not even try to provide more or hustle. Last time I came in at a very normal dinner hour and they ran out of steak and the employee said to just order something else? Da fuq? 

They run out of chips ON THE REG which I didn't know was possible. There will be 6 or more employees standing around doing nothing. Also the employees are pretty sassy 85 percent of the time (eye rolls etc). Like I get it, customer service is rough at times but chill out.
