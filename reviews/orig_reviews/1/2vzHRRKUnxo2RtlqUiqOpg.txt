Cold tortillas, awful service from the owner (she actually rolled her eyes at us when my friend asked that our tortillas be served warm because it was cold the previous time she was there), and the food really wasn't all that great.  We're never going back.  There are far better spots in the South Side and in Pittsburgh in general.
