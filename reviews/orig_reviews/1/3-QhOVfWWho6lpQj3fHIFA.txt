Oh Burrito Company... no more...  I visited again and this time my experience was down right awful. I picked up a chorizo breakfast burrito to go. Super rude service and they charged me for extra salsas that weren't in the bag. I asked for the burrito to be double wrapped since I live in Maricopa and when I got home it wasn't, the burrito was cold. There was a hair wrapped into my burrito and to top it off I got really bad food poisoning and had to miss several days of work. Thanks burrito company...I won't be back.  I'll be taking my business to Los Taquitos, Rubios, Tortilla Fish, Chipotle or any other good Mexican food locations nearby that don't offer crappy service with a side of food poisoning.
