Myself, my wife & another couple ate here on a Wednesday evening & the only meal that was fresh was the salad ordered by one of our group. The seafood in the paella was overcooked & the rice was mush. An order of Cuban porkchops were inedible and the salmon dish ordered was not cooked as requested. The ceviche appetizer was just chopped shrimp. Boo! Even the sangria was lacking. I don't think the owners can decide whether this is a restaurant or a nightclub.
