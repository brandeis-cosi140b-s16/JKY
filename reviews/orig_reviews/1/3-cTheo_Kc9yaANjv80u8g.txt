The food was okay, but I sat at the bar and my service was terrible. I had to ask for chips and salsa 3 times. I got my food before my chips. I asked them to make fajitas spicy and for some reason it was sweet? WTF?
I asked for hot sauce and did not get it, until a waiter that was cashing out noticed and brought it to me. I tipped that waiter that who was nice enough to take care of me 5 times more than my actual waiter.
