Had dinner here Sat night with husband. Atmosphere is cool and rooftop is nice. Food is mediocre at best. We both had the same type of burrito, but they were very different. One had a lot of sauce inside and no pico, the other barely any sauce and lots of pico. Chips and salsa were good. Service was horrible. The two hostesses are more interested in talking with each other than seating guests. They kept looking at us, but kept talking. We finally asked to seat ourselves, then they seated us. Our waiter was HORRIBLE! He was rude. He kept asking us if we wanted seperate a checks. We were seated at a four top, but sat beside each other. We were both wearing our wedding rings and my 5carat diamond...we are obviously married. My husband said no, but the waiter wouldn't let it go. He kept it up. Then before we left he snidely said "sorry to make this uncomfortable". Save yourself the trouble...drive another mile and go to Mad Mex...always great food!
