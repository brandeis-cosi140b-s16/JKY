Simply put, this was my worst dining experience in Charlotte to date. We had friends in town and wanted to take them somewhere fun uptown. Needless to say we were disappointed in our choice, and will never go back. The food was subpar. Guacamole had no flavor at all. So bad we felt the need to send it back. Sangria was so-so at best (and way overpriced- pay attention to the less visible writing on the signs, a pitcher is NOT $20 if you're not there on Thursday. Dinner was filling, or maybe I just lost my appetite.
To add to my personal frustration, the service was just terrible. Our server was slow and difficult to track down when he was needed. When our food was brought out, our server and another guy put all the food down at once... The food runner's arm went right into my burrito. Acceptable? I didn't think so, but they felt it was. He actually tried to leave the table without saying a word (despite the cheese running down his arm). Our servers response to an arm in my food? "Oh, is that okay?" No, it's not. And you couldn't pay me enough to come back.
I can promise you'd get better Mexican/tex-mex at any of the other places in and around the city.
