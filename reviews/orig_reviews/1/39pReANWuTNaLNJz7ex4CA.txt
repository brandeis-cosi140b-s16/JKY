Can I give lower than 1 star?  Calico Jack's was featured on Fox 10 News so we figured we would give it a try.  My wife ordered the carnitas burrito and I had the don flautas.  Disgusting.  Worst meal for both of us that we have had in a long, long time.  The service was slightly below average.  The atmosphere is nice but that's about it.
