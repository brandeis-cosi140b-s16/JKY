I've been in twice so far. The food on the first visit was horrible. They have to hand pick out chips that are not spicy (gross) and the food was awful. The second time I was in was just for a drink and the waitress got pissy with me for moving her serving tray off of the bar seat I wanted to sit on.  I will never come in here again
