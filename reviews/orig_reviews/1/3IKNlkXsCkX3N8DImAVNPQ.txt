I went there for the first time today during lunch, and I was impressed by the customer service as soon as you walk in, there great. They had me try all these samples which was great. I finally made my selection and that's when I lost interest in this place. They were so stingy with all there stuff, the portions were so small it was like getting an appetizer. The guy behind the counter used tongs to get the food and would shake the tongs to where the food would fall off and only put what was in the tongs on your bowl, REALLY like two ounces of fish?! Along with all the other stuff it was really small. I paid $10 for food and drink and wasn't pleased with the size of the portions they gave. CHIPOTLE is cheaper and you get more for your money.. I'd hate for a potentially good business to go out for being stingy with food! Common guys make your portions bigger for the price you charge
