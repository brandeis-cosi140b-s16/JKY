My Wife and I went to Nando's to celebrate her 27th birthday, and I have to say it was a big disappointment. We had the house margaritas, which tasted like it was all mixer and no liquor. The salsa was stale (tasted like old tomato sauce) and the chips were fresh but not salted at all. I ordered the steak fajitas and my wife ordered the chicken fajitas.  I was hoping that the fajitas would turn my sour mood around about the place, but no, it did not.  My steak was so bland and didn't even taste like it was marinated at all. Also the steak didn't even look like steak (the pieces of meat reminded me of Mongolian beef). My wife's chicken was the same story.  We really didn't even touch our meals and quickly asked for the check.  Also I think there was something wrong with the salsa because my Wife and I started to feel ill. This used to be my wife's favorite place to go for Mexican food, but after this experience we will never go there again.
