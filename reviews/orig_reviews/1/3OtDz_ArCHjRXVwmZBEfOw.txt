Sorry, I can't recommend this place. The ambiance and presentation are good, but that's about all. The food was overpriced and yet smaller than kid size portion. 

The best thing here was the chips and guacamole they serve you before your meal...except by don't tell you it's $11 for a small bowl of tortilla chips. 

Save your money, go elsewhere. Unless you're fine with shelling out $50 for a few quarter size tortillas, a couple pieces of vegetables and a few tortilla chips.
