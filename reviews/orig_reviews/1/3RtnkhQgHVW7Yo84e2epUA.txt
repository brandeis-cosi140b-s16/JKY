After seating ourselves it took awhile to get service, she was working her ass off though as they looked very under staffed.  The nachos were topped with cold meat after waiting quite a while to get them, one in our group said that this was just a tick above Taco Bell.  I've had better at Taco Bell for sure.  One also talked about the fact of choices in the airport & how this place probably doesn't give a rats ass about yelp reviews because they are set.  I've had a lot of good airport food in this country, it should be an absolute privilege to have a spot in a place with limited choices & numerous clientele.  C'mon Vegas, you're better than this!  How do you screw up nachos!?
