What a huge disappointment.  I am local and work in the vicinity of the Hard Rock.  The Pink Taco is generally pricey so I usually save lunch there for a special occasion and was willing to pay extra because of the quality of the food.  What have they done to this place?  First, they changed the menu and my favorite meal was not on the menu.  SO ok. . . I will try something else. . . The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.  The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.  The meat seemed frozen and old.  The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat. 

 The taquitos were burned, served with a lump of so so guacamole.  I tried mixing the guacamole with the tasteless chipolte ranch sause to try to get something that tasted good and had a good texture.  This didn't work.  The margarita which was $12 tasted like a cheap glass of lemonade. . .Come on people. . .at least get the margurita right!  

The manager did comp the chicken wings. . .We noticed that the people sitting next to us were less than thrilled with their meal as well. . .Whoever is in charge of this place now should be ashamed for taking a place where you could count on good atmosphere and good food into a gastronomic nightmare. 

 It will be a long long time before I go there again, if ever!
