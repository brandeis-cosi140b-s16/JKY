I have to say the service is fantastic sat at the bar very attentive but this  the worst fish tacos I have ever had. Absolutely lacking in flavor tortillas were overly soggy. Picture eating tofu wrapped in a tortilla and that is what you get.  I am not one that is particularly critical of Mexican food especially tacos but I have to say this was probably the worst thing I have had in the casino since I've been here. Again the service is fantastic waitstaff is fantastic food absolutely not.judging from the other reviews if I were the Hard Rock Hotel I would revoke their lease and get something better in here
