Horrible visit.  Sat at the bar for 5 minutes before getting service.  I ordered 1 double ketl and tonic and 1 double ketl and cranberry and the bartender rang it up as four drinks so I paid $30 for two drinks! Wtf. There should've been a double button on the pos. But they obviously don't train their bartenders correctly.  And it definitely wasn't a 6 count pour for a double.  Will never go back.
