This place sux a**!  This is based solely on the service, didn't stay long enough to try any food or beverages.  The staff is straight up rude which was the only low light to my recent stay in Vegas.  If you stay at the Monte Carlo, there are plenty of other bars and restaurants, so skip this one unless you feel like being annoyed.  The staff was not willing to accommodate simple requests and seemed more focused on harrassing us than providing good service or any service at all!
