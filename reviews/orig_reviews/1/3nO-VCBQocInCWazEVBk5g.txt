Don't just walk away from this place, run. 

Was staying at the Luxor for my brother's 21st, and the location and name of this restaurant was alluring, but nothing more than a clever ruse to dupe guests in to patronizing this sham. We arrived around 6:00 on a Wednesday, and were seated pretty quickly. That may have been the only good thing about the experience.

Drinks. Our waiter attended to us quickly, took our order for two margaritas - no salt - and came back with two margaritas - with salt. He took them away and brought them back,  and judging by the salt water flavoring, had clearly just dumped the beverages in to a new glass. Pretty stunning for a fully staffed dinner crew with a half-full service. 

Appetizers. We ordered the beef taquitos. Those too came out pretty quickly, but the dish was paltry. It looked and tasted (quacks like a duck...) like two microwaved, frozen, taquitos from the local Wal-Mart frozen food section. They were sliced in half and drizzled with sour cream to make it look more appetizing, didn't help. 

Dinner. I ordered the shredded pork tacos, which came over-stuffed in to mini-disc sized tortillas, thrown next to some rice and black beans, and drizzled once again with the same uninspiring "creama fresca", cool story bro. This is something I could have gotten at a chain restaurant for about $6 less. At least there I know I get what I'm paying for. Yikes. What was worse was the seafood relleno that my little brother got. It was clearly frozen seafood slopped on to a small serving of rice in a mushy pepper and slapped with a $19 price tag. Genius. 

TL;DR

The service was poor, the food was worse, and grossly overpriced. With so many options in and around the hotel, you'd be a fool to waste your time and money here regardless of the circumstances. This place has potential sitting right above the lobby of a popular hotel, but I will never eat here again in it's current form.
