There wasn't much to like about this place except the location is  RIGHT AT the light rail. The music was annoying (live "bad" band), the drinks expensive and sour. I like a margarita served in glass, not plastic. I felt like I should have been poolside or at a sporting event. Didn't try the food and won't be back to see what that's about.
