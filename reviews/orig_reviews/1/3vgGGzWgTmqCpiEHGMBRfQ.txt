The location is nice, the service was good, but in my opinion, the food has gone so far downhill I hope never to return. It's not that the food is gross or anything like that, it seems fresh but the flavor is just so blah. My parents and grandparents love it but if you like spicy, flavorful Mexican food this place isn't for you.
