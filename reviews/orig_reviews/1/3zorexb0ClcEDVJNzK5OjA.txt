Food is OK, tho they were busy so it took nearly an hour and a half to get it.  Their security guys are complete aggro d*cks tho. 

A friend tripped on the sidewalk and they "asked" him to leave for too many drinks.  Not really, they rough housed him out immediately and looked like they were trying to get him to start a fight with the 3 of them.  

Bright side is our 20 person group can go somewhere else next year for the get together.  I'm sure we can get $4 bottles of domestic beer about anywhere.
