I have only been here a couple of times, however that was enough to determine that Mad Mex is far superior in every way.Had nachos with chicken as an appetizer-rather flavorless and nothing special.I ate the "3 amigos" as my entree-1 beef minitaco, 1 carnitas minitaco, and 1 chicken minitaco. They were all very bland, the tortillas were soggy, and frankly the beef taco was inedible.Everything I have ever ordered at Mad Mex has been very tasty so since they are both so close to eachother in shadyside-walking distance in decent weather-I see absolutely no need to go to Steel Cactus-head right to Mad Mex!
