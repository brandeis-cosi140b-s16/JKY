Aunt Chilada's it is time to hang up the towel..reinvent yourself as a nursing home cafeteria and everyone will be happy.

 Your nachos are, well Auntie -they're nasty. The cheese is stringy, the chips stale and the chicken tastes canned..The worst part is all you put on nachos is cheese, beans and chicken - no salsa, no guac, no olives, no onions...Alot of nots.  The hair that was impaled in the cheese is actually not what stopped me from eating...the lack of taste is was haulted me, the hair just confirmed the decision for me. 


The margaritas are $8.00 which silly me, made me think that, here in  the land of the sun, where everyone serves margaritas as cheaply as possible, for $8 I must be getting something really special. No, I was wrong.  Nothing special about your cheap tasting tequila and even cheaper mix that is shot off the bartender's gun in a standard pint glass for $8...seriously? 16oz of Mrs. T's and a shot of tequila or rubbing alchohol, everything had the taste of shortcuts at Aunties. 

Your bathrooms are dirty and really you have the resort golf crowd not a bunch of rowdies, so its' not them, its you not checking on the faciities throughout the night. And, given that I am paying $8 for margies and $12 for some stale chips, a clean bathroom would have been a nice touch. 

Your staff is quite nice and you have plenty of them. So, though you were serving me crap and ripping me off while you were doing it, you were really nice about it. I didn't boher to complain about the hair because if I started with the hair, were would my complaint have ended...again, retirement is the key. 

So, Auntie, your mexican restaurant days should be coming to a close. Maybe lay off the booze and consider a buffet style generic mexican food in a nice assisted living facility. This would be your true calling but selling overpriced generic, crap tasting mexican food at the foot of a resort needs to come to a stop - someone is going to get hurt.
