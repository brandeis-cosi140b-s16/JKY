Food was very basic, The spinach sauce should have gone on the burro not in it. My Asada burro had more filler beans than meat (Filibertos has more meat and cheaper too). They wanted to charge for more salsa and chips .99 for a small basket of chips and .99 for 1/4 cup of salsa. I ask the manager to name one place around here in the east valley that charges for extra chips and salsa and she said she couldn't, We told her it was our 3rd time there and was never charged before and that's when she said they fired the people who have done that.  They have lost my business for good and manager really don't care and she showed it. One last item, my enchilada style burro flower shell soaked up the sauce on it and had very little around it, they wanted more money to put sauces on our burros.
