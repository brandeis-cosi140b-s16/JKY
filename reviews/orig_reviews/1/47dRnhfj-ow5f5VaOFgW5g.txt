We just are here tonight for my husband's birthday and I was so disappointed with the whole experience. I was told by friends that is was such a cool and fun place with great food. It was so loud I could not even have a conversation with my husband. I had to send my food back because it was cooled wrong. We waited over 20 minutes for my new food plate and by then my husband was done eating. We had to pay for chips and salsa from a Mexican place how lame is that when the drinks are already $13 for a margarita! I will not go back here again as it was a waste of money and I actually got really sick from the food. Not a way to spend the 4th or my hubby's birthday. I wish I could get a refund since I did not even eat much of my 2nd plate of food. What a waste!
