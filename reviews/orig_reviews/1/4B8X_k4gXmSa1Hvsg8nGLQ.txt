The restaurant had a special event menu last night because of the Justin Bieber concert. If you want to do a special shortened menu, the items being offered should be good. OUr table of 6 ordered the nachos, quesadillas and burgers. All of them were cold, plain, poor ingredients and overall bad. Did I mention they seemed to out special prices on their "event" menu.  A small, yucky burger $11.49, a really small quesadilla (four pieces) $9.99 and cold, gross nachos- $11.99. And the topper was a bottle of beer- $7. The one star is given to the server. She was friendly and attentive. No wonder it was the only place not booming with business.
