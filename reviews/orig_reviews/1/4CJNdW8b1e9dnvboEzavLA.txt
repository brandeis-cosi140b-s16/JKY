Service was ok. But this is literally some
Of the worst food I've ever eaten in my life. We ordered chicken enchiladas with rice & beans and a combo plate of a beef enchilada and beef taco. Both were absolutely disgusting. It was a soupy mess. The enchiladas were just thrown together with watery chicken and literally Covered in huge globs of gross cheese melted on the top. The green sauce had no flavor and was watery as well. The beef enchilada was the same. So watery it was literally dripping off the plate. Rice & beans tasted like it had been sitting out the whole day. All around just gross we will never be back.
