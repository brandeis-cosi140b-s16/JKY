Well I was very disappointed,especially after hearing this place had been in this location for 25 years. My carne asada burrito was anything but authentic. Instead of marinated shredded beef it had bits of beef that had been way over cooked. You could chew and chew and nothing would happen. I suggest that you stick to Chevy's. My wife's enchilada was so salty she couldn't eat it. Oh ya, drinks are way overpriced too.
