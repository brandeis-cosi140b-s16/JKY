I hate to have to decrease my review, but not as much as I hate the fact that I will never return to this establishment. I have frequented this restaurant for many years, but my last few experiences have been terrible. Every single time I order my food, they bring it out wrong. It happens so frequently that it makes me wonder if they do it on purpose. They can't be bothered with checking on you, refilling your drinks or offering a smile. I feel like I'm bothering them by being there. I order the same thing every time I go & order it the exact same way, but every time I go there's either extra ingredients on it or something is missing. The last time this happened & after I was lucky enough go get a waiters attention to tell her about it, I was told it depends on who makes it. Really? No point in reading the menu here ... You just have to hope that it's made correctly & if it isn't & you're brave enough to complain, get ready for attitude. Time to find another mexican place that actually appreciates having faithful customers & will make my order the way that I request!
