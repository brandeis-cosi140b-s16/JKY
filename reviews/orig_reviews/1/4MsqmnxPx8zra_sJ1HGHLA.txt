Since my first visit a couple years ago, I have seen the quality of the food here plummet.  This week, it hit rock bottom.  My wife called in a to go order, picked it up, and brought it home.  We discovered that the small amount of rice they did give us in our combination plates was completely inedible.  It must have been sitting in a warmer for hours because it was hard and crunchy.  My wife ordered the BBQ chicken, and it was hard and dried out.  I ordered the jade red chicken, and it was hard and dried out.  Whoever was working the kitchen had to know the food had been sitting out for too long and was dried out, and it is shameful that they nevertheless served it.  We would have brought it back, but with a newborn at home we did not have the time or energy.  They should have just got it right the first time.

In all, what was once my favorite place in Chandler has slipped to the point that I'm not sure I want to ever go back.
