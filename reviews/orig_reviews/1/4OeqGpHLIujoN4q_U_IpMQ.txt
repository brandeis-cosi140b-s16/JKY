my friend was begging our group to go eat here for lunch since shes been here before and fell in love with this place, but i don't see whats so great about it.  i do like the decor and the lighting and everything, but the food is really just meeh to me.  i had the chicken enchilada and all i can say is, it's super DRY! i had to use their salsa that they give you with chips as a way to moisten it up and add some flavor.  i hate black beans (it's part of their side) and i did not like their mexican rice.  it was just not cooked all the way or something cause it was pretty hard.  umm i'd rather be at el torito.
