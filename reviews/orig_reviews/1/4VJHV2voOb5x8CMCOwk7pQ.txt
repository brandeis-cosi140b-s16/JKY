I myself work in a resturant so i understand that mistakes happen, but my experience with wahoos tacos was so disapointing that I will NEVER spend another dime at any of thier establishments. My husband and i got take out at the nearest wahoos on rainbow. We purchaced $30 worth of tacos and condiments. When we got home we discovered that none of the tacos had any dressings. They were nothing more than tortilla, meat, lettus. No pico, no slaw. NOTHING. I would never pay 30$ for meat and lettus. Not to mention the meat tasted terrible that night. No flavor at all. I called immediatly assuming I would just speak to a manager and come get some replacements. Well the employee Vinny explained to me that he couldnt help me and their manager was not there for the night and there was no one else I could talk to. So I asked him to take my name and number and have them get back to me the next day. 2days later I called again at 5pm and another employee again tells me there is no manager on duty. So I gave him my name and phone number and explained the situation he said he would put my info on his managers desk. Its been 3weeks and no one ever got back to me. Mistakes happen but they clearly dont care about good customer service. I was ripped off and they could really care less.
