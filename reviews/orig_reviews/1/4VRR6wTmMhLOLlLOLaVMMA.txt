Went last night prior to movie...worth trying due to positive reviews.  Got chips and salsa, found hair in salsa as chip was heading to mouth.  Then, looked in glass of water and saw what looked to be what I hope was a small piece of paper with writing but server said it might be a bug.  Got right up and left, won't be back.
