Let me start by saying I've been going to Chevy's for forever. Not so much in Vegas, but all over California. I know what to expect, I'm not looking for fancy, just mildly satisfying. 
So. Tonight my family, there were 7 adults and 3 kids, went to this location for dinner. We arrived at 6:30. Placed our orders, got a few beverages, and waited... And waited and waited. An hour later, mind you they were not very busy, and maybe two check in's from our waitress, our food starting coming out. Some of it. I didn't receive my soup and salad, and my uncle didn't get his enchiladas. We had no silverware, no tortillas for fajitas at the table, and my nieces kids meal was wrong. Went tried to find our waitress, couldn't, ended up robbing other tables for silverware and I went to get tortillas. Then I asked for the manager.
Tony came over and we got off on the wrong foot. He was combative and went about addressing our issues all kinds of wrong. He essentially was asking for our missing orders all over again... I told him to check with the server and the kitchen for our orders, because placing them now isn't going to do us any good. He was yelling over the long table to my uncle asking over and over for his order until my uncle finally said never mind on the food at all. Tony disappeared, the only food to come out after that was a chicken taco for my niece that had cheese on the plate despite us saying she had a severe dairy allergy... and the food that was there (that we waited an hour for) was all cold! 
I could tell Tony wasn't the GM, sure enough he was an assistant manager, so I asked for the GM's card, and despite them comping the whole meal, I will still be reaching out to him. Ordinarily I would've tipped the waitress despite the comp but I couldn't justify it given the lack of service. Missing meals, combined with bad food and even worse customer service is truly unacceptable. Even when it's free.
