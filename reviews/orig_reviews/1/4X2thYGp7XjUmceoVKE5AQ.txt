I had a carne asada burrito that was more fat and gristle than meat a couple weeks ago. I decided to give them another try this morning and get a breakfast burrito, and I couldn't even get served! The employees were having a non work related conversation (about some drama) and left me standing at the register. I'm done with them. I like to buy and shop local, but it looks like I will have to travel to get good Mexican food and service.
