So I can't rate the food as yet; since, I'm still waiting for service after 20 minutes. Our waitress was really fast to get our drink order,but when we were ready to order she ignored us.  When we finaaly did get her attention and mentioned the service was less than we hoped for all she could say was they were a little busy. But I doubt she'll be so busy when it is time to give us the check and collect her tip...what tip?
