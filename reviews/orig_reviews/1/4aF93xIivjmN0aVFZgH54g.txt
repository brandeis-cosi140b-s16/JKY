Bland and tasteless except the Talapia which tasted like olives and was sent back. The service was slow and inattentive. The only redeeming quality was the chips. While they were fresh and hot, the salsa was not. Even with extra heat requested, the salsa was bland. This is definitely not a Mexican restaurant any Mexican would be caught dead patronizing. It is definitely a place for gringos with no taste or high expectations.
