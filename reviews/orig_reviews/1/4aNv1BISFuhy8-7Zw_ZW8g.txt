My wife and I had dinner last Friday night.  It was terrible.  We ordered the Angus burgers.  The meat on the burgers were just two small slider patties.  The onion rings were full of liquid, clearly frozen items.  The wine was expensive and was a name brand, however, what they served us didn't  at all taste like the wine listed.  It was probably a cheap substitute - I think this is illegal.  This restaurant is off our list.
