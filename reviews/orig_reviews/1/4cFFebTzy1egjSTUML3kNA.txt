We stayed at TI on Wednesday night. Got a 2-for-1 cocktail voucher and we redeemed it there on Wednesday night. Big mistake! Very weak margaritas. The music was horrible to us; sorry, we are not into hip hop. We left right away. "Glow night"... I was expecting more like an 80s music type event, which we would've enjoyed, but nope. Adios Se√±or Frogs!
