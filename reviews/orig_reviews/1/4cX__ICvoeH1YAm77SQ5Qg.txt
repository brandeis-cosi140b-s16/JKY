I have gone to many restaurants in my time and I figured in Las Vegas why not try something different. Well lets say management and staff is key to any successful establishment. But unfortunately, this place lacked it. We had a party of 11 and our poor waitress was left to handle our table and another table of 20+ guest on her own, while the assistant manager is busy dancing with the bull rider controller and obviously has her attention focused elsewhere, can we be more professional she is the assistant manager. As a manager of a facility she could of delegated to other staff to help provide service to both large parties. Instead a dinner that should of taken only 2 hours turned into 3.5 hrs. At that point we decided to speak to the individual in charge and he decides to laugh at another situation, goes to another customer then finally decides to attempt to address our dissatisfaction. If you don't have reservations for anything after dinner this is the place to go because you will be spending most of your Vegas time at this restaurant due to the lack of help needed to facilitate decent service. I will be sure to let everyone I know of the service that was provided at such a place in Vegas. Word of mouth is the key to any successful establishment.
