Gnarly fast food. The concept is great but the execution is just awful. There was no flavor to the Jade Red Chicken and the tortilla was stale. It wasn't even creative; purely drunk food only that it still leaves you unsatisfied. I can take awful food now and then but the place was completely dirty. There was food left on our table that I had to wipe off and there was food all over the floor. the staff just merrily ignored it. Absolutely disgusting. We came home and showered. If I could give it zero stars I would.
