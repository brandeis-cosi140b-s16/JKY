Don't bother.  Food was expensive and nothing special, and service was abysmal.  Manager didn't seem to care.  We waited forever for drinks, had to flag our server down for refills, and waited again another 15 minutes for those.  Watched tables all around us get the wrong food orders - two lonely burritos checked into every table and I'm not sure they ever found a home.  Not a good experience at all... We won't be back... Ever.
