This is one of the worst eating experience we have had in Vegas... The food was left out long enough for it to get cold and did not taste good. Now we have been waiting 1 hour for our check. We have asked twice now. We can't even pay... We feel like just walking out. The service here clearly sucks! And it is so overpriced for warm food that has been sitting out.
