Went to Taquitos today.  

The service was worse than their usual indifferent mediocrity.   Today they told me to wait while they spoke with a vendor rather than taking my order.   

Following that they did not even meet the minimum bar of getting my order right. It was nowhere close.

I have previously been to Taquitos and had decidely mediocre service but excellent food.

Unfortunately they could not even meet that standard this time.

Spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated.
