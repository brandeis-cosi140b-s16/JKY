ZERO stars. Food is awful. There is no reason that something as basic as a burger should be so bland. The people that work there are rude. A bouncer came over to open the "garage" and practically pushed me out of the way to get behind my chair. He didn't ask if I would move or even apologize for being practically on top of me.   Avoid this place at all costs.
