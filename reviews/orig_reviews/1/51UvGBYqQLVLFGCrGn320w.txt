Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!

Customer Service was AWEFUL, on a scale of 1-5 food was 1, drinks were ok, the only good thing was the atmosphere, which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there, I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving, which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory!

There are Plenty of Great places in Scottsdale with Great food, Great service, Great drinks & Great atmosphere.

We even tried talking to the manager but he got all Upset & tried to make us feel like we were lucky to be there & didn't know what we were talking about.

So if you want, BAD Service, Over Priced & Tasteless food & like to waste your money this is the place for you!
