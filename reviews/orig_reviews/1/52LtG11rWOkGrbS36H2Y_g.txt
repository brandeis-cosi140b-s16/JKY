The wait staff and and manager were the worst I have ever seen. We waited 15 minutes before the waiter came by to take our order. Never saw him again. Called the manager over and she got a new waiter who was ok. Manager never checked on us again. If you go here and get a waiter named Jeff G. walk out! The food was good once it was ordered and arrived.
