Run of the mill Mexican food with typically lousy service.  We've been several times and the food is usually decent. This last time, it took 20 minutes to refill drinks and 40 minutes to refill salsa, causing us to wait about 10 minutes to eat our bland food and calling for the manager.  Then to top it off the rice was raw and crunchy.  We won't be back after this worst experience.
