Awful experience. I was part of a large group of mostly out of town guests. We arranged to visit the night before and were assured they could accommodate the size of our group (35 people).

The food was decent but nothing special. The service was HORRIBLE. When a complaint was made to the "manager" the service got even worse. 

Overall, there are too many other options in Old Scottsdale than to waste your time and money here...
