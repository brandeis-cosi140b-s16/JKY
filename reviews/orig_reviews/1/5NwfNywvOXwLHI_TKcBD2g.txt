After I informed the staff that all the tables were dirty, nothing was cleaned in the time it took us to eat, about 20 minutes. Others just cleaned the tables themselves, not a single employee came out to even check.

There were 6 people behind the counter and one person cooking in the back.  Business was brisk, but not to the point of being overwhelming. They ran out of fajitas vegetables and it took over 8 minutes to get more.  

Poor leadership and poor planning on the part of management.

Very unimpressed with this location.
