I honestly don't even want to give this place ONE STAR. I was there this past weekend.. the girls and I are all STARVING after the pool party at Marquee and we wanted some food pronto. This was right there when we were walking out and we thought it was Chinese fast food. Yannoe? Something quick and yummy and hopefully, cheap. Boy were we wrong on ALL of that! I guess I should have been alarmed that this place serves BOTH Chinese AND Mexican food? Hmm... 

Anyways, we walked in, got seated, and checked out the menu. Everything was pretty expensive, but since we were already seated, we decided to just go with it. We ordered 3 hot and sour soups, 2 noodles, and 1 fried rice.. TRUST ME when I say this because I'm not exaggerating when I say that EVERYTHING TASTED DISGUSTING -- keep in mind that I have not eaten in 8 hours and cup noodles would have tasted heavenly.. But no, the food was completely nasty and they got a little vinegar happy on all our dishes. Not only were the food gross, but the portion was TINY. The waitress even said that you'd have to order 2-3 dishes per person to even be full. Really?

After what seemed like days for our food to come out, we decided to cancel the fried rice. We wanted to pay, get the hella outta there, and find some REAL FOOD. Our bill came out to $90ish dollars. It was ridiculous how BAD this place is. Nasty food, tiny portions, overly priced.. need I say more?

But yeah.. Keep in mind that this review is more for their Chinese menu, but I will not be back to find out how their Mexican food tastes like. Please save your money and go to the Panda Express down the street if you want Chinese. You'll be much happier AND you'll get more bang for your buck there than at this place.
