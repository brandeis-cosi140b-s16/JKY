Actually didn't try the food. Stopped into to grab something to eat after a long day of travel. Bartender closing down his register,  kitchen was getting cleaned up, waitresses were closing out and and doing side work.  When I  asked if the restaurant is still open the rude bartender pointed at the gate across from me and said when that plane leaves they close.  

I walked out of there, who wants to eat at a place that is 99 percent closed down and on top of that they weren't even inviting and said hey we're closing down but don't worry about it,  come on in and grab something we will take care of you.

Stay open till you close.
