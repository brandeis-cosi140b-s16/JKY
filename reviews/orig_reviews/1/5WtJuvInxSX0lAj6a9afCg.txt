Mediocre food at best, awful service... Del Taco is a more flavorful and enjoyable experience than this place.

My wife and I have given this place 3 tries, and each visit is more disappointing than the last.  PLEASE get rid of your attitude-charged wait staff!!  They are DESTROYING (and drinking) your business.  My wife and I have hotel and food/beverage careers, and have never encountered service in all of Las Vegas as bad this place.  When one ponders why the waitress is such a jerk, and then you see her pounding shots with friends, the pieces come together...

The hostess is the only thing this place has going for it, she's sweet and often does half the work of the wait staff.

We're done coming here, and giving it any more "chances"!
