One star seems generous here. 1. Way over priced, 2. Horrible service, and 3. The food is pretty bad. You could hear the waiters fighting in the back, my soup was semi- warm (and you could tell that they warmed it in the microwave), and my shrimp ceviche was so bad that I didn't even finish it. Sad. Keep walking by to find something better.
