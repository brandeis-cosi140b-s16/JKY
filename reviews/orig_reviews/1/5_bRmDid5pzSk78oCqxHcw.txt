My friends and I decided to go here because we were kind of getting tired of some of the other joints on Mill. We tried this place thinking that you CAN NEVER go wrong with Mexican food. BOY WERE WE WRONG! The service here was deplorable, seeing as our server was reading a book rather than keeping track of our food, water, or needs. The food was bland and not appetizing. The "quesadillas" were not quesadillas, but some sort of weird bread without cheese, meat, or anything for that matter. The salsa was watery and old, and all of our food was cold. The waiter said they were "authentic." I was with two hispanics and an east coast foodie, and none of us felt that any of it was authentic. My friend also found a hair in her chimichanga. The ambiance is lackluster and boring. This is one of those places on Mill that needs to get with the program or LEAVE. There is no place for something so grossly unneeded in Tempe. They should honestly put a new restaurant or bar there.
