In the past I have really enjoyed the Green Chile Chicken Burrito, but after a MASSIVE price increase in May, I will not be returning. The aforementioned item was $9.50. The price has now increased 33% to $12.50. I might add, this is an ala carte item and was not enchilada style. Simply a burrito and a little lettuce for aesthetics. When i asked the server, he said they raised prices across the board by,one-third, shortly after Cinco de Mayo. Want a margarita? That will set you back $12-15. Really? Simply overpriced!
