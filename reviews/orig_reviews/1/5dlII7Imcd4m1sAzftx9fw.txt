After just about an hour of waiting for our 3 orders of various nachos we walked out...I think the wait was absolutly ridiculous and the waitress and manager agreed with me as well. 
We were excited about trying our nachos as there were numerous options to put on the "build your own nachos" page...All chips said they were made on site and my daughter who is so picky loved the idea of spam being on her nachos..Yes, my fellow islanders-SPAM is an option as well as kim chee-exciting huh? If we only we had 4hrs to kill then maybe we could have tried it!!! We waited and waited and waited and finally nothing!!!! The waitress kept telling us that it will be just a few minutes but after a while we knew tasting our nacho masterpieces was not meant to be...
While waiting we were given house muffins(jalapenos inside) with honey butter- the muffins were so cold and sadly we did not enjoy these. As we stood up to leave the waitress let us know that there are 3 cooks in the kitchen and 3 managers all assisting the cooks trying to get food out-seems like mass confusion to me as it was not a packed restaurant at all!!! I know this is a new place (the waitress said they have been open for a month) but why open a restaurant if your cooks aren't able to handle 3 orders of nachos- nachos a dish that is in your name and supposedly your speacialty....Kinks should have been worked out within the first few weeks because the last thing you want especially now is for your customers to walk out because of the wait and not be able to even try the food.
The waitress was nice and seemed embarrased by the wait herself and it was also said that a table before us also walked out because of the wait. She got the manager who was also apologetic and said that there was no excuse for the wait. So to compensate for our time there he gave us a $15.00 gift certificate to come back.Hmmm I'll have to sleep on that...
