So I know that all of the 5 star reviews for this place are from people who have a hand in the company called Riot hospitality. They posted 5 stars on whiskey row, el hefe scottsdale, and public house on sixth (all riot properties) and used the almost the same exact post.
Truth is, the bartenders stare at themselves all day and night while they fix their hair, and unless you're a friend of someone there, service is a "c" grade at best. Food is bland, drinks are inconsistent and the bartenders I've had, don't know how to make an old fashioned. I ordered a shot of rumplemintz and was given a shot glass full if simple syrup and that was the last time I went. This is the talent you'll find in the front of house at ALL of these properties.
