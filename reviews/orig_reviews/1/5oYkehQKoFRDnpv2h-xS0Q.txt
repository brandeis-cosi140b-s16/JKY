So filthy we walked out!

I took my girlfriend to Mundo on a Saturday night.  Things didn't go well from the moment we walked in.  The hostess couldn't be bothered to look up from her iPhone/text messaging and simultaneous chit-chat with a server to greet us at the door.   

We weren't crazy about being seated next to a few very loud tables.  We looked around the room and realized that we'd been seated there because none of the other tables had been bused yet - there were several filthy tabletops. 

We left the table and moved to the bar for a drink.  It was FILTHY!  The were two bartenders behind the bar and a huge line of filthy unwashed glasses.  There was bar debris - napkins, limes, etc.  We waited to be served  - but the two girls behind the bar couldn't be bothered.  We asked for a drink menu, which she handed us over a stack of unwashed glasses. 

We looked at the long line filthy glasses on the bar, the tables that hadn't been bused and the garbage on the floor and decided to leave.  I won't be back.
