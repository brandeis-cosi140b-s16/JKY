I had a good margarita here before...I think. When I ordered it this time, it was watered down and very sweet (I had a raspberry flavored margarita). It was also very expensive for that piece of sh*t drink; $8.25 for a 12oz and freakin $22. for a yard long... WHAT A RIP OFF. I will not get one from here again. The bartender was rude too; he took a long time to take our order.

After flippin through the Las Vegas magazines, I found a coupon for a free 16oz margarita at Slots-A-Fun. Maybe that would've been better...or worse; if you've tried that one, let me know.
