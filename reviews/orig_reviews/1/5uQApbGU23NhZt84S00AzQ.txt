This location is really poor in quality and service. I LOVE CHIPOTLE, but sadly locations vary in quality and service. As a loyal customer I pay more for the quality Chipotle supposedly offers, but when I have to plead for a decent amount of meat in my tacos every time I order its beyond frustrating. Three times I have been to this location and three times I got little sub standard portions of what I pay for. If Im paying $10-15 for three tacos, I expect the majority of the cost to be MEAT/protein not toppings. Also my last experience, was 10% cheese in my quesadilla and stale chips, I was so mad I actually drove back to the location to show the manager. All he could say was, uh ok we can give you another one if you want. UM YA I would think so, and how about working on quality control here. The kids that work there act like your a pan handler when you order food. And to top it off he gave me another bag of stale chips. 0 stars here.
