Let me preface this by saying we have been coming here for 9 years, and after tonight we will NEVER come back. Let's start...
Arrival- there were a few people waiting when we got here, put our name in and were told about 10 minutes.  After 30 minutes of waiting, a party that arrived after us, and was a larger party, was seated. I went to ask the hostess how much longer we would be waiting and she said we were next. I pointed out that the people that arrived after us had been seated and the "manager" said "yeah, if a smaller party is waiting we sometimes seat them first." I said, we have 4, they have 5. Her response was "oh, well they were probably here before you, you just didn't see them." Nope.
Seated- finally get a table and there are waitstaff everywhere but no one is approaching us. At this time a party that arrived 15 minutes after is is seated next to us and is immediately approached for drink orders and given chips and salsa. We still have not even been greeted. At this point we realize why, the waiter that has been visiting with the party at the table next to us, we could hear him address them as "mom" and they are obviously family, comes over to take our drink order and leaves.  He returns and leaves our drinks. It's another 10 minutes before he takes our order. After he leaves again, we flag him down as we still do not even have chips and salsa.  Meanwhile our server is leaning on the host table chatting with hostesses and other waiters. We had to get his attention for refills after drinks were empty a while.
Food- well a bug was flying around and landed on my half eaten food, what I had was good, not great. My husband had carne asada and it was chewy, and burnt so bad the edges of the steak were curling up.
We will never be back, and I know we are not the only ones. So sad because this was one of our favorites.
