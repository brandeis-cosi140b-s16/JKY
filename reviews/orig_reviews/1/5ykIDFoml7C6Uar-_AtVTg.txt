Hostess said we couldt seat at the table overlooking the strip cause we were just having drinks, we moved n then she comes over n said no u cant seat here either ( table near bar) u can seat only in the tables at the back or at the bar.....

Geez!!!! I wanted to leave rigth away, what diference does it make where u seat as long as u buy drinks or food. We got a 2x 1 coupon  in the strp before so we were gonna used it.

We sat at the really unccomfortable bar, we asked the bar tender can we get the bloddy marys as 2for one n she said: oh no no bloody marys, can we get margaritas?? no not that either, in a arrogant tone, she wasnt friendly at all. We ordered two beers it was 9 bucks for two beers with a 2 for one coupoun,  r u joking???  So regular price for a beer is 9, geez all this for a place where u cant seat where u want, no friendly bartenders, never everrrrr coming back here is just a trendy bar with overpriced drinks n nothing special.
