Here's the 1. 2. 3...

1. Great Food. I love hot New Mexico style food. Good job.
2. They have a little brewery and make 3 house beers. Unfortunately, they're all shitty.
3. They could REALLY improve the service. No Bueno! 

We'll be back for the food. It might be take out next time though!

4-17-11 Update: Some asshole who was clearly affiliated with Arribas contacted me via private message to slam me for my review. I hope the yelp police find you and pull you off the site. More importantly, I hope more people read my review and stay away from this restaurant. Good Food folks, just get it to go! To Bryan L. and the rest of the gang over at Arribas....Go EFF yourselves! You get one star and NO more of my money!!!!!!! Learn how to work, Kid!
