I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.

On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect. 

An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right. 

I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!
