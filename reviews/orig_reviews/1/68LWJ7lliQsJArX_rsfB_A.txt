I never write reviews for restaurants but I want to warn everyone about this place. I am a food service manager and I watch every one that makes my food insane open kitchen because hand washing is super important when handling food. I have never visited a place with so many health violations. 
To start things off one guy coughed in his left glove. I looked at my husband and he saw the same thing and our eyes got really big. We couldn't believe that he just did that and didn't change his gloves. I was so hungry that I let it slide. He had zero contact with my food so it made me feel a little better. Still it was disgusting.
We sat down to eat and half way through our meal we started watching everyone on the line. I saw a girl in the corner by the chips putting a chip in her mouth WITH GLOVES ON!!! and didn't wash her hands and get new gloves. This is a big health violation! My husband and I continued to watch her and she did it again!!!! The same employee went to the dining room, got a drink (WITH HER GLOVE ON STILL) took a drink and I saw her lips touch her glove and went back to the kitchen and continued working (WITH THE SAME GLOVES ON). This is worse then going to the bathroom and not washing your hands. The same employee wiped her hair out of her face withe the same gloves as before and continued working. 
Lastly the person taking a phone order with her glove on returned to the line and continued working without washing her hand and changing glove. 
I am in shock that the health department hasn't seen any of these violations before. 
Even though they had great attitudes we will never return to this location.  It's unbelievable how the manager on duty wasn't watching this.
