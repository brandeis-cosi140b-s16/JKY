I really want it to like this restaurant I love  Mexican  food. But it was not what I expected to be the food took a long time to come out , we waited 30 minutes. Once we received the food it was not hot it was under cooked. It did not taste authentic  it tasted like it was old & it sat out for a while . My sisters stomach was in pain that entire night eating there. My enchilada was HORRIBLE. we will not be coming here again ever . worse so called Mexican food we have ever had.
