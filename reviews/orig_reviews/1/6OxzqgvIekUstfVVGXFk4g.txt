I was looking forward to trying this place. We walked in and asked if we needed to wait to be seated or grab a table ourselves. The bartender was pleasant and told us to grab a table. Both servers working saw us sit down, someone brought us water and menus and left. After 20 minutes waiting for someone to take our drink and appetizer order, we asked if we should order at the bar or if a server comes to our table and we were told we had a server. Again, no one stopped by while visiting with and caring for the other 3 tables seated with guests. A table say next to us and were greeted and waited on immediately getting their drinks and appetizers on the table while we waited another 10 minutes. The servers both ignored our efforts to get their attention. We left and went elsewhere. Horrible service...obviously can't comment on the food/drinks.
