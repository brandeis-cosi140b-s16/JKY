I've been here a few times in the past. It was decent food, quick and easy for a school night. However, the last time I went here will be the last the last time I ever go again! I took an order of the chips and salsa to go. About half of the container of salsa gone. I notice a broken rubber band floating in it. Absolutely disgusting! Nope! Nah uh never again. Don't eat here people.
