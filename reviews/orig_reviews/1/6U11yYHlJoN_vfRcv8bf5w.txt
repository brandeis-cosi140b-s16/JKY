I tried all of their meats, nothing too impressive. Their fish taco was pretty gross, and the pork was bland. I do, however, enjoy their veggie offerings. Always fresh and good. Green salsa is my fav. 

I am also nervous of a place that is FILLED with flies, and this place is BUZZING with them.... Seriously gross.
