Yesterday we had a group of almost 20 people at the upstairs bar. I have never been treated so rude. The female bartender was so miserable and did not want to do her job. I asked for a Yuengling draft...she said they were out and walked away. Then I had to get her attention again and ordered a Blue Moon draft and she said we don't have it in draft, its not even up there (pointing to the drafts). It was clearly labeled with the other draft beers. Again she walked away. My friend then ordered a Margarita and she glanced down and said they don't have any glasses for it AND WALKED AWAY AGAIN without asking what else she could get us. When I asked her if she was making the drink she practically yelled saying "I TOLD YOU WE HAD NO GLASSES". Another bartender came over to us and I ordered a Blue Moon draft and he got it for me with no problem while I watched other people drinking Margaritas. I was so disappointed in the service and disrespect we received. I liked the bar but will never recommend it because of that one bartender
