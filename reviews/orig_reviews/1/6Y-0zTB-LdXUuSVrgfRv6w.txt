My first experience with this place was during the first week of June.  I went there with a friend of mine for a quick afternoon drink.  The service was terrible, the bartender was about as friendly as rabid pitbull, and the drink was overpriced and stale.  We literally were two of maybe five people in there at the time.  

My second experience was on a Saturday night at the end of July.  I was literally as excited about standing in the 25-minute line as I am about turning 50 in a couple decades and staring down the barrel of a colonoscopy.  I could not put in to words what I thought about the clientele of this place.  Wannabe gang-bangers seemed to be the main clientele followed by guys in glittery shirts and fake diamond laced pants.  

I was in this place for about 45 minutes.  I have to admit, the music was good and the drink service was above average for the whole Westgate scene.  But, after seeing testosterone filled thugs trying to fight with everyone seemingly just trying to have a good time and being pushed by some guys on the dance floor, it was time to leave.  

I haven't been back since and don't intend to.  The place seems to attract drama and, unless this is an afternoon on NBC, I don't need that place in the Days of My Lives!
