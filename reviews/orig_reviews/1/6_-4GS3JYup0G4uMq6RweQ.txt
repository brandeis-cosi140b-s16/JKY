Ok, I get it that everyone is excited you finally opened.
We (party of 5) came in today for Brunch.
After asking two waiters 3 time for water and half way thru my meal, I finally got water.  I also asked our waiter for the habanero sauce which I had to remind him again half way thru my meal.  After paying our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the Bar where I stood for over 5 minutes while the Bartender and servers watched the game ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no service.  I finally said in a loud voice to the Bartender. Quit watching the game and get me our drinks. This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.
