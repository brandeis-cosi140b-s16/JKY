Stopped in on a Saturday at 9pm. Acoustic guy in the bar with about 12 people in the whole place.  We must have been blending in with everyone because it was 20 min before someone came and took our drink order, ONLY after we flagged him down.  My girls margarita was weak, so she asked for another shot, that was completely forgotten about, AGAIN, we had to flag down the bartender. 
The bar staff is VERY focused on the regulars sitting at the bar, we seemed like a burden to the staff.  On a positive note, he did comp the extra tequila shot,  but had to flag him down for the check when the acoustic guy started playing old 70's TV show themes.....TIME TO GO!!!
