Great little restaurant. Service was slow, which is forgivable in a small establishment. But then the food came out. It was hot, looked delicious... so we dig in. The chipotle was so strong that the food was essentially bitter. Perhaps just my personal palette, but my girlfriend didn't enjoy her Chimi either, she said it was really greasy. The Creme Brule was good though. Not horrible, but we didn't like the food. Pity, it's a cute place.
