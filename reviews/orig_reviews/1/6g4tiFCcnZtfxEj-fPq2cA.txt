Horrible sante de salad.  A huge amount of sour cream mixed with seemed to be old caramelized onions and lettuce.  No cheese.  Super dry crumbly strips of chicken breast that at first I was upset that there weren't more but after tasting the first one I was glad there were only four.  The only good thing was the guacamole.  Waiter and service was good.  I could only eat a part of this salad and still needed protein so we had to eat at another place after this.
