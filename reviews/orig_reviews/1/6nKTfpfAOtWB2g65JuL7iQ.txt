Came here for dinner with my family, it was a 35 minute wait so we decided to take a table outside since there were heaters and we didn't want to wait.

Once we were seated it took about 20 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our drink orders.

Next the waitress spilled my dad's drink all over the table and my sister and I.  

Also, the outdoor heaters kept turning off every 10 minutes and we had to keep requesting they be turned back on.

The waitress from the next table over had to keep helping us because our waitress was clearly struggling.

I used to really like this restaurant, however after this experience I don't think I will be returning due to the poor service.
