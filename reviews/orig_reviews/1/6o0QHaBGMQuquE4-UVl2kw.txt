Horrible experience here! Stay away! Got our entire to go order wrong and had to wait 20 minutes after i got there which was 10 minutes after phone call for the food we were looking forward to but never got. Crappie food for the wait. Friends had eaten here before and recommend to us. Placed order by phone and prepaid by cc. Got there and had to wait cuz they forgot one order. Ordered beef tacos combo but got bean n no combos. Went down from there and not very good food anyway. Will never go back and hope my friend got his money back since we never got what we ordered.
