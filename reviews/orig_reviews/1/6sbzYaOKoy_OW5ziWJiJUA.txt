Today was to be lunch at Lenero's after church.  I never ate there but the rest of the family had and they had very good things to say about the food and the service. When we walked in, we were not greeted but the sign said to seat ourselves, so we did.  We waited for menus/water/chips.  We waited.  And we waited.  Finally we got chips and salsa (both very good) and we hunted down our own menus.  We ran out of chips and salsa and waited.  And waited some more.  My bro-in-law went to hunt down a waitress.  He found one and got very little response, so he very nicely offered to help bring water to the table.  She said she would be there soon.  She was not.  As we waited more, a couple was seated, got menus and did their order.  Before us.  Why did we wait so long?  Such a great question.  I think it was cognitive dissonance-the last time everyone was there it was so different, so the thought was maybe we were just hitting the timing wrong.  Until the other couple got service before us.  We finally realized we were being stupid for staying and got up to leave.  As we walked out someone said "thanks for coming in"--did they realize we never ate? 

Maybe this was a fluke.  Maybe this has never happened before (except reading some of the other reviews, I think this is more the norm).  Businesses need to understand that customer service is important, maybe even more important than presentation and taste.  I give Lenero's a ZERO for customer service, the one star is for the chips and salsa.  

Will I be back?  Nope, unless there is some compelling proof that things have changed.  Are you listening Lenero's?
