This is one of the most disappointing lunches I have ever encountered. Let me tell you why. 

The menu was clear and seemed to have a good selection so I got the veggi burrito and my friend got the fish tacos (baja). The prices were good so we were pleased until we got our food, chips are not included not a big deal so we went back up and waited in line to buy some. 

The salsa if that is what you want to call it was really tomato sauce I think, bland and flavorless and all the tops on every bottle were super dirty so I did not even want to try it but I just opened a bottle up and poured some out to avoid the yuk on top of the spout that had obviously not been cleaned in some time. 

My 'veggie' burrito was watered down beans (slightly warmed) with a bunch of wet lettuce inside and a little bit of cheese. My friend's 'baja' tacos were some frozen fish sticks in a couple of taco wraps with some soggy lettuce on top and the baja sauce was actually tartar sauce! 

When we tried to explain the problem to the people at the counter they hardly spoke english and did not seem to care so we will not be back. 

p.s. they don't seem to clean the soda fountain either it was sticky dirty when we went to get our drinks and I found it quite disgusting. and just so you know we went for an early lunch it was only 11:30am.
