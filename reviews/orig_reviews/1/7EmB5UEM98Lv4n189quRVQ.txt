Not as good as we expected. We started out with the margaritas, and although they were okay, they weren't worth the $13 price. I missed the people passing out drink coupons!

Unlike other Mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are not free and cost $4 here. It came with 3 different salsas, but they were extremely mild without any heat at all. We did ask for a spicier salsa, which they brought out at no extra charge. But all of the salsa containers were very small.

We ordered the beef and shrimp fajitas. When the food came out, there was hardly any meat and only 3 shrimp. At least the beef tasted okay, and the shrimp was flavored wonderfully. The flour tortillas were disappointing- part of them were stale and completely inedible. Beans and rice were not included and also cost extra. The rice was hard and undercooked, and the beans didn't have much flavor. It wasn't worth paying $5 extra for food that they couldn't even cook properly. 

Our server did a nice job. She was very attentive, even though they were busy. Too bad the food and drinks were overpriced and didn't measure up.
