12 adults & 2 kids under 10 years. Reservations, arrived promptly, seated promptly w/menus & chips.

WAITED 4-EV-ER for service. Finally able to order drinks. WAITED. Drinks came. BAD DRINKS. 'Ritas - WEAK, very little mixer, hardly any booze. Draft beer - foamy. Iced tea - watery. Ice water - flat.

WAITED to order food. WAITED for food. FINALLY 11 meals arrive, including 1 kid meal, not the 2nd kid meal. Our 2nd kid almost breaks out in tears seeing "everyone" but her get food. Really? Don't you know to prioritize the kid meals? Even if it is - oh, no - a HAMBURGER & FRIES? 

10 mins later #12 & 13 arrive. 10 mins later #14 shows up (Whoa - Steak Tacos!) 

Meals were lukewarm & bad. Mine was the House Specialty, the shredded beef chimichanga. It was soggy, w/mix of shredded beef & CHICKEN. I had plenty leftover & DID NOT ask for a doggy bag.

Meal #14 asks for a discount due to her meal arriving 20 mins late. Manager comes over, comps meal #14, discounts 2 other tickets of other people who complain. BUT DOES NOT DISCOUNT ALL THE TICKETS or otherwise take our issues seriously. 

Tells us they were backed-up cause "a 50-person wedding party came in tonight". 
Excuse me, but 50-person parties don't just arrive unannounced on a restaurant doorstep. They make reservations. Management is then expected to PLAN for extra staff & food for the big party, not to accommodate the party at the expense of the other customers.

There IS no excuse for the bad drinks. Simply none. 

This is all due to BAD MANAGEMENT. It is not a bad waiter, a 50-person party, a new cook. It is bad management. Period. End of discussion.

Yoghurt Time would have been better.
