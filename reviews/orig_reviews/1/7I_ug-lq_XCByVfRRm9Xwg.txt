We ordered a fresh white peach margarita and it tasted Iike sugar syrup.  Not much peach flavor - only sugar. The veggie enchiladas had absolutely NO flavor- and they were very oily. The rice was a bit dry and crunchy. The chips on the table were greasy and flavorless.  The price for this was $31 before tip and the quality of $5 street food.
