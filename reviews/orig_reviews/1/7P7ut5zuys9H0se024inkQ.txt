I used to love it here when we moved to the area 2 years ago. But recently something has changed. Our last few visits, we haven't been super happy with the service or the food. So tonight I begged my husband to go and told him I'm sure it would be different and they'd be as good as they used to be! But I was way wrong! It was a bad experience from the get go. The staff had less personality than a wet rag, the ice tea dispenser was empty and when we got home with our order (I had ordered the salmon bowl) there was no slaw on my salmon. So it was just rice and salmon. My fault for not checking before we left but still... Also the salmon and rice was like eating a salt lick! I've never had anything like it before! So needles to say my husband got to say I told you so and I was disappointed. We won't be going back.
