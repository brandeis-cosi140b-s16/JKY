FOOD POISONING! This place gave me, my 8 month old son, mother in law, and sister in law food poisoning the night before thanksgiving. We all had different plates with different proteins, so this is likely not the case of contaminated food from a distributor. Most likely some dirty line worker not washing their hands. Thanks for ruining thanksgiving.
