It's very hard to understand why this place gets good reviews. I've eaten here twice in the last year, and have actually been very disappointed both times. I was dragged along with work mates - not my choice.
If this makes me sound like a food snob then so be it, but I guess I have higher expectations than the other diners.
The first time I ate here, the metal plate they serve food on had dried food that made it look like the plate had not been washed properly. The second time the beans were hard and dry around the edge which made it look like they had been sitting there long before the tacos were added. Whichever explanation is the right one, it's VERY BAD to see dried food on your plate.
When I ate there yesterday the smell of backed up sewer as I approached the bathrooms was pretty bad.
Overall, a terrible dining experience and not cheap either - $10.50 for 3 chicken tacos. Sure it's not expensive, but I expect better quality for that price.

There are way better Mexican restaurants.
