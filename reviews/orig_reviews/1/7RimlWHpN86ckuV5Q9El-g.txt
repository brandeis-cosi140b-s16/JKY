Been there a couple of evening and sat out on the patio area where the waitresses ignore you until you jump up and grab one even though she run ever table around yours. She wont even look at you when you wave at them. Had to go to the inside bar to order drinks instead and me snd my friend got sick drinking the overly sugary daiquiri and long island. Had to leave early after feeling sick but did finally wave down a waitress and get some chips.
