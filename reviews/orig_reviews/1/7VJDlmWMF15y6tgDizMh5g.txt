Went here to grab a beer and some food before heading to a movie. The location and atmosphere are great which makes it very appealing. However, the complements end there. The service was terrible and it took ages to get a drink at the bar. When I and another order their half off appitizers during happy hour on a busy day they were served mildly warm and most likely had been under a heater for quite some time. How hard is it to make fresh nachos and quesadillas!

Considering that they are located in a large outdoor shopping mall there are much better alternatives. Ive been to Cadallac Ranch across the walkway and it was exactly the same dining concept with similar prices and specials expcept with much better service and food.
