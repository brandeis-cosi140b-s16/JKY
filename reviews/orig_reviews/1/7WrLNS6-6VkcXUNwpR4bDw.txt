Never Again! Horrible customer service! Took my nephew and his wife here on 5/31, everything was great until the waitress dropped our whole order right by our table.... It was an accident so of course we understood... The part that irked me was the lack of customer service.... The manager  never came over, not even the waitress.... Until our food was ready again then she informed me the manager can give us 10% off. Whatever. That's fine. But no apology, no service, no refills on chips or drinks after the waitress dropped our food. This place is going downhill and I won't be back!
