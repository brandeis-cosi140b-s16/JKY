This is possibly the worst "mexican" restaurant I have ever eaten at! Thankfully my fiance and I had our entrees comped as part of a show we were seeing, but even then I felt ripped off by what we did pay for (chips, salsa, guacamole, a margarita, and jalapenos in one of our burritos). There was zero spice, heat or flavor in any of the food, with no peppers in anything except the jalapenos we'd ordered, but even those had been deseeded and washed so they had no spice at all. There was only the barest hint of cilantro in the salsa, and the guacamole was essentially just mashed avocado with a pinch of diced tomatos and white onions thrown in. The burritos were poorly wrapped, falling apart immediately, and poorly assembled, with only a dollop of sour cream and guacamole in the very center of them, so the dominant flavors were of essentially unseasoned rice, beans and meat, the salsa only adding texture with no flavor or kick. The margarita tasted and felt like it had no tequila in it as well. We asked if they had spicier salsa and they did not. All in all this was the blandest, most unsatisfying mexican meal I have ever had, and it was vastly overpriced; the only positive thing I can say is that it was warm and took up space in my stomach.

Also, they have a "California Burrito" on the menu which is a lie; theirs is merely a vegetarian burrito, not an actual California Burrito which is a carne asada burrito with the works and fries inside.
