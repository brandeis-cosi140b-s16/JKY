Went there last night on a Monday night 9p. Asked hostess for a table for a quick bit to eat. There were plenty of empty tables in the dining room but she said there would be a 15 mins wait cause the servers are swamped right now. I noticed empty seats at the bar and asked if that was open seating. So we grabbed 2 seats at the bar. Took a little while for bartender to get to us. It wasn't that busy. There's about 20 seats at the bar with 3 bartenders and 1 Barback.  We asked food menu for quick appetizers.  Bartender came back after about 5 min took our food our. We ordered ribeye tacos and lobster tacos.  $12 per order for 3 small street tacos. Bartender took our food order and then disappeared.  Didn't offer us water or asked if we wanted a cocktail.  We finally got the other bartender's attention and asked for water. After about 10 mins our tacos arrived. It was suppose to come with chips n salsa. We asked 1st bartender for chips n salsa. He said he'll check on it. We started to eat the tacos. They looked really good. Very disappointed with these over priced street tacos. The tortilla was cold. Ribeye was over cooked and cold. The lobster was deep fried but it was cold. Everything was bland. Oh and we never got our chips n salsa. We asked for the check. It took quite awhile for bartender to get us our check also. It wasn't busy but bartender seemed overwhelmed.  Overall very disappointed with service and quality of food. Most likely won't ever return or recommend to anyone.
