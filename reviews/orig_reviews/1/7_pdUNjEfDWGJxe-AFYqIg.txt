I have had 3 bad experiences at this place of business. I walked in to make a complaint and called twice. No one cares! heads up.
the problem I had on the first occasion was not only was service slow but the waitress considered children (4 & 1 1/2 years of age) adults , charging an automatic % for 6 persons. One of the children wasn't even sitting at table or high chair  Charged for adult drink for child's drink , the children were not crying or a problem. it was late afternoon &slow as well as the service. I met my family there didn't know there was a problem so I paid the full amount & didn't look at bill just handed son a hundred.
I went in upon finding out what happen(since my office is at the Waterfront to let the manager know) the manager(behind the bar, heard my story and ask me , "what do you Want me to do?" 
told since my family has had restaurants , I want give the owner another chance. Went in order, grilled chicken dish, salade, 2 cocktails and tacos. Service bad, slow, attitude, food cold. only 3 parties in restaurant.
Called in to speak to manager or ask owners name & email.when I said, I wanted to file a complaint ,email the owner, I was hung up on.

Bartender , manager has attitude, seems uptight and not friendly every time I have gone in , there are few customers.

BAD SERVICE,BAD FOOD , ATTITUDE IS TERRIBLE OR CHARGES CUSTOMERS..

I had given up when talking to persons in a class and they told me to use YELP.
