For starters, I was ignored upon entering the restaurant and standing (alone) in front of the hostess stand while the 2 kids working kept talking and doing god knows what.  I finally said, "Can I get a table?"  They said, Oh, I thought you were waiting for someone.  I guess I'm not allowed to eat a restaurant alone??
After 14 minutes of sitting and getting more frustrated, I stopped one of the 40 employees that had walked by my table ignoring me, if I could get some chips and salsa and a waiter.  A guy came (and seemed super annoyed) and dropped off a bean dip and mild salsa with chips.  I asked for hot salsa (as they normally bring you that) and he said, "you want hotter than this?"  (it was mild, and I guess being a white girl they assume I want tomato sauce? wtf??)  
I ignored it and ordered a sampler plate which was to have a taquito, mini chimi, mini taco, and a green tamale.  It took 35 minutes more just to get that and the place was DEAD.  I was so annoyed.  When the food arrived it was NASTY.  The tamale had been microwaved until it was hard and one of the ends was crunchy.  The taquito was covered in brown guacamole.  Yes, BROWN.  The mini taco appeared to have a bean/meat mixture.  The only thing edible was the mini chimi, and it was like the kind you get in the frozen food section at Fry's.  
I was so disgusted and tried to get the attention of someone, anyone.  I finally asked the hostess to get me someone and that's when my waiter came and said, "You wanted the check?  Here's your check."   I wanted to punch the dude, but I'm not a violent person.  Ok, maybe I am, but I know my bounds.  
I figured it was a fruitless effort to waste time explaining how bad they suck.  Because all of them suck and they wouldn't have comprehended it.  So, I paid my $16 bill and left.  For the last time.  I will NEVER go back to that sorry excuse for a restaurant!!!!!
