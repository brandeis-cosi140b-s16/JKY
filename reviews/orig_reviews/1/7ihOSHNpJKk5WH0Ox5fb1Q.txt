Worst service ever. Took 20min to get a server to our table.  I had to ask the bus boy where our server was and if we could get some water. She finally came by and took our order and left we waited another 15min and no chips or salsa. Meanwhile tables were getting seated next to us and recieveing chips and salsa as well as water.  Asked the server if we were going to get chips and salsa and she said "i think so".  We tried to give her some slack bc she had quite a few tables and that is just poor management skills.  She responded in attitude with "Its nothing new". We recieved our FOOD before our drinks and the chips and salsa when we were finished with our food? Finally we had to get our check and she told us if we wanted it taken care ofwe should do it at the hostess station which is where we asked for the manager.  
He was some young little condisending boy who had no idea what he was doing and just comped our drinks? Really when the service is that bad thats all you're going to do? He didn't care because they were busy... but I will Never coming back here again.
