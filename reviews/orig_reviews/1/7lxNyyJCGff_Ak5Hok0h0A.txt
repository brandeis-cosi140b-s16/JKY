Overpriced and not a good flavor on food!,...I eat at very good restaurants and I don't mind spending couple hundred dollars, but... $6 for a jarritos drink?!?!?!?!... No way!!!!...the soda is $.99 cents at the store, PLUS my friend got the runs from the chilaquiles..... I would never comeback or recommend it to any of my friends.
