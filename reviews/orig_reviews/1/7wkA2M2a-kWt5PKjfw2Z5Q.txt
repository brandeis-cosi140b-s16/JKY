OVERPRICED AND OVERSALTED CHINESE FOOD. The portion of the food here is half of what a normal portion ordered at a restaurant should be. Especially for the price?! If I get a $18 dish of meat, I expect to be full afterwards. We ordered four dishes to feed 5 people (family style) and we all left hungry and dissatisfied after eating here. The noodles we ordered was too salty (we each had one scoop of noodles since the portion that came out was so small). The soup was not savory/flavorful, almost bland. And the Mongolian beef that came out on a bed of romaine lettuce was also extremely salty and the lettuce was drenched in the overpowering vinaigrette.

DON'T COME HERE unless you want to leave hungry or super thirsty!
