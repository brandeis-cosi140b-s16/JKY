Went tonight for date night which we get maybe twice a year and service was bad from the start. After waiting forever for our food waitress finally came up and asked if she took our order cause she couldn't find our food. She then comes back and said it had been sitting up there and was cold so they'd make it fresh. Once it came out it wasn't even what I ordered, not even close. Ended up boxing my husbands to go and leaving with nothing for me. No credit for the bad experience or anything. Never had this happen there before. Was a disappointing night.
