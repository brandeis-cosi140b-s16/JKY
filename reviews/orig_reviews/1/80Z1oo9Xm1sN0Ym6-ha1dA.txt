Ordered grilled veg taco, veg burrito. It tasted like leafs and beans and they did not add cream, cheese, salsa nothing in it (no spice at all in Mexican food huh!). Didn't eat my food left the place after paying my bill. Will i recommend this place, LOL. One should try it to believe it. Probably was a bad day for me...
