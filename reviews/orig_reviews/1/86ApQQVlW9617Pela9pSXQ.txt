It was a lunch time, and I was starving. Z'tejas seemed to be the only quick option around, so we parked our car and got a table. 

The overall design of the place was not bad. The service was not bad (fake). Now the food... The food was bad-from the presentation, to the consumption part, was just bad. 

I had the Pork "tender"loin
The meat looked like it had been sitting in the Atlantic for a few years. The onions rings were the best thing in the plate, and I use the word "best" very loosely

My mother had the mahi... She compared it to, "A dried out version of what could've been" 

Z'tejas need to stop trying to do 20 things and focus on one type of food.
