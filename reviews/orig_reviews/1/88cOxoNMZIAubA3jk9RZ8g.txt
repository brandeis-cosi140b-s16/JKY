This place....Oh My.....
Well if you're a vegetarian...RUN. 
I got stuck at this place due to a corporate event my company hosted there. 
Let me say, how excited I was at the idea of Mexican food at the Christmas party. Then my vegetarian instinct kicked in when I got there....hmm....lets check for lard.
I asked the waitress who was going around...slowly I add but it was a busy night so maybe the service is faster when there isn't a huge event going on. (I'm thinking understaffed?....hoping?) Anyway, I was then informed that they cook their beans with bacon. What? Yes. Bacon. So there went the idea of a burrito, a tostada. Depressing. I ended up eating the very "ehh" chips (deep fried tasting and thicker than the typical chip. I'd venture to guess possibly flour chips?) 
I'm not a big drinker so the allure isn't there for the bar aspect. 
I will honestly never be back and from what the people who actually did eat there said I didn't miss anything.
