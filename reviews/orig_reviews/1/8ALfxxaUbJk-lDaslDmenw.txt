This place sucks with capital S!customer service is bad all bad, we walked out after sitting there for 15 waiting for the waitress to take our order, mind you the place was empty, after asking if we can still order breakfast she said a nope, "breakfast is till noon" is 12:10 the place is empty (scratching my head) but ok, she must of seen $$$ on the people who walked in because she didn't even bother to ask us for our order, she just left us there, food is over priced !! This place sucks!!
