Skip this place!  Service is terrible.  The place was empty except for one other table but we couldn't even get seated because everyone except the bartender was talking in the kitchen.  We could hear them in there but apparently they couldn't hear us (Hello?  Do we seat ourselves?  Anyone back there?)

After about 15 min. of waiting (with the bartender just starring at us the whole time) the single table of  people in the dinning room told us that they just seated themselves so they could at least get some drinks started (They ordered a few beers at the bar and then sat themselves down).  We waited another 15 min. but no one appeared to give us menus, say hi, or take our order...the bartender pointedly ignored us also as he was busy...  doing something...  We finally left without ever setting eyes on a hostess, a waitress or the menu.
