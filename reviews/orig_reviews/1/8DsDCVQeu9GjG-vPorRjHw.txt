I visited yesterday, but nobody served me and after me there were some White people, waitresses came up. It makes me so upset, but today, I  tried again, and exactly same as yesterday. I booked already, but nobody asked me even did you make a reservation or how many etc. Just ignored me. I never ever try here again.
