My husband and I ate here and the service was horrible, the wait staff seemed lost and the manager was worse..after our order was finally placed and we recived our food it was completely wrong..we ate very little of it we didnt want to return it to the kitchem and wait another hour before we got food. Needless to say we will not be going to this place again.
