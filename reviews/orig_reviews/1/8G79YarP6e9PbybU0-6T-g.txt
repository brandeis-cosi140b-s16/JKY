All I can say is that the reviews connected with this restaurant have to have been written by friends of the owner. If I could have given this place no stars, I certainly would have. Never had I had a more terrible dining out experience than at Valle Luna. I just arrived in Arizona from NY and took my family to dinner there. Six of us sat down to dine and we went to order. Last year I had the best chili relleno dinner here, so I asked for it again. Sorry ma'am, you have to have a taco instead of the two chilis! Why said I, I don't like tacos, can't you just charge me for a second chili. No substitutions! Just take off the taco and put on a chili, don't you want your customers happy? My granddaughter heard him mumble, for a price and for a price it was! Instead of charging me for one chili, they charged me for double chilis, beans and rice...18 bucks for two soggy cheese chilis! Where last year they were crisp and hot and delicious, this year they were two drowned out soggy cold messes lying mixed in with the beans and rice, drowned in tasteless watery sauce. I asked for the manager and Carlos, the manager came to tell me...tough! We have rules. We don't change things! I said don't you care about customer satisfaction? He said, we have rules! I said I guess you don't care about your customers and he shrugged. That says it all! Tasteless soggy food, nasty manager, greasy plates at the table, uncaring waiter..including the one who elbowed me as I left the restaurant. All this for 118 + dollars. Enter at your own risk! I'm sure there has to be better Mexican restaurants in the Chandler area, or at least ones that actually care about their customers.
