This is literally the worst food I've ever tasted. The beef, chicken, and shrimp in our tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas were super dry and tasteless. The lettuce salad mix they served on my tacos and tostadas looked like it came out of those prepackaged salad mixes. The carrot slaw on my taco was dry, it was white and flaky. The staff was friendly. This is the third time we dined here and we will never return. The food was bad to mediocre at best.
