My wife and I stopped in for dinner and margaritas. We were seated right away and served chips and salsa  from there we sat and waited and waited for our waitress to show up.  We ordered food and drinks together because we weren't sure how long it would take her to return. Good thing because she didn't come back until food was ready. 
I ordered the pollo fundido. The chicken had NO flavor and the cream cheese on the top was so thick you couldn't taste anything but cream cheese.  We will NEVER return!!!
