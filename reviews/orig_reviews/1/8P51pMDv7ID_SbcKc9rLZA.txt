NEVER HAD SUCH A NIGHTMARE DINING OUT EXPERINCE IN MY LIFE!! I planned 1 month a head of time my Bachelorette dinner, made reservations .. I was super excited! I arrived 25 mins late to my reservation (hard time catching cab)when we arrived they skipped us. Which is fine long as we get the next opening seating. We waiting over 1 hour and  I noticed people that had just signed in were being seating before me and my group. So I went to talk to the assist manager. Which was lady I asked why it was taking so long..  She gave me the worst attitude ever so I told her she was ruining my special day being that I was the bride to be.. She told me "WELL NEXT TIME DON'T BE LATE TO YOUR OWN PARTY" than walked away from me when I was talking. I was livid!!!! I seriously wanted to slap her! I never in my life been treated so badly! So I complain to the Restaurant manager and told him how horrible that assistant manager was treating me, than he tells me the assitant manager was his wife!!!?? What the heck?? So obvi hes not going to reprimand her cause they're married. Total BS. The manager tried to make things right and got me a drink at the bar, but the damage was already done. My party didn't want to wait any longer at another restaurant so we just stayed. By the time we sat and eat we had waited over 2 hours.

 You would think I get best service being that it was my bachelorette party but no. 
 Totally ruined and put a damper on my night.
Worst experience ever!! I tried to find a corporate number to complain but couldn't fine one..

HATE JAVIERS
