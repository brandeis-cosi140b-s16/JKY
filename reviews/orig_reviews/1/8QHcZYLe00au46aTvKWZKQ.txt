Food poisoning, stay away!!

I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and completely regretted it that evening and the entire next day. 

We should've known better since the menus handed to us had an entire meal left on them. Completely unsanitary and disgusting. 

We went to get our money back which they refunded us only half the bill. When we told them what I ordered, their response was "Yeah, the mole sauce is bad sometimes." Umm, are you kidding me?!

Only a matter of days before the Health Department shuts this place down.
