We ate at this restaurant twice. The first time we had reservations which apparently means that when you arrive all of the tables will be full and you will wait 30 minutes to be seated in the bar area. The manager apologized and asked us to return. He talked about their Sunday brunch when we said we would be uptown again on Sunday (2 days later). So we gave them another try Sunday. Although we were seated immediately, a waiter did not acknowledge us for 10 minutes. When we finally tried to order we were told that they were not doing brunch today and that we could only order off of the dinner menu. I do not plan on returning.
