Is there a "zero star" option?  Got a chicken taco plate with rice and beans.  Chicken was cold and hard and there was a piece of aluminum foil in the rice.  When i asked for the taquila menu I was handed a salsa menu and the bartender walked away for about 5 min.  Awful experience here.  Wouldn't reccomend it!
