Terrible DJ. Watered down drinks. Extremely poor service. On a slow night we had to walk the restaurant to find our server and he hadn't been back in 25 minutes. The reviews on here are spot on. Great location, but you wonder if there is even a manger here. 

We ordered the brownie for dessert and it might have been the worst restaurant brownie I've ever had. Literally tasted like they took it out of the freeze, unwrapped it and put it on our table. After we paid the bill ($53 for 3 small, watered down drinks and a brownie) our server said he'd take it off the bill (there was one bite gone after an hour) but then couldn't remove it because he said he ran the card already. 

Don't come here.
