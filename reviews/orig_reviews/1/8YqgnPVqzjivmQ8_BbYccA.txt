I hate this place so much. I only come here because my coworkers like it. Every time we wait in line AT LEAST 30 minutes before we get our food. Every employee is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know how they can keep track of whose order is whose; I can't even follow my own plate. My food is always very wet and messy from not draining the meat juice which makes it harder to eat and enjoy. I don't know if every location is like this, but I now dislike all Cafe Rios. This restaurant would be much better off as a sit down place with waiters. That way I would expect a 30 minute wait for my food, instead of standing in line for it.
