I came to Carolina's with high hopes.  I've heard so much about the location downtown that when I heard there was a location in my area - I was stoked.

I ordered a burrito with beans, cheese, green chile and eggs.  I opened it to devour and the tortilla was so sopped with moisture that it completed fell apart.  I ate it as I could.  The potatoes tasted like the ones you get in the can, the eggs were watery and the beans weren't there.  Someone behind the counter charged me extra but failed to follow through.

I will say that their tortilla with butter is good - but what ISN'T good when drenched in butter.  For good tortillas, go downtown to Glendale and go to La Purisima...don't waste your time with Carolinas.
