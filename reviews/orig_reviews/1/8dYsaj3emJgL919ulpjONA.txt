The service was inexcusable. As a foodie and promoter of both Meat & Potatoes and Butcher & the Rye, I was incredible excited to try this new hot spot during my recent visit back to the Burgh. I was delighted when we called and learned that there was no wait.  Long story short, we ended up leaving after a steep bar bill and the incompetent hostess inability to seat a simple table of three.
