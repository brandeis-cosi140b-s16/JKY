We came here prior to running the Vegas marathon thinking we could get our fill of carbs and grub on something original... Nope.

The menu is overpriced and the portions are atrociously small. It's a shame because the food is actually decent and the service was great- but come on guys, you're feeding humans. Barbie would spend a small fortune here and still leave hungry.

Skip it and head to the silver spoon buffet down the hall instead- you'll get twice the amount of food at half the cost.
