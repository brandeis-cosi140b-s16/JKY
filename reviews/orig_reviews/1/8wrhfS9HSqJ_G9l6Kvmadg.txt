I just walked out of this establishment. I have worked in this industry for 7 years and I have never been treated as if my Buisiness did not matter. My Roomate had called in a Togo soup because she is feeling under the weather so I went to grab it for her... Show up and have been waiting 6 minutes before someone even acknowledges that I'm there. The girl (not sure of her name but she had awful skin completion) had helped me and told me I needed to wait 15 minutes longer for a BOWL OF SOUP!!!! I know a bowl of soup does not take 15 minutes to prepare. So I asked if because it was a soup if it would take less time and she said she would grab it and so I paid. Then she says I still have to wait... So instead of honoring her word of grabbing my soup I had asked for a refund. I will no longer be dining with cafe rio and I will no longer recommend them over chipotle as I have in the past.
