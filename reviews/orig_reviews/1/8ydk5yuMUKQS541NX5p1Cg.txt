We REALLY, REALLY wanted to love this place. This could have been a great little find...BUT: The only way this place gets a 5 star review would be if the review was only based on beer selection, simply for the fact that they serve Victoria beer, which is rare outside of Mexico. That was a GREAT surprise. However, it's not served COLD ENOUGH. It was barely chilled and then poured into a warm glass right out if the dishwasher, I presume. 

Guacamole appetizer is VERY small, might as well have been a side of guacamole. No flavor to speak of, and no jalapeños or seasoning to speak of. Just a mashed avocado for $9. Salsa was bland and boring as well. Nothing worse than watered down flavors, obviously catering to the American Taco Bell palette. 

The tacos really earned 1 star. We were expecting authentic Mexican food, and instead we get a hipster spin on tacos. Cold tortillas with hard curled edges, weird flavors. We ordered three different tacos: carnitas, shrimp and chicken. I had one carnita taco (was it sautéed in soy sauce?) and a bite of the shrimp. Couldn't bring myself to try the chicken tacos, they smelled odd and the meat was dry and covered in a sauce. My friend are them anyway because wasting food is a sin. Cooking like this is a bigger one! 

Got talked into dessert because I was still hungry after not eating the tacos and guacamole. Bread pudding churro thing...it was ok. 

Our service wasn't up to par either. At least be able to pronounce the items on the menu, but not being familiar with what is on your menu is a problem. 

Overall, the patio is great if you stick to just beer or drinks. We will be back to enjoy the patio and Victoria beer, but never ordering food here again. No bueno.
