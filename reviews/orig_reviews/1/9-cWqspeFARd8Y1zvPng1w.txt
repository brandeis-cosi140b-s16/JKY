Horrible service along with over priced, horrible tasting food. The only reason why we went there was because my children's school had a fundraiser and we wanted to support. We will never return again. The server dropped our plates on our table with a horrible look on his face and didn't say one word to us. We had to beg for utensils and napkins well after our food was served. It wasn't even busy the day we went. Beans tasted like they came right out of the can and the rice was just gross. The only thing decent was the chips and salsa.
