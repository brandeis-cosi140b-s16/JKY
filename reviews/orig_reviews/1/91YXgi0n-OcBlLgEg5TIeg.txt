We came in here at 10:55pm, 
First of all, don't look at customers all confused when they walk in. The restaurant was empty, and they were starting to close but yelp says they close at 12? So I asked, and yes it was 12.
We felt a little awkward , but decided to stay. Bad idea.... 
We ordered tacos and we can see the cook from the seat we were in, and he looked kinda pissed off when the order went through. Actually he looked REALLY pissed off. Next time, stand AWAY from the dining room so we can't see you nodding your head and bitching as you read the ticket.. The blonde waitress is kind of rude & has a bad attitude.
Honestly the food wasn't even worth it. Bland and tasteless.... 
Never going back.
