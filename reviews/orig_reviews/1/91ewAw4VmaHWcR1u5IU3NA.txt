I had tried before my husband and I went. It was about 10:30pm on a Thursday night. The hostess sat us never mentioning that the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. What!!!' My husband looked at me and said he did not want to be rushed and said don't they close at midnight? I agreed. Our server informed us after trying two unsuccessful to sell us alcohol. We don't drink that the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. We decided to leave. On our way out I told the hostess she should have told us about the kitchen closing. The back of the house should have told the front of the house. We won't be going back!
