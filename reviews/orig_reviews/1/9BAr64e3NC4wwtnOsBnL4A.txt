Warning: you will get scammed by their frozen drink bartenders. 

I'm not talking about the strength of the drinks which is also debatable. But what I'm talking about is an annoying pyramid scheme which my friends experienced while here this weekend. 

We were wandering around the Strip one afternoon when my friends wanted a frozen boozy slushy. Cabo Wabo was closest and decided to wait in line for it, myself included since I can partake in a frozen daiquiri from time to time. The bartender tried to sucker my friends into larger drinks than they wanted, and then poured in an extra shot of rum into their drinks without really getting confirmation. The spiel of the extra shot is that you get to spin a magic wheel with prizes on it--hats, free drinks, the like. The catch, which comes after the bartender pours her extra shot is that there is only one spin per group. I'm gonna throw the bullshit flag there. After my friend won a "Cabo shot" the bartender said "the bigger the tip, the bigger the show" at which point I said point blank to her face, "so basically it's a pyramid scheme so you guys get more money." She looked at my like I was a) right and b) a witch with a "b." 

This whole experience left me incredibly frustrated as a hostess and makes me dislike management and company policy for something so ridiculous.
