I'm going to get straight to the point, I love Cafe Rio, I think the food is great and the service is DREADFUL. However they have become so painfully cheap, ask for anything extra: dressing, sour cream, cheese, one extra tortilla, extra Pico everything is a charge! Come on when your customers are spending 15 bucks for lunch and asks for an extra side of sour cream, why  charge 60 cents... you just piss us off
