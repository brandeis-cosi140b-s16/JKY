I was there last night and I can say that I'm really disappointed. Being one of the best customers of Carlos' n Charlie's in Cancun, I expected the same quality. Sadly it wasn't; the food and the quality of the open bar is so low and cheap that I could only drank a half margarita. And it was all I had for the night. We asked for a refund of the Open Bar  -which they refused-  since we were not willing to drink more of that weird stuff they serve as alcohol. Instead we were offered a "comp real Bacardi" which it wasn't enough to make it up for it. We decided to go, I feel robbed.
