This place epitomizes the word overrated. 

The food was a bit too "fusion" for my taste. We ordered the scallops, grouper and duck confit, and all were underwhelming. Too many flavors going on, no cohesion. We also ordered the skirt steak tacos. The handmade tortillas were quite good, but the steak tasted smokey, almost like bacon. Nothing like I thought or was described. 

Our waitress seemed like she just started working there. Whenever we asked her questions, she answered awkwardly with hesitation. At the end of our meal, she didn't ask us if we liked the food. I'm surprised that she is working in fine dining. Seems like she would be better fit at a sports bar.

Maybe I am spoiled from living in Portland, but, overall, I would not recommend this place.
