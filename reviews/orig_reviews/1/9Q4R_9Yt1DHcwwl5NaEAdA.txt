We get to the restaurant before leaving and they first tell us that the wait is 20 minutes. We go to the bar to sit and drink some WATER and food & they kick us out Because I don't have my ID. Yet, to state law in Nevada you are aloud to stay in a bar section if they serve food at this hour. I would understand if I went to order alcohol but it was strictly water & instead of going far to get my purse from the car I decided to wait because they told us that it is 20 minutes. We wait outside for 30, then after asking 3 times if the table is ready and getting now more snotty attitude from now not only the bartender and now the hostesses, we finally get seated.
We get the option to sit inside or outside, thought that was odd coming from the fact of it being a 10 minute longer of a wait.
We choose inside and there is at least 8 empty tables. 4 of them being dirty our entire meal. The food was okay, but GETTING MY FOOD OUT BEFORE A SIMPLE GLASS OF WATER.. Is dumb. The guy next to us in a suit had a whole tray spill on him. It's been like 30 mins and the other people next to us haven't even got their drink order. I thought customer service was a good thing to get them to return.. But instead of saying it is all because of it being "busy" 
You should all say because we're lazy bitches who don't know how to clean a table or even check on their customers. 
IF I had the option to give it 0 stars. I would.
If you're at the convention at mandalay bay, save yourself and walk over to another restaurant . 
As I write this a bunch of glasses fall and break too. Haha.
