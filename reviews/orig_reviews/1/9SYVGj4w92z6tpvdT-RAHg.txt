My mom and I went there for happy hour. We ordered the tableside guacamole.  It was ok. Nothing special. When we received our bill, they not only tried to charge us full price for our drinks, they tried to charge us for premium liquors we never ordered. We had to call a manager over to fix it. They tried to overcharge us by $30. I will never go back here.
