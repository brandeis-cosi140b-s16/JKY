Decoration are very dusty.  Bathroom was not very clean.  After waiting for  1 hr for menudo, finally had enough of waiting.  Went to ask what was taking so long.  Informed that "menudo was not ready".  Checked their health department grade and they got a "c".  Will not be eating that menudo after all.
