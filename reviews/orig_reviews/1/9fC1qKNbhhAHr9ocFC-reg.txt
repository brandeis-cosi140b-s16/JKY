Can you give no stars??? The food was horrible, the "blended" margaritas were like crappy Slurpee's devoid of any liquor or flavor, just ice. The owner and staff openly eat their shift meals in front of customers, letting the service time suffer. We went there a couple of times to see if it was a fluke but no, the owner was yelling at staff when we walked in, and we waited over half an hour for service and finally left. Maybe if the owner wasn't so busy making his staff feel useless we might have gotten some service. DO NOT GO HERE!  If you have a hankering for Mexican food, go to taco bell! It is a huge step up in quality!
