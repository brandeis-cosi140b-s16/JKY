This was awful. I never write bad reviews but this was unacceptable. The service was extremely slow, it took an hour and a half to get appetizers out alone. When food did come out our waitress said "I hope this was worth the wait".  It was not. When the main food came out it was cold, covered in salt and bland. I do not recommend this place to anyone. We sat at the bar and we saw when they took dirty glasses, they dipped them in water and then reused them. What is going on at this restaurant? Stay away!
