I feel I tried enough menu items to not visit this place again.

The chicken has almost no flavor and is covered with cold cheese & lettuce.
The pork was a little bit better, but you're better off going for their breakfast menu.

The people that work there are nice, the ambiance is great, but when it comes down to it, I don't think the food is worth skipping other restaurants for.
