Used to be a great place to get an after hours burrito.

After seeing the video of the chest-pounding, knuckle dragging bouncer pummeling some patron, we've x-ed Dos off our list.

We'd rather eat at the crappy Philly cheesesteak place or even pay Mickey's ridiculous--"wanna-be night club"--cover for late night eats . . .
