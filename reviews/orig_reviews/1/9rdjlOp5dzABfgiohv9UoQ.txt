Do not eat here believing you will be receiving anything close to the deliciousness as the original Los Dos Molinos (South Mountain location) . 

For the price I expect better quality food.  I'd rank this place no higher than a 24hr fast food drive thru.

Our beans and rice were at least 3 days old. 

The blue corn tortillas for the enchiladas were DYED, they were florescent green. The manager blew us off when we brought it to his attention.

 My beef tacos were 3/4 beans and topped off with a few shreds of beef.

 Last but not least the margaritas were awful, I'm sorry but I do not want orange juice in my drink.  How does a Mexican restaurant screw that drink up?
