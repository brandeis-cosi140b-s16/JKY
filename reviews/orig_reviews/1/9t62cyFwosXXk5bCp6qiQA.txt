The food was tasty but VERY overpriced. My sister ordered a margarita and they charged her $13.00 !!! Looking at the drink menu the next day on line they charged her for some ORGANIC margarita!! Really ??
She never even mentioned anything about organic anything ! The regular margaritas are 8 bucks !!! They saw us coming !
