Even with 3 stars we decided to give this place a try, big mistake. Food was mediocre at best, the $12 margarita was good but not so as to save this visit. Restaurant is actually nice, but they should consider revamping the menu or get someone running the kitchen that can actually prepare a decent dish. My advice look elsewhere to have a good Mexican dinner.
