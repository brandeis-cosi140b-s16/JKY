These idiots hate their job and make it a miserable experience to even go there. I wasn't even done telling them my order and they already moved on to asking the person after me what they wanted. I repeated what I wanted more than 5 times and they still didn't wana do it. It might as well be serve yourself buffet because these idiots don't want to do their jobs, are miserable all day long, and make the customers feel uncomfortable. Worst service ever shut this stupid place down already. People already got sick too many times. Losers.
