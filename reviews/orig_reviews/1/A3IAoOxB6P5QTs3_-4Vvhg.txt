Each year when visiting Las Vegas for a trade show we take a group of 15-20 to a special place for dinner the night before the show opens and this year based upon reviews we chose El Dorado Cantina which was a HUGE mistake. Place is not the cleanest, located next to strip bar in fact you think you are going into a strip bar until you get right up to the door and realize there are two entrances. We were seated in a private little room which was ok but as earlier stated not the cleanest, waiter was okay but just kind of there not talking up any particular dish or recommending any item. With the size group we had they gave us four baskets of chips which were gone in short order and when asking for more were told they cost $2.00 per basket which isn't much but I have never heard of this in a Mexican restaurant which normally gives unlimited chips. Now for the food not one person said their food was even great or even good in fact one person got extremely sick later and was unable to attend the show the next day,was it the food ? I can not say it was but several complained the next day of upset stomachs.  Bad food, bad service, bad location means I would not recommend it.
