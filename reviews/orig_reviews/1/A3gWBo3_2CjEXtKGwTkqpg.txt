A star because the food was good. The service was in all honesty the WORST service i have ever had and sadly my party tipped the awful waitress more than 20 percent when she deserved not a dime. She never checked on us..not even once when we were clearly out of water for over half an hour. So one of my party eventually got up and went to the waters station and took the water pitcher. We waited ourselves. The food was good but they couldnt even get it right which means not only did FOH suck at their jobs so did BOH. Manager came over and was sarcastic and giddy about how horrible the service was that he cracked a joke about it. All in all my out of town family was seriously disappointed and we will never return here. There are better Mexican food places in PHX for decent prices and better service. I advise EVERYONE to avoid this place and go somewhere authentic. Dont waste 8 dollars on a burrito with four things inside of it. Sorry staff but until you stop sucking youre losing my business.
