Today I went to the location on Centennial and Ann in Las Vegas, NV for the 2nd time.  The last time we went we had a very long wait and bad service but good food, so we thought we would give it another chance.  I guess shame on us.  We had a large party and the restaraunt wasn't busy.  We had to go to the bar to get our drinks because the price difference in the dinning room was unacceptable.  We ordered our food and it took about 45 minutes for half of us to get our meals and another 15 for a couple more to get theirs and then another half hour for two other guests to get their's.  Several of us ordered the Chimichanga which we ordered smothered and none of them came out right, my daughter asked after 15 minutes for her salad dressing and an hour went by before she got it.  One person sent her whole meal back and ordered something completely different and when it came the food was cold.  Then.....the Manager  Dawn came over to the table and spoke to the couple who did not have their food yet and said she was going to take care of their's and when I said really you should take care of the whole table because nobody's was right and she put her hand up to me and said "I don't hear you!"  then walked away.  The server Vicotoria, should be commended, it was her third day and she put the orders in correctly and she ran her ass off for us to try and make things right, but she couldn't go back and cook it too!  We asked for the Manager to come back to the table to talk to us and she wouldn't, she went by our table many times and kept her eyes in the other direction.  I can't believe this, it is acceptable behavior.  I don't know if the kitchen was just "hazing" the new girl or what but the Server Victoria was the only one who cared.  
 
I hope that you are more concerned than the staff at your restaraunt.  I want to say that I ate at On The Border in Maryland and it wasn't at all like this, but this one has 2 strikes and I don't think there will be a third attempt.
