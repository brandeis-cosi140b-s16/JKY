Over all not a bad place. Came here for my friends 21st. 
Everything was great untill they kicked me out for sopposedly being to drunk, i had 3 beers? 

All my friends were like what the fuck? Hes not even drunk. That bs. So ended up leaving pissed off cus oviously the people workin there are pansies and they think 3 beers is to much so yeah bunch of bs.
