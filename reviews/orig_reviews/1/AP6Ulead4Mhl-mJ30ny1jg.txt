I was out for a walk with my 2 kids and decided to grab dinner and take it home to eat. I ordered mahi mahi tacos and 2 cheese crisps (quesadillas). When I got home we sat to eat. My daughter who LOVES mandarin oranges refused to eat theirs cause she said they taste rotten, and the 1st 2 bites of my tacos I got 2 bones. One was about 2" long and pretty wide and the 2nd was 1/4" long. I ate the first taco and just didn't want to eat any more... 
I was so excited to try this place and now I have no desire to return!
