Absolutely gross-  I'm just going to be bluntly honest- who the F cares what the food tastes like when the place looks like a frickin' dump?  It was so disgustingly dirty inside. Besides food, paper, trash- resting among the carpet- the tables were dirty, the bathroom was out of service and I feared touching anything as I was led to my seat... that's a problem.

I've actually never seen such a messy restaurant before. Let me also say that the restaurant was empty when we arrived, and was filthy when we walked in and was filthy when we left. 

Obviously no one that works at this restaurant cares about cleaning up between seatings. There's no excuse for a place to be disgusting like this. It's downright unsanitary. You serve food Valle Luna, you're a business Valle Luna- keep the place clean for heaven's sake.
