I walked in to this place with a co worker and it is small, located in a strip mall.  I was offended that on the two walls were big flat screen tvs blaring Fox News Channel, loud and annoying.  I asked if they could turn the channel and was told no. that they can't.. I tried to turn the channel myself or even to turn down the volume and it was locked down.. so I turned off both tvs.  The food was average, I don't really understand the hype about the food, there are plenty of Mexican restaurants in the area that don't have a political agenda.  

No thanks, I won't be back.
