I am a pilot with an hour to kill before show time of my next flight. I opt to sit down and relax while I get some good Mexican food. That was nice. I order the $6 Jamaica. The waiter was very confusing when he called it the Jamaica flower water. I've never heard it called that way and it sounds more like a lightly flavor infused water like rose water or something ludicrous. Nope, the waiter just didn't know how Jamaica is made so it seamed normal to him to call it water and not more like sweetened iced tea of flore de Jamaica. Now that's out of the way I get the Arizona burrito. 
After a few minutes I down the Jamaica and the food comes out. It looks great  and I ask for a refill on the Jamaica.  There are no refills. The glass was a 12oz glass with 8oz of ice. That is $1.50 an ounce for Jamaica. Are these managers completely nuts? It was good but outside of Manhattan I've never ordered something so expensive. 
The burrito was very flavorful but again small for $13 then piled high with frozen steak fries. 
So $20.58 for a burrito and Jamaica later I'm out of here never to go back. There are many other great dining options here in sky harbor. No need to stop here unless you are not hungry and you don't care what things cost.
Note to the managers. An appropriate price for these would be $1.75 for the Jamaica (or have free refills) and $9 for the burrito. Out the door with tip $12.50. I was so overcharged by your prices that I did not include a tip. I hope you pay your waiters well
