Myself & family had horrible experience at this establishment. Bad service's not enough waiter/waitress. The food is no where nearly as good as Tempe location. This place is mostly enjoyed by non-locals that don't know Mexican Food. The employees pay better attention to non-locals (folks that are staying at The Point). I rather go to Tempe location which is much better. Never coming back to this establishment. Not recommended.
