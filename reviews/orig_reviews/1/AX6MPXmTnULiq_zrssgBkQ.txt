Terrible food. Its a total insult to mexican food. The place smells of wet mop year round. (I'm a flight attendant that walks by there at least 3 times a week.) The drinks are watered down and the alcohol in mixed drinks is of the cheapest quality. But for a town like Vegas where some people stay drunk throughout their visit this  might be the place for the indiscriminate bunch.
