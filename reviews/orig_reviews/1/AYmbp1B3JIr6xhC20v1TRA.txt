It won't let me give NEGATIVE stars! If you wanted their shrimp tacos today you had be there before 5pm. Also they ran out of rice. If this was the only time this happened I wouldn't be writing this negative review. This is the WORST cafe rio I know of. It's the only one that consistently runs out of food at an early hour. This happens so much that I will take the extra 10 minutes and go to the centenial center location. Really! This place sucks! No planning! How they stay in business is beyond me. It forced me to put one star to post this review.
