It's 10:45pm right now. Just got back from The Stand. They wouldn't serve me. Sorry to write this out (kind of a bummer)---but if you're thinking of a late-night burger, don't bother. They have no interest in serving you. I even called ahead and asked if they'd still make a burger and fries if I drove down. They said, "sure, we don't close 'til eleven.''" I drove down. One of the employees gave me some line about how the drive-thru closes at 10pm some nights. And, yeah...tough luck.

Wondering if the food's any good? Read Ryan J.'s review of 7/13. Because I wouldn't know.

In the meantime, find another late-night burger option.
