As my girlfriend and I entered Cabo Wabo, we spotted a cute, quiet table we interested in sitting at. As we were making our way over to the table, we were stopped by the hostess. 

Hostess: "Are you ladies looking for the bar?" 
Us: "Actually, we wouldn't mind sitting at that table over there..."
Hostess: "No, the bar is over that way."

And then we were escorted to the bar... which was full of low-lifes and drunken dudes. The smell was awful, the people were awful, the servers were awful. It felt like we were attending a "dudes fart party"

Why were we escorted to the bar? Why were we denied a table?
These questions will never be answered. 
We were assumed trash.

This place is nasty.
