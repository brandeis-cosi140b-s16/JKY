I really wish I could of gave this place 5 stars for there food, but I didn't get a chance to try it, the service was so horrible that we had to walk out, we where seated right away, but soon after that they completely forgot about us, took 10min for someone to acknowledge us, another family walked in after us and were given menus right away, meanwhile we are waiting for our menus, instead 5 min later they bright us chips, but still no menus we had to ask for them, 10min later they came and asked us what we wanted to drink, but we haven't received a drink menu either, the family next to us looked like they been sitting there for a while and still haven't ordered as well and looked frustrated as well, after 25min we decided to walk out.
