Here today and was treated so rude by a 40 something male bartender. 

What an idiot. Why are people mean?  There was not reason to be rude you could tell that he was often rude to people as other employee had their heads down. He was some type of manager probably sad about how his life turned out so he treats people rude because there is nowhere else to go in the airport. 

If you can avoid it do not go here
