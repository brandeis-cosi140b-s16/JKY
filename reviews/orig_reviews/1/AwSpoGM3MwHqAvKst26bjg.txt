BEWARE!!! My husband and i both had a few bites of the steak from there and it didnt taste right so we stopped eating it. (That is the only thing we both ate the same that day). We both ended up with horrifying food poisoning for 2 days. I am pregnant so of course i am extremely scared and mad. Still have yet to get the little one checked out... but hopefully the baby is okay. PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE! I feel like i died for 2 days and am finally coming back to life.
