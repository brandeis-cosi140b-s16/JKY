Went there last night. Was not greeted, had to search for an employee to ask if we seat ourselves or wait. The one & only employee/host/server/waiter/cashier/busser was not polite. Told us to give him a second....Had a pissy attitude. Alot of other customers were sitting but had no drinks or food at their table. Everyone inside looked confused. Stood for about 10 mins waiting for him to seat us. Energy inside the whole place felt off, so we walked out.
