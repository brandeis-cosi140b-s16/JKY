Surprised to see the place was half empty after we waited 15, 20 minutes.  Why did they make us wait? Next time they make you wait, you should ask to check inside the restaurant and see if how many empty tables there are.  I should've turned and gone to the coffee house or the buffet but I trusted the yelp reviews for some reason and made a mistake of staying here for food.
Mediocre food at best. Tortillas that came with fajita were hard to chew and too think.  Drinks were bland.  Chips were not crisp.  Pork stew was so salty.  Steak Fajita was a-okay.  I was not so picky because I was extremely hungry and about to to pass out.  But the worst thing was the wait. Don't eat here. U will regret for sure.
