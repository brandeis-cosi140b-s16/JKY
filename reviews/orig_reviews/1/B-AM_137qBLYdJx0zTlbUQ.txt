A very poor dining experience.

There was no one in the restaurant when we arrived and I should have took that as a sign of trouble, alas my spidey senses were not tingling...and later on nor were my taste buds.

Arrived with a group of four (3 being from China). I figured this would be a fun place to experience being a mexican/chinese fusion restaurant.

It began with the ordering of hot water that arrived in an iron tea pot, visually pleasing but left a terrible metallic aftertaste. The dishes we ordered were indeed tiny and expensive as other reviews state. My company had two orders of different soups and the fresh handmade noodles but had to quickly report to our waiter that all three dishes were incredibly salty, we're talking "preserve your tongue for the winter" salty. Our waitress advised us that a lot of asian customers have this problem, "Americans just expect lots of salt or they complain that there is not enough flavour". I found this a little hard to believe being that all other restaurants we tried in Vegas were well under the "tongue preservation" level of salt. 

They offered to redo the soups but we had enough of the trouble and decided to cut our loses and shared the noodles and a fish taco (a very rubbery fish taco but with nice hints of flavour). 

It was then that the hostess provided the bill which included the two dishes that we did not even eat, after reminding her of this they quickly changed the bill but the fact that they tried to charge for everything showed no care at all for customer experience.
