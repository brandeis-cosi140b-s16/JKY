Do your self a favor and stay away from this place. If this is upscale you must be joking. We ate here when it first open and it was quality food.  Now is got a bull ring shitty food, dirty glasses, bad service and the most annoying loud music playing at noon when most people are trying to nurse a hang over. I see this place closing very soon.  So many better places to eat and much better Mexican food. Try the restaurant in Tivoli if you was fresh quality upscale Mexican.  This place gets Uck and double Uck.
