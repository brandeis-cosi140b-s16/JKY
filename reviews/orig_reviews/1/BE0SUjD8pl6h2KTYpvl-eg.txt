Went here with the wife from a lot of people talking about it and was highly disappointed we got carne asada fries and some spicy pork tacos, the tacos were decent at best but the carne asada was the worst tasting ever it tasted like it was blasted with gas or something I cant place it but theres no way it could always taste like that and have such good reviews absolutely horrible we will never be back
