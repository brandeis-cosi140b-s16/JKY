I drove a long way to try this place based on the reputation. It was in the middle of a rundown industrial setting, looking more like the back of a warehouse than the front of a restaurant. When I got there at 5pm on a Saturday, two carloads of would be customers were already there banging on the gates and windows in bewilderment that there was no one there and there was no note on the door explaining why they were closed and not serving dinner on a Saturday evening! I will not waste my time on this inconsiderate dive again.
