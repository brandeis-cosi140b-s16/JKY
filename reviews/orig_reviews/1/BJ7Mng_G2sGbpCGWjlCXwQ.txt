Back when Westgate was new and exciting, this place was a cozy cocktail lounge. Unfortunately, it was hijacked by Calico, who attempts to turn this into a nightclub with Latin flair. It fails miserably.

Came here twice--once on a busy night, and once on a slow night.

On the busy night, the narrow walkway and dance floor made it pretty hard to move around. I would normally not complain about a place like this being packed, but it was just not meant to be this kind of club. It's just an uncomfortable place to be.

Gave it another try on a slow night, only to be greeted with my worst nightmare. They were OUT OF JAGERMEISTER. Under no circumstance should that ever happen, especially in a bar of this magnitude.

Not coming here again unless I'm involved with that 'VIP special' they copied McFadden's with. By the way, EVERYONE GETS THOSE. Doesn't make them 'winners' or this place special.
