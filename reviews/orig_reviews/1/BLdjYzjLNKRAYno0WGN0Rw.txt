Giving this place one star in order to write my review.

My bf and I were there on Thursday night. We were both starving!!! We sat down and were greeted promptly. We ordered an appetizer and a few different tapas.

Bacon wrapped dates (our favorite tapas) came out super HOT! My bf burned his mouth. The bacon was really fatty which explains why it was burnt.

Empanadas had a mushy meat which resembled puréed (?) old shredded beef...not good.

Crocketas were deep fried but super soggy??? How does that happen? and who knows what was in them. It was supposed to be chicken with béchamel sauce but tasted more like a Campbell's cream soup---wait generic cream soup- Campbell's would've actually helped--- w chunks of who knows what. I've had béchamel sauce and that was not it!

Chorizo was served cut into tiny pieces 5 pieces altogether and was so oily that some of the oil ended on my shirt...goodbye silk blend piece :(

Finally we decided on gnocchi...pasta right? You can't mess this dish up- I've made it myself at home with OTC sauce...well surprise! Salty and gnocchi tasted so un fresh!

I will not return to this place. Seriously! My bf even said he would much rather take his chances on the other more known tapas place then step back in here. How is this place still having people come in and order FOOD? Clearly these people lack a trained palates or maybe they lost their taste buds in a freak incident. I went home and - I kept wondering what was in those Crocketas and empanadas. The thought of how old the food was...it was too much for me.
