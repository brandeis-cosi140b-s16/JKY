Wow, not what I expected from a place that had some great reviews. Where do I begin, so the ordering was a nightmare, then the so call dining area, it was like entering a local community meeting room. Pressing on, the food I ordered came in a tin pie plate container. The actual food was OK, but seriously, I will not return to this hole in the wall.
