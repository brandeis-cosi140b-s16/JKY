I'm not sure where all the good reviews came from here. My service sucked,(both my cups had food in them) (our burrito was wrong even after sending it back the first time), and the food was mediocre. I ordered a Bloody Mary they charged me $14 for and it was one of the worst bloody Mary's I have ever had. There was no manager on the premises so the bartender assisted us with our complaints. She was very nice and did try to help us out the best she could. For now I'll stick with 1.50 tacos at a taco truck rather than eating at this place.
