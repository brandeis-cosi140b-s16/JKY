Came here on Christmas eve, eve with my family who lives in Phoenix and we live in Tucson.  The murals were cool in the back of the place. Inside the place is cramped and the chairs uncomfortable. The artwork was fun to look at on the walls. We open the menus and the prices were outrageous for this place. My wife and I decided to split the chicken mole entree. Chicken was drowned in Mole sauce that was not good at all.  We both agreed the best part was the guacamole but how hard is it to add pomegranate seeds to sliced avocado. The service felt rushed and 3 times I had to tell the busboy I was not finished with my meal yet. The best part of the meal was the dessert. 4 people with 3 sangrias and the total bill was $120 with tip. I recommend not to go to this place.
