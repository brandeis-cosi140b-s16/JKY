I have never given a restaurant a 1 star rating. But for the life of me, I couldn't understand how this establishment was receiving 4 stars with 129 reviews. I mean, the ratings were the only reason I decided to give it a go after all! 

Carrying on, if there's one thing that gets to me, it's really bad Mexican food. Now, I understand this place in no way advertised that it was down-home cooking, or anywhere near authentic Mexican cuisine, but for what it advertised on its menu (enchiladas, tacos, tostadas, burritos and the like), I expected at least a Tex-Mex kinda meal. 

Boy was I wrong. It was just horrible. They had removed every aspect of what makes Mexican food Mexican food, and replaced it with what tasted like something you got at a gas station in the middle of no where. The "creamy green" sauce they serve on their burritos and enchiladas (not sure if they serve it on anything else) was hard to swallow with a straight face. It tasted like Campbell's canned cream of mushroom soup. Their beans and rice, SO incredibly tasteless and somewhat undercooked. And their house salsa I'm pretty dern sure was that disgusting Pace Picante tomato paste you get out of a jar sold at your local supermarket. 

I wondered if the waitress knew how horrible the food was...I felt badly lying to her and saying everything was okay when she came around to check on us. Because it most definitely was NOT. But complaining to her about it was not going to fix the bigger problem at hand, which was the food there is simply atrocious. 

Moving forward, I will be a bit more hesitant relying on reviews when picking new places to dine at. I have a feeling this place's 5 star ratings aren't all that genuine... Be weary fellow my fellow Yelpers. Be weary.
