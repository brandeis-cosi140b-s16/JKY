This sorry shithole really could only survive in Touristville adjacent to the resort. Good God! I actually felt like my wallet got gang-raped for the experience: one dinner + one quesadilla appetizer + three margaritas = $60. What in the hell is that!? It would be one thing if the food was amazing.... but the so-called green chilis in my quesadilla were cut up raw mild boring jalapenos that added absolutely zero to the food (but cost an extra $2). The poor downtrodden quesadilla soon sweated an enormous pool of grease, which soaked its entire underside, rendering it inedible. One of my friends passed around a guac appetizer, and the raw onions in there would either put hair on your chest or singe it clean off, not sure which. Blech!

I will add a 1/2 star because the margaritas were tasty. Either they used high end tequila, or there was no booze at all in there. For the price, I would hope it was nice tequila. Clearly, since I can't really tell either way, there wasn't much in there. I could also go so far as to add a half star for the ambiance. Total old-school Arizona touristy kitsch, and the patio was very nice for our group gathering. However, with the preponderance of wonderful places with outdoor seating, I doubt the patio alone would ever lure me back. See ya at Los Dos!
