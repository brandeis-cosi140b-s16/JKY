We were staying at the HardRock and decided to go down and eat here. I had some many tacos which seemed reasonable but once I started eating I felt something odd and realized it was a fingernail from my taco. I showed my coworkers and they all wouldn't finish their food. Once I showed the manager she wasn't even really apologetic. They comped my main course but made me pay for everything else. I understand things happen but what turned  me off was the lack of customer service
