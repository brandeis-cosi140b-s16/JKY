Service here sucks our waiter Martin who goes by Jesus was not welcoming. He made my brother and I feel like we were a hassle and he made faces when I asked him questions about the menu. As if I annoyed him it was unfortunate that my first experience had to be with such a waiter.  However besides bad service the food, chips and salsa with bean dip is awesome. Get new staff who actually want a good tip he didn't deserve any tip that I left him but since I work in that line of business I left it. Next time I won't and yes I will be back and making sure I request a server who's name isn't Martin/Jesus.
