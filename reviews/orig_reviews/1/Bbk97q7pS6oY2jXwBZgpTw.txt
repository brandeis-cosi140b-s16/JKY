Since some coworkers requested to come here for their birthday, I begrudgingly complied. You'd think that in five years a location would improve enough to at least earn an extra star. This is not the case. It's been over five years now since I've been to Depot Cantina. It'll likely be another 10 before I return.

With seven of the ten already at the location that would be joining us for lunch today, the first person we spoke with stated that we had to wait for the others to show before he would sit us. Mind you, they weren't busy in the slightest. So we stood. Waiting. Eventually, another individual came by and kindly offered to seat us, that it wasn't a problem.

That's pretty close to where the good stops, sadly. It took over an hour to get our food. Our waitress at one point apologized, stating that it wasn't really her table (even though she's the only one we dealt with the entire time). And even when we did get our food, my order was incorrect not once, but twice. After the second round, I chose to forego any further attempts by them to get it correct. I don't blame our server really. She seemed very busy and likely didn't have the support she needed.

Also, if dust or cobwebs bother you, don't bother coming here. Most of the light fixtures and the various ledges around the venue are covered in cobwebs and a thick layer of what looks like very old dust. 

I do not recommend Macayo's in any way, shape or form.
