Ordered a large margarita, which was okay, nothing phenomenal.
Shrimp enchiladas was not up to par. The enchilada sauces came on the side and didn't taste yummy.
Chicken tacos had bland chicken and came on crunchy shells, which was unexpected. 
Rice and beans that came with both meals were disgusting. Things that come out of a can tastes better.

Chips & salsa only free the first round. The chips were good, but salsa was probably one of the worst I've had at an "authentic" mexican restaurant, so i'm really not sure why they are so stingy with it.

Service: the place was full, but in the 15 minutes that we stood inside when NOBODY acknowledged us, 3 tables were cleared. Only when a family of 8 walked in and crowded the whole place and they were FORCED to talk to us did we get seated. 

The waitress at the end also tried to overcharge us. I left her an awful tip. Here's another tip: make your food better, and have better service, and stop trying to rip off your patrons!
