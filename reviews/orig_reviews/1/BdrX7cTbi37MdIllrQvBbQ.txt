Ok, so normally I like supporting Russian places, but I have no clue what happened to this place. Me and gf and my sister (visiting from CA), went to this place to eat. Last time I went it wasn't too bad. This is just embarrassing. Strange new menu, including Russian, Mexican, American, Greek? Ordered Oliviye, vinegret, piroshky and, Julien. Piroshky were edible but the rest was not Russian food. Oliviye is not warm potato salad from a jar. Vinegret is not supposed to be white..what? Did I miss something? So besides being embarrassed in front of my sister we had to leave and go eat somewhere else, because we couldn't take more than a few bites of anything. Sorry for being harsh but my review doesn't actually do this experience justice.
