Sabor Amargo (Bittersweet) - Just left Sabor about 30 minutes ago and I'm still hungry and even more disappointed. Where do I start? Let's start with the good - friendly cashier, good tasting food. The bad? Everything else. The place was a complete disaster. It was dirty, the women's bathroom was broken and the men's restroom didn't have a working sink. Only the hot water knob was functional thus hot scolding water was the only option if you were brave enough to wash your hands (don't worry I did). I waited patiently for about 20 minutes and then grew rather impatient after 40. Finally when my order was delivered it was incomplete. I saw other customers having similar issues so I didn't panic. I asked for my order to be corrected and it wasn't. The cashier was a little too friendly and was too busy talking up customers to address my issue with urgency it required. I asked for a refund for the missing items from my order and unfortunately the cashier was unable to help me. She solicited the help of a cook who didn't speak really good English. She asked me how much I paid for my taco...I pointed to the menu and she attempted to swipe my card at least 4 times without success. Finally, I asked for my card back and just told her to forget it. All this time there is a manager type in the back room on his laptop being rather useless. I'm hopeful this person is a vendor and not an owner or manager. He never came to help quell the traffic or help out his overburdened staff. Overwhelming disappointed in that a few basic restaurant rules weren't followed - advise customers that the kitchen is backed up, offer a replacement for a missing item, how to manage a POS system, delivering "fast food" in under 40 minutes. I hope this place gets it together, too many good restaurants in Charlotte who can fill this void.
