Way disappointed!  Food was garden variety mexican.  Our waitress was not interested.  And my biggest pet peeve of leaving the table full of dirty dishes while we were left sitting there trying to pay our bill topped off a forgetful evening in Scottsdale.  Go somewhere / anywhere else for a better expenditure of your time and money.
