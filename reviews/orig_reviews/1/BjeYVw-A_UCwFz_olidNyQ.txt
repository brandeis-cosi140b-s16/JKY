IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THEM NO STARS, I WOULD HAVE DONE THAT! DO NOT COME HERE!!! We had a bad experience in the Bell Rd location, I came home and sent an e-mail complaint in and was IGNORED! I sent in a second complaint and was sent back a LONG letter attacking my complaint in the first place. I have news for these OWNERS- With customer service like this you will close soon. One thing BILL said to me was no one else complained about that nights service. I can tell you with complete confidence, no one else may have complained but I guarantee there were other people that will just not come back. THE LETTER THAT CAME BACK WAS RUDE, AGGRESSIVE, SELF INDULGENT AND HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Terrible that they have such an inflated self ego that they do not care and even worse yet feel inclined to attack anyone who did not like their experience at this establishment. Shame on Bill and Janie RIddle
