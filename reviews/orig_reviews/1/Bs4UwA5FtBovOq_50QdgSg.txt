So I'm writing this review after sitting here for 30 minutes with a menu in front of me and no one has bothered to even take our drink order. We are in plain site but no one even came to check on us. 

They are not even busy at all. Several people came after us and got service but they ignored us - probably because we weren't a big party. 

So after having time to consider their overpriced food I will go somewhere else and actively tell people not to go here. Before leaving I went in and told the wait staff we would be leaving because we didn't receive any service and they were hardly even concerned - read rude.

At least I got to eat a basket of their gross greasy chips for free. We won't be back here or to their equally overpriced and meagerly less than average sister restaurant John Cutter. If you want overpriced greasy bar food don't miss John Cutter!
