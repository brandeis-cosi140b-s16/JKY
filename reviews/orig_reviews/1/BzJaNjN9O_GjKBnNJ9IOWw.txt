Just an Awful lunch experience. 
Bartender was new and doesn't know the menu at all. Forgot to make our margaritas. And we r sitting directly in front of him. 
Food Order took 25 minutes to come to the bar and it was wrong. Mine came out right but hers was not. There was no sense of urgency with the staff to get the order put in and corrected. I had to tell them that I would like to get this today. So now we have to wait again for the new order. 
The food finally came out and the salad was disgusting Just swimming in a very bad tasting dressing. My burger was a sloppy mess. It was cooked correctly though. The bartender did get the salad off the bill because it took so long. No manager ever came over to talk to us. She just walked around the room obnoxiously rattling her keys and joking with staff. 
I will not be returning. For a new place to try and attract locals. They need to train staff better and up there game. From top to bottom.
