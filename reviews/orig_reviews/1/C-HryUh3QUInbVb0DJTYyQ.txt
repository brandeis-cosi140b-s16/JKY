Had my first and last meal here this weekend.  The quesadilla didn't taste right. Within 2 hours after eating, I came down with violent food poisoning.  Spent the entire weekend in our hotel room at the Monte Carlo throwing up, chills, muscle aches, nausea.  Nice way to ruin an entire weekend in Vegas, Diablos.  

Avoid this place.
