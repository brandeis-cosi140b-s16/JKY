Couldn't get a seat. Not because it was full, but because they wanted to provide us with 'excellent customer service' once you're seated, so you get to wait in the wind and dust for 40 minutes while there are 10+ tables that are empty. That was some excellent customer service! If you won't hire enough people to serve a semi-full house, maybe the restaurant business is not for you. Also, it is probably a better idea to let your customers know that service might be delayed, and ask if they would like to be seated during their wait. Don't make up stupid excuses!
