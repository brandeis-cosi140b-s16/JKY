A very poor excuse for Mexican food.  We arrived at lunch to find the place packed and had a bit of a wait, which despite the run-down lackluster interior, we viewed the popularity as a positive sign that we were in for some great food.  We were finally seated and were provided with food-covered menus and a basket of chips and watery, flavorless salsa.  The waiter finally came over to take our order after a long wait at which time we also requested some silverware and napkins.  After another ten minutes, he finally brought us some water and some well used silverware rolled in a paper napkin.  One would have thought that with salsa so watery, they would have provided us with some plates to prevent dripping all over the table, but the overall lack of cleanliness of the place seemed to suggest otherwise.  The chips themselves were greasy and bland and we only consumed some of them because we were both famished.

After another lengthy wait, my veggie burrito finally arrived. I only managed to get through a few bites of this greasy, flavorless disaster before calling it quits and heading back to the office still hungry.  The burrito consisted of nothing more than soggy, overly greasy, limp, overcooked vegetables, of which spinach was the predominant variety.  There was no flavor to any of it or any spice, sauce, etc. that would give one the impression of eating Mexican food.  I have absolutely no idea why people would flock to this place.  The atmosphere is that of a dirty cafe with tables packed on top of each other and the food is beyond horrible.  While I avoid fast food at all costs, I can honestly say that I would eat at Taco Bell before ever coming back to Frank & Lupe's.
