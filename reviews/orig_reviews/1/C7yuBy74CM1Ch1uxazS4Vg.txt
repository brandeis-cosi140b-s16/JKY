Okay, one star is a bad review, and I want everyone to know that the service here was SO BAD that it took away from everything else. With that said, the food here is probably the best on mill, so I will probably end up going back anyway. The combined IQ of the servers in that restaurant has to be in the mid 40s, and maybe instead of standing around and talking to each other, they could be delivering their food. Seriously thats your only job - to bring my food to me, thats why I go out to eat. If you can't do that competently then guess what, low tip. If you completely neglect me, don't refill my drink, and the manager has to bring me my food because its been an hour and the place isn't busy - no tip. Of the four times I have been there during the day to eat, twice I have not tipped and wrote exactly why on the receipt and explained to the manager, but I am still shocked every time I go there and the servers fail to do the one thing they are there to do. The steak tacos are good enough to deal with it though, and there is a wide range of tequilas to sip.
