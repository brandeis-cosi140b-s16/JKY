I was so excited to try this place for the first time and was so disappointed. The door staff was rude, our waitress paid no attention to us and brought out the wrong food for nearly the whole table, she was more concerned with the fun tables who had bottled service. It seems this place is more for bottle service than food service so if your hungry, DONT BOTHER.
