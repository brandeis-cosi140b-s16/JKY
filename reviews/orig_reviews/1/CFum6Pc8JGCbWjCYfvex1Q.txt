This restaurant is off my list for good. There was a time in different states that I would have considered them pretty good. Things have changed and it appears to be nationwide. The service was terrible...we received the "what do you want, your bothering me" attitude from our young female server on an early Saturday night last weekend. Our biggest clue should have been the now hiring sign that we joked about in the parking lot hoping it wasn't cooks. Our order was incorrect and I'm fairly positive the chicken in my 3 sauce burrito was frozen. It was perfectly cubed and had a squishy consistency. My friends veggie burrito came with chunks of partially cooked zucchini, squash and red peppers. The rice was just as bad.
The only thing I found appealing were the re fried beans. 
Add a $5 draft beer and voila, unhappy customer.
