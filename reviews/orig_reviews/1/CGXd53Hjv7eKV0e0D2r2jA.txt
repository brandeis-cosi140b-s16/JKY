This restaurant was recommended to us by the hotel we were staying at.  Very disappointing .  Poor service, we actually had to get our menus ourselves.  Drinks were wrong after ordering- they were however corrected.  Food orders were messed up, arrived nearly 45 minutes later, all were cold, some were not even cooked all the way through.  We even had to return the chicken salad twice as it was made wrong, nothing special about it just didn't want dressing.  No one ever came to check on us, no one apologized, nothing was comp'ed.  The young ladies at the hostess stand were not very helpful either to our waitress who was clearly trying her best but over her head.  Not a good experience - go somewhere else.
