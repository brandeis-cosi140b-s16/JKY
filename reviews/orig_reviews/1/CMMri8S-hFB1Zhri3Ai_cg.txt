This place is absolutely terrible. If your waitress's name is Misty I suggest you ask to be reseated. She's rude, demeaning, and VERY inexperienced. It'll take you 30 minutes just to grab her attention to place your order.  The food was nothing to die for, and you have to ask for refills. I really wish our experience was better as the reviews below suggest its a decent place, but we will not be back. For the money you spend here you can get a great meal with EXCELLENT service down the road. Usually if the food was not to par but service was good we return for a second try- as every kitchen has an off day. But Misty sealed the deal for us. Management needs to rethink that one.
