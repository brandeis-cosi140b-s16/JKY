This place is a terrible idea unless your rich and can order like 5 burritos they are acrimony as shit my burrito was 6$ and the size of like a taquito. My order was 20$ for that and 3 mini ass tacos with no flavor. If your really looking for Mexican food this ain't it. The horchata is good. Anyone recommend a real Mexican place in central Phoenix?
