This is the WORST expierence and decent. If I could give zero stars I would. This is my first and last time I'll be visiting this chain. When it was my turn in line I was still behind the wall and the guy asked what I wanted. At least that's what I assumed because I couldn't hear him. I told him 2 steak burritos and he asked something but I couldn't understand. I asked him what he said, but he turned his head away from me and repeated himself to where I couldn't understand him. When I apologized and said I couldn't hear him he had the worst snappy attitude and asked what sauce I wanted. I tod him "I guess hot" this was my first time and I had no idea how it worked or what my options were. I like lettuce, pico, guac, sour creme on the inside but I didn't have that option. My burritos were rolled and finished. When they came out of the heater thing another lady asked what I wanted. So all the stuff was on the outside?!?! That didn't make sense. I should have just ordered a salad. When I got my food it was cold. Had decent flavor, but was disappointed. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone.
