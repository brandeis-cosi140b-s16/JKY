I was so excited to try New Mexico style food in Las Vegas, and I'm unhappy to put a bad review but the service was horrible and super slow.  The food was mediocre at best.  The employees aren't very welcoming and seem unhappy.  I wonder if it's a case of poor management.  Anyhow I really hope this place excells in the valley but it is a terrible location kinda hard to find in a back corner.  Worst part was the funky set-up.  Get it together Chile Addiction... Willing to give one more chance in the near future and possibly change my review...
