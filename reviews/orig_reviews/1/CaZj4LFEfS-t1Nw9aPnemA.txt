Had gone to this restaurant couple a times before and never had received worst service ever!!  Server thought we were from out of town ( which my family was but we are locals)  started arguing with my folks.  If they asked for something just like chile sauce, server said he had to put an order for it, what when in a Mexican restaurant has an order for sauce have to be put it; seemed like this server was pissed if we were from out of town?? Don't understand why.  He was so rude and when we left decided to talk to manager same as rude and we were asked where we were from??  Did it matter, we as customers should of been treated right, won't be going back here again!!
