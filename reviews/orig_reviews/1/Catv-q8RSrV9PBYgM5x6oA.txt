Think again before going here! I tried it about two months ago and the guacamole got me to try it a second time....what a mistake! Service was some of the worst I've ever had. Food was ok, nothing special. Chips were stale. Even the second basket they brought over when I requested a new one. The wait for our food (burrito & 3 tiny tacos) was about 40 min. Never again! Too bad too because they have a cute little patio!
