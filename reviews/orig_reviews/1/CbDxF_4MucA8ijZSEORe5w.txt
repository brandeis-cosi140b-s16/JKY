Been here 4 times. Every time the service was shitty and Inattentive . Even rude

They were out of 3 things the last time we went.

The drinks are very very good, all natural, no fake syrups.. The salsa is bland and they put onionss on everything.
The seitan taco was very good 

Chips were greasy and shiny with oil. 

The patio is nice but attracts too many smokers
