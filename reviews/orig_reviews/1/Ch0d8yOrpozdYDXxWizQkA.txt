Absolutely HORRID. Words can't express how appalled I am about our food experience at this restaurant. 

Portions are laughable and food is the worst I have ever had. 

The Dan Dan Mien noodles ($12) were thrown into a big plastic tub containing 90% air and 10% food. It came out to the equivalent of 5 noodle strands, mixed in with a few pieces of meet, vegetables, and put into a big container to give the illusion of generous portions. The Langosta Tacos ($10) and Carnitas Tacos ($4.50) were the size of my index finger - no joke. 

Rarely do I ever order food and feel so jipped-off and demoralized. 

Aside from the highway-robbery prices, ridiculous portions and nasty food, the worst part was perhaps that the waitress recommended these items to us. 

*** China Poblano and the ownership/management, and even Cosmopolitan should be really ashamed of themselves. My experience was nothing short of criminal and I will NEVER go back. ***
