There was 9 people before me that got there order , our order was simple and I had to go to them and say I see my order sitting there. I did grab a to go menu button rolled up in a ball and threw it in the parking lot.  Junk service when busy that's for sure.  You may see a line to the door, but I'm thinking its because they are sooo slow.  I do hope the food is better than the service.  Wait, it must because how much worse than junk does it get.  I will not be back and don't recommend.   Your reputation did not meet the standards I would have expected based on the plaques on the wall..  I go out to dinner 3-4 Days a week.  If you remotely like even Good food, this is Not the place for you.
