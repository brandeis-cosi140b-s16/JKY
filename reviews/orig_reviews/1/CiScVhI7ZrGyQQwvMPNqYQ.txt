Wow so ok... From the words of our server, "In order to "class up" the same menu z Tejas has adjusted the menu."

Don't be fooled- it's the SAME menu, they want you to drink for cheap at $5 per drink but they want you to pay more for the same food as before in order to earn a star or put some cash in the CEO's pocket book.  Oh...

NO MORE COMPLEMENTARY CORNBREAD.

They're masking it with "we donate proceeds to ..." And next they'll give 50% of the proceeds somewhere else...

This is not a fine dining restaurant. It's a happy hour with a bar.  If you want to attract a crowd or earn a star, change the menu and your style of serving. 

Wow. Disappointed returning customers and Won't be back.

How's that for your pocket book.
