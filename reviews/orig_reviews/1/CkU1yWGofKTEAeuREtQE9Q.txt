I would absolutely never go here again. 
I do not drink but I absolutely love to dance. Its over crowded, I expected it to be crowded, but not to the point where I cant even turn around!. I didnt have bottle service but I was near a v.i.p. table and the waitress was being a total batch (if you know what I mean). I was dancing and a beer bottle was on the floor and instead of kicking it again and dancing on it or someone possibly getting hurt, I picked it up and put it on the v.I.p. table and she turned around and tried to hand it to me. I explained it was not mine because I do not drink. She proceeded to shove it on my chest forcefully and demanded I take it, instead of listening to me!. 
If you dont like your job, dont work there!!!!
