Just returned from the Rockerij, we had a house salad that was mixed greens (Costco style) with 2 small pieces of tomato and croutons for $8.00!  Sorry folks this is not a salad this is a plate of lettuce.  $8.00!!  

 We ordered Prime Rib and once again we were disappointed, seriously the meat was tough and that "melt in your mouth anticipation"  just didn't happen.   We walked out vowing never to return again.  If you are commancing high prices then provide superior quality.  As for service, it is a reflection of the 'lack of flavor, quality and true concern for patrons', everyone is too busy to concern themselves with the details.  

We dine out often, returning to places that once valued client, quality and service.  We will not retun to Rokerji,  Bummer, once upon a time the client, service and quality meats reined supreme.
