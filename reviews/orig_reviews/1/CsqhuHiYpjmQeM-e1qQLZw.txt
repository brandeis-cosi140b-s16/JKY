After everyone raving about this place and Martha Stewart eating here we knew we had to go. We gave it three different tries. We are done. I fail to understand the appeal of this restaurant or how they stay in business. The food is decent, but don't be hungry or have any place to be as you'll be waiting. And waiting. That's after you've waited and waited for one of the empty tables. Then there is the completely incompetent, rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner.
