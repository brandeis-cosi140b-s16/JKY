I really don't understand why all the great reviews about this place. Maybe it's because of it's location (being one of the few restaurants in Litchfield Park) or maybe it's the alcohol. Either way, it's not that good. Being new to Arizona, we decided that on our anniversary we would try 2 new restaurants. The Old Pueblo Cafe was our dinner choice. Poor choice to end a great day on this note. We had a trio of tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken & 1 fish) and a green chile beef chimichanga. The chimi was mediocre. The tacos were all bad. The fish taco actually made us sick. All 3 were hard from being old tortillias. Absolutely this has been the second worst Mexican food we have ever eaten. Also, the food is really overpriced for the quality and quantity. We won't be back and recommend that you don't waste your time, money or calories either.
