A Robert Irvine attitude adjustment for the wait staff and kitchen help needed immediately!! 

I was so excited to bring my boyfriend here as Arriba caters for the company I work for and the food had been great. 

When we arrived we were asked to sit in the cantina area. While it was colorful and inviting, the service and food was dreadful. 

First, let me start by saying it took 15 minutes to get our appetizer. We ordered the queso and upon arrival it was cold and the layer of cheese had already started to crust. 

While we were eating out appetizer, the waitress finally decided to take our food order. It took another 30 minutes to get our food. I had the carnitas. The meat was burned to a crisp. The waitress did, after 25 minutes, inform us that the kitchen was backed up. We counted less then 6 tables. Hmmm .. maybe she forgot the order and had to hit the RAIL button.

Now, let me take a step back and mention that it took our waitress quite some time to get our drink order (water and sprite). I asked for a straw (I just started invisalign and my teeth are a bit sensitive) and she never brought one. I am glad it provided my boyfriend a chivalrous moment to hand over his straw. 

Hopefully I can figure out a way to attach a photo, but the entire time we were dining we had the pleasure of looking at four tables that had not been cleaned. We should have got the hint to leave when the table in front of us got up and left a full meal.

As the meal came to an end, the manager did stop by and ask us how everything was. We did mention the delay in getting our food (we didn't mention the burned food although we probably should have), and so he felt obligated to comp a portion of our food. He 'graciously' provided us with the employee discount. Instead of a $47 check it was $39. Thanks buddy! 

Needless to say, we wont be going back.
