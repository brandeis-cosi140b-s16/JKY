I visited a networking group that met for breakfast. The place was empty yet we were set up against the window which was tight & uncomfortable to get around. The staff was not attentive. Seemed put off that they had to be there so early. Waitress didn't know who got what meal. The food was good. I wanted ice water & got hot.
