So finally I decided to try out Tacos El Gordo yesterday, after hearing from countless people saying "oh they're the best, all others can't compete!" Blah blah blah, you can't just believe what people say until you yourself have tried it and I did and well.... They should be called Tacos El Garbage!! Anyone who thinks these tacos are the best should be deported to Mexico just to experience what a real taco tastes like. The carne asada was dry as fuck and the worst part was that before the food hit my mouth you could taste the flame off the heat from the propane! Seriously my tacos tasted like lighter fluid!!! Hank Hill would've shit 4 bricks because he would've preached "Taste the meat not the heat!" Biggest waste of $20. For the extra $6.00 I should've gone next door, literally 5 steps to the right to Los Tacos and had real tacos that taste way better than the shit I just ate. Such a long wait in line for nothing. So like they say don't knock it till you try it! Yup, never going there ever again!!
