Ignore the 5/5 reviews from the employees, this place is bogus.   Poorly made drinks and botched food orders during the day, RACIST bouncers at night that actually told my group everyone but my black friend could get in.  Unbelievable in 2014 that employeesare enabled by the El Hefe owners and managers to openly discriminate.

This place is doing a great job of bringing sub-par, snotty service to the otherwise Mill and deserves to be gone in a few months...frankly Canteen was much better.
