Food poisoning, over priced, and mediocre service. I was there last night. The fish tacos  were small, $4 each, & have made me terribly sick today & unable to work. I asked the server a question she couldn't answer and she never sought help from her staff. But I did. And I got an answer. Also had to hunt down my own napkins, then salt and pepper, clean up my sons spilled drink by myself, and ask for a refill when the empty glass was right in front of her. Just sayin...
