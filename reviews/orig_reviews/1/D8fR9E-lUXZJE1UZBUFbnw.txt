If I could give this place a 0 I would... We stopped in today and I paid $4.50 for a large guac to go. Imagine my surprise when I opened it in front of my guests and it was so watered down it was soup. I had to throw it away and apologize to my friends. I will NEVER spend another penny at this place. You have been warned!
