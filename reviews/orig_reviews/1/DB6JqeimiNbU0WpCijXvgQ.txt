I honestly was not impressed. I ordered the chilli relleno. The dish seemed pre made & reheated. I thought that it was strange when I asked for it with no onions and they said it couldn't be done.... Because it was already made.  I'm really sad because this was supposed to be my special birthday dinner. :(
