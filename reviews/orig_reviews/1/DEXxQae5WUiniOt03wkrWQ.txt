Greeting and food service was on the slow side to be 3PM and pretty empty. We were standing upfront for about 15 minutes and literally no one stopped to check our status or seat us. Once seated, our server Luke was definitely helpful and on point with his drink and taco suggestions though. 

We had the street corn as an appetizer, total waste of $4. Corn on the cob (probably the smallest I've ever seen), lathered in oil and a sprinkle of cheese. I was expecting at least a juicy piece of corn and all the things that would make it almost worth spending $4 for & even more so "Mexican Street Corn". I had the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and opted for sweet plantains instead of beans ($2 upcharge). Tacos were pretty tasty (that's what the one star is for), plantains were burnt on some ends and they were all stuck together. Saffron rice would've been good had I not chomped on a few hard clusters of rice. 

I went back on yelp and saw the South Park location had better reviews - because I really wanted to like this place,  I'm willing to give Cantina 1511 another shot but at the South Park location. One star for the tacos alone.
