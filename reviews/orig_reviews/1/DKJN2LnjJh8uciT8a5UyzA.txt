We ordered the make it at your table guacamole.  It tasted bland.  Needed garlic and salt. I also ordered the mini steak tacos.. Very disappointed because the steak had no flavor. It's like they slapped it on the grill and put it in the taco and that was it. I expected some kind of flavor. Overpriced food and disappointed because it was my first experience with them.. Service not that great either.
