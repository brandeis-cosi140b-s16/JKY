We wanted this place to be good since it is close to home.  Perhaps we made bad food choices or it could have been an off night but we were very disappointed.  The fish tacos had tiny chunks of greasy seasoned fish in a taco.  The pork carnitas were very dry, tough and chewy.  A lot of of our food was left on the plate.  This restaurant is off our list.
