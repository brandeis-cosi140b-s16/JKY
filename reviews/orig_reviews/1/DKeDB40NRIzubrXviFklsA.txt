I ordered some nachos online at 4:00 pm, and after an hour and a half called in to see what's up. Apparently, the driver dropped it off at the wrong apartment. After talking with the manager, he said I wouldn't be charged and he'll send another out right away. Almost 4 hours later, it's 7:42 and I still don't have nachos.
