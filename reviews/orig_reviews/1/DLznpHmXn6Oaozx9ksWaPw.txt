One might expect a restaurant in a wonderful hotel like the cosmopolitan would be spectacular - not in this case. 

My girlfriend and I ordered what seemed to be like safe dishes to eat, we shared the soup Swallow a Cloud and ordered 2 tacos for myself and 1 for her. First of all, the soup smelled and tasted like feet. Very unappetizing. The tacos, which take only 2 bites to finish, we're nothing special at all. My girlfriend was very unhappy and ended up getting a Pinks taco across the street. 

Prices are REDICULOUS for what they serve. Cosmopolitan should be ashamed to host this restaurant.
