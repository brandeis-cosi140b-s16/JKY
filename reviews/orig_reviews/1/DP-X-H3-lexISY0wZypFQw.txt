Frankly, one star is even too generous for our visit recently to Abuelos at Arrowhead. What used to be a fun and delicious place to eat has dwindled down to being just an absolute dump. 

The restaurant was filthy. Someone had actually dropped one of their flossers on the floor in the lobby and the hostesses just walked by it over and over again. There was trash in the faux planters and there were actually still Christmas decorations in a couple of random spots in the faux plants surrounding the dining area. There were dirty tables that just sat dirty all around the dining area. Sorry but that's unacceptable. 

The server was friendly...sort-of. He sold us on an appetizer and then didn't bother to put it in! I think he was put out that our party of 3 decided to share the fajita trio rather than ordering 3 seperate dishes. The fajita trio is HUGE and it easily feeds our family. Our drinks were never refilled...our chip bowl sat empty so long it started to get cobwebs on it. 

Overall, this was a grossly disappointing visit to a restaurant that once was respectable, clean, and had pride. There is clearly no pride left in this Abuelos. I think I'll just stick to the dives here in El Mirage....at least they care about their customers and their reputations.
