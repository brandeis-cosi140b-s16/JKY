I have been a loyal customer of Ricardo's for years.  However, I will no longer be patronizing Ricardo's.  They offer a happy hour of half price appetizers and drinks between 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm.  Last night my husband and I ordered four appetizers to share.  The waiter commented that we seem to be ordering "a lot" of food, which, actually should none of his business.  I made the comment that I liked to have leftovers for my lunch the next day.  At that point he told me that no "to go" boxes were available because they don't make money on Happy Hour and they don't want people coming and eating one item off each plate then taking the rest home.  So I guess they would prefer for the leftover appetizers to be thrown away, rather than allow their customers to take the appetizers home that they already paid for??  Doesn't make sense to me so I won't be going back.
