Yikes.  The one time I ate here, the food (chicken tacos) was absolutely flavorless except for the chips & salsa, which were passable.  Service was standard.  If you're stuck at the Palms and maybe too drunk to go anywhere else and have to have something vaguely Mexican-ish, sure, give it a shot.  It's not going to kill you, but don't come to this place expecting the same kind of miracles you were expecting when you were splitting 10s at the blackjack table across the floor.
