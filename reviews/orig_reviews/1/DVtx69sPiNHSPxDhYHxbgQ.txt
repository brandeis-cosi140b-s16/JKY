We were craving Mexican and the weather was nice so we sat outside.  

First we ordered the chips and salsa.  Wait a second-- ordering chips and salsa? Seriously, we have to pay for chips and salsa? What fresh hell is this?

The chips are described as hand-cut, which I think means they're hand-cut from the Wieliczka salt mines in Poland.  Our chips were rimed with salt.  We scraped the salt off in heavy flakes, and the chips were still eye-dessicatingly salty.  

I got a few tacos.  They were okay, but not much meat, and again, the main flavor was salt.  My partner got the pollo en mole, which was so salty it was inedible.

After dinner we walked around the corner to a party, when we told our friends we'd gone to Verde, everyone groaned.  "Y'know", said one of my friends, "All the cooks there do coke in the kitchen".  Honestly, that doesn't bother me at all; but really, with the intense focus that comes from a few bumps, I'd expect better food.  

They have a really long list of tequilas, if that's your thing.
