What in the hell was that?!?!  A quesadilla with meat that was a size of a half dollar.  The meat was seasoned OK.  I guess since I'm from the Bay Area, I'm use to eating excellent Mexican food.  Long lines for a Titos tacos 2.0 with carne asada fries included.  If you want to eat excellent Tacos and Burritos, go to 24th street in the Mission, San Francisco.
