I can say that the waitresses they have working are gorgeous but other than that this place is a joke. Amazingly bad music played WAY too loud to eliminate any chance of having a conversation. Food is way overpriced and not stellar by any means. Waitress cashed us out without even asking if we were done. Place seems to be a douchebag magnet. Typical Scottsdale crowd full of $30,000 millionaires.
