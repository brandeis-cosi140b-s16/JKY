Here is a place you go when you want horrible food with bad service and overpriced drinks. They do the "seat yourself" gimmick. That means nobody really comes and takes orders. When they do, you get a $14 bottle shelf margarita serves in a pint glass. 

For $12 you get chips and watery, tasteless salsa along with some cheese wiz. I kind of hate myself for having come here more than once. But beggars can't be choosers during flight delays.
