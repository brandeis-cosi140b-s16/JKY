Food was ok but i would say on the expensive side.. $5.25 for one small barbacoa taco, and $5.50 for a small mexican coke bottle that you buy for $1...but the worst part was the service. Like if they didn't even care. There was 4 of us and one of us ordered a.damn salad, and we all finished our meals and the salad never came, we asked the manager to just cancel it at that point because everyone was done with their meals and he just said, ok.... no apologies, no let me make it up to you...nothing. so someone left without dinner...terrible service in my opinion...never going back.
