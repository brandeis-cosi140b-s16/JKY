My husband and I have been going to this location since they opened. We love their food, but service has become horrible. We placed an order online at 5:30 and pick up time was 6:15. Once we arrived we were told our order wasn't ready. Come to find out, our order wasn't even started. Once everything was made they then told us it would be another 20 minutes for queso. We were asked if we wanted to speak to a manager and we replied yes. After 5 minutes we then were told that they were out of chips and waiting on another batch. Finally another 5 minutes passed and chips were ready. (Whole time our burritos were sitting out getting cold). Still no manager and still no queso we took what was ready and left. 

When we finally got our food home. Our kids quesadilla was missing and the guacamole was already turning brown. My husband called the store to speak to a manager. He was on hold for ten minutes before she took the call. She did offer for us to come back for the missing food, but it was just too late and too fare of a drive to even make it worth it. 

We will not be going to this location ever again. We will find another restaurant to take our business.
