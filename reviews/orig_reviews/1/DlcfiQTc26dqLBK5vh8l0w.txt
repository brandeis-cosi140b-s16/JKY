Terrible.  The place was empty, yet I was served by beer in a HOT glass?  odd.  I ordered beef fajitas, and they were terrible, with much of it being such bad meat it was inedible.  The food was also extremely bland.  I asked for chips and salsa, only to never get any.

It was terrible, and I wont go back in my travels to Phoenix.
