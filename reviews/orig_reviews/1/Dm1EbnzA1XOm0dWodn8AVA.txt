WHAT A HORRIBLE PLACE! PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE. With so many great places in Vegas.. Don't waste your time at this place

1. The food was a cheap/horrible attempt at mexican- very dried out and tasteless
2. The waitress never came around with our drinks, even after asking 3times
3. Pricing was way too high for the quality of food and service
