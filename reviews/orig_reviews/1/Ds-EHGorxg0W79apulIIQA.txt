With the mix of good and bad reviews I thought that we should give this place the benefit of the doubt as it is very visually appealing. I was totally wrong - it really is that bad. The decor and service were all fine but the food was terrible and a real struggle to finish (I hate leaving food). The Queso Fundido was the last dish to arrive; fortunately it was a minuscule portion as it was so rubbery and unappetizing. One to avoid.
