Warning, Do Not go here!!
Went here with a group of friends Halloween weekend.  Our group paid the cover charge to get in, they had advertised on facebook that women are free to get in which was not true.  As soon as we paid to get in my husband was turned around two steps in the door by the bouncers to the parking lot and informed him he can't go in.  My husband went peacefully outside and asked for his money back that they took from him for a cover charge.  He was then tackled to the ground by the thug bouncers busting open his lip and giving him a sprang ankle.  He was out in the parking lot!  My husband was not hostile, and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason!  This place doesn't care about it's customers and feels it's in their right to assault anyone they choose to pick on.  Do not support this club/restaurant... I will be telling everyone to stay far away.. My husband is a gentle man and would not cause any trouble. Also the club is loud, overpriced, crowded, dirty, and has really shitty music..
