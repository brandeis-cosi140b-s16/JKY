Poor service on multiple visits so it's time for an update.  The most recent involved being seated at the bar with no acknowledgment from the bartender who then left the bar for a several minutes.  No greeting.  No drink order.  Nothing.  Did I not exist?  What if the other patrons at the bar needed something?  For the quasi-upscale places like this, you simply should not experience this sort of thing.  Ever.  I walked.

They're also hyping their Herradura tequila bottled for them, but they embarrass themselves by serving it chilled.  This isn't vodka.  Coldness mutes the aromas and flavors.  And tequila just isn't served chilled anyway.  What a joke.  I was polite in pointing out the issue with serving a premium tequila this way, and apparently they've received that criticism/concern in the past... yet they continue to do it anyway.
