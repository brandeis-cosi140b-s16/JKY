visited here on a Tuesday evening, we asked to sit inside as it was only a second date. we got seated outside there were a few babies so here and there a laugh and a scream. we ordered and were trying to have conversation, a huge group walked in. we could barely hear ourselves think let alone hear each other. the group kept getting bigger and bigger. I was finishing up my meal the queso dip that wasn't that great. A lady came over and said someone said we wanted to talk to her we didn't we only wanted our check. 
she contuied to apologized and then said that they tried to seat the group down stairs but they weren't having it. this is where I think she let down her customers. she said that the group keep getting bigger and bigger. She offered to buy us some drinks not even help with our bill. we spent 70.00 for crap food and worse environment. will never visit here again and will tell everyone.
