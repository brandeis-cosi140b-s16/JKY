I couldn't give no stars, so I had to give it one.  Don't waste your money here.  The most horrible Mexican food ever.  Sure, you get 99 cent margaritas on Tues., but not unless you order at least a 7.00 meal.  I had to sit through a concert with the most horrible indigestion I have ever had.  The margarita tasted like pure lime juice, couldn't even taste any alcohol.  I took all but  two bites home for the dog.  The next day I took another bite of the rice and beans, wondering if it had just been my stomach, but got the same awful taste and indigestion. horrible place to eat.
