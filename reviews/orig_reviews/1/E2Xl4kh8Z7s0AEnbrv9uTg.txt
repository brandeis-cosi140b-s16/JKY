I went to this place on a Sunday morning and it was a complete mess. People were waiting 30 minutes for a burrito. One guy walked out because he did not get his order. I waited 30 minutes and when I still did not have my order, I asked the girl at the counter. In an rude and angry voice, she said that it had gone out "a long time ago," which is funny because I was sitting right by the counter. So this place is slow and they lie to you.
