We stayed at the flamingo hotel, which is awesome, but we were hungry and this place was inside and convenient. Saw all the negative reviews but said what the hell we'll try it. TERRIBLE MISTAKE. This place absolutely sucks. I ordered Tacos for $17.00. I figured it would come with rice and beans, ITS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. Got 3 tacos, thats it, nothing else. I could have gone to taco bell and got more food. And on top of that, my fiance ordered a cheese quesadilla, the dumbass waiter brought out steak. We told him he had made a mistake but we'll take it anyway because we were hungry. He charged us for steak. But what drove me crazy is the drink prices, my god what a f'n ripoff. I realize its vegas but im not buying a large pitcher for $39.00. And if that waiter still works there, hes a total idiot. Kept on asking why we weren't drinking and was getting annoyed with us. Im assuming its because they get a commission for drink sales. $44 for 3 tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and water. If i could rate no stars i would. THIS PLACE SUCKS, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
