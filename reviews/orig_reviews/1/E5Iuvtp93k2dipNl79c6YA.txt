I understand this is a "modern" Mexican restaurant but... I don't believe it's Mexican at all! I'm Mexican... There is nothing Mexican about melting cheddar yellow cheese with sausage and calling it queso fundido with chorizo! Wow not to mention ceviche means cooked by means of acid so using lime to cook fish usually means ceviche!!! No one in Mexico puts tomato sauce in ceviche this is not modern! This place pretty much butchered Mexican culture! I'm not even gonna make a big deal about the manager's outfit! Peace
