I tried this place for the first time today after seeing it on The Food Network some time ago. I have to say, the person working the sample counter was very helpful in explaining the ordering process. 

However, the food was not worth the money. I was seriously disappointed in the quality and quantity of it. I had the Jade Red chicken and it was very bland. The breading was too thick, the chicken stringy and odd tasting and hardly any sauce on the chicken itself. There also were no vegetables in sight. Not healthy at all. Like many other reviewers have also stated, the food goes right through you. 

I wanted to like this place, I really did. It is an interesting concept but falls way short. On a side note, my family was sitting under the ginormous TV and one of the other patrons decided to crank the TV volume way up. We couldn't hold a conversation after that and decided to just leave rather than complain to management. Overall, a very disappointing visit and I won't be going back.
