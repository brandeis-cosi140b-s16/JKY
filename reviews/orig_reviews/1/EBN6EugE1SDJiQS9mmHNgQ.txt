My friend and I ate here on a whim earlier this summer because we were craving Mexican food and it looked nice and authentic. It was quite possibly the worst Mexican food either of us had ever had. There was a ton of people finishing up eating because they had just come from a softball game or something. My friend and I ordered the flautas combo meal, both which came with guacamole. It came out right away, but it was stone cold. Like it had been sitting there, maybe they were anticipating someone from the game would order the flautas meal but no one ever did, and they gave it to us instead? The outside was stale, the meat inside (shredded chicken and beef) was soo dry, tasteless, and crunchy (yes, crunchy from being left out for so long). Also, neither of our meals had guacamole on the plate even though it was supposed to come with it. So the waitress gave us $1 off each meal instead of bringing out some guacamole.:( The beans were so watery, it seemed like they were running out because so many people were in before we came in so they added water to them. Like we definitely could have used a straw to drink the beans. $22 later we hardly tasted our meals and had to leave because we could not physically make ourselves eat the food. We maybe just had a bad experience because we were coming in right after all the baseball/softball people were leaving, but still, neither of us would ever come back. The people who work here are super nice, if the food was decent I'd return.
