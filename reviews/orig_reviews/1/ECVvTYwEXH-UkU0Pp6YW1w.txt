Not a fan.  Just took the family here to try it out.  Ordered the steak burrito and fish tacos.  The burrito was overwhelmed with the flavor from the sauce.  The fish had bones in it.  The rice was crunchy from being undercooked.  Was not very happy with this meal.  Total price, with one soda, was ~$24.  We will not eat here again.  Chipotle is better.
