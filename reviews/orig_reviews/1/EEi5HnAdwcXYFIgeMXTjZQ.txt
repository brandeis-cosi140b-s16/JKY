I should've known something was up when I stuck to the floor walking to my table.
Service was friendly but the best part of my meal was the Diet Coke. 

I got something with shrimp in hatch Chili cheese sauce. The shrimp tasted very old & both the shrimp & cheese tasted like they had been stored in a very dirty refrigerator.  I could actually taste the spoiled food & mold.  Hubby had a chicken burrito & was also suspicious  of the quality of the chicken. 

I took leftovers home for the sole purpose of sending them to the health department if I got sick. 

I will definitely avoid ever coming back here unless I drink enough alcohol to kill the bacteria I could taste in the food.
