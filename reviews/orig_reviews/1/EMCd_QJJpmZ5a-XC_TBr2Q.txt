The menu looked great and delicious! The reviews and location really swayed my friends and I to stop by. Unfortunately, the lack of service made us leave because our "server" failed to show up after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting. So we went to grab a guarantee nice bite at Eriberto's on Osborn and 7th Ave :)!
