Note: I did not eat here.

First off, I hate paying more than $10 per plate at a mexican food restaurant because I know a cheap, delicious and fresh place down the street. 

Second, these m-fers gave away our reservations because we were late. Now I know they have to run a business, but I told the lady we were celebrating a birthday. I mean COME ON. 

Third, they were rude and wouldn't help us find faster seating so we could catch Ka. SO F-U deigo, we went to pearl and had a great non rude time.
