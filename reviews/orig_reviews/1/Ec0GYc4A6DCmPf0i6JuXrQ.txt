I could not have been less impressed with this place.

We walked up to the hostess station inside only to be ignored by the hostess (and a second employee standing next to her) while she chatted on her walkie talkie with another employee.  Finally one of them said "You wanna eat?".  No, we randomly walk up to hostess stations all over the city without the intention of eating there.  I was ready to go but my friend had a groupon so he wanted to try it. 

We were then sent to the outside hostess station to be ignored by *4* more employees.  Seriously - how many employees do you need to stand around chatting with each other??  One girl even had her leg sprawled across the narrow entranceway to the outside seating.  The hostess went to seat us but didn't tell her to move her leg so she continued to chitchat and block the entrance while we waited.  I don't know who manages this place but he/she needs to get on the ball.

After being seated we were greated by our waiter (something Kennedy?) who was very nice but seemed to want to rush us.  

The drinks were served in plastic cups but I have to admit my drink was good (their version of a Long Island Iced Tea).  The prices are not that great (which we expected on the strip) and the food sucked.  It looked like it was going to be tasty but couldn't have been more bland.  There were no condiments offered and there was NOTHING on the table, even salt.

I would never go here again.  Its typical drunk-touron crap.  Bad food, bad employees, bad pricing.
