I went to this place knowing that it was fast food mexican.  The food was just ok and I've tried it a few times. The people that work there are never nice and have never said Hi or thank you. I'm obviously not going there for the atmosphere but c'mon you could have some manners. 
The last time I ate here the girl started mopping under my table that I was eating at and all of the others beside me. The smell of the floor cleaner was so overwhelming it got me sick. I did tell her not to mop near me but should I have to? I won't be eating here again. Even if the food was good it's not worth the attitude this place gives.
