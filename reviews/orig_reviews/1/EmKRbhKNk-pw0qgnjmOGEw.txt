Came back to give this place another try, stupid me..I gave this place a 1 start because yelp doesn't allow a 0 . 
I can sum this place up in a few words... 
WORST SERVICE. 
The servers had absolutely no personality.. The place is very modern and I love that. Working in such an upbeat place you would think the employees would have an upbeat personality, or any personality for that matter. To the server who always wears a pony tail and white tank( don't know your name because you never introduced yourself) , if you hate your job so much, get a different one. We couldn't even tell her our food came out wrong because she ran away. Servers, do yourself a favor and write down the orders because our experience shows that you can't remember them. My company had the enchiladas with no onions, first thing she tasted was onions. 
Food wasn't all that great either, disappointed..
