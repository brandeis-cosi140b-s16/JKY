First off, our waitress, who's name was Vanesa with 1 "S" sucked, sad to say...
She literally took forever to walk over to us every time.  We ordered chips and salsa but she lagged so terribly, we had to cancel the order.  So we came here during happy hour and got the Margaritas, buy one get one free.  It tasted like juice.  My friends and I wanted to send it back to the kitchen.  We also ordered enchiladas and it was not good at all.  What a disgrace.  And you would think having a Mexican name in the restaurant name and hispanic servers would give this place credit.  Nope!
