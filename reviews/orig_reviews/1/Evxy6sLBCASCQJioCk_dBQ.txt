Dooooo NOT go here. They will LITERALLY take your money. I went with a group of friends on taco tuesday/final basketball game, which i understand gets super busy but a good server doesn't make excuses. My server was very nice but never refilled my ONE glass of water and took her THREE times to bring me a lemon wedge (by the time she brought it I was 2 tacos in of my 3). Finally, my total came to $8.20. I was the only one of my 6 friends paying in cash so i put a $10 bill and .80 cents down. She came back and gave everyone else their cards and walked away! She still owed me $2 and she just took them! I honestly wasnt even going to tip her but LUCKILY FOR HER she got to STEAL my $2, way to go Kenadee!
