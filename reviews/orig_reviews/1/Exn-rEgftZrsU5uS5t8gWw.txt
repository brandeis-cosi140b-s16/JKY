Arrived on a weekday early evening around 5 pm. Their was plenty of strip booths available but the hostesses said they were reserved. Never again will I dine here, hostesses are saving best seats for their Hispanic friends, they treat Caucasians very bad here, so many better choices for Mexican food in  Las Vegas and Henderson.

Very unsatisfied yours,
