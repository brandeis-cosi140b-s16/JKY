Nope...No way... Nuh uh, don't do it. 5 hours after eating here my stomach is still churning. Not in a good way, mind you. And here's a memo to management: When it's 114 degrees outside, I'd like it to be less than 100 INSIDE WHILE I AM EATING!!!! Bad food and inside temps that had me sweating, not a good combo. Also had a rather limited menu, not too many items on it. Just say no.
