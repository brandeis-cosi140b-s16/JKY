One word could describe this whole place - Why?

Why did the owner decide to open a restaurant?
Why did the chef decide he/she knew anything about cooking?
Why is the Silverton the only casino in town who is getting no applications for its open positions? (ok, well that one's a no brainer).

It took only one bite, although I am often a fool and will continue to eat more despite what my taste buds are screaming at me.

My meal was simple - Chicken Tortilla Soup - how can you mess that up?

Well let me tell you, Mi Casa messed it up with flare and extravagance.

After tax, the so-called bowl of so-called soup was the better part of $9.00. But it was far from a bowl and its only resemblance to soup was the way it dripped off my spoon. Oh, and a bowl is a bowl - not a cup.

Here's a bit of advice for the chef - Chicken Tortilla soup is not a beef broth base, and certainly not a broth made from beef bouillon cubes.

The soup was so harsh (let me emphasize harsh here), it almost made both me and my dinner companion gag with disgust.
