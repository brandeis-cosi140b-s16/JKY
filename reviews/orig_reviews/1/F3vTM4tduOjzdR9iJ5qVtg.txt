This is my 2nd bad review of this restaurant, the 1st i did via open table back in august 2014 but chose this way since it is more visible and again it is my 2nd bad review and perhaps it will be noticed more by the restaurant. My husband and I decided to do an impromptu supper/movie date night. The restaurant next door had a 1.5 hour wait, cantina had none so we chose to go there. We were sat immediately and noticed that the seating had changed as did the look of the menu. We waited, and waited at our table and were not acknowledged at all by anyone.  My husband and I are very patient, we both worked in the industry and understand things can get busy but it is expected that someone should have acknowledged us, even if it was to say "ill be right with  you". I looked at my cell phone  after being there a bit and said to my husband "if no one comes in 3 minutes were are leaving", I waited 4 and we got u p and left. We stopped by the hostess stand to let them know why we were leaving and decide to walk to one of the other restaurants in the plaza. The manager did chase us down and apologized (which was definitely appreciated and warranted) but we had a movie to catch and were not happy, it was too late. This is the 1st time I have ever walked out of a restaurant, it was the 2nd time we had a huge issue with service. I do not think we will be back, we waited a long time between our last disappointment and this time and were let down again. Again,we understand things happen but I can tell you that one of the 1st tings I learned in every restaurant I ever worked in is, patrons should be greeted in some capacity as quickly as possible (within 3 minutes).  Perhaps this is one reason they had no wait while their competitor had 1.5 hours.
