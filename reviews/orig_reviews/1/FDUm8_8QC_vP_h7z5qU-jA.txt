The food is OK but I'm really pissed about their limited menu after 9pm.  Some shithead of a manager decided they are only serving Quesadilla's and Burittos tonight.  What the hell?  It's 9pm and there still alot of flights leaving.  Why such a limited menu?  The food here is all based on about 10 ingredients put together in different ways (meat, beans, rice, tortillas, etc).   So why can't I get a taco or a salad?
