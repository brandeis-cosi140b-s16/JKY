This was the most disappointing night here at this location. The waiter was unfriendly, never smiled and acted like he was mad all night. Beverages were not refilled for some of our party and I was never even asked if I wanted another margarita. Oh, and the margarita was watered down and I could not even taste the premium tequila that I ordered. the only thing that was good was the food. Yummy as always so at least the kitchen staff rocks. We will never return to this location again as our experience each time has gone downhill.
