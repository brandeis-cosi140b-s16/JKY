Come for the overpriced, mediocre tacos. Stay for the atrocious service! First (and last) time for me at this place. Went through the drive thru and after being told to wait a minute by the speaker, I waited over 5 minutes to place my order. Also, the order was wrong. And in a town with truly outstanding street tacos, these are not remotely worth $3 per taco. Maybe the burgers are better. I won't be back to find out.
