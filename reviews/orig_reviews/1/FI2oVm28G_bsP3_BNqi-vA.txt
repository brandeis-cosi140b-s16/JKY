Honestly, I'm a bit surprised by the number of good reviews.  My experience was far from positive.

Service was terrible.  As the four of us in our party observed, the waitress made a habit of bringing hot food out on a cart from the kitchen, and rather than immediately serve it to the table, she would stop by other tables on the way, takes orders, ask if they needed anything, etc.  This happened multiple times.  Seems to me that should be the other way around.

I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The rest of my party was served their food about 10 minutes before mine.  That is also unacceptable.  They felt bad about eating without me, and I didn't want their food to get cold.  The kitchen needs to learn how to time food so an entire table's order comes out at once.

We had to ask our waitress several times for napkins, silverware, and salsa.

After all of this, the food was sub-par.  My chicken lacked any resemblance of flavor.  The rice and re-fried beans were fine, except for the clearly over-cooked, dried out edges of beans around the plate.  The only person who mostly enjoyed their food had ordered a chicken quesadilla.  At least they can get cheese and tortillas to cook right.

They also charge $2.50 for a second helping of chips and salsa.  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where they charge for more chips & salsa.

Overall, being my first Mexican restaurant experience in Arizona, I'm VERY disappointed(come on guys, I can throw a rock to the border.  I expected better!)  

I definitely won't be back.
