This review is based on the sleazy tactics used by the waiter. We had a few hours before catching our flight home. We wanted an outdoor venue. They do have a nice location right on the strip but slightly elevated. I looked at the menu and order the Shrimp Taco's. The waiter decided that I would like the Sammy Shrimp better. When he brought it out, I asked him where my taco's were. He said, "I thought you might like this better."
Everyone else had their food and we had a flight to catch so I said "whatever". It wasn't that good but it was food. 
When I got the bill, he charged me for Shrimp and not the tacos. The Shrimp is the most expensive plate on the menu. I said no way, I didn't order that. I said bill me for what I ordered. 
He went to check with the manager and came back and said she said no. He then trys to play the guilt trip on me by saying he will take it out of his own pocket. That may work on some people. I said I will talk to the manager. He stopped me and said he would ask again. He came back and offered to take $5 off. I know this is a scam that they use to increase average bill. They may even get bonuses for selling the most expensive items. Sad.
