While the food is a tad bit better than average, the customer service is non-existent.  Brought  45 people in for a preplanned luncheon.  Macayo's botched the buffet, by letting it run out despite the contract calling for a refresh.  Granted they finally refilled, but only after a long delay.   Macayo's forgot several meals, yet constant reminders managed to get them served well after everyone else had ate.

Forget dealing with macayo's planners, they fail big time!

They might be OK with onsies and twosies tables, but I wouldn't count on that either.

Taco Bell would be a better bet.
