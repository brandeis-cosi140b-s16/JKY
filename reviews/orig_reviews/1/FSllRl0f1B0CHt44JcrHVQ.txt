We had lunch here with family.  The chips are fine but their salsa is little more than a red pepper sauce, no tomatoes or other ingredients.  I ordered a combination plate with a green verde pork burrito and the green sauce was so over powering that it ruined the dish.  The beef enchilado was o-kay but the chicken taco was dry.
My wife had the vegetable fajitas and the vegetable mix was little more than a lot of green peppers and little else...
Not returning here.....
