Came in with a large group after making reservations.  Took about an hour and a half to get our food.  When we got it about 75% of the plates were cold.  Expected a better experience from a place such as this in Las Vegas.  The manager took care of the bill which was nice but I would not recommend this place to anyone else.  The plates that were warm were mediocre at best.  Save your money and go somewhere else, Las Vegas has many other places to offer.
