Omg! What is that smell?! The last 2 times we went there it smells like a sewer pipe broke under the restaurant!  We actually left the second time, the moment we walked through the door!  The first time was a month before and they hadn't fixed this?! It's like eating in a dirty toilet!  Won't be back and it's a shame because their food is good!
