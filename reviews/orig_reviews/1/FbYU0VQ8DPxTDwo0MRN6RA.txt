Came in for breakfast with some friends after a 5k downtown. Waited 25 minutes for our food. Watched 2 tables who came in after us get their food before we did. When our food finally came out, our nachos looked liked it was sitting under a heater for 10 minutes. Buddy ordered his eggs scrambled, but his eggs came over easy. Another friend ordered 2 shrimp tacos, but only got one. Complete utter mess of a dining experience.
