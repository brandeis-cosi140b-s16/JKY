We went to Salty Senorita's last night to celebrate a birthday with about 25 people.  I was skeptical to start with because I had been there before and my experience wasn't great.   At least they are consistent.

The only good thing going for Salty Senorita's is the outdoor environment.  The food and the service is some of the worst I have experienced.  

I know "Salty" is in the name of the venue, but the amount of salt in the food is just ridiculous.  A friend of mine waited over an hour for a salad. We waited an hour for our carne asada tacos that were filled with steak bits that were burned to a crisp.  Another person in our group ordered wings. After about 45 minutes she asked the server when her wings would be coming.  The server said she brought them awhile ago and gave them to some "dark haired" woman at the other end of the table.

The unlimited chips and salsa mean nothing other than a consolation prize and even the salsa isn't that great.

There are plenty of other places in the area to get decent mexican food.  After going to Salty Senorita's, I can say this isn't one of them.  If you are simply looking for a cool place to hang out and get drinks, then this place is it but I recommend you eat elsewhere.
