Food is decent.  Yummy guac made at the table. The meal itself was ok. However I cannot in good conscience give high stars to a restaurant who limits a military discount to "just the active duty member". If you are going to offer a discount it should be extended to their family members at the table also. Not just the military members meal. Seriously?! Who does that? We used to get the discount off the whole ticket. Not sure when that changed. Been going to this restaurant ages. Going to rethink that now. There are plenty of other options in Mexican cuisine. Those who do offer the "whole" table... children and the spouses of military a discount without them being present. It may seem I'm being petty over a few dollars. It's just the way I was treated when I enquired. When I took my children without my husband. Shame on this restaurant being so close to a military installation and being this stingy. Especially when every time I go their is plenty of military handing over their money. Keeping this business open.
