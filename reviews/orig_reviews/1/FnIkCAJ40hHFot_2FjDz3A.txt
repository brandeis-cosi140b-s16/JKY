Went to this place cause I heard it was good. What a disappointment, tacos were horrible. First the meat has no flavor and when I got them they were cold. The guacamole was crap I couldn't believe people give this dump 5 stars. I'm from Los Angeles and I've had way better tacos at taco trucks. So if you're in Vegas don't waste your time coming here unless you like eating cold and no flavor tacos
