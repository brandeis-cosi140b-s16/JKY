To be honest, I'm a fair person who gives legitimate reviews. I find it disrespectful when a person says they can't allow anyone to enter who serves a drink within the hotel. In my opinion, I think it's all lame. If a hotel allows Fat Tuesday to be served while T&T says no to Fat Tuesday at their restaurant then that's a little BS. This is one of the main reasons why I don't book my stay at Luxor.

"Have a drink! But you can bring it anywhere else."

Also, I hate how the "manly" employee came up and said rudely I could t not bring a drink from the same hotel in a restaurant.  He tried my time and other's time at the LUXOR and will not be coming back here spend a dime.

I wish this gets reviewed by LUXOR and lays down a simple law to allow a simple rule to allow anyone to not give a damn like other restaurants.

T&T sucks because of this.

It's VEGAS!
