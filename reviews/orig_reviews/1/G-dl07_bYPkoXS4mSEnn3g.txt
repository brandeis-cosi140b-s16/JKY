We've been going to Chapalas for over 30 years, the mild salsa and unlimited chips were untouchable, service was average but the good food and short wait times made up for it. However, on our last experience the disgust that was felt by our entire party was unfathomable. The chips were stale, cold and over cooked, salsa mediocre at best. The food took over an hour to come out. Only 1/6 dishes was edible. The beef was RAW in the middle, the refried beans were grey and looked like diarrhea, and all the food was cold. When we told our waiter the beef was raw he began to get agitated and said it wasn't raw even after showing him. He even had the nerve to come back to the table staying so what do you want me to do about it, we asked for a manager who never came. He was the rudest server we've ever experienced, he acted like he was doing is a favor and never even apologized to us. We will NEVER go back here; if you plan too beware that you'll probably leave with food poisoning and need a trip to the ER!
