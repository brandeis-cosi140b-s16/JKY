I don't know what authentic Michoacan style is exactly but if it's it's gummy, goopy, and icky, they've got it down to a science. When I go out with friends, we tend to order one of each but nothing here was particularly good and several items were particularly bad. Also, $9 for guacamole? One avocado and some tomato is not worth the money to me. Mind you, I'm not cheap and am often told a very generous tipper to boot but I do expect my money's worth. 
The waiter was so busy gossiping that the busboy had to attend to us and even though we barely ate more than a bite and voiced our displeasure, they said "Oh" and that was that. Take your $45 somewhere else, even if it's to the grocery store to cook for yourself.
