The only good thing about this place was the chips, salsa, and bean dip. My sister and I both got burritos enchilada style.  When we got our food, all we could taste was SALT. Then when we took the leftovers home, my brother in law ate them and found a hard dirt clod in the beans. We will definitely not be back! And to be honest, I wouldn't have even given it one star if I didn't have to.
