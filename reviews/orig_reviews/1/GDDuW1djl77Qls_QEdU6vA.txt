We were there before they changed their menu and were a tapas restaurant. Before, the food was delicious and since they've changed it, it's horrendous.  My bf got the chimichunga and he said it was just a bunch of meat and cheese that they rolled up to make it a big burrito. He said it tasted like nothing, no flavor.  I got the shrimp taco which also tasted like nothing but I can taste the chared shrimp. I also got the fish taco and del taco's fish taco is  actually better than theirs and finally got their veggie taco. Our waitress said the veggie taco was her favorite...it had no taste whatsoever. It was basically a bunch of meat and cheese and veggies made to fit in a taco. 

Oh, our appetizers was plain nachos and it taste like pepperoni pizza rolls with guacamole and sour cream on top.  The pizza rolls itself taste better than their nachos. It seems like they fried their chips and then added cheese and baked it and then added the pico, guacamole, and sour cream.

Overall, the place was better as a tapas Spanish restaurant and before they changed their menu. We will not be going back to toros.
