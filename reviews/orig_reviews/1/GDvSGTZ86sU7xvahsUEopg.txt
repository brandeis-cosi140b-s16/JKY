We were sat immediately, and the bouncer went to tell the hostess that he sat us. A gentleman brought us waters and said a server would be right with us. After about 10 minutes, another gentleman came by to tell us that he would get a server. After about 15 more minutes, I asked for the manager. She told me that they were short on servers for the shift.

I work in a restaurant, I know what that's like. But if a table was sitting there for 20-25 minutes, and didn't have a server or menus, and the only person to help was a busser/expo (sorry, I don't know what his job title was), I would say that it was a very, very, very poorly run restaurant. And if the servers were short handed, the manager SHOULD be the one to help pick up the slack, not be standing by the p.o.s. system asking me what I want to drink when I tell her I've been waiting for 25 minutes for a menu. 

Needless to say, I left. The food might be good.
