I saw this huge jar of olives and by gosh I wanted a handful!!! Little did I know... The bartender stuck his dirty hand right in the jar and grabbed a handful of olives out!!! Please wash your hands in and on my olives before you serve them to me... I would appreciate the germs and filth from you handling money all day on my olives to go please!!!! What bar-tending school did these people go to??? Why don't you also squeeze my lemon with ur filthy hand into my drink while you are at it??? Will you charge me extra for that service too please??? This place sux and btw my enchiladas were horrible!!! Has anyone ever  even been to Mexico??? If you are going to serve mexican food please at least make one trip down south so you know how it is supposed to be made!!!!! Any idiot can look up a recipe for a dish and mess it up cause you have no idea how it is supposed to taste!!! This restaurant was just as bad as the motel it was attached to!!!!
