My daughter loves the salad but we are not going to bring her to get it any more. Every single time I bring her we are rushed in line and receive the WORST customer service. I am also gluten sensitive and when I asked for gluten free options no options were available. I was told that maybe the grilled chicken is ok... just not good enough. Fail on customer service. Fail on gluten free.
