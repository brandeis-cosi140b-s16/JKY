The worst ever!!! Food sucked, service worse, manager worst of all. When things things are bad it's one thing, but when the manager Alan says, "You knew what you would get and you knew you would be expected to pay for it no matter how it came out." That is just unacceptable! Don't come here.  There are too many places with good food in town to waste your time & money on s place like this!
