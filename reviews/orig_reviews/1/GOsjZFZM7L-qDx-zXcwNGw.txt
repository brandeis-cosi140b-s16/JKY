As a Native Texan, I have higher standards for Mexican food. Even when it's the cheapest in town, it ought to be a step above cardboard. My beans were clearly canned, the taco shells were burnt and the lettuce was limp. On top of that I suspect the only seasonings available under that roof were salt and pepper. The meat was dry and burnt and the rice was hard. The plates were paper, which is okay for fast food, but from the outside it didn't look like a fast food place, But as soon as you walk in you see the chain maze for the line and the menu on the wall, should have walked out right then and there. but the worst thing of all was that my chips and salsa was actually chips and hot sauce. they didn't even have real salsa. it was in a squirt bottle if that gives you an idea of how liquidy it was. it was not the chunky salsa i expect at a mexican place. terrible.

I cannot think of any place in my lifetime that has had worse mexican food, and I lived in GEORGIA for seven years. Even the peach state had better mexican food.

I wouldn't say that it was unclean, just standard fast food levels of sanitation. decor was terrible, and atmosphere was meh.

never again
