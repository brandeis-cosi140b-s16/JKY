Over priced food for less than sufficient portions.
ex: $12 for 6 small pieces of "shu mai" dumplings.  I can do without the gold flakes and just pay at most $3 for it.

I like salty food, but the chinese food here is way too salty.  

Also, what's up with the names of the asian dishes?  Each dish name sounds like a Kung Fu movie...With these names, you have to sit there and read the entire description of the dish before you know what you're ordering.  For example...they had a dish called "swallow a cloud," um...why can't you just call it wonton noodle or something similar to the dish so it's easier to recognize.  I understand it may "fun" names...but it's not run having to sit there and read every single dish.
