San Felipe's happy hour is great, but that would be about it. I was there today, and the service was AWFUL. I was with one person, and it was not busy when we arrived. However, our server did manage to forget to bring my beer right off the bat. She was honest and apologized for forgetting, which I understood those things can happen. BUT when our order came out we were missing a side of sour cream. Our server did come by to check on us til we were two bites away from finishing. (Nor did anyone else walk by or we would've stopped them.) When she finally did stop by again, we declined another round (we were both over it by this point) and told her we were finished. We sat there for literally over 15 mins with my credit card on the table waiting for her to bring the tab. I'm not being over dramatic, we were both looking at our phones constantly, looking at the time. I actually had to get up and go find my server so that we could pay. When she saw me all she said "oh." She clearly forgot about us AGAIN. There was no apology of course. 
I've working in the restaurant industry since I was 18 and experiences like this are incredibly frustrating. Sure, there Happy Hour is good, but there are many other places with great happy hour and much better service.
