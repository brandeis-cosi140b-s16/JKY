I paid $14 for a burger with fries that are cold and saggy, there was no flavor in the burger but sweet grilled onions, i had to take my order to go, and none of the servers would help me out cuz they thought no table to no tip am sure, but i ended up tipping the guy who cleaned up the tables i think it was the shift manager too ( weird)  who was the only one who would listen to me and took care of my order!!! Never eating there again. Oh ya am an employee at the airport and i never rated a food place before so thats shows you how bad this place could be.
