Does all of scottsdale eat at poor serviced, bad chips and salsa places and so this is the norm?

I live in Seattle people and it's hard to believe but yes, I've had better food at the taco truck down the street. AND the service was better.

let's start with the location.  they sat us at the two top right next to the parking lot, why is this even a table??  it's next to all the nastee exhaust fumes and no good views of anything except for the ugly ass tree next to us.

The chips and salsa were 1. under salted and 2. under flavored and 3. stale.  Gross.

I ordered the fish tacos and the corn chowder.. which had to be doused with Tapatio.  and my dinner mate had the 'best dish in the house' which was a carnitas dish.  um.. we should have left after they refused to move us.

poor poor experience.  Don't go here if you want a decent meal.
