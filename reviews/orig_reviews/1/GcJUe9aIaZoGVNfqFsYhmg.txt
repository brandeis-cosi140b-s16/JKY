Whatever you do, do NOT use your credit card at this place.  I left my credit card at the bar and realized it the next morning.  I called and they confirmed that the card was there.  I called a few days later to make sure it was okay to send my husband to pick up the card.  They said as long as I gave him my license, it was fine.  That wasn't the case when he got there.  He wasted 30 minutes because the manager said due to liability, they couldn't give him my card... regardless of what his employee said.  I was extremely frustrated, especially since he was not willing to work with me at all.  I told him that I was disappointed because I could have sent whatever proof they needed, even skyped for proof and if I would have known he couldn't pick up the card, I wouldn't have wasted his time.  I even asked if they could mail the card and he said no. I sent a letter explaining my frustration and never heard back. So a few days later, I drive out to Chandler myself only to find out that my card was missing.  No one could find it but they promised to call me that day.  2 weeks later, still no card and no call.  And even though they acknowledged that they received my letter while I was there, they never responded. I called today to learn that they cut up the cards after a week because so many people  leave their cards there.  Sooooo frustrated, not with the policy, but it seems their employees should know the policy.  It would have saved me two trips, totaling an hour of wasted time and frustration.  If you MUST go to this place, use cash.
