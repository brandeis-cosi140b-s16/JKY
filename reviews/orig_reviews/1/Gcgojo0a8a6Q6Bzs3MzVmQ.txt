This used to be my favorite place to eat until two days ago when I had found a hair in my third taco. I have ordered the same meal for the past three years, but for some odd reason the lady handling pico and lettuce would not allow me to get the pico in the tacos and insisted on putting it on the side. An unfortunate experience for myself.
