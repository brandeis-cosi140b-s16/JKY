This is my first bad review so just bare with me. The location is terrific. It is located on the corner of Fashion Show mall and is a great setting for potential people watching. Those are the good things. After that there is nothing good about this place. I was seated by the hostess who appeared to be having a bad day. It took a long time for the waitress to show up. For every interaction I had with my waitress there was a ridiculously long wait and the place was not crowded. It was a Wednesday around 7-8 o'clock. Ordered a drink and bottled water; it took forever for her to know if they sold bottled water. When she found out then she placed my drink order. I ordered dinner and it took too long for the food to come out. I ordered the grilled fish taco's. They brought me half a fish and tortilla with rice and beans. The flour tortillas were not very good and it turned into me forcing the food down. Never saw the waitress again until I flagged her down for the check. After that I never saw her again. The bill was $41.92 and I left $42 on the table. Just a horrible experience overall. Such potential but an utter disappointment.
