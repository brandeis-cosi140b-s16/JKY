So, I went here the first time like 2 and a half yrs ago. I really liked it, so I decided to go there when someone gave me a gift certificate there.

I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend ordered a grilled chicken breast.

She was eating it and was like this taste soo bad. I was like let me try!

I took one bite and the chicken tasted soo badly of fish it was soo gross.

Why would the chicken taste like fish?!?!

Well needless to say she got food poisoning and had to miss work for the next day.

Although they do have a tranny that works there and she is really nice. We always get her as our server and she gave us the "family "discount when we came.

But, I wont eat there again
