High school girls seating patrons badly, waiters bringing plates and bowls long after the food was served (?). Mundo survives for one reason...only restaurant near Smith's theater. If Smith's would so much as start serving hotdogs and nachos, Mundo would close down. Until then Las Vegas will not have a Broadway class theater. Patrons of the Arts demand culinary choices equivalent to the Playbill.
