Came in with my mom with over an hour before our flight. Unfortunately it seems like they sat a lot of people in our waitresses section within a short amount of time because the service was terrible! 

Two different groups of people near us got their food before us even though they were seated and ordered after us. Our waitress eventually told us there was a mix up with our order in the kitchen but by that time we had to get our food to-go or miss our flight! We had to ask multiple servers for to-go boxes and our check because each would dismiss our efforts to get their attention. We also saw another woman eating a taco while exiting the restaurant because she was going to miss her flight and her friend had to pay her check.

Thankfully, they only charged us for our drinks because of the inconvenience but we will not be returning the next time we are at the airport.
