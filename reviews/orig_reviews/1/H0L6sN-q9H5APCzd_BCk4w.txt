Two! Not one,  but two roaches crawling on the table. Came in, sat and ordered then here comes a Roach crawling on the table then another! Not sure if the solar flares, the full moon, or the fact that it's Friday the 13th had anything to do with it,  but the fact that it was my first time there, the roaches made it my last time there! And the fact that the booth seating with the huge square pillars makes for an uncomfortable setting. And the energy is not good,  very off! Also, the roaches were small, meaning there are more, probably a nest! Roaches don't come out during the day unless there's an infestation! Wouldn't recommend eating here!
