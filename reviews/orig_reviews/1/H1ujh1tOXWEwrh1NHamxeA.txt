My family and some friends ate at Hecho in the MGM Grand on Tuesday, June 10th for dinner.  The waiter was somewhat pleasant but the service was very slow.  The worst part was the food.  Some of us had the burritos, fajitas, and I and another had the 3 enchiladas.  I thought it was extremely dry and very poor taste.  I didn't even finish the meal.  I thought it might just be me but everyone (party of 9) all agreed that it was the worst food we have ever had!  The table side quacamole for $10 was the only decent item but very small portion.  We spent a total of approximately $255 on this meal.  Qdoba or Chipotle would have been ten times better.  We were all disappointed and very suprised that such a lousy restaurant would be in the MGM Grand.  Save yourself a lot of money and eat at one of the other restaurants.
