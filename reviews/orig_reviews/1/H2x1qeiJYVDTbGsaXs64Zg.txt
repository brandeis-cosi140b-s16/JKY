Ordered six tacos to go and it took 30 minutes. Got the tacos and they were cold. I took them back and the bartender was rude and argumentative. She said they would remake them and I said I didn't have any more time to wait. She asked for a receipt which she didn't give in the first place. The restaurant wasn't even busy. This was my second time here, it's unlikely that I'll go back.
