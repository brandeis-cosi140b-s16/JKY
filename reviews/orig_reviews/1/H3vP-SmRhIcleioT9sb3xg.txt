The reason my wife and I ate here is because we had already been wandering around the strip for a few hours, just so happened to be in Treasure Island, and were starving!  Even under those circumstances, if I could take it back I would.  For starters, no outside drinks.  We had purchased a daiquiri at a bar upstairs just 5 minutes before in the same hotel and had to chug it to get in.  Why the hell can't I take a drink inside that I purchased in the SAME HOTEL as the restaurant?!?!?  Oh I know so I can spend more money at your restaurant!!!  Then the food was very expensive and fairly mediocre.  $17 for an average burger and fries? methinks not.  After chugging our daiquiri and having a pretty good buzz going you'd think the food would taste better.  On top of that the service was just horrible.  Pretty much as long as you're not drinking you don't exist.  I understand that I'm not getting drunk and spending a ridiculous amount of money in your restaurant but I am still a customer.  There was a table right next to us that was drinking and the waiter pretty much never left their side.  The few times the waiter wasn't there a hostess was there or some random chick making balloon hats who stood there awkwardly waiting for a tip.  Senor Frog's is clearly just out to get your money so swim clear of this place, unless you plan on getting hammered then by all means the entire staff will be at your feet.  ALL I WANTED WAS A BALLOON HAT!!! :(

P.S. my wife and I had an upset stomach for the next couple hours
