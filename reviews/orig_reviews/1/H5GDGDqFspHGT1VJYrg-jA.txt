Boy has this place gone downhill. I ordered the chicken asada salad which I had once before and which was simply heavenly. What I was presented with today did not bear any resemblance. The chicken tasted off. Instead of being laid on top the greens all the ingredients were tossed together.Hot not good tasting meat and wilted hot greens. No way was this chicken fire roasted. Although there were only two tables and a couple at the bar we had to wait forever. The cook offered to swap the bad salad for another. Just paid and left. Ingredients down hill, presentation downhill, service downhill. Companion's pork torta was just mediocre. Won't go back
