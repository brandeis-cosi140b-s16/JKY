Looked awesome but disappointed us...

Stopped on my 1st evening in Las Vegas and was very excited to have margaritas with some Mexican food. The margaritas were okay and ordered the guacamole appetizer to go with. We should have just stopped there. 

We then ordered chicken nachos & their house specialty steak tacos. The food took a long time, the waitress was slow and the food was blah. The steak was cold, nachos were just ok (we left almost the entire plate) and the tortillas were hard. 

The waitress did not even bother to ask if the had been good even after seeing our plates almost intact. We asked for check and she took forever to come for it and forever to bring it back. 

I had seen that my fellow Yelp reviewers had only been averaging 3 stars so lesson learned...listen to Yelpers!!! :)
