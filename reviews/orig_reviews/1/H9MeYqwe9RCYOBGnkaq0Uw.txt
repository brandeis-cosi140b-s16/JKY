My boyfriend and I stumbled in here after getting lost in the maze of the Cosmopolitan hotel and finding out that it was 10pm and not many places were open (surprising since this is Vegas).  It looked promising.  We were expecting a little fancy schmancy for the meal, price-wise and portion-wise, but we were in for a shock.  Extremely pricey for extrememely small protion sizes.  I understand the whole tapas concept, but these tapas were barely enough for one person to share with himself, let alone TWO whole people.  We ordered the scallop ceviche, which unbeknownst to us, was deconstructed.  I believe it was a $16 plate consisting of 4 parboiled baby scallops, like a large bay scallop (think: size of a little bouncy ball you get in a quarter machine), each sitting on a half key lime, sprinkled with what looked like paprika on top.  It tasted like a parboiled scallop sitting on top of a dry lime, sprinkled with something flavorless on top.  I cringed as I ate each scallop, thinking this was SOOO not worth $4, even for Vegas, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  Next came carnitas tacos.  2 tiny street size tacos, which i will admit were very tasty, but again, very tiny, not filling at all.  At this point we were dying.  Then came the pork siu mai to save the day.  I believe these were one of the cheaper menu items, but it had twice as much food as our first 3 plates combined.  They were really tasty too, I could tell they were hand made.  These little dumplings were our saviors, at least we could leave feeling like we ate something and not pass out from starvation on our way out the door.  I expected a little more food, flavor, and decor to make up for the bill we were presented with.   That said, I won't be coming back,  and I wish I never came.
