I was really disappointed after seeing such great reviews on Groupon. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences and food I have had in Vegas. I think Groupon needs to educate their vendors on the reason why people by groupons...to save money...NOT so that we will "get a free meal" by not spending more then the groupon amount. 

They have a good atmosphere, almost like a college bar, its fun, loud music and people pouring shots. But the food is terrible. Cold chicken and steak, like its been sitting in the back all day (worse than then chicken cubes soaking in broth at Subway) The food was just bland, no flavor or spice. My tacos came with a "side" of beans. The side was a one ounce cup filled with an over salted pile of mush. Luckily I didn't get the side of rice or guacamole that was suggested, everything was $2 or more extra. Also, what Mexican restaurant makes you pay for chips and salsa!?!? 

On top of the terrible food, our server just hassled us all night about the Groupon. We spent only 38$ since the food was so bad I couldn't bring myself to try the "delicious" dessert suggested by the waitress who also suggested the "amazing" beans. Since we only spend $38 and the Groupon was for $40 the waitress made a huge deal and said we had to order more. Then she said 'well treat me right and I can get my manager to maybe over ride it. Even though that means you are getting your meal for free"

WTF!!! Who is getting a free meal?? We BOUGHT a groupon!!!! She told us at least 5 times to tip her well because she got us a free meal. I was so angry that we even left her any tip, I would have rather spent that tip money on a slot machine. Please do yourself a favor and don't go here
