The douchy wanna-be Scottsdale type waiter took forever to get to our table. He's all grins to the cute girls at our table and won't acknowledge any guy. I could see one of the managers sitting at the bar drinking. Probably off her shift, but she's there in her spare time?  Seen other of their staff hanging out drinking too.  Maybe it's just me, but it feels awkward to be around that.  It also probably explains why their service sucks, because their employees treat the place as their personal hang out instead of their place of work.  Also, the music was loud and spazzy. I appreciate a good mash-up too, but this stuff was just painful and obnoxious. 

My guess is that the only reason this place gets business is because it's the only game in town for the Chandler/Ahwatukee area. I don't know too many people that actually enjoy going here, but it's probably the lesser of two evils (instead of driving to Scottsdale). PLEASE let there be more competition for a good bar/nightclub in this area!
