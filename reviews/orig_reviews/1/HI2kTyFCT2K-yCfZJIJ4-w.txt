My wife and I and our friends have been here many times over the past couple of years for dinner or happy hour and have totally enjoyed the food and dining experience. Tonight, however, was a huge disappointment. We wanted 20 minutes for a table, followed by a 40 minute wait for our food. 

My wife's salad looked like it had just been washed and was served wet - yuck! 

I ordered a fajita, The meat was grossly over-cooked and served on a bed of saut√©ed onions with just a single slick of red pepper, a teaspoon of lettuce, 3 of the greasiest fajita wraps ever seen rolled up in tin foil and a small amount of shredded check melted into a clump and unusable.

The waitress had way too many tables and was less than attentive to the diners in our section. A guest at a neighboring table winched when served her food as a good deal of it was hanging off the edge of the plate looking like the kitchen just slopped it on. 

When we politely spoke with the waitress about our meal she became defensive and offered no apology. Before receiving the check the manager stopped by to ask how our dinner was, he too was defensive and had a "so what" demeanor. Neither the waitress or the manager apologized which was very disappointing.

We know they can do better because they have! 

Maybe it's time to call Gordon Ramsey for a rescue!!!
