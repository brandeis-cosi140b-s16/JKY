Have been going here for years, and getting...and loving the cornbread.  However, as of the 1st of the month, they started charging $3.00 for the cornbread...but neglect to mention that.

I would think if they changed the policy just a couple of weeks ago that they would now inform customers that they are charging for cornbread...which was free.
