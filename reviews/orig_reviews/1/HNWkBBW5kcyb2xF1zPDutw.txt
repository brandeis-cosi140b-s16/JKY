Hands down the worst Mexican food I have had in Arizona (lived here for 27 years). The service was slow and unhelpful, the prices were way too high for the amount of food that you got, and to top it off they sent me home with the wrong order!! After calling the restaurant to share my frustration, all I got back was a "oh, ok." No apologies and nothing to make up the 10 minute drive back. 

The food taste was below average as well. My carne asada burrito had almost no guac inside of it and the meat was burned to a char. I tasted nothing but tortilla and burned meat. An order of chips and guac will get you a handful of chips that would probably satisfy a 4 year old. Don't even get me started on the chicken quesadilla I ordered. There was no cheese in it!! huh!? Just chicken and bread with sprinkles of cheese. Unbelievable! 

After coming back to pick up the food that they had forgotten, I asked for some extra salsa. The worker at the counter hesitated and reluctantly handed me 1 small side salsa that is good enough for 3 chips. 

Let me sum up this entire review for you. Service is below average, the prices are way too high, and on top of it the food is horrible. Save yourself and go anywhere else for some Mexican food.
