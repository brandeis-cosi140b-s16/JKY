This was my first time there. I was meeting a new group of friends for drinks and enjoying myself even though the a/c was out in the restaurant.  I could deal with that because we had an awesome waitress, Lori. The bar "Manager"...an old cranky guy, kept giving me dirty looks because I guess I was blocking the walk way of some servers with where my seat was. He complained to Lori and I gladly moved. I was disturbed by his looks but I let it go but I am very perceptive. About 20 minutes later, all power goes out. We try and pay our tabs with our debit cards since none of us have cash and the machine isn't working. He (mean old bar manager) then says get money out of the ATM there. It of course isn't working. We ask if he would comp our $9 tab and our other friend had $30 cash on a $48 tab. The manager then grabbed the checks crumpled them in his hands and said "yes fine! Whatever!" I will never go back to this place. If you don't like your job....find another. Lori was great though. I have no idea about the food...so you are on your own there but service is much more important to me.
