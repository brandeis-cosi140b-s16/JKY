I Was was so excited to have lunch there. since moving to AZ i have heard so many great things about this restaurant however when I got there totally disappointed the culinary experience hasn't caught up yet in Phoenix,AZ the food was less than mediocre, And the counter tops at the bar were sticky;( this old mom-and-pop joint, is thumbs down for me.......;(
