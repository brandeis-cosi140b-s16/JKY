I had steak tacos and the only thing that had taste was the lime I squeezed on them. Veggies were decent and black beans dry. I never thought anybody could make dry beans, but I stand corrected. Margaritas are decent. Absolutely the worst salsa I ever tasted. Tasted like ketchup with spices. Chips were old.
