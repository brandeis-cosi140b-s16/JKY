Great service.  When it comes to the food there idea of fresh is 4 day old cow shit . Fish tacos tasted like the fish sat out for a week . I have never had fish that tasted so nasty. Had a hard time taking the first bite and there was not a second bite.  We told our waitress that the fish was not of satisfaction and she just chuckled and walked away .
