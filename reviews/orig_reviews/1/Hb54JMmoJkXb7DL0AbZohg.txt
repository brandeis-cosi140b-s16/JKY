When I walked in I was impressed, it's Beautiful, it's has this inside outside kinda feel with the courtyard setting. 

The menu was extensive and everything sounded delicious. I saw food that looked really good being served to other tables.

Unfortunately the food was not as good as it looked and certainly not as good as the restaurants interior would have you believe.

I got a taco and enchilada combo, the taco shell was a generic hard shell like those found at Taco Bell, the chicken inside ( I Kid you not) was the exact same chicken used at Taco Delmar  and the meaty enchilada sauce well, it must have been by  Hormel.

Everything had a different kind of peppery tasting spice that did not work well competing against each other.

It's like the Rainforest Cafe  of Mexican food.
