I would give this no stars if possible.  To start, we walked in & the table we wanted to sit at was soaking we,t from a dirty rag they used to wipe it down, so I asked the bartender (who was just standing there doing nothing but staring into space) if I could have a napkin. All he did was point to the waitress across the room, who was talking to another waitress. All while the bartender was standing next to a huge pile of napkins by the servers station.  All I could say was "wow".
So we looked over the menu and decided to order the bacon cheese burger.  First, the burger was half the size of the bun and the bacon looked like they bought it from the same place Wendy's buys there bacon. Actually I 100% would have preferred and would have been more satisfied with Wendy's Bacon Cheeseburger compared to this one. So not only was the burger small & the bacon below par, the bottom bun was soaked in grease! How terrible and disgusting it was. It came with fries which were also soaked in grease & soggy.  

Sammy Hagar should be ashamed to have his name attached to this place. You're better off going to McDonalds. You'll feel a lot less ripped off!
