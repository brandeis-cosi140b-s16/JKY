I had such a pleasant week in Vegas and stopping in this place for a last Vegas drink was just a mistake. I've had the shittiest service here ever. It is THAT BAD. 

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and after a few minutes the bartender asked for his order and didn't bother to ask for mine. She didn't even look at me. As she was preparing his drink, I said loud enough "I'd like to also order something...I'm with him" and she completely ignored me. She was right in front of me! Maybe she wasn't paying attention but hello....I'm in your section siting here and didn't even acknowledge me? Wow! I had to order from a bar back and she had to tell the other bartender at the end of the bar to make my drink. 

The spicy mango Marguerita I ordered tasted like straight syrup. Nasty. 

Do yourself a favor and do not come here if this is how you want your last memories of Vegas to be. Absolutely horrible. Thanks for a crappy experience.
