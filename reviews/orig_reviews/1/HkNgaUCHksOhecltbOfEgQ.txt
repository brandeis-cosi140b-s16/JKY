Came in to have dinner and drinks with my friend last night and the service was TERRIBLE.

Our bartender gave us menus, and completely forgot about us. We had to ask the host to get her attention. We thought "ok whatever, no big deal" maybe she's spacey. She made our drinks and I asked for salt and she forgot, "ok what ever, no big deal, I'll get salt on then next round." We ordered food and I asked for hot sauce, she forgot that as well. I was basically done eating when I was able to flag her down for hot sauce, and then she came to clear our plates, and I asked her to wait just in case my friend wanted more (she went to the restroom) the bartender literally rolled her eyes, and that's when I decided to write this review.

Food was good, but I could do without the crappy service. No one should have to go into a restaurant and feel like they are an inconvenience to the staff.
