The entire restaurant was filled. Took an incredible 40 minutes to get our food. We ordered a breakfast burrito and a torta combo. We were able to sit down after standing and waiting for 35 minutes. Initially we ordered to eat in, and then my boyfriend asked for our food to go at the 30 minute mark. This is only because we were giving up on ever getting a seat.  

When we did get a seat, the worker informed some people who just came in that we had our order to go. Why? I have no idea. It's like they didn't want us to change our mind to eat in even though we waited well over 30 minutes for our food. Anyways, the other customer harassed us to have our table and the man at a smaller table nearby. Rude? I think so.   

Overall, a horrible experience trying to eat in. Not enough seating options. Yes, there is outdoor seating, but it's near the huge garbage. And as you can guess, it smells disgusting outdoors.   

Would I come here to eat again? Not if it's indoors, and not if I want my food quickly. The food was very okay.   

TLDR: Awfully slow service, not enough seating, not the best staff.
