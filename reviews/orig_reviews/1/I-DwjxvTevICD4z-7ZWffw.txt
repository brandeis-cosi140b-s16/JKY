I will never forget my 18th Birthday.  Even though it was over three years ago, I can remember it down to what I was wearing.  Not by how good it was, but by my experience at Dos Gringos.

I have no problems with the servers or the decor.  It was actually quite nice.  My problem was with the food.

I ordered a Carne Burrito with Red Sauce, which is something that I usually get when I am at an authentic mexican restaurant.  From the first bite, I knew that something was amiss.

The first complaint that I have was that the meat was raw.  Not Rare, Not Pink, but Full-on red.  I did not find this out until I was halfway done with the burrito; I thought that all the red juice was from the red sauce that I had ordered... I was wrong.

After asking for it to be recooked, they brought me back a new burrito.  Skeptical, I cut inside, just to take a look... Lo and Behold, more uncooked meat.

Now, at this point, I remember getting queasy.  Not only did I have food poisoning, but I was deeply sick from the raw meat that I had previously eaten.  Needless to say, I found myself in their restroom for an extended period of time.

I have not gone back since.  Some people that I Know believe that I would have a different experience if I returned, but that is not a chance that I will take.  Dos Gringos?  More like Don't Go-go.
