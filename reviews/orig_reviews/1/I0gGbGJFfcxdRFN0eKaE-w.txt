Not good.  The food was luke-warm on a hot plate.  The carne adovada was bland and had a giant piece of snotty fat in it.  The salsas looked like they were reused for me from a past table.  Beans were bland.    Plus, they brought the food out faster than if I'd been at McDonald's.  At least give me the impression you cooked it back there, and at least make sure it's hot!  

Really awful, and I'm sorry to say that, as it looks like a local, Gilbert joint.
