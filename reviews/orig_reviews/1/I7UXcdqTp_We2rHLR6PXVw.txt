Barrio cafe in Phoenix airport... What scatter brain corporate executive in charge of this place green lighted and ok'd the use of jalapeno peppers in ALL repeat ALL the hash browns??? So your kids will be screaming/crying for mercy with one bite. And there's not even a warning... Just some idiotic "our famous barrio browns" in the menu description. Wake up and fire some CEO's please and fix your menu. Also the food was horrible. $30 at the airport for two breakfasts that weren't even as good as Mc Donalds or Burger king breakfast. You people should be ashamed. I didn't know that it was even possible to screw eggs, bacon and hash browns up this bad. My advice would be to avoid this place at all costs. A microwave breakfast burrito that has been frozen since Abraham Lincoln was born would be better. Run for your life.
