Have been here many times, both this location but also the ones on Eastern and Stephanie, and while you can't argue that the food is good you can argue that the service and the way you order is simply pathetic.

Walking in and seeing a line snaked like DMV at 1230 with 35 min wait time on a Tuesday is grotesque, it's not that busy, all that has to be done is an ordering system like all other places where you place your order and pick it up later, go see how efficient that works at any Jimmy Johns, this is it we are not coming back.

So until you can figure that out it's Mexican food at any other outlet.
