This place was horrible. The service was the worst part, I'll get to the over priced food in a min. They have a happy hour special from 3pm to 7pm. My boyfriend and I get there and are seated right away (the only positive) and the waitress comes over , she looks pissed off already , and I ask her if there are any drink specials ? She looks at me and saids "yes but they're over at 7" I know it's 6:30 I still have 30 min. Anyways it took her forever to come back with water for the table too! Now the food wasn't horrible but I've also felt that at that point Taco Bell had better food. The chipotle red chilli. Sauce on my burrito was more like buffalo wing sauce! My boyfriends steak was pretty good. Finally done with dinner and the waitress comes back before we've gotten our jackets on .. As if she wanted us out of there ASAP! Honestly not impressed the McDonalds inside the Monte Carlo had better service than this place ! :/
