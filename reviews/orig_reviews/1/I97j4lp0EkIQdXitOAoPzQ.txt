Worst. Service. Ever. It took 15 minutes just to take our drink order - we were about to get up and walk out when the waiter suddenly appeared so we decided to give it a chance. After we ordered drinks, it took at least 10 minutes to get the drinks (2 beers and a sangria) and then an additional 5 minutes for my friend to get her cup of what was a very lousy coffee. We ordered guacamole, and by the time we got it we had no chips left, and it took 15 minutes to get chips. Our waiter just kept just disappearing, and the manager was too busy chatting up the hostesses to actually pay attention his patrons. The food was decent, but I would NEVER go back because of the terrible service. We left the waiter $1 tip - he's lucky he got that.
