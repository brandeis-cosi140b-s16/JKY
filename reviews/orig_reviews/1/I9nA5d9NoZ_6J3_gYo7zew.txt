We've eaten here a handful of times and each time it's worst than the last. I ordered a tamale tonight and it smelled and tasted like an old wet sock. My boyfriend ordered a shredded beef taco and it too tasted terrible! The meat was black and tasted nothing like beef. We ordered to go so it wasn't like we can send the plates back :/

Now, I'm in bed with chills and an upset stomach. I seriously hope this isn't the beginnings of food poisoning. We've decided NEVER to eat Do√±a Maria ever again.
