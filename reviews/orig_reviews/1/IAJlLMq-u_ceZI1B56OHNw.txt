I was so excited about my 11th free meal but until tonight i felt so offended by this guy Kevin. We ordered our usual and the fun part begin...... at the register, first the lady at the register is not with it, and here comes Kevin questioning what we order, not one time but several.... and i kept repeating myself " chicken salad " n " chicken burrito ", and than he pulled all our sides (dressing etc... ) out, and counting how many we have, i mean really dude?? first is with the chicken shit, and now he is counting my dressing???and to top it off, they were out of rice.  If you really trying to do your JOB right, listen/watch, don't question us like we are criminal and shit.... super not happy at all!!! 
But i def love the lady who prep my food and Jordon the cashier, they always take care of me and my husband.
