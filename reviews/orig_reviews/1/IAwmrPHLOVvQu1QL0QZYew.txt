Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!
