If this were the price of a normal restaurant, it would deserve 2 stars.

But this restaurant having Jose Andres' name tagged onto it....... you  expect more.  MUCH more.

Unfortunately, things were not good.  The fries with XO sauce cost about $10... and it was way too salty to even eat.  And I have a salty palate.

Soups were all salty, but lacking an flavor at the same time.

Carnitas taco (single, 1 taco) was $5.50... and it was..... not even as good as a carnitas taco you can get at any taco stand for $1.50.

Scallop siu mai was really good, the only thing I considered "good" from the meal.

Disappointed for a "Jose Andres" restaurant.
