I don't even know where to begin. We came in on Sunday around 11am. I was accompanied by 5 others. There might have been 8-9 other people in the whole place. I was so excited to try this place because I had watched it on the Food Network channel. MAN what a disappointment! We were greeted 5 mins after we came in by a very rude bartender. I kick my self for not asking her name.. She took our drink order which consisted of beer and 2 shots or tequila.. Then she was gone.. 15 mins later she came back and brought the tequila.. My husband asked where his beer was and she said I'm getting it.. Another 15 mins went by and this time another bartender came on shift and I asked for our bill.. I said all we had was tequila.. She said well it looks like you also had beers.. I said you are right we ordered the beers but were never served them.. So we got the check for our 2 shots of tequila, paid and left.. I honestly was very excited to try this place and I am extremely upset with the service and will never be back.. We should have listened to the hotel staff whom warned us about Nacho Daddy..
