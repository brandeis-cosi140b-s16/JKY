Saying that this restaurant sucks is probably the nicest thing I can even come up with! The food was boring but expensive. The soda was flat the entire night and our drinks would sit empty for 20 minutes before anyone would think to refill them.  The service was absolutely horrible and to top it off when we paid our bill the server also ran my card for someone else's meal. Instead of giving me a heads up that they made a mistake I found out the next day when balancing my check book.  When we contacted the restaurant to make sure that the transaction was canceled the manager told us he would call us back the next morning because they were very busy.  No big deal until the phone call didn't come. When we called back to follow up you could tell that the manager was annoyed that we were asking him to verify that the $70 transaction was canceled.  The least that could have been done was an apology but that never came! I will make sure that nobody in my family or group of friends ever return to this restaurant!
