I'm sorry...but no thanks.

Growing up in East Mesa, when Tia Rosa's opened it soon (for some reason) became the go-to "nice" Mexican spot.  I'm not sure why...the food is about on par or below the standard of most Mexican food that one can other wise find in Mesa.  I don't understand the obsession.

All of my memories of Tia Rosa's are attached to one overriding theme:  Waiting.  On a Tuesday or other week night it is not uncommon to wait over an hour (say an hour and 40 min) for a table.  There really isn't a good area or bar to wait either.  Then it's the waiting for a server to come.  Then it's the LONG wait for food.

Why all the waiting for something that's not even that fantastic??
