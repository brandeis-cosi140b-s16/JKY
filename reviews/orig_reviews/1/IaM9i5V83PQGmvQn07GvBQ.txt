No matter how hungry you are, or how much your feet hurt, do yourself a favor and keep walking past this noisy excuse for a Mexican restaurant, located pretty close to the Flamingo front desk. 

It offers overpriced, mediocre Americanized food...with a small discount if you show your Total Rewards card. Alas, the savings did not help. It was a bomb on so many levels. 

Service: our server was sweet but slow and managed to get so much wrong. I ordered a Pepsi, got a diet, and despite my almost empty glass and her eagerness to refill my husband's water at least 4 times, I never got a refill. Given that the soda was $3.50, ugh. 

She forgot to bring my soup and when we reminded her, she smiled and said she would take it off the check. Boo. 

My chicken fajita salad was tasty. Basic, no complaints. Hubby had BBQ shrimp and did not like the spicy sauce or the bacon garnish. 

We splurged and bought the chips and salsa...nothing like a paper bag of stale chips and jarred salsa to convince us we'd made a grande mistake. The noisy atmosphere and thumping soundtrack sort of topped things off. 

One of the worst meals I've ever had in Vegas...live and learn.
