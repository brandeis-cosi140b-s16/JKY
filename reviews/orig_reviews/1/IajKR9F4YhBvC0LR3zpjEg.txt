Our party of five arrived mid-afternoon for a late lunch.  We were seated at a booth that included old crushed chips underneath the table and chunks of meat scattered on the floor.  Once our food arrived (yes, we stayed to eat...) we had to ask for utensils.  The food was bland overall, although the enchiladas were covered in a greasy pasta sauce (possibly Ragu).  Mexitalian anyone?  Upon leaving we visited the restroom, which appeared untouched by a cleaning agent for an unreasonable amount of time.  Considering we were one of only a few people in the restaurant at the time, the bathrooms should have been clean and our table certainly should have been set.
