Wow, things have changed and not for the good. We have been coming here for a few years now and it seems like every time we leave, we always say "I`m good on Arribas for the next 12 months" but we keep going back every couple months. No more. Tonite was it. Wife ordered an a la carte chicken tostada and they wanted to charge 1.99 for sour cream and 2.49 for guac. Booth was filthy. Wife had to steal a clean fork from another table as some ones enchilada was still on hers. Halfway through the meal I noticed mouse crap on the wood ledge along our table so that ended my meal which wasn`t good anyway. I always clean my plate when eating Mexican food. Called the manager over and quietly explained the issue. He apologized and told us they are very careful about these things. He did knock some off our bill but after getting home and thinking about it, I was disappointed the whole meal wasn`t free being we couldn`t finish it. We won`t be back. I`ll take my chances at Filibertos. On a good note our server, Ryan did a good job and kept our drinks full and the stale chips coming.
