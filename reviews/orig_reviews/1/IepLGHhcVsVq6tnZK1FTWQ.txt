Went for some quick nachos and a margarita- Waited 15 minutes for someone to come to our table.  When the waitress arrived she dumped her jug of water on my wife, an instead of cleaning it up, she stood there for a minute with a "embarrassed" look on her face. We changed tables and told her "not to worry about it".  She didn't come back for along time so we left. Grabbed a margarita on the way out from the bar which sucked. There is way too many great casual Vegas restaurants to even bother giving them another shot.
