Wish I could give this place a better review. The food is great but my most recent experience is enough to keep me from returning to this location. We came in for dinner and ordered our meals. I was a little grossed out seeing one of the employee's healing abrasion uncovered on her arm. Finally got to the register to pay and was helped by a different employee. I noticed this employee was still wearing her gloves. She handled our money and then bid us a good night....then returned to the line with her gloves...tainted with money germs...and proceeded to work with food. No hand washing. No glove change.
