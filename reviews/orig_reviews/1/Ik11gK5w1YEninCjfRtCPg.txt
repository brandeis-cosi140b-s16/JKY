Until this incident, I was a loyal customer of faves since 2005...long story short....a substitute, second-rate cashier (she was not the regular cashier, but an older and evidently still inexperienced, inept woman from the kitchen) knowingly misprocessed my order (I initially voiced my concerns upon receiving an unfamiliar total, and even reviewed my receipt with her, at which point she rigorously denied any irregularity). Then she had the unmitigated audacity to get upset with ME, after it was indeed confirmed that she had submitted the wrong order. I politely asked that the situation be rectified, and with that she defiantly "served" me the sloppiest, wet paper sack of a burrito ever created in an aggressive and reckless fashion...unlike the manner in which she secured my tortilla, our relationship is legitimately wrapped.
