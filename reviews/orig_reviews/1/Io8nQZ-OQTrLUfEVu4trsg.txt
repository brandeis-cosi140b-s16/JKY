Third time visiting and the food is good and had decent service in the bar. However when my girlfriends and I went to the Restroom we witnessed an employee use the potty and return to work without washing her hands. There was also hand sanitizer readily available at the door which was also ignored. This grosses me out so now I won't be back.
