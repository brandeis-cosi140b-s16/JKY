We went on Friday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Our friend had been there before and really liked it but after this visit I doubt she will be back. We had called days before to make a reservation for our large party and were told they do not take reservations. They told us the wait would be about 30-40 minutes. We waited well over an hour and while we waited we saw another large party get seated before us. The hostess was rude and so was the rest of the staff. Finally after a few members of our party left we got seated at a table that did not have enough room for our group. We told the waiter we didn't have enough chairs and he told us he didn't know what to do about it, then he asked us what we wanted to drink. Really? Worst experience I've ever had.
