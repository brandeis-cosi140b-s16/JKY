We found ourselves tooling through the forum shoppes one day on our recent trip to LV around lunchtime.  I had been craving Mexican, so we of course we stopped to check the mall Directory and voila!  We see La Salsa!  I was so excited!!  Little did I know............

It looked so cute when we went inside and then we noticed a great outdoor patio with a bar.  I think this must be the attraction, margaritas outside, that allows them to continue to stay in the forum shoppes and make money.  B/c our food was dire, bland, tasteless and all around the worst Mexican food I have ever had.

And I do not say this lightly, I truly am the last person to be overly critical b/c every restaurant can have a bad day.  But this food was insipid and terrible-- PLEASE do not eat here.  There are so many other options, I wish we had taken one of them instead.
