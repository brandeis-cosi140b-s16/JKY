Who puts beans in carne asada tacos? gross. Plus they charge per taco for all the extra like pico and sour cream. It came out to $26 for 3 tacos and a buritto and 2 drinks. Mexican ripoff for lousy lousy food. Will never be back and advise friends to stay away. 

If I am gonna pay that kind of money for crap mexican food I expect a sit down full service place not some dump that uses plastic utensils and employees that don't don't understand a word of English.
