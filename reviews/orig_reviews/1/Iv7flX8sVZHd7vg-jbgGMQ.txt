This place is the reason I signed up for yelp!
Wish my first was a positive one.  This place is not cool though.  

I have no idea what the food even tastes like here.  I walked in with my wife around 3:30 in the afternoon and there were open tables all over (definitely busier than I would have thought for the time though.) The rude hostess told my wife she would "get to us in ten minutes."  Then I watched three groups of people walk in and get seated after us.  They had no reservation just asked for a seat.  I could see them.  Then I asked the hostess about this issue.  She said "our kitchen is really busy, and we do take some reservations."  What does that have to do with this situation?  I wasn't sure so I left, never getting a chance to eat their food.  You are not better than anyone.  Judging your patrons on the clothes they wear won't get you anywhere.  I would never give my money to a place like this!  

If you wondered what I was wearing it was a Michigan tee shirt and some jeans.  I was there for their bowl game.
