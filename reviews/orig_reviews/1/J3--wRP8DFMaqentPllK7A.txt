Overall - definitely avoid if you're going on a date - might be okay for a group if you guys are into chain-like restaurants and don't care about quality food or drinks. 

In regards to the food and drink (1) Beware the Calamari - unless you are in the mood for fish sticks, then by all means, enjoy! (2) And I'm sorry, but since when did using a sour mix (house-made or otherwise) for margaritas become something work advertising? Their drinks were cloyingly sweet and syrupy and a far cry from anything remotely authentic. (3) Then there was the guacamole - maybe the standard version was better, but we were highly encouraged to try their specialty guacamole which had goat cheese in it. I love goat cheese, and I LOVE guacamole, but I couldn't really see how the flavors would work together. Just like I had thought, the flavors made a rather disastrous marriage - but beyond the sad mismatch, the flavor was down right bland (even after adding salt & their special spicy sauce, it just tasted like mush). (4) And while the concept of the tortilla rounds was cool, they failed again to execute (they chips were stale & flavorless, not crispy & lightly salted like authentic chips should be). 

The atmosphere is loud and upon settling into it, mostly unimpressive - the lighting is dim (which I normally don't have a problem with, but their tables are a size that makes it awkward for two people to see each and have an easy to understand conversation). 

This place misses the mark on so many levels it's straight up sad.
