I would give them a good review because their food really is good.... When they get it right. I have come here multiple times with my boyfriend and they have gotten the order incorrect at least twice.

I am a vegetarian and have only had restaurants give me meat in my food probably 4 times in the past 6 years. As I took a bite into my potato manchego cheese tacos I distinctly tasted chicken. I waited 20 minutes to get the incorrect item that simply needs to be fried. Like I said before, I would go back if they could pay attention to the order.
