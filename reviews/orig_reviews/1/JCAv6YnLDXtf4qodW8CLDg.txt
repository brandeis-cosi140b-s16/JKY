Although the tacos here might pass in the middle of the country, given the number of delicious, authentic tacos you can find in the Valley for under $2, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would muscle through the tacos here.  Although the combinations sound trendy, they taste like an expired fad - something you'll regret when you look back on them.  Here, you need only wait a bite or two before that regret sets in.

On our first and only trip here, we had the guacamole, lamb taco, pork adovada taco, and Thai snapper taco.  Although you can choose to flavor your guacamole with tastes like jalapeno bacon and pineapple mint, we opted for the house version since it was our first time.  The guacamole, although a sizable portion, was completely lacking in flavor.  There was no hint of cilantro, jalapeno, or lime in any of the bites we tried.  A true waste of delicious avocado.  In each of the tacos, the flavors weren't well developed and didn't marry well.  Blue cheese and curry sauce might sound like interesting toppings for a "gourmet" taco, but if you can't pull it off, you shouldn't try.  Even the pork adovada was completely nondescript and lackluster, even despite the attempt to spruce it up with mango jicama relish and cotija cheese.  The side of "street corn" that accompanied the tacos was abysmal and tasted little better than canned corn drowning in butter.  

This place might be good for drinks since the converted church is a nice change in your average scenery, with high ceilings, lots of wrought iron, and stained glass, but we would not come back here for food if it was free.
