Worst experience in Vegas.  No one knew how to light the heat lamps.   No rice and beans with fajitas until we asked and then were told they were extra. Fine, so offer it when we order, dude! And then the waiter stood and waited for us to pay when he dropped the check. Really? You're gonna hover over me after you drop the check? Ghetto!
