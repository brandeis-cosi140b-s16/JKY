Got a table here(spent around 500$), the server poured drinks for everyone around the table(without consent from anyone) and multiple drinks for the people at the table. Basically she kept pouring out the drinks so that we would hurry up and leave so she could make more money on the next table and such. Poor service, I'll never ever go back again. The way it's ran is disgusting. I called management and they just say "oh, I'm sorry I'll bring it up at our meeting" umm....awesome. 500$ down the drain. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!
