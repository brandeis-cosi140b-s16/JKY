Went there with out-of-town guests cause they were staying in the west valley, and it had been recommended to me.   I had the chicken burro plate with rice and beans, he had the same version except with beef, and I don't remember what she had.   I give it two stars for the salsa, but that's about it.   If that was chicken in my burro, I don't know what kind of chicken it was.   It surely didn't taste like chicken.   And the consistency was basically unappetizing.  It came with rice and beans.   The rice was tasteless till I poured the salsa over it.  In fact, that is what I did with the burro to give it some flavor.  The refried beans is typical refried beans out of a can.   My relatives said it was good.   I mean, they were my guests.   What are they going to say.   Plus, they are from a city that doesn't do Mexican food well.   Would I go back?   A resounding no!
