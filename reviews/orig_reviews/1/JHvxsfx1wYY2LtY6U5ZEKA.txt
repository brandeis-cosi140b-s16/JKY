While the food was okay tasting, it made me sick and I can't say I'm surprised. The grease factor was off the charts, which should have been  a warning sign. I didn't even finish my burrito, and I'm glad I didn't. Definitely won't be back. 

Not sure how this place gets great reviews and a healthy image. It's just another greasy Mexican food joint in Vegas. You want real Mexican food in America that won't make you sick, go to Tucson. For some odd reason Vegas doesn't have any worth talking about.
