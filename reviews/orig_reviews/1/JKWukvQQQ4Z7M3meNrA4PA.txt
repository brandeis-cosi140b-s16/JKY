Stay away! I gave the place three tries but each visit was worse than the one before; horrible service and bad food. 

I sat at the bar tonight and it was 5 minutes before a bartender showed up; no one was behind the bar. Once the bartender showed up I ordered a beer. He brought it to me then walked off without asking if I was ready to order (which I was). I watched him converse with other staff members hoping to catch his attention and a few minutes later I did. 

I ordered a chicken burrito. The cheese on top was not melted and some of the chicken was luke warm. I only ate about half of it because it was loaded with salt. I still can't get the nasty taste out of my mouth. 

Ready to leave, I finished my beer then waited for the bartender who was having a lengthy conversation with other customers. I finally got his attention by waving my arms.

It's obvious that management is lacking in their ability to manage as this lack of service and bad food was a repeat of my two other visits. Needless to say I will not be back.

Save your money and eat at Taco Bell. The food and service will be much better.
