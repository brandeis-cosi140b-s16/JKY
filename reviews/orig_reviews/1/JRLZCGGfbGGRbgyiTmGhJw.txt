The worst Mexican food I have ever tasted.  One drink and two places of cheese smothered something with no taste or flavoring at all.  $32.00.  The parking lot is full and can't imagine who is going there.  Just awful.  Nothing edible.  Do clients "just not know: WHAT MEXICAN FOOD IS !!!!!!! WARNING..DON'T DO IT.
