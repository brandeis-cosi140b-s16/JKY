This used to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  About a year ago my husband and I both became violently ill a few hours after eating there, and after reviewing what we ate in common determined it had to be the salsa.  So we stayed away until Sat. night when we decided to give it a try again.  The place has always been scary by its appearance but we were amazed how much it had run down in just a year.  Everything was dirty, from the floors on up, including the inch of grime covering all the crap hanging on the walls, which keeps them from really cleaning or putting a badly needed fresh coat of paint on the place.  There are holes in the booths with stuffing spilling out and there was a big smear of dried salsa on the mirror hanging right next to my head.  All very unappealing!  Add to that stale, tough tortilla chips, a very bland green chili burro and watered-down Margarita and I'm writing off an old favorite.   Unless you really like the dangerous feeling you get when you walk into a border town dive, stay away!
