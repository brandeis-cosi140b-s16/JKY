I wish I could give this place 0 stars. It was disgusting, my food was ice cold, and it was so over priced. The staff was rude and it was clear they were not following sanitary procedures (you can't hand a plate to someone they start eating it take it back and give it to another customer!!!) I would not suggest this place and I will never come back.
