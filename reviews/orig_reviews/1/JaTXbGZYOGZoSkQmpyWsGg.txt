Tacos Jalisco? More like Tacos Jalisc-NO. The place is a small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint, and boy does it smell like one. Upon entering the dining area, ones senses are consumed by the overwhelming stench of bathroom, which leaks from the poorly enclosed area at the establishments rear. A sizable portion of the tacos were inedible grizzle, and the bean burrito banished the only chunk of cheese to one small section on the bottom, growing like a small cold tumor from one side. The chips were store bought and the bottled sodas were nearly expired, which is completely mind boggling. The prices were high compared to similar places, and I left with nothing but sadness filling my stomach. Needless to say, not planning a return visit.
