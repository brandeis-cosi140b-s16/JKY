Huge disappointment.   Best chips and salsa, not! Had taco dinner, no taste at all and the chicken and steak was overcooked and cold.  My husbands dinner also overcooked.  Passed up a great Italian dinner to try this place.  Big mistake.  Way overpriced for what we got.  The music was too loud and so dark we could hardly read the menu.  The only thing good about this place was the service.  Too bad the food isn't as good as the service.
