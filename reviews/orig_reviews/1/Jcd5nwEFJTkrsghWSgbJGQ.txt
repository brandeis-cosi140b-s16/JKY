We called to reserve Havana Grill for June 24th, a Monday. As you can see the website shows open on Monday and it was confirmed for a party of 16 for that day. We all show up and it's closed and the sign says closed on Mondays. I had called a couple of days before to ask if I can bring a cake for our party that Monday and she said oh yes, she checked to add that to our party reservations. They lost out because another restaurant seated all of us for the party! I won't go back, unprofessional service.
