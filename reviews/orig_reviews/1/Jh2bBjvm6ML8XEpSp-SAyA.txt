I hear good things about the food here and couldn't wait to go with a group of family and friends for my sisters 30th birthday. First off they absolutely do not take reservations, this irritated me but I thought ohwell no big deal. Before we went I called and asked if we were ok to bring our own cake to sing and celebrate for my sister.. This is where I'm annoyed and give this restaurant 1 star so I call and they say "yes sure but it will be a $5 charge per person." So let me get this straight, we are bringing a cake and you are charging me to cut it? I even asked if I could bring my own plates and cut it myself and they said if I did that it would be a $3 charge per person. This is just so dumb to me, there was 15 of us and i couldnt believe they wanted to charge us to bring our own cake! We ended up going and not taking a cake, food was ok. Nothing special, and we ended up spending over $300 dollars. Service was ok nothing great and I definitely won't be going back!
