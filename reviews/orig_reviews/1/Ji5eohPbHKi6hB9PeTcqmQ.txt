Only one in the restaurant at 5:40 pm. Maybe 6 people total by the time I left at 6:30 including one loner guy at the bar smoking an e-cig as if he was cool somehow. Took 30 minutes to get a burrito and a kids bean and cheese burrito. Kids burrito was inedible because it was too spicy. My burrito came with just beans and no rice because "they didn't make any rice today and didn't tell me". Didn't double up the beans to make up for it, just left an empty spot on the plate where the rice should have gone. Took 25 minutes to replace kids burrito with chicken nuggets. Only one waiter and apparently a worthless cook. Never going back!  I expect the place to close down soon. Barely hanging on because of arena guests I'm sure.
