Service at this location is just the worst. I don't know if they are understaffed or just non caring. Food had been super inconsistent the last 3 times I've been here. Some days the beans look like they were scooped out of a can that's been left open 3 days. The Queso Fundido Is the only reason we go back. And if you can hail down a server the $1 margaritas during happy hour are good. The last time I went the place was nearly empty and it took 40 minutes for my order to come out. And when it had it was burnt. If you want Arribas go to the ahwautuki location.
