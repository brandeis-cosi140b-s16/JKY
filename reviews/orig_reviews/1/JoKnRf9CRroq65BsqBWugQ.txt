I am a huge fan of the Cafe Rio franchise but this one is horrible. I've been in twice, since moving to the area and both times they disappointed me. This time was unacceptable though leaving me not able to finish my meal. 

I come in frequently to the Gilbert location because it's near my work,so I know what sides and extras come with meals. At this location you need to ask if you want ANYTHING. They try to rush you through the line, and if you ask for anything the workers roll their eyes and are inconvenienced. 

I was ordering for my family and didn't notice the missing items until I got back to my house. I did catch one thing in line. I ordered two tacos, and instead of asking if I wanted pico, she just started wrapping the tacos up. I asked for pico and she rolled her eyes and that's when I noticed the container was empty! She didn't want to walk back and get a new one! So instead she just decided I wasn't going to get any. I insisted and she went back and got me some. 

I get home, with my tortilla soup, missing half the ingredients, and my two tacos and two tosadas. I take a bite from my taco, and pull a foot long black hair out of my mouth. Needless to say I didn't finish my meal, which brings their cleanliness into question considering when I was getting my beverage, the brewed tea dispensers were open to the world. Disgusting. 

Management obviously needs to step it up at this location because if it's happening to me it's happening to others. And, after reading the reviews my complaints are the same as others and not being addressed.
