Been to Diego Pops a handful of times when it first opened, always had a great experience. Loved the food and the decor. But like every other place in Old Town the quality of the food and service falls off. Our waitress got every single one of our orders wrong, forget two of our orders, the sangria was bland and warm, we had charged skirt steak bowl and plate, both weren't really edible. The meat was overcooked and dry, the brown rice was burnt and hard. Our other friend ordered the green chili chicken plate, he barely had two bites. The tuna poke was lacking tuna, think about a bowl of poorly prepared stale coconut rice and some greens, with the tuna playing hide and seek. The waitress told us they only had hot sauce available, which is false having dined there before I knew for a fact there is a bunch of homemade sauces, but towards the end of our meal she showed up with all the sauces. An overall terrible experience for all of for of us and a waste of $150. Maybe the waitresses should write down orders so they don't have to be reminded everyone is missing something and from the taste of the food they either need a new chef or someone who can cook for humans because my dogs wouldn't eat what was served to us. Thank god for AMEX, a simple call to them will make this dining experience disappear cost wise. Taco Bell is a 5 star restaurant versus this place, service and food quality wise.
