One word- Terrible. After doing some major shopping around Tempe Marketplace, my girlfriend and I were HUNGRY!!! We were headed towards The Keg but upon passing San Felipe's Cantina we decided to detour. We were initially drawn to the restaurant because of it's festive decor and indoor/outdoor seating. The thought of munching on some chips and salsa over a girly conversations sounded great too! Boy were we WRONG!!! Once inside the restaurant, we soon found out that there couldn't be more to dislike about this place. The seating was uncomfortable, the staff was loud and scantily clad, and the food-ugh!! We ordered chips & salsa and a chicken and cheese quesadilla . My thought process was "how can anyone mess up chips&salsa or a quesadilla?!! So simple, right? O.M.G. Both were horrible. The basket of chips came out in a messy heap. There were two small salsa bowls but because they were placed in the basket so sloppily, salsa had spilled everywhere and the chips were soggy. Nothing worse than soggy chips. The quesedilla didn't deliver either. Bland and soggy. What a disappointment.
