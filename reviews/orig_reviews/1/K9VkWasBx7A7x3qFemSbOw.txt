worst food i have ever had! enter to a horrible musty smell. sit down and the waiter says "don't order the ground beef anything, customers say it is spoiled and rancid tonight"!  the kitchen is still selling it?? food comes out cold, beans equaled 2 tablespoons and rice was hard as a rock.  meals were: 1 taco w/rice and beans, 1 taco w/rice and beans and 2 tacos w/rice and beans, 1 water, one beer, one coke= $55.80! not only will i never return, but contacted the board of health!
