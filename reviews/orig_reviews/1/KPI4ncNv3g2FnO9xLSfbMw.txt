Tried to come here on St. Patrick's Day.  They locked the door on us and we were ignored when we knocked on the door and tried to call. They were not closed because their was some people inside.  My friends and I were not being drunk assholes nor are we cheap so I did not appreciate being treated like a low class citizen.  They have good tacos but it is seriously just a taco joint, nothing special, and they should not act like they are above people.  My friends and I will not be coming back here.  The food is not worth it!
