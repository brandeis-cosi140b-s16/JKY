I love Chipotle and have been to several...this BY FAR is the worst EVER! They mess up orders and they take forever! I have been there several times... thinking ok maybe this time they will get it right and they still dont! I ordered online recent because service is SUPER slow thinking it would help...get there 10 minutes after the time I said I wanted my order and my order had not even gotten started...cashier tell tortilla girl to start order she sets ticket aside not once but 3 times...there is 6 people in line none of which can complete an order. After being told 4 times to start the online order (mine) the girl starts making it....she didnt add all that I asked for. Mind you there is a line out the door...in the 30 minutes I was there line moved up ONLY 2 customers! Very upsetting! This is unacceptable! I will never go back to this location! I will tell people to not go there!
