Reserved a cabana to celebrate 4 birthdays at 7 pm on a Saturday.  Got there and got our party started, eating, drinking, dancing...at 10:15 pm the bouncers come over and tell us we have to be out by 10:30 pm that they sold it to another party that was starting at 10:30 pm.  What!?!?  We paid $500 minimum for 3.5 hours...are you kidding me!!!!!  The management is shady and we will not be back...EVER!  No mention of this when booking the cabana...just the $500 minimum...SHADY!!!!  I would give zero stars but you have to pick one.
