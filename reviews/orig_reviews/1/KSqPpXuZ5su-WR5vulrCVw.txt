This was my first visit to the Old Town Tortilla Factory, and it will likely be my last. I'll break my experience down this way:

Food - If I wrote that the food was mediocre, I would be charitable. The queso fundido came out with a texture more like soup than melted cheese. The flavor was not too bad, but the texture was too hard to get past. It was served with in-house flour tortillas, which were nice, but the corn chips that were also served were commercial, mass produced corn chips. You would think that a place that calls itself a "Tortilla Factory" would have made their corn chips in house. It's easy to do and would have made a huge difference.

I also order the chicken tortilla soup. It is a chile-based soup with an odd, thick texture to it, as if somebody went a little overboard with the corn starch. I can't say it was as think as Jello, but it did jiggle! It had very little flavor. I would not order it again.

Service - Our server was very pushy, insisting that she new more about what we should order than we did. As this was a birthday celebration, I wanted to buy the guest of honor a "Millionaire Margarita"; it's an expensive cocktail but it would show some generosity to the birthday girl and perhaps make her feel a little special. Our server, however, immediately discouraged that order and suggested a different drink. Opportunity robbed. 

Drinks - Here's where the Old Town Tortilla Factory shines. I tried several different drinks and I loved every one of them. Tasty, well made, and generous quantities. Here's the only part of the Tortilla Factory that would entice me to return. Kudos to the bartender!
