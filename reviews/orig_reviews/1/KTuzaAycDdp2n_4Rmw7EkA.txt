Not sure what all the hype is about!? I went yesterday for the first time. It is right by my house and I always see they are busy. So I checked it out. 
Positive: 

Staff are very nice and friendly
A wide variety of drinks and juices

And that's about it. I paid $25 for 4 steak tacos, a piece of corn, and a coke.........
The steak was bland, not impressed at all. I have had Mexican food in Mexico, Chicago, New Mexico, Texas, California, all over Vegas, etc. I do not see myself going back or recommending it. Like I said, very friendly people working there though!
