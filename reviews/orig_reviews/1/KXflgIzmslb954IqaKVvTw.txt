Horrible service! Waiter refused to place my appetizer while he was taking drink orders. I placed an order for the queso and never received it. I then ordered to fish tacos which were horrible. After about 30 mins after leaving I began to become very sick. I definitely received food poisoning. If you want to have the worst service and food come on in!
