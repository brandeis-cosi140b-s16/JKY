I am writing this the day after my less than stellar dining experience and I am still annoyed.  

I feel like a sucker for ignoring the overwhelmingly negative reviews of this place and giving them a chance. 

The short version is that this place sucks. Horrible food. Mediocre service and exorbitant pricing.  I promise you any other Mexican restaurant is better than this place.  EvenTaco Bell has better food

Consider yourself warned; don't waste your time or money on this poor excuse of a restaurant.
