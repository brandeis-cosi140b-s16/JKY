Take this review very seriously, I am not trying to be rude or funny, or even a prisoner of the moment...I promise.

For a good 7 seven years I  have held the belief that Buca di Beppo was the worst restaurant in the area, flavorless and decrepit! But there is a new sheriff in town, and his name is Someburros, and he is more evil than Arpiao. 

With food worse than what is probably served in tent city, I am now reeling in horror at what may come tomorrow or even within the hour. You see, the "meats" in both my and my gf's burros have got to be canned or canner quality, you know...Friskas. Seriously. The nachos were nothing but old, whole corn tortillas shingled with tepid beans, cold cheddar cheese, and a good 8 oz of jalepenos! Speechless...

I'm sorry, but if you check in here, check yelp for a "nearby" urgent care center.
