Second time coming here. I wanted to order food to go. The old man at the front brushed me aside to help some people that walked in behind me. After that he practically threw the menu at me once he realized I hadn't ordered yet and very rudely told me what I should've asked for was to see a menu. I told him he was rude and placed my order. After I confronted him he was nicer. My food got to me fast, I ordered the two chicken taco lunch special. I don't think I'll be returning after today. I don't want to be treated that way again. I work in customer service, it doesn't matter how bad if a day you are having, don't take it out on your customers, and smile!!!
