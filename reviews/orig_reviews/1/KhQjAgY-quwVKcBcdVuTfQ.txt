One day I wish restaurant owners here in San Tan Valley would really try and step up their game. It should never be about the money and truly be about customer satisfaction. I just spent $25 on two shredded beef tacos, one bean & cheese burrito and two cheese enchiladas. The pictures looked pleasing but every bit of this food was completely unpleasant. The cheese in the enchiladas, what kind is it? It definitely wasn't shredded and the green sauce tasted like it came from a can. It's sad to spend money on food we are not going to eat. Guess I'll keep looking...
