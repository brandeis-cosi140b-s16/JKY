I'm sorry but after waiting in line for one hour and I ordered a bunch of stuff, I was very disappointed with the taste. With all the people there I was expecting some amazing tacos, but honestly they were the worst tacos I have ever had. 

The service was amazing and the staff was very friendly but I will never go back
