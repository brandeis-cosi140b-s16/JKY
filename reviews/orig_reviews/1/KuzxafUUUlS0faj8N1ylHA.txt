We went with a couple of families. There was 13 of us and the bill came to $340 and it was family - style.  I got 3 small tacos,  mac ' n cheese, a tiny quesadilla that the kids wouldn't touch.  Go to Rubio's.  Go somewhere else.  This place is a huge rip-off.  I am still flabbergasted at the gall of this place to have the prices they have for the severing sizes that they provide.
