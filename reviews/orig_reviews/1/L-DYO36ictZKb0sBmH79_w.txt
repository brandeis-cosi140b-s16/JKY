We called on a rainy, Sunday afternoon and were told they were not taking reservations.  There were six of us.  When we arrived at 5 pm, we were told there would be a 45 minute wait.  We had a member of our party needing to catch a flight so we asked why we had to wait so long as there were several tables available.  The young ladies at the counter said we could have called in two hours ahead and they would have had a place for us.  However, we did call in two hours ahead and were told they were not taking reservations because it was raining.  I was confused, upset and ended up at The Spotted Donkey, spending $200 and it was wonderful!!
