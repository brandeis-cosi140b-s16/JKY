Just received a private message from a fake account with a racist undertone attached to my review at China Poblano.  Probably from someone who works there or is a manager...only a person like that would take the time to create a fake account, and send me a private message to insult me on my review.

Good to know what kind of people work there.  Just reinforces and validates what I thought about this place.  

Too bad I can't give this dump 0 stars.  Cosmo can do way better
