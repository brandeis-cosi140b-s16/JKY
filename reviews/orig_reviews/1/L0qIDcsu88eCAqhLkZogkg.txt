We've gone to many Mexican restaurants in the past. Never have we been so dissatisfied.

We walked in everything was fine. Till we started ordering, the cashiers could have been more friendly, I mean it's a part of their job right. We sat down and waited for our food. While waiting we saw cockroaches crawling on the floor... The meat wasn't as cooked as we thought it would be. Very unpleasant visit.
