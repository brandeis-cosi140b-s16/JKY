Walked in and sat down at a table with my wife and friend.  The serving staff walked around and totally ignored us for 25 min, so we left.  The staff wasn't busy.......  they just seemed to concerned with dancing around and texting.  Upon leaving I expand to the employee out front my situation, who didn't seem to care and brushed me off.  Won't be back.  What a waste of time on the strip.
