I have been to DG once before and had a great experience - good food, good drinks and great atmosphere. This past Saturday, I was in Scottsdale again and wanted to bring my group there. I called a couple of days before and made reservation since there were 8 of us in our group. When we arrived, they said go to the bar so I told the bartender we had a reservation for 8. He looks at me and says  "Why the f*** would you make a reservation here?"  A little shocked, I replied were there are 8 of us. His response was "thats idiotic, no one makes reservations here and just laughs.  Needless to say, I was a little taken aback by his response and got a very bad feeling from this place. He asked what I wanted to drink and I walked away. I had no intention of bringing 8 people to eat and drink at a place that treats their customers with such disrespect. The security guards asked why were were leaving and when I explained they didnt know who the bartender was, only that they were sorry and he was new. He was a tall skinny guy with dark (longer ish) hair.  To the owner of this place, keep in mind this is how your staff is treating customers. To all other patrons, I would avoid it. We ended up down the street at a Mexican place where the servers actually wanted to serve us.
