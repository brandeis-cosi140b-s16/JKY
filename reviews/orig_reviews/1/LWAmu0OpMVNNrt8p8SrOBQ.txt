This has to be the worst Mexican food ever.  I'm not picky about authenticity - on the contrary, I grew up on Tex Mex and love it.  But I'm astounded that anyone could actually mess up queso dip.  It's spicy cheese dip, how did they manage to make it so totally gross?  Maybe it was partly because we had a divine meal at Nobu the night before, but it was awful and I would not eat there again.
