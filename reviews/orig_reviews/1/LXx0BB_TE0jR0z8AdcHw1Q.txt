Listen...Despite being a regular yelp user, I have never left a review.  I just don't have the inclination to do so, but this staff was so bad...here we go!   Hostess was rude and regularly not at her station despite not being busy.  I've just never seen so much scolding from a hostess!  Lots of open tables (less than half full!!!) but couldn't be seated for at least 30 minutes.  Drinks were weak.  Bartender yelled across the restaurant to the server.  So bad that potential customers were getting advice on other close by restaurants for breakfast from the hostess.  There appears to be a management problem.  The staff doesn't seem happy!  Unfortunately the food is pretty good and the ambiance nice.  This is over shadowed by the untrained staff.
