Dear Catastrophe Waitress,

It's not okay to push people out I your way or sneer at your customers.   We can't help it that the airport is busy and that you are poorly managed.  You shouldn't take your anger out on the very people on who you depend for you livelihood.  It's too bad you blew us off.  We are nice people and good tippers.  Happy Thanksgiving.
