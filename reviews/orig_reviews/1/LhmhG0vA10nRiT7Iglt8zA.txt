MUCHO NASTY.  I love great Mexican food, gone here +- years ago.  My waiter was attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  First my wife's Margarita had almost NO Tequila and almost no ice.  manager jazzed it up but VERY little.   The chips were decent but the salsa's  were runny and flavorless.  Ordered a cheese crisp it came to the table cold, ate 30%, sent it back.  Wife ordered the beef tamales  and they were the funkiest color and  most un-mexican she has ever had and she makes tamales.  The rice was HARD.  I ordered a chile relleno  with black beans.  The order came with hard rice, and refried beans (WRONG) and a relleno with 1/4 of a chili "honest" 1/4 ( 2" X 2")  the rest was batter and lots of it (6x6).  What a disappointment for $51.00. Dont get me wrong I made my choice to go there but an establishment has the responsibility to provide a quality product for the price they ask, $51 isnt chump change, I will spend 4 times that for a good meal.  From now on I go back to my mainstays Barrio Cafe, Richardson's Cuisine of Mexico, SOL, Cantina Laredo, The Mission, La Hacienda.  Macayos, why would bother put put out a product so poor when the competition is so keen, in the 80's your product was great.  Maybe times have left you behind.  .I really wish you well, retool.
