Beyond over priced and terrible service. I was almost ready to get up and leave due to NEVER getting water.  We had to remind the waitress over 3 times for everything. ... water.... flat ware.... napkins...all the stuff that should just be there standard at a restaurant anyways.  Food was ok but definitely  $$$. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND coming here.
