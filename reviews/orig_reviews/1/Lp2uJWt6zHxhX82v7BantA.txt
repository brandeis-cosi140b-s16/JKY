This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but nothing good lasts forever. The manager is a joke, I asked if they weren't going to have any mint limeade, the best part of Cafe Rio and he apologized and said there was no excuse. That's it? No we'll make more, nothing. The place has gone down hill and the manager is the reason. Food quality and service quality are just terrible.
