Horrible experience. They make you wait outside the club inline for no reason because was empty. I had a female promoter walk up on me & my husband with a beautiful smile ( could not hide behind it that she was under the influence)  she said loud & clear : open bar for ladies $15 & gentlemen pay $10 for cover only. When we got to the door things changed.. they charged $40 for both of us. -.- really? At that point,  after waiting and wanting a good time we paid and went in. 
Open bar sucked, they don't serve beer, their well brands are cheap. Club was dead. Left a little after 2:00am waiting for the busy friday night that the bartender assured us would happen by 12am...  never ever did.
