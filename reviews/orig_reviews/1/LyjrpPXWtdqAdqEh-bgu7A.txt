This was our first time trying it. Have to say that we were disappointed with the food. Chips and salsa were probably the best part of our dinner. We ordered the chef special chipotle enchilada and burrito and chicken quesadilla for our son. It's probably the blandest food I've ever had. Chicken had no flavor. Seemed boiled and shredded chicken wrapped in tortilla and smothered w chipotle sauce. Even the quesadilla was bland. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Stay away. Staff is cordial but food was horrible.
