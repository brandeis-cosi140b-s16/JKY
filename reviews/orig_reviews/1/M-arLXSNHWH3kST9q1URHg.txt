I gave this place two chances to prove itself, but they have failed me. Visited this place when all the hype came about but was severely disappointed in both the size and taste of these tacos. Yes, I know they are street tacos and they run small, but I had to order 20 just to get a good fill, so I decided to order every kind of taco they had. I wish I could tell you what those tacos tasted like, but they all lacked flavor ....literally no flavor.

I'm quite shocked at the reviews raving about the best tacos around....clearly  these tacos do not fit in any kind of a "good" category.
