Oh my gosh...this place sticks. Who are you newbs that are giving this place such high ratings? It's Taco Bell with a bar. Have you folks never been to Mexico, know Mexicans, ate at good Mexican rest? Yelp lets me down every once and awhile. The black beans seemed canned, the rice was dry and the taco meat was...well poor quality (see pic), I spit out as much as I ate. The chips and salsa were the highlights and they were average. Go to Si Senor in or Los Dos Molinos...trust me.
