We went on Sunday night because on Facebook it was advertised as a party more for LGBT community and Flamingo is very supportive. $20 each for liquor bust. We got there and nothing was mentioned about the party. Since I'm limited on what I can drink, I got the frozen Margarita. It was so light on alcohol and ton on sugar. We were ignored and hard to get drink refills because the staff seemed more on playing with each other than paying attention to their customers. It was very disappointing to say the least. Cover was taken care of thanks to slot machines. I read other reviews and based on what we went through, don't even want to try their food.
