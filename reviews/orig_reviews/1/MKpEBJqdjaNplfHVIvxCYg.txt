As a Vegas local its rare I make it to the strip. I stopped in to have a light bite and a drink. The food was good and the Chayo margaritas were great but our bartender Melissa was not so great. She was very dry, rude and unfriendly. I would come back but I recommend avoiding having Melissa wait on you. If I could I would give it one star. Service is everything in Vegas so zero rating for that!
