Ate here for lunch today. The place is dirty and greasy, especially the ceiling fans. I was glad they weren't on. Food: very skimpy for a Mexican restaurant. Ordered the #3 and got about 2 ounces of beans. The rice tasted like dish soap. The 2 tacos were chicken and beef, tasteless to say the least. I won't be back.
