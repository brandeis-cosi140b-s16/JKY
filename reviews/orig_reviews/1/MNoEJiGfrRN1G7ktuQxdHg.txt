Went there for taco Tuesday for my work about a month ago and order some to go. They were really good. However, I went there today, and the same bartender that helped me before said she wouldn't let me get any to go? What? So I asked to speak to a manager and the general manager came out and said he wouldn't do it. And it must have been an exception that one time. I explained it wasn't an exception, she did it no problem. He refused our order. And said "nobody does taco Tuesday's to go"

Really, cause I have never had anyone not allow it. 

So I went down the street to Los Taquitos and ordered a ton of food to go (all taco Tuesday items), and a month and a half ago backyard taco took our order to go for taco Tuesday to go without even question! (Backyard taco has the best tacos around but are slightly farther away).

You guys just lost lots of business as our company has over 200 employees and our organization has over 2,000 locally.

The sad part is I was there years ago when the chandler Dos opened and was friends with the owner and he would never have acted that way.  Now I see why they were dead at lunch time on Taco Tuesday at this location.
