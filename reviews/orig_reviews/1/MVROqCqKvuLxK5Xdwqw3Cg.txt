I've been here a few times, but I will never go back there again. Do to a large part of management and ownership. As I waited I've seen their employees get chewed out in Front of  customers by this woman who seems to be the owner. I don't think she's ever been to management training, but I got the feeling that she doesn't know what she's doing. She's seems stuck up and rude. 

As for the food, it's mediocre at best. The service by the waiters is good. They do have good chips and salsa. But I would not support establishment that does not treat their employees well.
