Saw all the great reviews and decided to eat there tonight. We walked in and no one greeted us, so went to sit down(thinking it was seat yourself).  The waiter came up to us and asked if we had reservations-no we did not; however, there were plenty of open tables.  He told us that table was reserved but we could have the table next to the front door. Ok fine, that would not lower my rating. Guacamole for appetizer was ok as were the chips and salsa. My chile relleno dinner arrived cold along with the rice and beans.   They did re heat for me but truly the dish was not good. The ground meat had a weird taste. My husband ordered the hanger steak. He said it was ok-not worth the money. Our dinner guest ordered the chicken tacos-nothing special. Dining room small, tables too close together. To top the night off, the table we wanted to sit at originally was never taken. Honestly for the money, NOT WORTH IT!  Plus, portions are small! Will not return-there are much better Mexican restaurants in this city for a less expensive price. Disappointing!
