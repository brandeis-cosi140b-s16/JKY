Great chips and salsa. And that's as much as I can rate. Seeing as we didn't get to order our drinks for a ridiculously long time. Then the sever never came to get our dinner order. So we paid and left. The chips and salsa is enough to make me give this place another shot but need to make sure there's no game or private party or anything that will make them busy and incapable of serving any other guests.
