I went here to check it out and have the microbrewed beer, and I'm just glad my stomach still works. They have to have the worst beer I have ever had in my life, and I have had over 190 different bottles of beer. I had the pilsner, and I knew from the start that it was going to be terrible. It came as a cloudy medium dark gold color. Pilsners are supposed to be light gold, clear, and crisp. This was the exact opposite, and I thought of it as a confused hefeweizen.

After I mangaged to choke that down, I tried the amber ale. The color was pretty good, so I was hoping this would be better. NEGATIVE. It had no aroma, and when I went to taste it, it tasted just like the pilsner. I had my girlfriend try both the beers too, she also agreed with me. 

Bottom line, don't ever try the beer there.
