I'm sorry I didn't pay closer attention to the reviews about this place. I expected a $$$ restaurant on the strip to be at least decent- this was horrible. The service was the worst I have experienced and the food was really disappointing. We were sat and eventually our drink orders and app order was taken; ~10 mins later our app came out (cold) and we hadn't received our waters or sangrias, plates, or table settings. So we waited longer- and finally a really nice busser brought water and table settings and apologized. Then the waitress came back and took our dinner order, which she got wrong, and when we agreed to keep it, it was awful. I was so flabbergasted by the whole experience- and shocked that no attempt was made to make up for the wrong food (at least comp the mistake; we didn't want to wait for the meals to be remade) and acknowledge that our drinks came so late (as we were starting into the mistake dinner). Overall, food and service was disappointing. Don't waste your time here when there's so many more options on the strip!!!
