To be fair we should have walked out the second we opened the door.  

We were looking for an actual Mexican place to have Margaritas and tacos. When you first walk in it is apparent that this place is a hipster "Mexican" food joint.  I noticed a lot of the reviews talking about how cool this place was.  if you're a little pretentious and want to feel like you are hanging with the cool kids, this might be the place for you.  If you want good food go elsewhere

Horrible.
Short version
A rude waiter, no margaritas, and a TINY $15 burrito that was disgusting.

This is the only time in my life I have left my food uneaten at the table of a restaurant and gone directly to another restaurant.
