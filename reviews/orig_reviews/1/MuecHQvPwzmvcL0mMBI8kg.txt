I was just here a few hours earlier today and I have to say that this is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. The service was absolutely horrible. Our waitress barely spoke English and seemed to forget about us. She came and got our drink and food orders and we didn't see her until the food came. My drink was empty for about 15 minutes. I would of asked for a refill as she walked by except for the fact she disappeared  the entire time. The food at La Casa Blanca is okay however it's very overpriced. I wouldn't mind the price if the service was halfway decent. I've eaten here several times since I moved to Arizona but after today I really don't think I will ever go back.
