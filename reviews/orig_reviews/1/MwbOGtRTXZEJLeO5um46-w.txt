If you're looking for over priced, small portions of food, with a fly problem and terrible service, this is the place for you! We dined here , post lunch, for a family members birthday with a large group. The server was rude, but expected when dining in Scottsdale. After taking our order 20 minutes prior, he came to inform the birthday girl and her husband that the dishes they had chosen were unavailable, so everyone else's food come out way before theirs. We asked for minor things numerous times and it took an unusually long amount of time to get them. The food was actually really good, so good that the multiple flies in the place couldn't help but want some too. Our dirty appetizer plates remained on the table for the entire meal and good luck getting a refill on water! For a place with pricey food, one would think they could put the effort in to provide better service....
