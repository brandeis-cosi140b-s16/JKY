This establishment is located in the Miracle Mile of Shops at Planet Hollywood.  Service was alright, food was ok, pricing was horrible.  I had the Mexican scramble which consisted of diced potatoes, tortillas and a very small amount of chorizo con egg.  When I say small amount-small amount for a couple of mouthfuls for $8 plus worth of food.  I really hate being taken advantage of on portion-pricing.  We will not make any more stops at this particular La Salsa.....
