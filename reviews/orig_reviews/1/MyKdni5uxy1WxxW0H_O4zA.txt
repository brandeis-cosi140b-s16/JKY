It hurts me to write this review but I gave Lindo another chance after our last experience and they didn't redeem themselves. I've lived here in Vegas for 40 years and have gone here as a teenager and alway ALWAYS had the best food and service. Unfortunately this no longer is the case. The service is okay and it's just a hopeful for the horrible food we had once again. The chicken was overcooked and dry again, the servers or the cooks do not listen to the slightest dish modifications. If they have this many items on the menu they should be able to meet at least somewhat decent standards to detail.. dishes are made sloppy and inconsistent. Servings have gotten smaller, prices have gotten higher. We alsom put in a to go order and it was a disaster. I hope the best for the owners, but me, my family and freinds and client's will no longer be Lindo Michoacan customers
