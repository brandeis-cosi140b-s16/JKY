Closed Circuit event is a rip off definitely not 110 worthy!!! Shitty service they don't let anyone sit on the tables/ couches  but that doesn't matter I get it but at least have some chairs for ppl other than reserved not long tables!! Screens are average size nothing special .. Drinks good. Would I Come again? Hell no. Disappointed.
