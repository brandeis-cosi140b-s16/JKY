Been here twice and had horrible service each time. First time, we waited 45 minutes before a server came to our table to get our drink order. We had to get up and flag someone down. Then of course after that, we had multiple servers coming up asking if we had been helped yet... I think it's because they pool tips and don't have table sections... They all are either redundant or no where to be found.

Second time I went it was one of the strangest experiences I've ever had... Ever.  We were asked THREE times by multiple servers if we had a safe way to get home,but instead of them asking it that way, they gave us long dance-around-the-issue schpeels about the community and how they want to keep it safe. We told em we were light railing home and lived down the street.... they were obviously worried about us drinking and driving. Even after that, thy still failed to being us our last round... Without actually telling us they were cutting us off. We each had three drinks and dinner and had been there for three hours. Then we had to get up and ask for the bill TWICE because no one ever came back to our table after three of them had bomboarded us with questions at separate times.
