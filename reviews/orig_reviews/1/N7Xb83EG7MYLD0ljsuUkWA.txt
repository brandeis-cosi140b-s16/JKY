We went here last Sunday 4-21-13 the servers were rude. We wanted to sit outside they took our name and we to ask how much longer, we went up to see why it was so taking so long. they sat 6 other people behind us, we finally got a table and they made such a fuss we left, what the hell all we wanted was to eat. They get no stars if I could. We had 2 coors light and a chips and salsa 37.00 dollars. Rediculous. We had to explain to manager and waitress about 7 times.
