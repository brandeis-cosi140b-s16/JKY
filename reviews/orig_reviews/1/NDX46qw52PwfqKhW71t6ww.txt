The chips are bland and tasteless. The gluten free menu consists of only 5 things when I know it would be very easy to create a gluten free meal with the help of a knowledgeable and courteous waiter or waitress. Not the case for me. So I settled for the naked taco salad for $10 and asked for a side of sour cream and had to pay extra for it. I checked the menu and they charge $10 for a regular taco salad which comes in a tortilla shell. So I'm confused here you take out the shell and charge the same amount and charge me for sour cream?? Overpriced, overrated gross food and whoever is in charge of the gf menu is lazy. I will never eat here again.
