My husband and I ate there and it was the worst tasting food. My beef taco tasted like fish and burnt oil, my beans were cold and my rice was hard, his burrito had a hair in it and had a fishy taste to it aswell. The service was terrible, they never came to check on us. Both of us got so sick I couldn't get out of bed and he couldn't off the toilet.
