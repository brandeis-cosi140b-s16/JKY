No More - gave it another try and bad experience again.
The food is good but no better in quality as the nearby little Mexican take out diners. They display their food nicely in a beautiful environment.
You should never have a bad experience at a restaurant, especially Mexican Restaurant, that has the high prices this place has. It's a special treat to go there for the ambiance and fabulous view of Las Vegas.
But the last two times (Latest this week) it has been really bad from the management especially.
First time we took a special out of town guest because she likes Mexican Food and is a vegetarian. There are vegetarian items on the menu but three times and long waits in between they put meat in all of her food. She never got her dinner-nor did the manager even stop by to help. The rest of the table ate as she waited.
Second time - We received a promotion in the mail from the restaurant which advertised their happy hour and a 15% discount. We said "Hey, we haven't been there in awhile, lets go." The promotion pulled us in. They would not accept the promotion we received saying that it was for the dinner hour only. (which the promotion did not say and we called their attention to) Still no deal. Now keep in mind, this made our experience so negative and for only a $2.25 promo. How cheap can they get for a classy place. And once again the manager did not come by to help.
Our family knows this restaurant back in the day when it was just a little cart downtown Las Vegas. What a shame.
I sure hope the downtown Vegas location is still good.
We will never return to the Henderson NV location on Carniege.
