We go to Fiesta Mexican often.  The food is always excellent.  We have always had very good service.  The restaurant is clean.
About two weeks before Cinco de Mayo, I made reservations for seven of us for 5:30.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time.  One member of our group checked in first.  She was told that we would be seated about 6:15.  I went to the desk and told them that we had 5:30 reservations.  We were told that we would be seated in just a few minutes.  Twenty minutes later we were still standing there.  We kept checking in and kept being told the same thing.  Granted, the restaurant was extremely busy, but just about everyone had reservations.  At almost 6:30 we were finally seated.  We were in the front of the restaurant, but in the back of the section.  We never saw a waitress.  After waiting 30 minutes, I used my cell phone to call the front desk.  Finally, a busboy was able to send a manager over.  She is the one who took care of us.  There was a party of 79 in one of their backrooms.  If you know that you have a huge party and you are booked solid for the night, then you should have enough sense to make sure that you have enough help. 
As many times as we have been there and as much as we like the food, WE WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK!  
I am glad that they were able to make it with so many places closing, but there are too many places to go to put up with that kind of nonsense.
