When this restaurant opened we went in there for dinner and I had the worst experience.  After taking a couple of bites of my food, I bit on a 1/2" bolt and almost broke my tooth.  When brought to the manager's attention, he made light of it with a remark " we were looking for this bolt all day long". None of our meals were complimented and we have never been there again. I think I spoke to the owner at that time. Never again!!
