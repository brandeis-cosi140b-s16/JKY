I'd like to give them negative stars. They sat us at a dirty table and when we asked to have it wiped down she seemed annoyed. Service was terrible, our waitress Jessica was rude and unprofessional. She never refilled our drinks or asked if we needed anything else when she swooped my plate off the table and ignored my empty water glass. When we asked to split the check she rolled her eyes at us. And to top it off, the food was mediocre.
