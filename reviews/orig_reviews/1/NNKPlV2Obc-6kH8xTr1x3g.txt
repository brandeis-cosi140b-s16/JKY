I was craving Cuban food when I flew into Vegas. I found this place online and decided to try it after reading reviews. It was Monday around 8:30 pm and they were closed despite lisiting online they were open until 10 pm. I drove across town for nothing and leave town tomorrow.  They should really update their listings online.
