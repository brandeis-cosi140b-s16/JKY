Would never go here again. The hostess said it was a 30 minute wait for an outside table & the place wasn't even half full, there were empty tables everywhere including outside. The "mug" drinks were way overpriced, came in a tiny plastic cup & barely had any booze in them. The bartender less friendly then a rabid porcupine. We waited for 20 minutes & NEVER saw a waiter which means we also never got to eat because we became tired of waiting & left. The only semi redeeming quality was the atmosphere, which was pleasantly quiet for a few minutes but after which it became frequently punctuated Every other minute by a loud, obnoxious, mumbled, unintelligible voice screaming some ridiculous crap about something going on in the restaurant. 
That was our cue to split & look for a place that would actually be happy to serve us.
