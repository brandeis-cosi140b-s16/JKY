This place is disgusting! I am surprised at all of these reviews...and the crazy long line and good reviews were "false advertising" for me.  We waited a while after struggling for parking on Friday night, and I had high expectations.  I got enchiladas with chile beef and tomatillo sauce with rice and black beans.  

...when the kid came around to ask how our meal was, the poor guy was not expecting to listen to a real answer I am sure....but he learned that I had both a hair in my food AND a clump of salt dumped into my enchiladas.  His offer: queso for my pain (no refund or free meal coupon).  I turned him down...after all, I lost my appetite and certainly won't be back.

Here is the deal - Just like Law and Order, THE ORIGINAL is the BEST...Chipotle cannot be topped...
