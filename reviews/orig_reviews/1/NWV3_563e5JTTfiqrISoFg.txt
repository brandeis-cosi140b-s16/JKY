I genuinely hate places like this; "this" being places that lull you in with some back story of the "MUY AUTENTICO" food/founder and their story of making wholesome food from old recipes, et cetera, and then you get your meal and realize either the founder was a liar or they just have been serving trash since she died.

I had a combo plate with a tamale, a tostada, and a taco. All tasted like they came straight from the microwave, and the standard beans-rice accompaniment was typical from a box/can in taste. (I got black beans, and they were served in a bowl. They were *just* like you would get from a can, and pretty sure they were floating in the can-water which most people discard).

I guess you can say one thing about this place: It's an equal-opportunity employer. However, that's not a good thing in this case: The college valley-girl type staffs the joint and very loudly gossips in front of customers- Like, welcome to Tempe! As if!

Can't believe they charge more than 3 bucks for a plate for this stuff in good conscience.

Leave it.
