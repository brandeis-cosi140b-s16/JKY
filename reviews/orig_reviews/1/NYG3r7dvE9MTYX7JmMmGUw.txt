This place is a joke. The employees are slow as can be, they f*ck the portions up, they look at you like you're an idiot when you are ordering. I wouldn't give this place another shot unless someone else was paying for it. I feel this place should be shut down and a Filibertos or something of that nature should open up in its place. Hell I will just go to the Taco Bell that's in the same parking lot. 

The one star is because they had air conditioning.

Manager should be fired.
