I went once and was very unimpressed.  Since I live in walking distance I decided to go back and just get a quesadilla and a beer.  Who could mess that up right?  I had to laugh when my corona tasted skunky and quesadilla was so bad I only had one slice.  You need to have very very low standards to enjoy this place.
