Bartender did not serve us so we moved to high top. Waited still no service. No drinks. Finally asked who server was. Bartender than said she was. We sat there for another few minutes. Mind you it's 830 on a Sunday- bar empty. Ended up leaving. Four servers, minimum, standing around. Frequent customer.. WILL NOT RETURN!! Bartender - female brunette.
