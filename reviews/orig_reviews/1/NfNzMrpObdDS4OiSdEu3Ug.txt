I have been a regular at Via for over 20 years. The food was always great but the service often lagged. They fixed that over the recent years but the food quality is now sagging and the portions are shrinking. Went there the other night...ordered chicken tacos. When they came we found they were rancid...stunk so bad we almost got ill right there. The server they told us they make them in the morning...yuck. That does it for us...moving on.
