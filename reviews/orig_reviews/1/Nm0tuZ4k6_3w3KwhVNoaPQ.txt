Used to frequent about 2 times a week. Salsa and street tacos were excellent. Burritos inconsistent, and got super sick from a breakfast burrito. Throwing up for a good 6 hours. Even though I was a regular there, there was never a " hi hello good to see you" . Pretty much a lack in the basics of customer service. The owner looks like he's in a bad mood all the time and is sometimes out front on cell phone making personal calls. One time they forgot about my order and waited for about 15 minutes while they served other people, not even busy and failed to recognize one of there regulars was waiting. Still charged me full price with a "sorry". When I see businesses like this succeed without the basics in customer service it makes me want to open up a business just on principal. Maybe there's a handbook " customer service for dummies". You can't really go by these other reviews because most if these people have probably never left the east valley and have minimal sophistication when it comes to dining and customer service.
