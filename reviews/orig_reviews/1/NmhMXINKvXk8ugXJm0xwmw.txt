I never write reviews, especially after I've gotten home from my trip, but this restaurant compelled me to. It's horrible. Don't eat here. I should've checked yelp before we did because it is disgusting food and poor service. I mean, I'm sure if you're there just to drink, it's probably fine, but that's where it ends. The enchiladas were VERY bad. Tasted like canned sauce. The rice tasted like the kind you get in a bag from the grocery and microwave. Not even close to being "authentic" mexican food. Just a joke. My friends food was half cooked, half wet. Yeah, gross. The Coke machine was flat and when I asked for another, I never got it. We waited 15 minutes and then finally just told them to forget it. Again, DO NOT EAT HERE.
