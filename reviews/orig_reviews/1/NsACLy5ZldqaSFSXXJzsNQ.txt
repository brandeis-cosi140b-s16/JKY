My wife and I never get to go out and finally we get child care to go to our favorite place and find out about new ownership. We were willing to give it a shot and were instantly turned off. While having drinks before dinner at the bar I ordered a ultra and got a corona I quickly told the bartender she made a mistake and she told me that she would have to eat this beer while giving me what I ordered! I was shocked and asked my wife if I was hearing things and she said ,NOPE! We paid our tab and left. It seems like every time we find a great place in tukee it always changes!
