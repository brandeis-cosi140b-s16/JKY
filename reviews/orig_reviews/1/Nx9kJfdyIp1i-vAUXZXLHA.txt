This place was extremely disappointing.  I went there for dinner earlier in the week. It was very crowded, but not just with people, the tables are way too close together it is a very unpleasent atmosphere.  It was also way too loud in there, you had to shout to be heard by the people you were sitting with.  It was dinner time, not night club time, there was just no reason to have to music so loud at that time of day.   Atmosphere aside, the food was just down right bad.  I had the fish and chips and spent the rest of the evening trying not to vomit as I walked the strip.  It actually made me queezie. 
Lastly, this place is expensive, a beer....one 12 ounce bottle of beer was $8.00.  Eight dollars for 1 bottle of Coors Light!   There are many places to eat on the Vegas Strip, I for one will never go back to this place.
