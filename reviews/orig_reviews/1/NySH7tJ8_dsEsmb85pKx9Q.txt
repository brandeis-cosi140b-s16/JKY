Had previously enjoyed the food quality and atmosphere, atmosphere is still the same, food has diminished considerably, had fish tacos the last time and the fish pieces were notable and tasty, this times visit my companion had the El Jefe Chimichanga ~ A crisp burro filled with your choice of grilled chicken, saut√©ed onions and tomatoes. Topped with guacamole, sour cream, cheese and green onions. Served with rice and beans. $14.50.
The Chimi was dry, a glob of tasteless guac on top, dollop of sour cream and dry chicken inside.
My fare was Alfredo's Green Chile Pork ~ A plate of tender pork simmered in a spicy Hatch green chile sauce. Topped with Monterey Jack cheese and served with rice, beans and flour tortillas. $11.50.
The plate was 90% beans and rice, the tender pork consisted of maybe 6 to 8 pieces the size of Lima beans, covered with pico to mask the portion size.  I tasted one of the pieces of pork and it was tolerable, but while searching for it's companions, i decide to return it to the kitchen and chose to forgo a replacement, ate my chewy and bland tortillas that tasted as tho they had been microwaved before being placed in the foil.
The Manager came to the table to apologize and advised that he had admonished the kitchen on the amount of protein; and suggested that it may have be the "end of the portions", not exactly what i wanted to hear as an apology. We will be looking for other options for our Mexican Fare, to bad.
