Disgusting! The salsa tasted like a can of puree tomatoes. The chicken tortilla soup had 3 small chunks of chicken and it tasted like a heated version of the salsa, hot puree tomatoes. Simply the worst meal I've had in a while. I will never return. In fact I felt robbed cause a cup of soup, chips n salsa and a Pepsi was $11.35 before tip. I know its Vegas but seriously. Do you know how many cans of tomatoes I could have bought with this money? I could have made nasty soup and salsa for our entire block!!!

This place was a hot mess down to the waiter who asked me every 5 freaking minutes if I needed anything.
