Every Christmas I order a party tray, as I did thisyear. I went to pick up my order on Christmas eve and had to wait almost 40 minutes to get my order. On top of that, 2 other people had come and gone and received their orders in a timely manner. When I asked Daniela to check on my order she was VERY rude. Also, I did not receive everything I ordered. It is sad, because I love the food, but we will never go back to that location.
