Hmm... 

Nonplussed. Mind draws a blank when I think of a positive, and grows tired of all the negative that begin to stir. 

So, the interior is somewhat attractive, but does not distinguish itself from other restaurants. I may not have ordered the piece de resistance here, but I did order something I thought would ignite "tasty" in my mouth, but didn't. Overcooked eggs, mutilated, also overdone chorizo. Chewed this stuff with a crying smile. Don't order off the Sunday brunch. 

One of those places not worth the drive.
