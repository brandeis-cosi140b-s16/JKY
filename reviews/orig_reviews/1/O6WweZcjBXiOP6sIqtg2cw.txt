Terrible! The service was so slow. Food was way too spicy. I ordered a taco salad and instead they brought me chicken tacos. Waiter rushed me the correct order then after. But sadly it was drenched with dressing. I got the dressing on the side plus a drenched salad! He took it off the bill and I spent the night starving. My husband said burrito was good but on the spicy side. This place lacks organization and is too pricey. Manager was MIA. We didn't ask for one but you can tell that they weren't there. The frozen margarita was way too tart and was presented in a beer glass. I couldn't even finish it. Waisted $$ on that one too. We tipped the waiter well regardless. But what a disappointment!
