Jay. He I introduced himself as the manager... We showed up at 1:59 on 9/21/15 and he refused us service. There were several people still at the bar, as well as, ordering food. He informed us the kitchen was closed and refused to serve us. 

I would love to try this place, but due to the horrible management I honestly will NOT return.
