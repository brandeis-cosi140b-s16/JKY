I've reviewed F&L's before - Food's good 4*, portions are a little smaller than you might expect.  I clean my plate every time.  How many Mexican restaurant's can you say that about?

I've had bad experiences here TWICE when using internet coupons or certificates.  The 1st time, I was told that the restaurant was no longer accepting that particular certificate.  I had just purchased those coupons about a month before.  Now, I PAID money for those certificates, but, it was a discounted amount, so I sucked it up and threw my two remaining certificates (and money) away.

Now, a week ago, I got a notice that a Deal Chicken I had purchased for F&L was expiring.  I buy a lot of online Coupons (Groupon type), and I don't remember what I bought where or if I used it or not.  I checked online, and the coupon site said my certificate was good.  So, we trotted down to Old Town for dinner and when I presented my certificate, they said it had already been used.  Apparently, they log their certificates on paper and DON'T update the websites issuing them.  We were the 3rd table that night trying to redeem a coupon that had been used before.  The manager came over and apologized, but it was really too late.  We had a bad experience for no reason, other than the owner's refusal to log coupons online as used.
