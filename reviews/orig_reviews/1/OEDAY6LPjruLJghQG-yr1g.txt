Despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian, and put them in the vegetarian burrito, The Original Burrito Company makes their beans with CHICKEN STOCK. 

This is false information they are providing to people, and when people have moral issues with consuming meat, this turns into a huge issue.

I will never eat here again. I do not support businesses that are dishonest.
