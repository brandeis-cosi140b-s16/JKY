Went to celebrate an  early Mother's Day  and wanted to try somewhere new to us!  Won't go back... Food was terrible.. Lobster enchilada and they forgot the lobster. All u could taste was corn tortilla, thick, and dry .  Meatloaf was over cooked, green chile burger was flavorless.  The nachos and  beer were the best part.  Sorry to my family for wasting your money.
