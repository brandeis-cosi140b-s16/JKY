I have been a big fan of Richardson's since its old location and love it and its sister restaurants, Dick's and Rockerij.  The food is fantastic, creative and always hot which is something I really like.  Went there today for lunch and the food did not disappoint.  The service, however, was a different matter.  Our waitress was not pleasant and either completely overwhelmed or just incapable.  We would have had at least two additional rounds of drinks for the 5 of us but we had a tough time finding our waitress.  Even getting our water glasses refilled was tough.  We actually had to go find someone it was so bad.  We asked her for an additional silver setup which she brought but when we again asked for more water and if she could find our waitress so we could order more drinks, we got attitude and the its not my section look.  In addition to being non existent for most of the visit when she was around our waitress was really bit**y and showed no personality or interest in us being there.  We were there for almost two hours to get through lunch and while the food was good, its tough to enjoy when you can't even get a glass of water.  Lastly, we ordered red beers and rather than charging us the $3.50 beer price plus some amount for a little hot sauce we got billed for full on bloody Mary's.  Not a big deal but didn't really seem right.  We will ultimately go back but with their understaffed or just poorly trained service they missed out on an additional $70 in drinks from our table alone and probably one or two visits over the next month until we just can't stay away any longer.  Really hoping the next experience will be better.
