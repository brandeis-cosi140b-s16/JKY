Had not been here in years and it looks as though I have not missed a darn thing! The ONLY bright spot was the warm crispy chips and their Macayo sauce (plus the friendly observant guy who kept the shiny silver chip bowl full!) 

Ordered the mini-mex sampler...Seriously, the Don Jose's frozen mini-chimi's and taquito's have far better flavor! It wasn't like the food was awful-it was bland... Not even worth the chewing... 

My husband ordered the salmon that came with a chili verde enchilada. He said the seasoning on the salmon was good but the poor salmon was as dry as my contacts after being worn 4-days in a row. The bite of enchilada was fine-nothing exciting but didn't make me sick either. 

The servers were pleasant. 

Definitely won't be eating here again given the other good eateries in town and the fact that I can buy Don Jose's at Smith's or Albertson's for far less dinero!
