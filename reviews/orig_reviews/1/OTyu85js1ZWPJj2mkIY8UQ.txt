First off im going to say the service was absolutely terrible. I cant get it out of my head how bad the service was, so the rest of the meal was just ok. Cant really say to much about this place. I ordered the burrito and asked for steak to be in it and it came out with Carnita in it. Then my fiance ordered the wrap and the server asked if she wanted fries with it acting like they came with the wrap and we get the bill and it was a $3.50 up charge. Not acceptable for the server to act like it came with the meal and charge. I swear to god the server stopped by our table maybe 2 times the whole meal. Also the manager stopped by the table and asked if everything was alright and I had to inform him of all the terrible things. Wasnt trying to be mean but he had to know. If you want terrible service and ok food check it out. But dont let my bad experience shy you away, go experience it for yourself. I will not be going back. Also the server had no menu knowledge and was rude to us as soon as we sat. Also it was the first time in my life that I didnt tip. That server wasnt worth a penny, and thats me being nice. Not a Place for a CHEF of a different mexican restaurant. Now I know why I push my staff, So they dont turn out like this.
