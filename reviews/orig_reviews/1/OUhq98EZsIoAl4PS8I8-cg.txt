The food here was decent... 
However the service was the absolute worst service I have had in ever being in vegas. They have more employees than clients, and took 20min to bring out diet coke. Also, the 3 bartenders made our drinks and they sat on their counter for 20 min until we had to ask the manager would anyone mind bringing us our drinks that have been melting... no exaggeration, they have more employees than customers. 3 bartenders made our 3 drinks and not one could walk the drinks 4ft to our table. What a terrible experience.

As for the bill, if you get a margarita Cadillac style, they charge you for a margarita, and then they add $5.00 for "Cadillac" stlye..  that's a definite first. 

Overall, very over priced, food is decent, but for the lack of service and the prices this place is kind of a joke. It explains why there's more servers that don't really serve than there was customers...
