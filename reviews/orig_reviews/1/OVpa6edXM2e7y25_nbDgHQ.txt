What can I say about this place. I haven't been here in 2years. The service is poor. The food is good. But don't expect them to serve you a good portion of rice. I tried there chocolate and ice cream dessert. Tasted like shit. So I tried flan. How can you screw up flan right?  Yep. They did. It tasted nothing like flan. Tasted like straight up cheesecake. 
The place is going down hill. 2 years ago this place was good. But now,  now it is terrible.
