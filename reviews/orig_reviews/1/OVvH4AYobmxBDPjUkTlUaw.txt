My daughter went with her grandmother and grandfather to this restaurant. I am appalled at the experience my little girl had. My in-laws are a inter-racial couple, and were treated so badly because of that. They were sat at a table, no one came to help them. Another couple was sat next to them, they had their order and drinks brought right away. My in-laws still have not been greeted, then when they said something and they asked for a manager the hostess brought a waitress. The waitress had an attitude and said "I guess I can help you, what do you want?". When they tried to leave the manager came out and comped them their starter but sat them away from all other customers so they couldn't be heard if complaining. 
This is outrageous! In 2015, in Arizona we have to worry about my daughter learning about racism at such a young age. A black man and white woman cannot be served like everyone else? I will never eat here and I hope no one else does either. An establishment like this should not be allowed to be in business.
