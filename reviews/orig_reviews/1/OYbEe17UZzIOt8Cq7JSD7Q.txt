Went here once with a friend who was excited to drink some tequila at a bar that specializes in it. However, once we got the menu we were ready to go.  Prices for their various tequila shots were insane.  We settled on the happy hour shot (which was still a little pricey), paid our bill and were off to Robbie Foxes next door.
