Terrible service. It to 40 minutes (by the clock) to get a passable quesadilla and a beer , for which I was charged $25. The only table available when I sat down was two dueces pushed together as a four top. When I saw two friends looking for a table I invited them to join me at the adjoining table. The waitress refused to serve them unless they found their own table because she had already taken my order. 

I later joined three friends at the bar and ordered the same draft I had at the table for each of us. The glass was half the size but the charge was the same. 

 I have never run across a place that charges so much for so little and gives you such attitude. There must be 40+ more restaurants at McCarran,  any must be a better choice.
