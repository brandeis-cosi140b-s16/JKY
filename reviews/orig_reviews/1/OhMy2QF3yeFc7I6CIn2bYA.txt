The young lady out front, seated us immediately, she was great! But once we got in, it took the man about 10 minutes to even acknowledge us. Once he did and asked for our ID and basically offended my friend because her ID hair was dark brown, and she'd recently went to light brown! We ordered the happy hour nachos, wings, guacamole, and quesadillas. The guacamole was fantastic. They do give chips and salsa as a courteousy, but the salsa was only so so. They gave me 3 chicken wings! I mean i understand it's the happy hour menu, but 3 wings is just wrong! The nachos were TERRIBLE!!!! The chese tasted like powdered chese, i immediately spit it in my napkin. The waiter saw the whole thing of nachos still on the table and he didnt even ask if everything was alright. He never checked on us, and i NEVER got the salt that i asked for when he brought the chips and salsa. The waitress that was assisting nearby tables wouldnt even look our way. You could tell it was one of those restaurants where they only help their assigned tables. For about 10 minutes we waited for our waiter, then for another 5 minutes we were just waiting to see any staff so we could get our bill. We finally waived down the hostess who had to go get our waiter. Needlesss to say, i did not leave a tip, no one in that restaurant deserved one, accept the hostess actually!! WILL NEVER GO BACK, there are too many restaurants in Vegas to put up with that!!!
