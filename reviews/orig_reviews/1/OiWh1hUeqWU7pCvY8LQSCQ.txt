This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. First off it looks like it's barely clean on the inside. Second, the tacos I had were not good at all, and third you have to listen to the staff screaming in Mexican the whole time your eating. Not pleasurable at all. Do not go here for tacos.. Find somewhere else!
