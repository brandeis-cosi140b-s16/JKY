I was very disappointed with Senor Frog's.  

My husband and I wanted to have a nice evening and chose to go out to the strip. (We are locals)  and I have a few complaints.

1. Very loud.  I couldn't even talk to my husband who was sitting next to me.  We had to ask our server multiple times to repeat herself.

2.  The free shots.  I don't drink alcohol for personal beliefs and a spotlight was put on me despite the fact that I did not have a napkin flying above my head.  The guy came over and I had to cover my mouth and say no.  He did not want to take no for an answer.  I had to repeat myself 3 times before he left me alone.

3. I did not receive a balloon hat.  I may not drink, but I understand silliness.  I work with children. . .

4.  No Id's were checked.  Their were children in the dining area and alcohol freely being given.  I noticed an older woman looked very angry that the free alcohol guy was trying to give a shot to a younger girl at the table.  

5.  Food was not great.  I got pasta and it seemed more like soup.  Way too much sauce for anyone.

Afterwards, my husband and I agreed that we would not go there again.  We have had wonderful  experiences at other bars and restaurants and we will not go back to Senor Frog's.
