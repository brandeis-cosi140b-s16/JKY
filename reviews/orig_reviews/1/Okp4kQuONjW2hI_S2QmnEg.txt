From the beginning to the end was absolutely the worst service I have ever received EVER extremely disappointed ! We sat down after about 5 mins the waiter came by to take out drink order I'm a sucker for a yummy Michalada but that's not what I got I got a glass with ice and lime and a bottle of beer on the side (which was left untouched) the we order our food I ordered the chicken salad in a tortilla shell and husband ordered a shrimp ceviche salad (looked awesome) so after the food arrived my dressing was left out so after 10-15mins I was able to get the attention of a waiter to have him bring it out! So disappointed with the lack of customer service ! I usually enjoy this place but what a waste of 50.00$ this visit was! Maybe if the waiters paid attention to paying customers instead of chatting he could have seen how disappointing this experience was !!
