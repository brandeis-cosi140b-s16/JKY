DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.  We got seriously scammed on our gift card and management has done nothing about it.  They don't care that their customers are  being ripped off because they already got their money.  I had to file a complaint with the Attorney General's office against Richardson's/Rokerij.
