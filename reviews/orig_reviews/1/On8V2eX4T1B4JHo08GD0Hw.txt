Me and a friend recently visited here and had a wonderful time. The ambiance was excellent, the staff was courteous and we really enjoyed watching them encourage patrons to participate on the mechanical bull. The in-house dj also had a great mix. We shared a carafe of the don margaritas, which was good but did have tons of ice. The next morning we both woke up with a terrible case of food poisoning. Symptoms included fever (106 degrees) muscle aches, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms. We actually required medical treatment at the local urgent care due to the severity and duration of the symptoms. Items we ordered included the cilantro cream soup, tortilla soup, crispy fish/cilantro mayo tacos and carnitas/Mexican herbs tacos. We had not eaten anywhere else during this time period.
