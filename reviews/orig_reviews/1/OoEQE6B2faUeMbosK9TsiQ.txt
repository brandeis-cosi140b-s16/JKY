Been here many times and will continue to go just because the queso is amazing and there margaritas are good. But their service is awful and so is some of the management. I went there just recently with a friend and we both ordered a chimichanga with black beans. For some reason our beans had little tiny rocks in them. I called the manager over and notified him that our beans had tiny rocks and he said "That happens sometimes and walked away!" I have never been so confused or shocked at his reaction. I no longer order food from them but still stop by on happy hour for their cheap appetizers and margaritas.
