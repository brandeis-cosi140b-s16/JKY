First of all I'm not a mad person. For the most part I would go to El Hefe Scottsdale probably every weekend. But this is probably the last time I will ever go to Hefe. This is ridiculous. I woke up Sunday morning to find that I left my card at hefe. I called in the morning and spoke to the manager Gabby who told me my card was there and too come by and pick it up when I could. I went over to pick my card up and a new manager, Eric, was now there. I asked about my card and he said he was not sure where it was, but to not worry and to not close my account. I kept in contact, and it is now Monday. After speaking with three managers who could not locate my card, but all telling me it was safe and to keep it open, I called my credit card company and found that my card had been being charged after I lost it, one of the places listed being a charge for el hefe the Sunday after I had lost it. I don't know if an employee had taken it, or if it had been accidentally switched with another card, but the fact three managers told me to not worry when I obviously had a right to makes me uncomfortable. Again as a regular at hefe, I do enjoy spending time here and the one on mill, but it will be a while until I spend Saturday night at hefe Scottsdale.
