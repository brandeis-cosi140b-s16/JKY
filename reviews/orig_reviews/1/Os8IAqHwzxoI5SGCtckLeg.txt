Gazooks, Gazooks, Gazooks - I wanted to like you, I really did. Enchiladas and soup - interesting concept though mysteriously, I found only one soup on the menu upon arrival. Yes sir, I was greeted by a single lonely Tortilla soup but yet the "soup" part somehow snug into the restaurant's naming convention. And while on the topic of corn, please know that asking your staff if the corn was organic was akin to asking "what is the meaning of life?" It required pondering so deep that I was unlikely to get an answer in this lifetime. So I resigned myself to my GMO corn maza and headed past some dried out looking fillings (was that mashed potatoes I saw??) for the toppings...still hopeful.  What an  impressive array indeed.  There is not much I don't like about Pico de Gallo, except maybe for someone fishing for the spoon in its deepest depths. Glove or no glove, I'm not a fan of anything that requires being buried wrist deep. Call it a personal preference. I finally sat down in the noisy room amongst my fellow starved and desperate cubicle dwellers. Upon first bite,  I suddenly understood the importance of the topping selection. You see, without the addition of every creamy substance known to man, your enchiladas are regretfully forgettable. The overall concept strikes me as an interesting cross of Chipotle and Subway - just minus flavorful food, but with the general poor training of Subway staff. So Gazooks, we are not a match. It's me, not you. (Disclaimer: The aforementioned phrase is designed to maintain your self-esteem while really expressing that
 it is, in fact, you.)
