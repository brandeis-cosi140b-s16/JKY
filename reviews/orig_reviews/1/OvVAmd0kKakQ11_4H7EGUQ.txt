They charge more at the registers than on the menu.  If a taco is $2.75 ea. then at the registers they will charge an extra $.85 and lie through their teeth or hopefully you are too drunk to notice and say the taco costs $3.60 plus tax not the menu prices you see up on the board or on the paper menus.  A combo will cost up to $2.75 more at the registers, again they will deceive you with BS.  They've been doing this on and off between summer and spring for the past four years yet nobody notices the price differential on the board or paper menus and the registers.  They still have SLEAZY waitresses not servers who encourage patrons to buy more drinks.  I believe they have sex in the bathrooms during open mic nights, I saw a condom on the floor. Several years ago I remembered when they started out on 43rd Ave and north of Dunlap Ave they did the same thing, and neither the city, county, nor state did nothing.  This reminded me of another restaurant in Glendale who are still operating there after so many years.  Where is the common decency?!
