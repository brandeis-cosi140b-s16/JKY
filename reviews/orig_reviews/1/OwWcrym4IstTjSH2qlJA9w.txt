Stay clear of this tourist trap!!  Straight out of 1980 atmosphere that is way overpriced for watered down drinks with mediocre food.  The service is apologetic,for the service and the cost.  And for all the misery they will charge you $2.00 per person in your group for the honor of sitting in their deplorable establishment, even if you don't eat or drink.  Worst dining experience I've ever had.  $16.00 for a freakin quesadilla that you can buy at your local taco stand for $2.50.  You've been warned!
