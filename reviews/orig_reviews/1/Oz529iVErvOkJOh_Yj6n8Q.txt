HORRIBLE!!! This place is disgusting! The tablecloth makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. There was nasty food all over it and they obviously have not been washed in a while (if ever). The food came straight from serving dishes and the microwave. The service sucked really  bad. We had a Groupon and even with that our bill was over $40 for just two people and I had water to drink and my husband just had a pop. It is awkward that the waiter is hovering over you while you put your tip into the iPad they run your card on. I didn't want to leave any but I cannot be THAT mean.  It is WAY over priced! I wish I did not have to leave any stars for this place. Go to Taco Bell over this place. Awful.
