This place is really gross, I was very disappointed the best thing about my meal was my water. I got the tortas del principe super greasy my boyfriend got the tortas del Reyes it was so much weird meat it was too much. The bathrooms were nice and customer service was ok but all in all the tortas were a disappointment
