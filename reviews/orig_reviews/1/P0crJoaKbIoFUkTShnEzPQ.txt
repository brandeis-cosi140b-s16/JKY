NO!

DO NOT - UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - GO HERE  (zer0 stars)
this place reinforces the simulacrum that is las vegas, and does for mexican food what the vegas strip does for reality - presents a fabricated approximation of what should actually be.    

by far the worst "Mexican" food I've ever had, and definitely the most expensive. even the margarita was terrible.  mainly i was shocked and appalled by their veggie burrito.  on the menu it was described as including black beans, rice, corn, cheese, and peppers.  this sounded pretty good....but when it showed up the black beans were on the side and the cheese was on top.  i was so hungry that i got hangry and irritated at this.  its like whoever "designed" this burrito never actually ate authentic mexican food - which, given the context, would not surprise me in the slightest.
