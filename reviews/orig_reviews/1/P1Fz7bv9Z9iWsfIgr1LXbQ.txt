This restaurant is NOT baby friendly.  A towel lady in the women's bathroom told me I could not change my baby's dirty diaper in their restroom.  I believe her exact words were "you can't bring that thing in here".  I had no choice but to change her at our dining table.  I'm sure the next customers to sit our table would love to know that there could possibly be poop left over on the table of this dark and dingy restaurant.  The food is way over priced and nothing special.  I've been to a Sharkey's restaurant with better quality of food.  The drink prices are ridiculous, $15 for the smallest and worst tasting cadillac margarita I've ever had.  If you don't have a baby, and like over paying for drinks and crap food Javier's Las Vegas is your place.
