Came here to eat by myself while staying at the Flamingo. There were probably 4 other tables groups of people in the entire restaurant while I was there, and STILL, the service was unbearably slow. My order was wrong, and cold, and tasted worse than Taco Bell tastes on it's worst day. Consequently I didn't eat more than 3 bites of my dinner because my stomach couldn't take it. My waiter kept forgetting about me. The time between when I sat down and was finally asked my order, was about 15 minutes. The time for my food to arrive was another 20. To get my corrected order took another 10. When I asked for my check, it took another 10 minutes just to bring it over to my table. Do not eat here. Don't waste your money. Go get a taco out of a vending machine and it will taste better than this place.
