Be sure to call to make sure they are open.

This is a great concept and the I enjoyed eating there on my lunch when I worked downtown. I can not give this restaurant better than 1 start because I will not frequent the restaurant again. And, this is why;

I went there tonight, a random Tuesday. I had never been there for dinner before. We arrived around 6:30 pm. The hours posted on their website say they are open until 9 pm on week nights (as I write this their website and Yelp claim that they are open) . When we arrived we were told they were closed. Maybe hours had changed and they didn't update their website. When I asked if their hours had changed, and if they were normally closed on Tuesday, I was told that the hours depend on what is going on each night. I was told that they can't keep staff on the clock to keep the restaurant open when business is slow, just because they advertise that they are open... This is unacceptable.

I worked in the industry for several years and can't imagine running a restaurant in this fashion. I understand cutting staff, this is standard practice to cut to a skeleton staff when the night seems dead. But, to close 3 hours before you advertise because you expect a slow night. Too bad so sad for any customers that drove downtown for dinner. Unacceptable.
