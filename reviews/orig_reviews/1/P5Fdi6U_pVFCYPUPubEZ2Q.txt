This is top ten worst Mexican food I ever had. The food had bad flavor and a lot of it is canned. I ordered a paradise burrito enchilada style and added jalapeños and they put a very abundant amount of pickled jalapeños  inside. I definitely wouldn't come back or recommend it. The salsa was like canned tomato paste salsa.
