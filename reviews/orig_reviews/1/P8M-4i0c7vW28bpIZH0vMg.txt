I had come to this place a while back and so I referred the place to My family who had come out of town. I called in to make reservations and the girl on the phone said they didn't make reservations anymore, and than we show up to the restaurant and they tell us there was an hour and a half wait so we waited, and than after an hour and half, they tell Me it would be another hour and half, and I ask for the reason and the 4 girls that were standing in the fron just started being rude. So we left and end up going somewhere else. I would of biven this place a -5 if I could too.
