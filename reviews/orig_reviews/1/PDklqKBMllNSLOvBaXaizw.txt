Best Margarita?  Whoa this place has a reputation that it does not deserve.  

Food is ordinary and inexpensive, but the margaritas are overpriced and make no sense when the beer is so much cheaper here.  Young stuck up Millennial 20 somethings hang out here and it is almost as if this place got transplanted off Mill Ave. into Scottsdale, or maybe it's just the Scottsdale ASU kids that go here because they live close by in Scottsdale with mommy and daddy.

Can be loud, with limited seating, and parking is a pain here as well.
