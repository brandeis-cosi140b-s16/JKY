Everything is cooked from a can. When I go out to eat I expect everything to be home made. The service was terrible as well my pregnant wife choked on a piece of plastic from the canned salsa. The owner said it was a piece from the Chile but fortunately I am not stupid and I cook more home made Mexican food then tee pees. It was plastic not a stem. I do not like being lied to and will not recommend this place to others. At least they comped the meal after I had to tell them I wasn't paying for it.
