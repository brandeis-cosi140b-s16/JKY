After reading the great reviews we were expecting something, well, great...  As it turns out the food was greasy, the meat was thin and bland, and the batter-fried bacon was tough to chew and not worth swallowing.  I've had some great burgers in Phoenix (Houston's, The Grind, Roaring Fork) but this burger joint is sub par.  As for the highly rated sweet potato tots - they are bland and textureless balls of averageness.  BORING FOOD great for indigestion.  Skip this place - please!
