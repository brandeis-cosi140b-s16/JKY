The one and only star is for the bartender. Mike. He was amazing. Friendly and knowledgable. That said, I've never had mexican food I didn't like. I knew as soon as I tasted the chips and salsa- terrible - that I was in for bad food. Guacamole needed salt. Chips needed salt. Rice was the worst I've ever had. Chili Relleno was almost not edible. Service was HORRIBLE - didn't take our order until AFTER appetizers were served. It was a large party- but still. Some liked it. Said the mole was great. My husband had the salmon. It was ok. But for me- awful.
