Please close down.  Reservation at 7:30 on the patio.  Got there on time.  Finally seated at 8:00 inside.  Way too noisy for a restaurant.  Actually this is a bar trying to be a restaurant.  Manager offered complementary guacamole, which was actually added to the bill.  

We moved from inside to the patio at 8:30 and then finally served at 9:00.  2 of the 4 meals came out at the same time, then another 10 minutes later, then another 10 minutes after that.  Waitress tells the table that food comes out when the chef finishes making it.  Not necessarily at the same time.

Got out of there at 10:00.  What a disaster.  Food as okay but not great.  Kind of a gitchy idea of combining Asian and Mexican but only okay.  Service was lousy.  Really really really lousy.  No idea of how to take care of customers.  

If you like a bar setting with really huge tv's then this may be your place.

As for the food, 2 of the 4 people thought it was good. 1 was way too bland.  The dish was some sushi thing with raspberry sauce.  Nearly puked it was so bad.  The other not so good dish would have been okay had it not taken nearly 45 minutes to arrive.

The inside is nicely decorated.  But more like a pick up bar than a restaurant.  Too many plastic faces standing around waiting to be recognized.  More like L.A. than Scottsdale.  

Wait staff need to be trained.  Don't have a clue about how to treat customers.  

To top it off, woke up with a huge migraine which I never get.  I can only think they use some crap in their food like MSG or something.  

Prices too high for what it is.  So many other good places worth the money, not this place.

Please stop embarrassing Scottsdale with this attempt at fusion of Asian and Mexican.
