Been in here a couple times to day drink. Went in there last night with a couple friends around 1030, sat down at a table and apparently we were weren't good enough to be customers. No one acknowledged us/served us/or even said hi. We had to walk up to the bar which was in plain view from our table, to get menus, then waited another ten minutes. Still didn't even get a "we'll be right with you" so we left. Sent an email to their manager no reply so far, so we'll see what happens. Maybe I can call corporate about it. 
Oh and the one star is for the actual place. Cool place, nice setup, but you can see how a couple amateur employees can ruin potential business.
