You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them? This of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium.
Well The Tortilla Factory must have the same listening skills....their management never listens either.

You would think that after 111 reviews, someone over there would recognize there's a problem with the service. 
Nope.
This would lead one to conclude no-one in management knows about Yelp, or, and I suspect this is more the case, they can't read,

Prior to writing this, I read some of those 111 reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night paired-up.
Uncannily, it was true to form, explaining why this place gets two and a half stars.

Service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks.
Had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them..appx 20 minutes waiting on the free tortillas.
Hey TF, do I need to remind you of your namesake???

And the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you. (I sampled everyone's food in our party of eight) 

Old Town Tortilla Factory...you're really one sneaky bastard.
Laying in wait....for all the unsuspecting Scottsdale visitors looking for the 'Mexican Food' experience, and instead ambushing them with your bad service, high prices and tasteless garbage you call food.

But you do have some nice attributes, which is why, similar to my situation of never listening, I still have a wife.
Only I'm not sure how a fountain, large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business.
Oh well, who cares...right?
There'll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow. 

Are you related to Rustlers Roost by any chance? 
You both have so much in common.
