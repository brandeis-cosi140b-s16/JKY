I just spent 5 days at Mayo Clinic Hospital  being treated for food poisoning (E. coli and Campylobacter)  after eating here. 

I am profoundly disappointed. I thought the food tasted wonderful and the service was great  - but they cant get food safety right. do not eat here unless your next stop is the hospital.
