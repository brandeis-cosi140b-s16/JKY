Short version: It is bad. Don't go. 

Long version: I wasn't expecting a lot with a Mexican place in Pittsburgh but this was way below even this low bar I set. The chips are extra, they were mediocre at best. They were cold, thick and on the verge of stale. It took forever for my drink to come, but it was a drink at the bar so it's understandable. It was kind of hard to eat the bad chips without anything to wash them down though. 45 minutes later we got our extremely cold enchiladas. Even if they were warm the taste/seasonings were awful. I will never go back.
