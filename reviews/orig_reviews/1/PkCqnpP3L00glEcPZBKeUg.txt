New to Nevada from California, we are trying to establish new restaurant favorites.  We started with Macayo's on Charleston for Mexican food just because we were shopping in that plaza. We asked several people how it was and only one person said it was good. Highly disappointing after we tried it, and we crossed it off our list! 

I usually judge the food by two things:  The salsa, and chile verde. If these are good, the menu is good.  The salsa was crap and there was no chile verde.  They had something like it but the waitress said it's made with beef instead. What?

I agree with the other 1 star reviews.
