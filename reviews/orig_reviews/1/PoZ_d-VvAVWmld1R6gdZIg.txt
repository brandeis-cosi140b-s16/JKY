Came here for the first time. I order a combo fish taco and fries. I didn't get the fish taco or the fries. Got something else and no fries. Took them close to 30 minutes to give me the wrong order. Not coming here angain. If I could give no stars I would. Now I'm just hungry after that little bit of food I got. Not worth it.
