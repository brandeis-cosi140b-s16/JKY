After two visits - terrible.  Cochinita Pibil tacos dry and tasteless.  And with French fries!  Guacamole should be advertised as chopped (at least as well as you can with a spoon by a server who told us it was a pain to do guacamole tableside when it was busy!) avocado not guacamole.  Service seemed just plain uninterested.  Prices not justified at all for what you are going to experience.
