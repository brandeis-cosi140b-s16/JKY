Well... The only joy here was when I was riding home putting this place in my rear view mirror.  Truly a letdown... the place was busy (it does have a great atmosphere).  My wife and I were excited to try the food out.  Started with Mexican street corn... unseasoned and out of season corn.  My wife and I each tried 3 different tacos (6 total).  There was not 1 out of the 6 that I would ever want to order again.  Two main themes... under seasoned or strange flavors and little hard burnt bits in almost everything.  The only thing that I thought was passable was the chips and salsa.  Although, after reading other reviews, the question has to be asked... what does this place have against seasoning their food?  And, who are these people who are recommending this place as having great food.  Again it it's a shame that with a great location presentation and atmosphere they could not produce a quality dish.
