Terrible service.  Insane prices.  I went here with some friends to watch a UFC event.  Tickets to get upstairs were $25 per person.  Promoters outside had given us vouchers to buy one drink and get one free.  When we sat down, our server told us that the vouchers weren't valid upstairs.  Why the hell not?  We have already paid $25 per person to get up there! We order some food - chicken quesadillas for $17!  I was expecting a platter for that price but no, just four regular quesadillas.  Ripoff!  Server was absent for very long periods at a time so we ended up going downstairs to get drinks.  I used my voucher.  We get back upstairs to our table and the server yells at us for going downstairs to use the vouchers!  So disrespectful and rude.  I will never come back here.  There are too many other places to watch a televised event in Vegas that are actually worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.
