We had localdines deal we used to check it out for the first time.  Well, be careful when going to a place that automatically charges a gratuity.  Typically this means the service will be sub-par at best.  Bingo!  It took forever to get our first drinks. So long we had time to read through the whole menu.  He did seem nice enough, but just mosied around the place.  It really wasn't terribly busy.  Ordered the hamberguesa and the grilled fish tacos.  The fish tacos were good, but the hamberguesa will leave you feeling the results later...ah!  Anyway, it took so long to get a second round of drinks one of us went to the bar to cancel order and ask for the check.  We were already done eating by then.  He did ask if everything was okay, so nice attempt, but we just wanted to leave after seeing the bill included the tip.  It does not create incentive for giving exceptional service.  This town is tough for restaurants!
