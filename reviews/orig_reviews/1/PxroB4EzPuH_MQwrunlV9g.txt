This restaurant is getting worst everyday.  Prepare to dumb down significantly when you order.  What do I mean?  They ask for my order and I said, I would like a grill beef salad.  They told me, no such thing.  They do however have grill steak?  Huh? Isn't that the same thing?  Also be prepare to give your order to the same person over the glass 3 times or more.  They can't seem to remember your order for more than 1 second.  And don't even think of getting a friendly greeting...good food by horrible everything else.  Do not recommend at all.
