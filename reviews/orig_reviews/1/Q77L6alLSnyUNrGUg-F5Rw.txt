Holy shit, we just gave this place another chance and man, what a disappointment. 

When we arrived 80% of the restaurant was full. We were seated quickly by an efficient hostess. 
After 10 minutes we received water. 
10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders. 
Then it was another 15 before we received the drinks!
Then another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out. 
One of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made. 
A shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp.
A chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos. 
Another beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating. 
So what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated.
