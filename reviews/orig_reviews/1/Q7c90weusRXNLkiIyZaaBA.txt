Please please please put as much effort into the food as the decor. Place looks great. Tequila shrimp salad was 7 or 8 tough (must have been frozen) shrimp on a chopped head of iceberg. No flavor but the sugar in the dressing. It was horrible.  Margarita was like a grocery pre-mix. Protein burrito bowl was as one-note as the salad. Even the salsa and beans needed salt.
