Servers had poor manners when it comes to discussing internal business in front of the customers i.e. I don't want to hear how many tables they each have. The chowder was very good but the portion size of the entrees were so small I thought I must have ordered off the kids menu. The 2 pieces of beer battered cod were slightly bigger than the sad frozen refried French fries. For $8.not worth it. First and last visit.
