I was very disappointed overall with this dining experience and would never return again. The restaurant was half empty but yet, there was a thirty minute wait for a table around 2pm. The hostess had a snarky attitude and sneered at me when I asked if my table was ready, as I was looking at a fully, set table right in front of me, as she sneered at me again and said I will seat you when your table is ready. I have to say, that a power hungry, teenager with bad attitudes should not hold the power to seat paying customers. The barmaid was just as snarky and rushed us as we ordered, and then got our order wrong. When we asked her to correct the order, we got nothing but attitude. Also, I prefer not to be served by restaurant workers with sleeve tattoos--just a personal preference of mine. As for the food, I ordered a chicken burrito for $11 and I didn't recognize the meat insider, it may have been pork, or poorly flavored dark meet, chicken. Also, the server looked at us as if we had three heads when we asked for chips and salsa, as offered by every other Mexican Restaurant in the world! They don't offer chips and salsa, but force $12 appetizers on starving customers that just waited over 30 minutes in the 85 degree heat!
