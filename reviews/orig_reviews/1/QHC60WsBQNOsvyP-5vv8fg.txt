oookay! Soooo maybe I jus got the wrong thing but idk. I wasn't to hungry but I knew i'd have to eat because me and the girls were going out and gonna be drinkin up a storm that night. I read all the reviews of Isla and wanted to def give it a try. 

The place was very nice. However, the food...*sigh*..damnit.

Me and 2 other girls ordered quesdillas and my other girl ordered tacos. So when you think of quesdillas you think of..QUESDILLAS. I don't want the fux we had! They were weird looking and wasn't that good! I can't really explain it, i wish i woulda taken a picture. it kind reminded me of a hot pocket with supposely chicken inside. I didn't taste ne chicken and it had this sauce on top of it that tasted funny. I was VERY disappointed! My friend who had the tacos said they were bland and she wasn't impressed either! 

I was so sad because all I wnted was like a regular ass quesdilla to hold me over for the night. Maybe if I woulda gotten one of the dinners of the enchildas or something I'd be happier. And there was NO tequila godness!

def will not come back here! Okay..maybe I will if IM hella hungry and stayin in TI (which I probably will be cuz i love this hotel) but ill be sure to get a dinner instead. 

Oh and the chips and salsa and guac was yummy!
