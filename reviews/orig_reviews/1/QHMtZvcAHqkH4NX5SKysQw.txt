Worst service ever. My flight was delayed so I thought I'd stop by Blanco (it was close to my gate) for a bite to eat. I was seated right away but then waited 10 minutes before I could get the attention of a server. It seems that the server in my section selfishly decided to take an impromptu/unscheduled break and 'no one' was assigned to my table. While I waited (along with other customers who had not been served), 4 staff members (yes 4!) ignored attempts to gain their attention and stood at the host stand yukking it up and avoiding eye contact. Not impressed, if it hadn't been for Anda taking the initiative and stepping up I would have left. I will never come back...no matter how long I'm delayed in Phx
