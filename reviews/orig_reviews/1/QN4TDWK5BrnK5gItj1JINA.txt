Ugh. WHY chipotle? 

The service here is slow as all hell, even if there is nobody in line. My food has been cold 50% of the time. The other 50% they've run out of something. Tonight they ran out of chips. How??? The employees always act like I'm putting them out by giving them my business. When I have time I drive 20 minutes out of the way to the chipotle on scottsdale rd. in order to avoid this sad restaurant. 

One of my absolute biggest pet peeves about yelp is when businesses don't use this technology to their advantage. Please Chipotle on Thomas, your customers are BEGGING you to make changes here. Why are you ignoring the hundreds of complaints?
