Wow! Ate here about 2 years ago and decided to give another try.  I shouldn't have!  Not much New Mexican about this place, other than the titles on the menu items.  My first instinct should have sent me away when I saw there signs in the window misspelling "chile", when referring to NM chile, it is spelled "chile", Texas style and others is "chili".  The chile is no different than any other run of the mill "Mexican" restaurant around town. Salsa is very "Mexican".  It seems as the chile they are using doesn't come from NM. I think a ride to Santa Fe for the owners to try the NM flavors and learn the style would do them well.  Green onions, machaca and carne asada are not scene on NM food menus. Never again for me.
