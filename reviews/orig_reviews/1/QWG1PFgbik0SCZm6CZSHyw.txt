I just don't get it. I had the pastor taco and it was the worst taco I've ever had. I've had street tacos much better (and cheaper) than this. The quacamole was okay  but I can make the same thing at home. The chili releno was ok, nothing special. If it just tasted half as decent as the pictures, it might be ok. Again, I don't see the 'draw' here.????
