Chaotic Friday night crowd. Literally, I had to elbow myself through the crowd to get to the order window only to find out that the meat I wanted was served at another window. Whaaaaattt!!! Where are the signs and the orderly queues? The atmosphere was obviously too authentic for this gringo: I ended up leaving since having to wait in the correct queue for another 10 minutes was too much for my starving family.
