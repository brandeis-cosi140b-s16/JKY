Christmas, 2011. More folks working then people eating. Four in our party and a Grandchild. $15.00 burrito. Rice and beans with beef. No carne asada in this burrito. F**k me.Better food at Taco bell.The bill was $81.00. Don`t mind paying if it was worth it. It was a SH*t meal. Had to wait for ice tea and wait for the check.How can a place like this stay in busines. The food was not even MEXICAN like.Bad part of this is , i always want to eat there. What a waste. They only got a star becaose of being open on Christmas. F**k me.Thanks.
