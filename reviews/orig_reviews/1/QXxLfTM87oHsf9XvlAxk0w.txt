I have never been to a restaurant that blank out discriminates! We were seated outside and our server refused to get us drinks because he told my brother he had "droopy eyes". My brother had a serious eye condition and was shocked by the servers comments. We asked for a manager and didn't get any support. With that said, we left the restaurant and no longer cared to eat there. It is wrong to call customer names. I will take this up with my lawyer and ensure they are contacted. It's unfortunate.
