Came here for the first time about a week ago for a friend's birthday. Wanted to grab some drinks for her special occasion. Walked in and the place was completely empty. Sat down at the bar and ordered a round of overpriced tequila shots. The bartender checked our IDs. I didn't have my drivers license because I had left it at my apartment complex office, but I did have my passport. Showed it to her, she told me it was expired. Confused, I looked at it and she pointed to a date that read the year 2010. Annoyed, we left. After we left, I looked over my passport, confused as to why I hadn't come across this problem before (especially since I had recently used my passport to go to mexico). SHE HAD READ THE ISSUE DATE.. NOT THE EXPIRATION DATE. It was good till 2020. You would think a bartender would know how to check an ID.. Big bummer because the place was dead and we ended up spending about $350 at the bar we went to next!
