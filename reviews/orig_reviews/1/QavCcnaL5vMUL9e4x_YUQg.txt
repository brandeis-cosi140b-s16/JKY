Have been going to this location for awhile and has gone down hill! Poor service actually Rude. Staff sick coughing not covering their mouth or washing hands,putting on fresh gloves afterwards. Got mad at me for asking them to remake my order. How about when I say hi say hi back. Won't return to this location even though it's close.
