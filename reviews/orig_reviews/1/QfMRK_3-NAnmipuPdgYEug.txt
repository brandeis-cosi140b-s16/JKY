The food here used to be so good. Unfortunately, the food had suffered over the past few year and is saltier than a salt lick. The food has zero Mexican sophistication and has lost its luster. The margaritas are terrible which is sad because they used to be really good. Now they are WAY too acidic and taste terrible. Owners really need to change it up!
