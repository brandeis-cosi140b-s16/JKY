Just moved to the area from out of state. Ate here once and not only was my family disappointed with our meals but there was a hair in the basket of chips that looked to be pubic hair! My husband took the basket to the counter and quietly showed the owner not wanting to make a scene. All that the owner did was closely examine the hair and turn his back not saying one word! Not even an apology! Never again will we eat there.
