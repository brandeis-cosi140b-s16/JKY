Food was OK, but service hella sucked, all due to our waiter Jeffrey Hoth. If you ever go here, stay away from that fat, bald, lazy waste of air. I mean, 30 minutes to get a fucking Coke? Are you serious? And then another 30 minutes for our food. Then the guy had the nerve to hover around us as we ate so that he could get paid, as he was gonna go on break. Grr. Yuck. Bye.
