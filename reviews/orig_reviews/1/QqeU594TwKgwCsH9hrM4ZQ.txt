I really wanted to love this place, and I didn't ; not even a little. The hurried and unprepared staff made the food just taste so-so. The place is beautiful and looks like it comes with lots of experience and knowledge of the food, but that's not the feeling my husband or I came away with on our lunch date this past week. 
The place looks beautiful and in a great location, but feels like a fast food joint. Next time, let me order at the window, give me a number and I can pick up my food and drink a lot faster. Heck, serve up the tapas in wax paper and save some dishes if you are trying to be green. Thanks, but not thanks.
