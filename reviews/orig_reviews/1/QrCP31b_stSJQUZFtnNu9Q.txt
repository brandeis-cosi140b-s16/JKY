If you want to spend 45 minutes waiting on a bowl of mediocre tortilla soup, come here. The 2 waitresses and 3 runners do a great job at killing your time. 

Pretty much the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  I wasn't expecting much from an airport dining establishment but this definitely hit well below my expectations. All I wanted was a bowl of soup!

We sat down at about 7:30 am waiting for our layover to NOLA. A waitress acknowledged us and said she'll be with us in a moment. 10 minutes later and we still haven't put in our order. Two other tables directly to our left were seated after us and a different waitress took both orders. I asked if I could place my order and she rudely told me to wait my turn for the other waitress. 

I ordered my soup. Pretty mediocre. I could do without the sour taste and the pickled red onions.

Check was dropped off as i was finishing up what I could of the soup. Boyfriend put his card down, and the waiting game started again. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so we asked Miss Unfriendly from before if she could run the card. She pointed at the bar at our waitress who was running drinks and said "you have to wait for her." So we waited another 5 minutes before we threw down exact change in cash and left as quickly as possible, though our waitress did make it in time to come over to our table and grab the check as we left this hell hole at 8:15.
