After 3 days of raging in Vegas, I have not felt more like throwing up than right now after eating their "chicken nachos" - a sad compilation of frozen chicken strips, prepackaged chips, and pickled onions (cuz that's a normal thing to have on nachos)...
And the worst part is we actually waited over a half an hour to get them....service sucked and you could tell everyone here hated their jobs...and hated that you were eating there because it keeps a sorry establishment like this in business...
If you're getting drinks then sure this place is fine (always like a place with Dos Equis Amber Ale on tap!) but if you're eating...do yourself a BIG favor and just go to another place in the airport...wish we would've read the yelp reviews before we ate here (all the 1-star ones are totally on point) Cheers!
