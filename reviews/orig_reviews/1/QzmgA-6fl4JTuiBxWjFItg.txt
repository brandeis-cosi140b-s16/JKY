I actually still have a bad taste in my mouth. Ugh... There was definitely no quality control. My husband and I split an appetizer plate. The tamale and taquitos were average, but the empenada had a funky taste to it. My husband had the Baja ceviche as his main course, it was a good ceviche. My dish was the Jumbo Shrimp. The shrimp were fine, nothing special, but the rice and veg served with it were so salty, it was inedible. It was this that caused the before mentioned bad taste.  We finished by splitting the Pastel Rufina. Soggy pastry, way too thick cream and not much taste except the chocolate chips. 

I really wanted to like this place, I like the idea of sustainability. I like the Two Hot Tamales. I will say our service was great, but I go out for a great meal, great service is a bonus. 

Sigh, I hoped for much more.
