I can't remember the last time I went to a worst restaurant! And I eat out daily. There were 5 of us in our party. The nachos were so bad looking nobody dared to try them and we told the waitress to take them back. Another item that someone ordered was also untouchable. It too was sent back. I'm sorry but I don't have the details on that. But I personally tried the gorditas - blech! The taste was very unremarkable and not what I was expecting at all. Then I had the chicken fajitas. The chicken was burnt, not charred or flavored with anything. All I could taste was burnt carbon going down my throat. Then they cranked up some dj infused rap music at around 9pm where you couldn't talk to anyone at the table. Hey, this is supposed to be a mexican restaurant. What's with the rap? A complete disaster! Ruined the evening.
