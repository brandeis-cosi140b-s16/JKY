This was the most bland,  tasteless,  "way over priced for what you get" Mexican food I've had in recent memory.  My girl was in the mood for Mexican and while i had my reservations about this place, i agreed to give it a try.  I had the Oaxacan  chopped salad and while it's presented nicely, the visual appeal was as good as it got.  I'm  still trying to figure out how could so many ingredients lack any taste.  Even the grilled chicken was bland.  Not even the slightest hint of salt or pepper. The "enchiladas"were basically their tacos drenched with red sauce. The drinks were good so if what i had primarily come for would have been a few rounds while watching people take turns on the mechanical bull,  i would likely have rated this place higher. But i didn't so i won't.  Drink here but eat elsewhere
