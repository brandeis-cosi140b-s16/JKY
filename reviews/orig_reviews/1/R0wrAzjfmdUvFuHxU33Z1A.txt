The disappointment in this place!!

Service: -2 STARS from when we came in till we left. No one greeted us and when someone finally did I felt like a burden to have the hostess seat us.

Took 7 mins for anyone to approach us. By the time we got our water it was over 10 mins of being in the place. I order a sangria and she asked "White or Red?"

FOOD: 2 Stars the chips are overly salted. Had a bug near my sons plate then went to dip my fries in the Ketchup only to find a bug in my ketchup. 

Overall: 1 Star they took care of my burger for experiencing a bug on my food. On Mondays kids eat free! Oh and Wine about Monday's BOGO on the wine expect when I asked about my Sangria I was told for wine only. In most places Sangria is considered wine but I guess not here even when she asked me when placing the order "White or Red?" 

When I told the manager about the bugs she said oh no they come in every week to spray. Although they took care of my entree the lack sympathy was so fake I just wanted to get out of there. 

NEVER AGAIN!
