I am sorry. Nobody wanted this place to be the bomb more than me.  We watch Food Network, love the ladies who created the restaurant and have even tried to recreate the 'Ciudad Chicken' dish after watching "Best Thing I Ever Made". 

We ordered the appetizer "Queso Fundido" and at 1st blush it looked delish. Not so.  The homemade chorizo was dry and tasteless and the Manchego cheese mixture needed salt or acid or something.  It certainly did not taste of Modelo beer which was much described by the server.  We ate the appetizer with little fanfare...

For dinner we both ordered tacos. One order of carne asada and one order of fish tacos. 

1) Steak - tasteless and chewy and ultimate sent back to the kitchen. 

2) Fish -  larger chunk of avocado on each taco than actual fish. We didn't send these back as we chalked it up to a preference thing, but in all honesty these tacos were completely off putting.  

3) Ciudad Chicken (replacement for the sent-back steak tacos at substantially higher cost) - chicken breast completely dry and no sign of the pickled
tomatoes that were both on the menu and were also the highlight of our home version of this dish.  Completely underwhelmed by this replacement dish. 

In the end the only people who lost out were the server, Matthew, who was wonderful and tried to make things right. The food just was not good and he price was too high and no compensation or acknowledgment of the fact that we really didn't eat anything. 

This experience COMPLETELY disappointed and nearly ruined our final night in Las Vegas.  Thank goodness for the show "Absinthe," also at Caesar's, which lifted our spirits!
