Horrible service. I went for dinner and barely even made it to a chair. There was no line at all, but it still took the hostess a minute to get to us because she had some very important business to attend to on her cell phone. When she was done texting, or snap chatting or whatever, we requested a patio seat because the weather was nice. She pointed backward and let us know the "back bar" was open. And that's how we were seated. So my boyfriend and I wandered back, while the hostess did not budge. We arrived at what we assume was the "back bar" and sat for a couple minutes at a table near the bar, in plain view of a bartender. A server never appeared and the hostess left a bad taste in our mouths so we left and went to z tejas around the corner, where we were actually seated and waited on. Imagine that.
