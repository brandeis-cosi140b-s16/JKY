My girlfriend and I were here for the first time last night.  We are both over 45 so we are pretty experienced diners, and not some young pups. We bought a condo just a few blocks away about 6 months ago, and have had a blast trying new restaurants in the Old Town area. 

This place had a great atmosphere and we were very happy to be seated near the water fountains. Things went downhill from there. To be blunt, our waiter was just a flat out a jerk. When my girlfriend asked if there was anything on the menu that wasn't spicy, his response was rude and he acted like how dare she ask a question like that!  He said that she might as well just have a cheeseburger.  We were in a Mexican restaurant and my girlfriend was told she shouldn't have Mexican food!

We asked for chips and salsa (not free like in EVERY other Mexican restaurant BTW). When they were delivered the guy said something like "this sauce is hot, and this sauce is hotter".  When the waiter came back, my girlfriend asked him if they had a cheese sauce for the chips that wasn't spicy and he acted all jerky again and said "no". 

At that point we left and will not be back. We went a few blocks into Old Town and ate at Los Olivios and had a ball. Not as fancy, but "normal" Mexican food with lots of non-spicy options. Great waiter too!!!
