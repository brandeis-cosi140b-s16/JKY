Too bad I have to give them one star and cannot give them zero stars. I don't know how their food and drinks are, but their service is HORRIBLE. Eight empty patio tables on a weekday afternoon, and the hostess told me there is a 15 minute wait - would I like to put my name down on the list. The inside of the restaurant was not full - it was half empty. This is the most ridiculous restaurant I have ever encountered. If I owned the place I would fire every single person working there today for being complacent to this inane seating policy. Serve the customers you have - not the ones you need to text to remind them of their reservation.
