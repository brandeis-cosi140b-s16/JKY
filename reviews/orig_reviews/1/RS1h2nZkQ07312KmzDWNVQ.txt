I'm from LA and have Hispanic family, so I love me some Mexican food. I was craving some bomb tacos and wanted to give this place a try. I came here with some friends and let me tell you. Pulling up to this joint was already a red flag, the restaurant was inside of a building that was previously a gas station. The parking sucked, cause they still had empty gas pumps in the middle of their "parking lot" waste of space. 
Upon walking in the place looked really dirty and unsanitary. Tacos are tacos so despite all of that they still gonna be bomb right? WRONG. These tacos were so nasty, the meat was cold by the time I got to sit down, when i ask for salsa they put a huge splat of guac on the entire tortilla and the entire meal was so bland. No flavor at all. I forced myself to scarf them down cause I was hungry. But 20min After I wasn't feeling too hot. I ended the rest of the night throwing up dry ass asada and tortillas. I would NEVER go back.
