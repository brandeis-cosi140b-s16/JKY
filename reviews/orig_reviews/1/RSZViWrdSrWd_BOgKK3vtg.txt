We had dinner here last night, food was average but the service was the Worst we have ever received. We waited 21 minutes when after we were seated and then went looking for a waiter, they said he would be right there, it was another 10 minutes before he came.  had to ask for chips three times and never did receive a refill on our water or the offer of another drink or anything.  Will not return....it was horrible and still cost more than $35.00.
