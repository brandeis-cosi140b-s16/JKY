So disappointed ! We read the reviews and headed over, thinking about Lobster Tacos.

Parking was a nightmare, poor signage for those of us from out of town. Strolled the grounds looking for the entrance to the resturant, beautiful grounds with all the Christmas lights maned carousel.  The aromas in the air as we entered we so inviting. 

The hostesses were very friendly, but seem surprised we'd be there to dine when we weren't staying there.  Sat us right away, in the corner by the kitchen. The hostess was the only staff we ever spoke with.  Water was poured then we sat and sat and sat and sat.  After 10 minutes (maybe a little more) we hadn't received a "Hello" "I will be right with you" or any kind of greeting so we left.

 Perhaps if we'd been a guest at the Fairmont we would have had better service and we would of had the opportunity to experience the Lobster Tacos others raved were so good.
