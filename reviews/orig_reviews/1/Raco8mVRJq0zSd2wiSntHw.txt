Not far from our house so we decided to try, never again!  Ordered a mojito, which is displayed prominently on the menu.  Tasted like battery acid.  Told the server who said yea we don't have mint or lime so they don't taste great!  What?  then ordered a margarita, which was so bad I didn't even drink it.  I don't think they have a bar or a bartender think they just make stuff up where they get sodas and such.  Salsa was really bland.  chips were ok, thick which was good.  Ordered an a la carte burrito, a la carte tostada and one cheese enchilada.  Food was really bland and honestly taco bell has more taste than this place.  I guess being from L.A. I am kind of a mexican food snob but this place was horrible.  Bill was $30 way overpriced and food was disgusting.  Would never let anyone I know eat there.
