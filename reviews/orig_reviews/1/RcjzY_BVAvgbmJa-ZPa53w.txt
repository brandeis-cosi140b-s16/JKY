Went here prior to the Cards v Broncos game w/ my daughter.  She has not eaten at Bitzee Mama's, so this is her least favorite Mexican restaurant in Glendale.  Bitzee's is still mine.

First, I've been programmed to the free chips n salsa basket at most Mexican restaurants.  Odd that there was none here and it was not listed as a menu item either.  Options appear to be nachos or a layered dip. 

We ordered the shrimp ceviche which is marinated in lemon, garlic, the chef's spices...it was very bland.  I think the Chef left out the spices.  It wasn't the only thing he left out.  He left stuff out of my burro.  We didn't finish the ceviche.

The daughter got the tortilla soup and did not like it at all. She wanted to give them her grandmother's phone number to call for a good recipe.  I tried it and it was okay.  Tested kinda like watered down queso.  We didn't finish the soup.

My burro was missing its key ingredients of sour cream, guacamole and oaxaca cheese and the drizzled sour cream on top.  That should have been the first clue to the waitress that something was up w/ the dish.  Plus it wasn't chimi-style like I ordered.  Rather than send it back to have it fried, I decided only to say something when the bill came if I was charged for chimi-style...I was not.  W/o the cheese, I had more of diet burro, so I guess it was okay cause I saved calories for later.   I saved more calories eating only 1/2 the burro.  

Haven't tried the Irish pub yet that went in where the Fox Sports Grill is.  Places to go prior to games remain in preference order:  The Yardhouse, Saddle Ranch, Native New Yorker.

The place was not busy...it picked up the closer it got to noon.  This is 3 hours before kick-off.  I don't think diners are lining up to get inside here like they do The Yardhouse.

UPDATE:  5/14/2011
Sometimes I like to look back on my Methinks not reviews to see what other diners are saying after my visit.  I'm amazed Jack's is still opened.  To be in the Westgate, which sees probably meh traffic when there is no event, and then not be busy when an event takes place, how do you stay open??   Based on my experience at Bitzee's Mama and other diner reviews on that restaurant, I can only surmise that the offerings for Mexican in Glendale are so slim that its citizens are very forgiving.
