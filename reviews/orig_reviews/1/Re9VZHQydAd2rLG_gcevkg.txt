I am giving this one star because I can't give a lower rating.   I was there for over am hour trying to order a pork burrito. After 35 minutes in line,  when I got up to where I could order,  they were out of pork so I elected to wait the extra 20 minutes they said it would be.  I sat at a table and took a 20 minute nap. Then,  as instructed,  I went to the cashier (who was NOT at all helpful) to give her my order.  She continued to check people out and after almost 15 minutes,  took my order.  I waited another 20 minutes before other employees noticed and asked what was going on.   Three different people ended checking on my order before I got it.  They did give it to me free but that definitely didn't make up for it.  I spoke to another woman who was also waiting and discovered she had ordered ON-LINE (it is supposed to be VERY fast if you do that.   She waited just over 45 minutes for her order.   I will NEVER go there again,  nor well I patronize any of their affiliates.  I hope anyone who reads this also doesn't go there.   They obviously don't care about their patrons. Update:  When I got home and opened the box,  it was missing lettuce,  pico , napkins, and tableware.  Really ?????
