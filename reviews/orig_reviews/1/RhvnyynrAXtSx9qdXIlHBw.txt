This place sucked. I hate giving bad reviews, and more often than not if I don't want to leave a nice review I leave nothing at all unless I'm pissed off, but this place just was really bad. Unlike a couple of other reviewers' experience, our service wasn't bad at all, in fact that was probably the best part of the whole experience. 

The real problems: 1. No drink less than $11...and then the drinks weren't even good. They were small, weak and not even delicious. I had a "spicy mango margarita" and it tasted like a regular, non-spicy strawberry margarita (and looked like one too). Not a hint of spice and if that was mango, then I don't know what strawberry is. I was sooo looking forward to that drink too but it wasn't very good, and so expensive I wasn't about to order a different one to see if it was better. Plus it annoys me (especially when you're paying that kind of price) when restaurants/bars serve you drinks in a plastic cup. Really??? I'm paying $11 a drink and you can't even give me a glass?? (We weren't even sitting outside. No excuses.)
2. The food sucked...not good. Bland, greasy, dry chicken, no real flavor.

We knew when we went there not to have high expectations (especially for the food) but it was worse than expected, and the drinks weren't good. Our stomachs hurt afterward. Never ever going back.
