Seriously. Overpriced mediocre food. The yucatan pork was billed as a spice infused pork cooked 8 hours in a banana leaf. One thing was left out-- it also was basted in salt. Wow. Two flavors stood out: cinnamon and salt. The chicken enchiladas were wrapped in a thick tortilla almost impenetrable. The soup was interesting: a stewed tomato taste with subtle heat.  Chips and salsa were fine.  Was expecting more from this place. Too bad. Nice people work there and they do their best to sell the food as upbeat as possible. The food lets them down.
