My wife went for pickup. COmpletely disorganized. Called in or at 545pm. Said 20 minutes. She got there at 6pm and waited until 635pm. No comp or anything from manager and restaurant was bustling but not busy.

Bartender apologized several times & was friendly.

Food was bad. Did not resemble any of the great food we've had at other PHX & NYC locations. THe beans were so salty they were nearly inedible and the enchiladas were not anything like the ones we've had prior. The chicken's consistency did not inspire much confidence.

Either they are still getting organized (3 months later) or something is very wrong at this location. Maybe it's just the Ahwatukee restaurant curse. Go across the street to Secreto instead.
