The poor reviews for this Arriba's are correct. I wish I would have read them before I wasted my time and money eating there. There was a large spill left under our table. It looked like a spilled drink because of the lemon in the middle of the puddle. The table was short of napkins and silverware. We had to beg for more. The service is horrific !  The food is terrible and overpriced. The rice had so much pepper on it that none of us could eat it. The cheese enchiladas were cold and tasteless. The beer was not cold. Don't waste your time and money. You'd get a better mexican meal at Taco Bell or Del Taco.
