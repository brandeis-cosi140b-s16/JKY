I used to eat at this restaurant all the time. The food went from decent New Mexican style cuisine to ill-cooked meals that taste like salty cheese. I stopped going months ago and won't return. Not sure what happened and it's a shame!
I agree with the other posters that say the service has gone downhill too. I once asked 3 times for a drink refill and never got it till after I paid.
