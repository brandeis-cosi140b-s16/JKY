By far the rudest waitress I have ever had in my life!  Up until today I was a fan of Gallo Blanco.  I was excited to order the steak and eggs and when the obnoxiously rude waitress asked how I would like my eggs prepared I ordered them basted.  She looked me in the eye and said "NO"!   I couldn't believe how quickly and rudely she responded.  I said what??  She said "NO!"  I said why??  She said we don't have the stuff to make it that way.  So I said okay I guess I will take them over easy.  Im guessing that she didn't know what basted means.  Instead of saying Im sorry, we aren't able to make them that way she just said NO!  I asked to speak with the manager and he said it was no problem to make the eggs basted.  At that point I could care less about the eggs, I was appalled at the service.  There are too many great restaurants in that area to overlook the rude service.  I won't be back.  :(
