so this place is the hot spot huh I think not, service was garbage not even busy had extra servers yet it took 29 minutes to order by the time we ordered people behind us who sat after us were already eating. we went on taco Tuesday we were going to go to joyride but figured hey let's try this place well the tacos are minature which I can deal with but at 2.50 way to tiny joyride is $2 and twice size   and was brought wrong taco after our prolonged wait.
we will not be back
