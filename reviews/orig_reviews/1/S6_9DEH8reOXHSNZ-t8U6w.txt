It takes a lot for me to become impatient with people but today put me over the top. My coworkers put in an email order at 10:45 to be picked up at 12:15. I thought it would be kind to put up their food seeing how I was going to chipotle already and they are right next to each other. I arrive at cafe rio at 12:15 and tell the cashier the names I am picking up for. She then relays those names to the cooks. That was the first red flag. The food should have already been made seeing how my PICK UP time was 12:15. I'm waiting for my coworkers food and it seems like they aren't starting it. The cashier then relays the names two more times to the cooks. Three people behind me are served before my food is even ready. 45 minutes later there it is... My coworkers food. This was easily the worse service I have ever had from a fast food establishment. Never again will I eat at cafe rio let alone do pick up from them. It's forever chipotle gang or die!!
