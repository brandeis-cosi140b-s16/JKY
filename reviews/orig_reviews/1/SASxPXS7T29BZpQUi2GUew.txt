They had the worst customer service ever. We couldn't hear them a few times and asked them questions and answered us back in the rudest way possible and even rolled their eyes at us. The lady at the cashier was nice, but everyone else seriously needs to take classes on manners and customer service. I don't even care how the food is, if your service SUCKS, I will never come back. Will be letting the manager know as well.
