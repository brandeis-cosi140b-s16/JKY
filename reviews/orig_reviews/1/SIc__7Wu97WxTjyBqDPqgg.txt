The food here is amazing. Service tho... Really need to be improve. The guy on charge to make the Adobada fries was rude, I had an special request and he called me abnormal WTF?? After all he did not make my special order the way I asked for and told me that I will have to get in line to get another fries. 

Great food. 
Horrible service -0
