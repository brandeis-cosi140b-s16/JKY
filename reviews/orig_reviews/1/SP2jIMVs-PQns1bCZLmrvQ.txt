Deciding where to go with 16 girls is a challenge in it's own.  After deciding on a mexican restaurant that claims it is "good for groups" and being a mexican restaurant where it's already loud between the sizzling fajitas, clanking margarita glasses and multiple Happy Birthday celebrations, we mistakenly chose Popo's.  Our waitress was very nice and very good at her job.  The chips and salsa were great, food was average but you'd think a table of 16 would be a good sign for a good nights profit.  Apparently the manager thought differently.  After being told that we were being too loud and in an extremely unprofessional way, we took our party of 16 people next door to buy their drinks and eat their food.  Won't return.  Should change their settings to "not good for large groups."
