Went here for lunch because I was going to a conference next door at Paris. I guess since we were a group of ten and the server knew he'd be getting automatic gratuity he figured he didn't need to put forth much effort. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order, then another 10 to take our food order...about 30 to get the food-you see where I am going with this? All of the waitstaff seemed to not want to make eye contact with the patrons for fear they may get asked for anything. The server only checked on us once about 15 minutes after the food had come out which to me was unacceptable, especially because they weren't busy. It took another 20 minutes to get the check. The food was terrible. I got beef tacos and the beef tasted like how dog food smells if that makes sense. An overall horrible lunch with horrible service and horrible food. Plus overpriced. Avoid this place!
