I would put zero star if I could TERRIBLE! Steak tacos had no flavor when I asked for hot salsa the waiter/bartender brought me cholula seriously at a Mexican restaurant you would expect HOT SAUCE! Corona was warm and server brought out warm mug!~ oh and by the way lunch for two w 2 beers was $45.00!
