I hate when restaurants claim to specialize in certain foods only to be extremely disappointed with one of the plainest tasting noodle soups I've ever had.  With the name, China Poblano, you would think their Hong Kong inspired wonton soup would taste halfway decent. I had the swallow a cloud soup and the noodles were so dull that I just left them in the flavorless water-like "broth". The wontons were the only edible item in this soup. Even the Bok Choy was flavorless. This bowl of noodle water costed $17 too! 

The service wasn't that great either. Not very friendly or personable. Just going through the motions. 

Avoid this place at all costs!
