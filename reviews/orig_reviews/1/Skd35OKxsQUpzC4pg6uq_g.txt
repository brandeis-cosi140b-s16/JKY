Not only was the service terrible, the food was utterly disappointing. When we entered the restaurant the hostess said no greeting and was rather stand-offish. For a restaurant that has over 100 tequilas it was disheartening when my mother's margarita arrived tasting like salty water. After looking over the limited menu, our waiter recited the specials while mispronouncing half of them and stumbling over the list. Our salads arrived on beautiful plates, but to our surprise, half, if not more of the leaves were brown and wilting. Hoping for more in our entrees, they arrived and were subpar at best. The tamales were extremely small portions for 18 dollars and drenched in barbecue sauce. My tacos were in cheap, flour tortillas you can buy a bag of for 3 dollars at Giant Eagle. After finishing our dinner, we sat with our half eaten plates in front of us for at least 20 minutes while our waiter walked by numerous times not once asking how everything was or if he could clear away our obviously finished plates. We dined outside which was a very nice setting, and when we looked inside we saw another table that had their dirty plates sitting in front of them for an extremely long time. Finally, once our waiter cleared away our plates, he brought the check placing it not in the center of our table, but directly to my father, and did not say one word. No thank you, have a good evening, etc. and to top it off stood behind my father waiting as my father looked in his wallet. Once my father placed his credit card with the bill, our waiter immediately took the bill, and again did not say anything. I could not imagine anything rudder our waiter could have done.
The best part of this restaurant is looking at it. I do not recommend.
