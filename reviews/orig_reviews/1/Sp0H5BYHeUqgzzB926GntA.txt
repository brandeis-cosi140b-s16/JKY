I'm a Vegas regular, and I usually would never visit a restaurant right on The Strip, but I gave this place a try because I read that they had some killer nachos. Big mistake.

It was packed on a Thursday afternoon, so we sat at the bar. The chicken nachos were above average, and so were the margaritas. Then we got the tab and I was reminded why I don't frequent The Strip's tourist traps. 2 pitchers of margaritas and a plate of nachos= $95. Whatever. Our bartender was cool so I tipped $20. 

Here's the kicker. I get home and check my credit card activity and they added $10 to my tip. Dicks. I'll never go back.
