Just left this restaurant after waiting over 15-20 minutes with no service or greeting from a waiter....and the place was not busy, with the wait staff standing at the bar socializing. Sealed the deal when another table sat down after U.S. and was greeted immediately  with their water and device. I notified the staff why we were leaving and we got a "sorry". Such a shame, we rarely get a date night and I was looking forward to trying the food.
