Food is great however I am disappointed with the restaurants customer service. They advertise catering services on their Facebook page so I called and asked about catering an event that I was having. Gave all the information they needed and they said they will call me back with a week for price estimates. I was thrilled that I was going to have their great tacos at my event yet they never called me back. Thanks a lot.
