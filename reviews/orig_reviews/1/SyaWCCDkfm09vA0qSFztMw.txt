I have never been to a "Mexican" restaurant as horrible as this. Good location, horrible food, and horrible prices. You shouldn't serve store bought taco shells and tortilla chips in an "authentic" Mexican restaurant. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS for the amount of food you get. Have you ever heard of someone charging $6 for a small plate of tortilla chips? Definitely not recommended.
