I've never really been impressed with chipotle to begin with but every now and then I like the convince of a quick, warm burrito. 

But this particular chipotle is the worst of the worst I've ever been to. The staff is not very friendly at all. There have been numerous times where they are "out of organic chicken" which is just plain weird. The tables are almost always dirty because they seem to be under staffed.

Yet I still continue to go only because it's close to me. But i suggest going to the one on mill ave. it's much better!
