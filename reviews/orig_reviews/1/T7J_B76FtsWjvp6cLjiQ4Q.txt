I woke up with the largest craving in the world for a green chili burrito. I went to "Los Fav's" as we tempe folk call it and conveyed my enthusiasm to the girl at the register. 

All I wanted was a green chili burrito, with chicken instead of pork. 

Instead, I was given a plain chicken burrito with flavorless mexican rice. I cannot convey the amount of disappointment I felt at that moment. In fact, I was so disappointed, that I threw away the burrito after about three bites and told my roommates that I had just experienced the worst tasting burrito that I have ever had in my life. Then, my roommate suggested dousing the burrito in hot sauce to the point where I could only taste the stinging sensation of the red sauce. I concurred, that just about anything would be better than tasting the poor excuse for food that I had been given but it was too late for that. By this time I had lost my appetite. 

I was stuck in some sort of appetite "limbo-land" where I had not eaten more than three bites of food, but yet I had no desire to eat anything more. I could not even muster myself to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to try and salvage my sunday morning.

Instead-- I decided to write this review. I wrote this review not to bash the lady at the register for messing up my order, but raise awareness and hopefully to deter others from making the same mistake that I did.

AMERICA.
