I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I'm scratching my head at how people think the chips and salsa were amazing..Tasted like they opened it from a store bought bag. Now that I think of it, all of the food tasted like they pulled it out of the freezer. Could've gone to trader joes & bought some microwave mexican food that was just as good and saved $$
