This was my first time here. I came to the indoor bar to order a drink because it was far slower than the outside bar. The bartender (short curly dark hair) did not sad hello, seemed annoyed to make my drink, did not speak or smile once. This is terrible customer service.  And even after tipping she just slowly walked away without a thank you.
