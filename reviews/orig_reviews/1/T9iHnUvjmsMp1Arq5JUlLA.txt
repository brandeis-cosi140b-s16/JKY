The hype about this place is beyond me. First off it's filthy. I pretty much lost my appetite the second I walked in but decided to brush that off and give the food a chance based on the good reviews. I ordered the Jade Red chicken which tasted like bad mall food court sweet & sour chicken. How is that their best seller?! My husband ordered the "Jerk" chicken and Pollo Diablo with fried rice, all of which was just bad. Cannot believe anyone would enjoy this food.
