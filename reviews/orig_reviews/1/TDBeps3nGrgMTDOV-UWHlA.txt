Living 2 blocks from Panchos, I was surprised to see that the new restaurant was located in Downtown Summerlin.
We decided to stop for lunch after shopping today.
Upon entering we decided to sit at the Bar as it was closest and usually we get better service sitting at the Bar. Our Bartender/server was very nice.
 I asked for menus and water.
Upon getting the menu I proceeded to check it out.  The cheapest entree for lunch was $15.00. Come on,  really  2 tacos $15.00. 2 enchiladas $15.00.
  a house green salad $7.00.  The Margaritas are made with sweet and sour.  Jesus. They don't even know how to make a real margarita  My enchiladas were so bad I only ate one. 
I give Panchos 6 months and Adios. Shame because it would be nice to have a fun, quality place close to home.
