This is our first time coming here. The service wasn't that good. Our waiter was pretty awkward and the people that brought out the food were rude. My son got his food first and finished five minutes before the rest came out. 

The food itself was very bland. We all got something different and they got the orders  wrong. The chicken was tasteless as well as the beans and rice. The pork was okay. The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. If you have a couple of margaritas it won't make a difference what the food tastes like.
