Ok, here we go again.  Really..... I don't complain all the time.... Just when i get "underwhelming" food at "overwhelming" prices.  

Checking out restaurant.com.... run across a gift certificate for this family owned mexican restaurant.  Ok, discounted food, will give it a go!

Arrived on "Family Night", Wednesday... Decent crowd, 15 min wait.  Wandered into the bar area, which was neat and hopping with patrons.  Found a corner booth and asked if we could sit.... a few minutes later, we were seated.  Immediately i asked about the restaurant.com gift certificate to make sure we can use it.  We were aware we couldn't use it on "specials" or discounted items.. so no worries.

The chips and salsa were average at best.  I believe I have had better salsa at a Chinese BBQ.  Maybe the bottled salsa that the Pace company makes fun of might have been tastier.... "this salsa is made in New York City"......"NEW YORK CITY?" ... anyway, moving on.....

My wife opted for the "fundido" chicken (around $13)...  and I,  the chicken chimichanga (around $14).  My daughters split the Shrimp Enchilada (around $15).  Just a heads up to the wait staff..... I'm not expecting Ritz Carlton service, however, splitting the entree in the kitchen would have been nice touch.  No extra work would have been needed.... just would have been appreciated.

Food arrived timely.  No issues there.  Silverware is actually a napkin and a fork.  Knives are placed on plates that "require them".

OK.... Don't know if I am wrong here.... however, every chicken dish that i have had at any mexican restaurant is white meat....not dark.  I cannot tell you the disappointment i had when i found my decently sized chimichanga was made with dark meat..... and for 14.00.

Same with the chicken fundido.  Dark meat.

I whispered to my wife..... on the scale.... you all know the scale you have with your spouse.... 1 to 10.... because you want to know their feelings for the joint......  1 being  WTF?   .... to 10... i can't wait to come back no matter the cost.......

She hints around a 3.

I just asked her.... if her meal was 1/2 price.... as on happy hour of family night... would she raise her score.....  "absolutely not".

There you have it.   

Including 18% gratuity.... our bill was 38.80..... including the 25.00 restaurant.com

38.80 for a lesson... eh, maybe not too bad.....

i wish i could have liked you valle luna.........

It's not you.... it's me.
