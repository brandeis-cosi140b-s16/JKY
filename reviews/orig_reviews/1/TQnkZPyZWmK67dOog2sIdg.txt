We were a group of seven who went here... 

We were told that there would be a table available in 15-20 minutes. When 25 minutes had passed, I asked the waiter very politely when we would expect our table and pointed out that we had been waiting for 25 minutes. She gave a very rude answer, which were something like: "I told you it would be 20 minutes and you have definitely not waited 25 minutes." After that I was baffled. Who treats their customers that way? Right after she finished the sentence another waiter comes up with menus and says that the table is available. I turn around to call my friends over. Meanwhile the first waitress is saying: "Are you coming or what!? she is waiting for you. Go go go." In a really hush and angry voice, and the other waiter were off before we had a chance to follow her. 

We were all in some sort of chock; we have never experienced anything like this before. We decided to find another place to eat breakfast after that introduction.
