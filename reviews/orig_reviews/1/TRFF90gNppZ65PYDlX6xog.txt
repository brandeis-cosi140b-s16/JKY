Nahh. This is over hyped by media! 
I am not going into too much with this place cause it's not even worth the effort. Plain and simple it sucked. I lived in Mexico for years and this is not very good and the prices suck! 
I was not impressed with anything. The famous guacamole, big whoop. So you put pomegranate seeds in it. WOW! Genius! 
I would never return. I had better...much better!
