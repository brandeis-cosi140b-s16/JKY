Very disappointed with 2 of 3 items we ordered! The third was good.
The carne asada taco was dry and very little flavor in meat.
The al pastor burrito had flavorless white beans and oddly flavored meat.
The only decent item was the buche taco. Good flavor on the meat.
The service was minimal until the cashier-- she was pleasant.
Doubt I will return.
