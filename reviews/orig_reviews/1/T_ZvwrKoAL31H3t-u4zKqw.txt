Service was terrible. Bartender walked by me 4 or 5 times before acknowledging that I was there and then offered a very half hearted apology. She also did not try to remedy the situation by trying to improve the service during the rest of the visit. I ordered my food and asked if they could change one of the TVs to the game on ESPN instead of music videos they said they would then did not. Food was average at best, unlikely that I'll be back anytime soon
