Tried this place tonight after reading the reviews. We went in very optimistic. We first tried sitting outside but their were wasps swarming in the ceiling. Food was greasy. Salsa was just okay. And, they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic Mexican. Guacamole was instant. Staff was not friendly. Will not return.
