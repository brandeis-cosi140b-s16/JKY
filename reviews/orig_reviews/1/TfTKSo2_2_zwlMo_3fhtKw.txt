I couldn't tell you what a single morsel of their food tasted like.  Went there tonight (a Saturday night) at 8pm and the place was empty, only 4 tables of people seated in the dining room and a couple of people at the bar.  Our group was seated promptly by the hostess and then we just sat.  A guy brought us water about 5 minutes after being seated and then we just continued to sit for another 10 minutes.  No one acknowledged us ever again.  The table of people sitting directly behind us had their server stop by twice as we just continued to sit there.  You'd think the server would say something and let us know that he'd be right with us...didn't happen.

I was ready to order a $22 entree and a $16 glass of wine, but apparently they didn't care.  So after 15 minutes of being completely ignored and sipping on our waters, we got up and left and had a great meal at another close by restaurant.

As we were leaving Milagro Grill, the hostess was very nice and thanked us for coming.  Hilarious...these people are clueless! With all of the options in this neighborhood you'd think they'd be on top of things.

Good luck Milagro Grill, you're gonna need it!
