So decided to give this place a try before reading and of the reviews here. Needless to say I probably would have tried anyways. 

After getting the wrong order 2 chicken burritos instead of steak, my wife ate her chicken burrito and I bit into mine hoping it was steak instead of chicken. Nope it was chicken and horribly bland chicken at that. I called and went back to get the order corrected and received my steak burrito which I was hoping was better than the chicken I had tasted. 

No dice the steak was just as bland, the pinto beans, bland, the white rice bland, and the guac bland as well. I should have known as soon as I tasted my horchata that this was not the place for me. Still have a free steak burrito but I will be leaving it there. No way am I going back I will stick with Chipolte and yes that is how I spell it and say it. Do yourself a favor bypass this place.
