Had a fish salad and they smooshed it up into a tiny container.... fish was good but the salad container was too small, they even had trouble closing the lid...

sister had Kalua tacos and the tortillas were cold even after going through the heater (???) Kalua pig was really salty even for Kalua pig

I'd rather have chipotle tbh
