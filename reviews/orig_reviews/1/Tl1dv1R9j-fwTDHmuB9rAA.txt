Simply awful. 

We tried this Chipotle-style fast food joint today for the first time and it was so bad, I feel compelled to write about it immediately.  Upon first view, everything looked so promising....a long line, the homemade tortillas, fresh looking ingredients, smiling workers....but it all fell apart once we received our orders and tried the food.

My wife had a chicken quesadilla and it was one hot mess.  Greasy, gooey, sloppy and disgusting. She took two bites, probably one bite more than the quesadilla deserved, and gave up. 

My cheese enchilada with medium spice sauce was even worse; the sauce was extremely salty and had a very unusual, awful taste that made the enchilada inedible. I had one bite and stopped eating. 

The accompanying pico de gallo and shredded lettuce with each dish was pretty good!! 

The Diet Coke and Barqs root beer were also good.  The self-serve drink station was a mess however, with piles of overflow ice and overflow soda all over the counter and floor. I always view this drink station mess, just atrocious housekeeping, which you see in a lot of fast food restaurants, as a sure sign of a poorly managed food establishment.  The Manager should be canned for allowing such a hygiene and health hazard in the restaurant. 

I am amazed that Zagat rates Rio Cafe so highly.  It's one of the worst places I've eaten in Las Vegas. 

I recommend you do not try this restaurant.
