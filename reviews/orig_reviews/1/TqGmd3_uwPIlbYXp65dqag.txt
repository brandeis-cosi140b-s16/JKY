I am changing my last review. We came in tonight was told that the system is down and they are not sitting anyone until it is up. But a party of 6 just came in after we were waiting for 30 mins. The manager went ahead and seated them. Asked hostess why they got seated and said manager said it was ok for them but not for us. Asked if we could just sit and have soda, chips and salsa. Was told no. Have never been so disrespected. They do not even deserve one star. Finally seated but they can not come back in my eyes. Chrs  our waiter was super nice. He tried so hard to try to make it up.
