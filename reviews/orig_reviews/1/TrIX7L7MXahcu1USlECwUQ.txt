Every time I  come here, there is bad service.

This afternoon, we were seated quickly, and our waitress passed us a few times before getting our drink order.

Upon ordering drinks, i ordered my daughter Mac and cheese. We ordered our lunch after she came back, and the salad, and soup that we asked for took an exceptionally long time. About 20 minutes.... we didnt even get to finish them before our large plates came out.

Also, we asked 3 seperate times for hot sauce.. Halfway  through the meal,  it arrived. 

Also, during our meal, she only brought us one "extra" glass of water. I guess we were all supposed to share this glass of water....?

But, the thing that really upset me was when we went to pay. We had seperated checks, and my friend paid with her card, and i paid with cash. Well, lets just say that when my friend got her card back, i didnt get my change.

I mean, it wasnt a large amount  (less than $5). But, the waitress just assumed that the change was her tip. not a good business practice...............
