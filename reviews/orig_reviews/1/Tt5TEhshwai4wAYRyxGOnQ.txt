nasty, overpriced, bland food. dont understand how people make lines and wait for this place. they obviously don't know any better. i can think of at least 20 places around it that are 100% better. they only reason it is so popular is because it is owned by white people. dont waste your time people...stop being so ignorant and racist and try other restaurants who aren't owned and operated by caucasians. help the economy, close your narrow mind, step outside the box and give other restaurants a chance, i guarantee you that you will agree with this review....zero stars
