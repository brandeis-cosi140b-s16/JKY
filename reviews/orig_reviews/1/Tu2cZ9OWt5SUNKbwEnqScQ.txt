Showed up with a party of 5 at 7pm on a Tuesday night.  Was seated promptly and got chips and salsa quickly.  After 20 minutes no server showed up.  Went to hostess that seated us and told her.  No apology just turned to the back and left me standing there.  After another 10 minutes of eating chips and salsa we decided to leave.  Passing the hostess I told her that we were going somewhere else to eat.  She smiled sweetly and told me to have a nice evening.  I asked to speak to a manager.  Manager made no apology but did explain that the server in my area was new but wouldn't be around for long.  I asked what good that would do me now.  She said no good.  Worst experience ever!  Have been going here with visitors for years and have never been treated so poorly.  No one apologized but I guess someone would have to care  before apologizing.
