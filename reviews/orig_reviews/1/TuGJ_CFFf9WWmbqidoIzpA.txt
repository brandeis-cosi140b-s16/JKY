WORST TEX-MEX I've ever eaten, and my dinner companion felt the same way. Servers didn't seem very happy, and someone (a fireman) told me that an angry employee put a pot of boiling oil underneath the fire detector which set off the fire alarm which not only emptied every "Village at South Park" shop but also the people who lived in the apartments above them. Apparently they set off that fire alarm numerous times - just an arrogant, badly run establishment with yucky food. Don't waste your money, and if you plan to eat there have a good supply of Pepto Bismol (which was the color of their facade when I went) in your car. Otherwise make sure you're wearing a "Depends" The photo below to the left is VERY HELPFUL as it looks exactly like what you'll see in your toilet bowl later (and it won't take long).
