As an (inexplicably) popular Phoenix destination, I've dined here over the years and been reasonably satisfied.  Service is tolerable, speed is tolerable, ambiance is tolerable.  It's a little overpriced for the quality but I was able to swallow it.

Until tonight.  My group was seated out at a patio table which had the umbrella still on it so we were sitting in shadows.  We asked for a candle for some light- "We're out of candles, I guess we're not doing candles on the tables anymore."  The guy graciously removed the umbrella from the table which helped a bit.

It was downhill from there.  Slow service on drinks, constant creepy lurking interruptions from the waiter, condescending comments during 2/3rds of the tables orders.  Snooty oblivious help from the woman who brought out our orders.  (If the people you're sending out with food can't answer simple questions with anything better than a blank stare, *MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE CARRYING OUT THE FOOD*)

Continually empty water glasses and slow service to the end, I left satisfied only in the knowledge that I will never patronize this restaurant again.
