I went there with wife for lunch. I saw review at Food channel network and we want to try our self. I ordered beef chimichanga combo and wife's ordered taco combo. We were not impressed. They put lots of tomatoes and bell pepper and not a lot of meat. All we tasted is salt. The food is expensive. We spent about $15 for both meals without drinks. We agreed that Carolina's is far better. We will not go back for sure...................
