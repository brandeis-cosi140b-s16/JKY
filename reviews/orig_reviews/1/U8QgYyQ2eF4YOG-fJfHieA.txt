I used to highly recommend this place because the food was good and different. Lately I have received poor service and even poorer quality food. I placed an pursed with the bar server and watched her write down my entire order. 
After 15 minutes of waiting for a burrito it comes out covered in items that I specified I did not want. 
They take it back and then the owner and her bring the food back out 10 minutes later. I asked for salsa and he tells me it has salsa already. I said "yes I am aware I would like some hot sauce. I come here all the time."

He pulls out a menu so I can choose the only hot salsa they have. I then finally get to eat my burrito and it's COLD. COMPLETELY COLD. 10 minutes of recooking a burrito and it's COLD. 

WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

The owner lied to me about the order and the waitresses understanding of it and then said he "wont make me pay for it" after I informed him how cold it was and that my lunch break was entirely eaten up. I ended up walking out, no need to listen to his excuses on why his food was cold. 

I WENT OUT FRONT AND THEIR WAS A PICKUP TRUCK WITH RAW MEAT IN THE BED. ARE THEY USING THAT MEAT? IS THAT YOUR SOURCE? 

Won't be going back. Hope nobody else does either. COLD FOOD HEALTH RISK.
