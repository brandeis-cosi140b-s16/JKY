Horrible experience. They don't even deserve one star. We tried to go last Saturday to have a few drinks with friends. We weren't allowed in because one of my friends was apparently wearing boots. Let me be clear that they were not boots. I noticed the guy standing behind us was wearing  boots but he was allowed in and when I mentioned it to the bouncer his response was, "yeah, he's wearing cowboy boots". He didn't let us in because my friend was wearing 'boots'. Some boots are allowed and some are not? The other bouncer standing next to him told him to let us in because my friend was not wearing so called boots and he still didn't want to. Never going there again. The guy just wanted to be a douche. I really hope this was not race related.
