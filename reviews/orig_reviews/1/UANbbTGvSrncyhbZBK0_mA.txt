I love the idea of Korean-Mexican fusion.  But, I don't know if we went there on a bad day, or they paid Guy Fieri a ton to hawk their place, but I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the bulgogi burrito and Jamie had the bulgogi plate.  The meat was dry, and I had to ask for kimchi on the side.  Korean restaurant, kimchi ON THE SIDE???  There should have been kimchi IN everything.

Sorry, folks, I'm not going back.
