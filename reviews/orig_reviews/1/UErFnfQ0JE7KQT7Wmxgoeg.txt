If I had to ask for cornbread and bread pudding 4 times each, and water 5 times, after waiting an hour and half to get my orders taken, and another hour to have my entree on the table, the food better have been jizz-worthy.

Unfortunately, the guac was terribly blended, diablo pasta was bland as F, pumpkin bread pudding tasted nothing like pumpkin.

1 star for wasting my patience and ~5,000 calories that I could've better spent on Taco Bell.
