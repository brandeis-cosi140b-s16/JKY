Went here when it first opened, had some slow service. We chalked that up to the restaurant being new and returned recently (over a year later). STILL very bad service. They were very slow and understaffed, got one of our orders wrong and completely neglected our request for coffee. Besides what seemed like hard, stale plantains on my pancakes, the food was tasty. But it wasn't tasty enough to return and deal with horrible service.
