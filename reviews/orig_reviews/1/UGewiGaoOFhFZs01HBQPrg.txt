I've been here before and it was good food and good service. Today was definitely not a very good day. Four of the hosts were crowded at the door touching each other's hair and not welcoming customers or saying thank you. They had attitude as well. Our server looked like she got deal a wrong hand for the night so was unfortunately taking over her problems with attitude and gossip. A whole crew of servers were standing behind our table gossiping. I will not come back here even if i like the food. I am a waitress and there was absolutely no excuse for the service we had tonight.
