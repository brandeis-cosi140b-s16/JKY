Was here the other night , it was around 7 and the hostess was unwelcoming. Didn't catch her name just remember she had short hair . When we were shown to our seats the hostess slammed our plates on the table , a couple that was across from us noticed and were more surprised as we were. I was so upset & couldn't believe she just did that.  We ending up just leaving. And  ended up to going to Olive Garden.
