I love going to salty's because it is a great environment where I get the opportunity to relax and have fun with friends.  However, last Saturday, while celebrating a friends birthday, our table got cussed out by our waitress for others who had left earlier not tipping her.  NOT MY PROBLEM!b literally, could not believed she cussed us out not once but twice about someone else OBVIOUSLY showing their disdain with her service.  Whoever goes to salty's..beware of Alyse.  She's a nightmare of a waitress
