So.. I read the reviews beforehand and was anticipating mediocre service and poor food.  Unfortunately i was not dissapointed. I walked in and greeted by two security people who asked to see my ID. Walking past them i entered and area with tables with an open view of the kitchen. There was a waitress seating on one of the tables and she greeted me while seating. I asked if i could sit at the bar and order food. She said yes. When I sat at the Bar i asked for the Menu and the bartender mentioned that food was not available at the bar only the tables. I was given a menu and I picked a table. Because I picked a table maybe to far from the view of the waiters I moved to a location in plain view of everyone.  NO DICE!  It's been 25 minutes, I Am not kidding! This is the place where no one cares. I was really rooting for you Salty.... I was hungry for some tacos and a beer. Thats ok, there's a red robin close by. Oh, and if the people from this bar are reading this, you should really fix the table that wobbles about 20 inches to one side.
