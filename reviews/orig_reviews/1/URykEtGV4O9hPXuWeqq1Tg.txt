The absolute worst food experience of my latest Las Vegas trip. We stopped in for Brunch while we were waiting for our room. I had a feeling we were in trouble when the hostess gave us the regular menu instead of the Brunch menu. When we asked our waitress about it, she acted like we were putting her out.  We ended up ordering off the regular menu, which might have been our mistake. 

The Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno Peppers were the first and only good thing we had. They were Crispy, Salty, Cheesy, Crunchy and slightly Spicy. A good sign for the start of our meal. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. We also ordered at least one of each of their tacos. I can't tell you much about them because they all tasted the same.  In a word...bland! It's pretty bad when we couldn't tell the difference between Al Pastor, Al Carbon, Garden and even their namesake Pink Taco. Even the Tortillas were bland and doughy. The Shrimp and fish tacos were identifiable, but not much more. The Rice and Beans and Chips and Salsa jumped right on the same Bland Bandwagon. 

Even our Margaritas missed the mark. My Cadillac had an off, bitter taste and Diane's Kinky B*tch tasted like A shot of the liqueur by itself. Needless to say, there was nothing about our visit to Pink Taco that would make us want to return.
