We got robbed by pink taco last night.  105 dollars for chappy garbage food and tiny margaritas for 2 people.  I've had 10 times better food on a street corner in North Las Vegas for 5 bux.  I'm super pissd.  I've never done it before but I even stiffed the chappy as waitres.  And I don't feel bad for her one second.  I dare you to go into this rip off joint.
