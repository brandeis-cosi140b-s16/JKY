Don't let the one star fool you.  Food is great but I've been to a few Cafe Rio's and they all have great food. They all are consistently good. 

This Cafe Rio in particular is horrible.  They have horrible service.  Every time I go I consistently order $50 - $60 of food.  They have screwed up my order EVERYTIME.
