My girlfriend and I go to this location all the time and order cardne asada tacos. Last night my girlfriend decided to purchase menudo. I was hesitant because I don't like to stray from my usual anywhere. We came home and she made me try it (she's Hispanic) and I'm Russian. I wasn't a fan but I liked the broth. Last night she was raving about it saying it was amazing.
This morning she heated up a bowl of it. About halfway through the bowl she rushes to the sink and throws up. I don't know what's going on. I look on her napkin and there is a HUGE fly!!! You could see the wings. I was fuming. She is returning to the location today to complain.
Absolutely disgusting! Never stray from what you know !
