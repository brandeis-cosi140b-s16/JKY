After my boyfriend was raving about this place for months he took me here for lunch today. We walked in and I immediately noticed how dirty the dining area was. There was food on the tables, food on the floor and food on the chairs and I mean like someone had a food fight with some beans! There was an employee eating a burrito in the middle of the dining area and another tending to the soda fountain so I'm sure they noticed but not one person cleaned a table the entire time we were there. The employees were super nice who made the food and were very helpful while ordering. I ordered 2 pastor tacos and the corn Mexican style. Dude I was excited for the corn because elote is my fave but it was flavorless. The salsa bar was impressive with more choices I had ever seen. There was like 8 salsas, all kinds of veggies, cooked onions, 2 types if beans and more. One of my tacos the pastor was super dry and the other straight burnt black. Sometimes you're hungry enough that it doesn't matter but this time I left half my food for the trash can, bummer.
