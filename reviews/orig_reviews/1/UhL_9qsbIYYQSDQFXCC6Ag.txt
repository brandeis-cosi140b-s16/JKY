I came to have menudo with handmade tortillas.  Being that their specialty are tamales I ordered a cheese and pork tamale. The menudo was great but the tortillas unfortunately were not handmade. What bothered me the most was that the owner argued that they were.  I would've appreciated her honesty. The tamales were not the best.b
