Read reviews that this was a good spot for Mexican - save your money!  Had the pink tacos.  There was a smear of black beans on a corn tortilla, topped with some cheese and microwaved before being topped with some extremely dry chopped chicken.  $12.00 margarita was about 4 sips.  Good news:  Chips were fresh and salsas were good....disappointing!
