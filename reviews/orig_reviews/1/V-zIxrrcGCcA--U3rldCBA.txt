Bottom line: This was my first time in and I won't be back.
I totally agree with "Rebekah J", and our experience with this place was not any different. We were not even given our silverware, and the waiter never came to us after taking our order. When I went in searching for one, no one bothered to care, and busy talking among themselves. Food was just ok, nothing great. All this when the overall occupancy was about 25%.
This was my first time, and would be my last too!
