Ehhh. I don't usually post bad reviews,  but in this case I'm pissed. No strawberry lemonade or mint limeade. The horchata & southwest limeade machine isn't even turned on, so everything is room temp. The bathroom was embarrassing. I haven't even eaten my food yet, I'm actually nervous. Had they at least been friendly I could give a 2nd star, but no such luck.
