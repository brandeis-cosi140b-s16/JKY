One of the worst things about Yelp is that there are no options for Zero stars for restaurant's that truly deserve it. That statement is only for this location and not for the Cafe Rio chain as the others I have been to have all been wonderful, but the management at this location is truly horrendous. If you want a better experience go to the one next to Sportsman's Warehouse and you will see what this chain really stands for. The store on Decatur is a easy fix, just bring in a manager that actually knows how to run a restaurant and isn't insulting to customers. The manager is truly a piece of work and really need to be retrained. I have been in sales and traveled the western US for the past 40 years and I have never come into contact with worst customer service, this guy really takes the cake.
