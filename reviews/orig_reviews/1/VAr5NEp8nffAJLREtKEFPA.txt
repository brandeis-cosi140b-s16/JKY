The service here was OK the first time we went but the kitchen was out of everything, even tortillas!  I realized everyone has a bad day and really wanted to give them a second chance.  I went back the other night and was just as disappointed in the service and quality of the food.  The one thing they do great is the guacamole.  With that said, the quality of the other dishes was sub-par.  The pork was so tough it was almost beef jerky like.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  The Fish on the tacos was soggy and cold.  The server was so overly pushy with trying to get me to buy the most expensive tequila for a margarita that I just changed my drink order to water.

Overall, for the prices they charge one would expect well seasoned, properly cooked, and overall nicely plated food.  That's just not the case.  It's been bland, tough, cold, dry and disappointing every time I've tried it.  This place could do so much better and really be a great place to eat with a large group of friends or on a romantic date.  The kitchen doesn't seem to care and the wait staff just wants to up-sell and is not very knowledgeable with questions about the menu.

I gave Barrio Queen two chances, and will not give it a third.  I can not recommend Barrio Queen at all.
