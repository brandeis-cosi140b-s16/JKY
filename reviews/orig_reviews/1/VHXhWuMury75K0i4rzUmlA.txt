Overpriced food .
Rude server.
Low quality food.

I think they get away with the fact that people visiting Vegas are not repeat customers. So they act rude and don't really care.   Dont waste your money.

The waiter actually ruined our night ... we were having a great time and he just acted rudely and at the end charged us 20% forced gratuity on top of that for his rude behavior.
