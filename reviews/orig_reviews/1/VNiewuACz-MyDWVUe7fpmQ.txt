Love the food, always have. But when you have 8 employees "working" and only a few customers in line it should not take 23 minutes. The poor kid on the front line was in training, understandable learning curve, but he had to keep going back to the back to restock the prep line multiple times himself just while I was in line. You could tell he was fustrated by his vulgar language talking under his breath but where all customers could hear. Other employees were just talking or on their cell phones.  If you stop and think about the health side of that...we use our cell phones during some "wash your hands when done" times. Not the time I want you touching my food right after.  Finally got most of our food and sat down to eat. After about 25 minutes, and we were done eating, we still had not received some of our food. End up going back to the register for a refund. Food was still good, as always, but the people working simply did not care about anything.

-Unacceptable wait time
-Never received all our food, refunded for missing items
-Food was good, though sanitation was poor
