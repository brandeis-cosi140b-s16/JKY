I arranged a reservation for two persons at The Mission for a very special occasion well in advance. The food is excellent, the service was very good but the help at the front reservation greeting area need significant training. I was immediately greeted in a half empty restaurant by the statement that there was a limit of 2 and 1/2 hours that I could remain at the table. Really! 
Two people for dinner? How tactless! This will be my last time that I will frequent this restaurant that had been a favorite for over 6 years. Again, the desk help need serious training! Ideal for tourists who like to spend money and most likely will never return, but for us locals there are a number of exceptional alternative restaurants available that know how to great guests!
