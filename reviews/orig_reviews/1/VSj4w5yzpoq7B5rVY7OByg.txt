Horrible food- Great Service

The waitress was so nice I almost did not write this review. I had the most bland tasteless pork their "signature dish" which was over cooked, reheated, not fresh, and bland. The empanadas were the WORST I have ever had, soft and chewy, instead of crispy and flaky. The drinks were equally bad, over-priced cocktails that tasted like everything was made fresh from a mixer bottle. Nothing about this place was good, except for the friendly waitress and the good guacamole
