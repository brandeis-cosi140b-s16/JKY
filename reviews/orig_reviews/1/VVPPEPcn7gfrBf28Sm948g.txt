Not a good experience.  We usually come on the weekends now and then for a nice wine and lunch experience.  This time, both were bad.  First, they quit carrying the Falling Star Sauvignon Blanc, and had no other Sauvignon Blanc to offer.  The waiter took forever to get me any wine at all.  I have asked a few times in the past months for them to carry the Falling Star again, but no avail.  My chicken torta was dry and horrible.  It literally had no flavor, I had to ask for mayonaise!!   I have had some amazing tortas in my life and I was expecting something fabulous.   Service was so very slow, we were so disappointed.  I love the building, the huge patio, the chance to buy fresh produce, and the food used to be very good, but I probably won't be back again.  With high prices, I expect amazing food and a good drink selection.  Table salsas were very good though.
