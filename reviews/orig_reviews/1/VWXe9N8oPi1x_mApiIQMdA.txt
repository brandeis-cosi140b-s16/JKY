I was hugely disappointed, i prefer to search out local family owned restaurants, there were alot of positive reviews about this place but it was not even good. portions were small and prices high.. Quality was sub par, the guacamole had no seasoning no flavor except bitter oil. we had enchiladas, chijmis, tacos more, nothing was even average. the salsa was hot but didnt seem fresh, made with low grade tomatoes,  hate to say it but, even the chains are much better than this place. 
Note: they dont itemize there bills either, seemed higher than it should have been. place was 1/2 full, food slow to come, had to leave in a hurry
