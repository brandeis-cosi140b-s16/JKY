Absolutely atrocious service, while there were only three tables of customers at 7pm on a Saturday night.  To top it off, the waiter was a smart ass when, after 15 minutes of his being MIA, we inquired as to his whereabouts when we wished to order more drinks & food.  On the plus side, the food was fine and arrived quickly (even before the chips and salsa appetizer?).
