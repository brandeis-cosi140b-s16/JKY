My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at Senor Frog. The food was quite disappointing. It was overpriced, but as locals we expect that on the Strip. She ordered a burrito, me a chimichanga. Our meals looked great, but as we dug in we both saw it was 95 percent RICE, hardly any meat inside. For $18 apiece, we could of ordered food at Roberto's Taco Shop that is 10 times better. Then we kidded each other about the sides, avocado and rice. More rice. At least the side should of been refried beans so our meals wouldn't be 98% rice. Good place to eat if you're a vegetarian. Than all you have to do is pick out the tiny fragments of meat in the burrito or chimichanga.
