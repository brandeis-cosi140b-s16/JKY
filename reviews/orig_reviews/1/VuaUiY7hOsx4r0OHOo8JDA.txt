Came in to treat my wife for a Mother's Day lunch.  Unfortunately after waiting for about twenty minutes, we had the bowl of chips finished off and drinks almost empty, no one had been by to take our food order.  They weren't that busy.  We decided not to order after waiting a few minutes longer our waiter finally came by to take our order, I told him just charge us for the drinks and chips so we could go somewhere else.  We weren't charged.
