I was craving fajitas for lunch and figured I would try Arriba to go.  

So to start with the good - the staff was friendly and I did not wait long for my food.  That's about it.

The bad - I ordered the Santa Fe Fajita Salad which cost $12.99 (including tax).  The salad was not inedible but it certainly was not a $12 salad.  The Salad portion was what appeared to be bagged iceberg lettuce salad (the kind with carrots and red cabbage).  The meat was ok but rather bland and the guacamole was clearly turning brown.  There were hardly any peppers or onions to speak of and one large piece of onion turned out to be the thick, impossible to chew, piece of onion skin.

My food was bagged not boxed - in a bag the was puffed up with air in order to keep the bag from lying directly on the food.  Only after I started to eat my food did I realize how this might have been achieved and I tried not to imagine an employee blowing all over my food to inflate the bag. Unfortunately that thought was too much and I set the rest of my overpriced salad aside.

Also don't expect a fork or napkins in your to go order if you do decide to take your chances.  There weren't any.
