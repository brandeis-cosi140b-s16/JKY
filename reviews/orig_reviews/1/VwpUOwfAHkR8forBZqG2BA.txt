I was there 4/28/12 about noon and was treated rudely by the hostesses after they got done finishing their BS session two minutes after I walked in with some friends. The patio had maybe ten people seated outside and she tells me it'll be a 15 minute wait to seat me out there, I ask why seeing as there is so many open seats and she tells me that's just the way it is. I say O.K., I'll just head over to D'Arcy McGee's to sit on their patio and she smiles and patronizingly says, "that's great, Have a great day" and then her and the other hostesses giggle at us as we leave the place. WOW, if that were my place and I saw that they all would be down the road a.s.a.p. Talk about pulling money out of the owners pockets. People like the patio especially when the weather is nice and they try to shove people inside by making them wait hoping they'll take an inside seat which is, of course, available immediately. On Saturday we made a point to get there earlier to make sure we got right onto the patio. This waiting thing is SOP for the place.
BTW-Two things:
First, our group went right over to D'Arcy's and sat down on the patio; we had a great meal and lots of drinks and dropped some large bills. And, the treatment we received was outstanding.
Second, as well as losing my business in the future, my significant other is a manager for a major corporation who has dumped a lot of money at San Felipe's in the past with clients, employee parties,etc, those days are over too.
It's really too bad about the service, all the place has going for it is a ton of atmosphere: booze is booze, food is food, etc. nothing special.
