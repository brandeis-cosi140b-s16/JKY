NO COMPARISON between this one and the Ahwatukee location (which I will rate a 4 or 5 soon). I ordered the chile relleno with adobada pork. It was terrible.  The beans were watery and bland.  They used a thick rubbery anaheim chile instead of pasilla which is a huge mistake, and the egg was separate from the chile.  The egg was wrapped around the chile.  The rice was mediocre.  Service was weak.  I would never go back.  I CANNOT BELIEVE this place is getting an average 4 stars!
