Waited for my birthday to experience this restaurant and was so looking forward to it. Arrived at 930pm for our reservation and it was really busy(in a good way). It took 15 minutes for the server to come over and take a drink order and then carded us but never mentioned it being my birthday or anything so that pretty much means she didn't even look at the date. My dinner date assumed she was the server assistant since she only took a drink order and gave us water. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks and then to our surprise she was our server and took our food order 20 minutes later. I was looking forward to having several courses spaced out over the night and was excited for the food. The bacon guacamole was excellent and everything I had hoped for. The 2 rolls we ordered were old and horrible. Do they premake some of these on busy nights and I just got old ones that weren't ordered? The rice was dry and hard and even the kiwi on top wasn't juicy. Server never really asked how it was jsut walked up and said are you finished and took the whole roll away just missing 2 pieces. Then we ordered some tacos and guess what? Old dry chicken that tasted horrible and the beef one was juicy but I refused to eat it out of principle since the night was so bad. At this point I had been there just under 2 hours and had only had 2 beers because she never would come around to take an order and had several dishes served that were all crap. The manager then comes over and says the server informed him we had sent back several dishes. His hands were shaking he was so nervous and I let him know it wasn't his fault he didn't prepare the meal but everything served was bad and old and a complete let down and service was bad. He offered his card to buy me a drink the next tiem I was in and walked away. Server dropped the check with everything on it and I had to tell her what I was and wasn't paying for. 
PATHETIC ON ALL ACCOUNTS IN EVERY WAY!
