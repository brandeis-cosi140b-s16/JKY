I went to Nacho Daddy for a Paint Nite event with a friend and got there a 1/2 hour early so we could grab a quick bite and drink before the event. 
We went straight to the bar and Kimmy was working. We ordered two beers and I told her that we were there for the event after she had offered us menus. I said, "If you don't see us we'll be in the other room for PaintNite." To that she answered with a not-so-nice tone, "You have to close out with me." 
My friend and I were super hungry and we still had 20mins before the event so I asked her if I could order food and pay her for it at the bar. She replied rudely, "If you want to order anything you'll have to do it with the server in the room. I don't know where you'll be sitting and I can't take the food to you and leave the bar." I rolled my eyes at her because the solution was extremely simple; let me order and pay for the food at the bar and give my food to the server to run when she took drink/food orders or deliveries to the event room. I did not leave a tip, ordered any more drinks or food the rest of the night. By the time the event ended, the restaurant was closing and we left without eating or drinking anything else. We only spent $10 where we could have spent more. This was a really bad first impression and I don't think I want to go back for another bad experience.
