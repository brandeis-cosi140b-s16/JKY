Just got back from here. Unacceptable service. I am not picky and very understanding...but this place was ridiculous. We got there at 730 pm. Had to wait for a table so we sat in the bar. Bartenders never made eye contact Or talked to us for 15 mins so we left. Our buzzer was broken and never went off. So when we got back... They sat us and we waited 10 mins for a waiter and another 15 mins for our drinks. Our food then took 30 mins.  We finally ate at 930. The food had no flavor and the beans were burnt. The restaurant was dead so I didn't understand why it took so long. We had to get the hostess to get our check since our waiter took forever getting it to us. I will never be back.
