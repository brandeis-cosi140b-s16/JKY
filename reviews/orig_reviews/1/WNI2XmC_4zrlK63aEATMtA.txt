This place was horrible! The server was rude, we asked if we could have Chicken Tacos, they were on the menu, NO! We ordered Carne Asada Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas, and Guacamole. The Chicken was fat rubbery and gray, The Carne Asada tasted gamey and disgusting, the Guacamole was OK. We had Chips with the meal, they were Ok, this disaster was $65.00. Don't waste your money, there are much better choices.
