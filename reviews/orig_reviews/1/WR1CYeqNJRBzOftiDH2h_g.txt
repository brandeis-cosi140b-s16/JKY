Saturday afternoon  - almost impossible to get a drink.  The bartenders are too busy talking on their cell phones instead of helping a full bar of frustrated patrons.  Had to ask 3 different times for 2 beers before someone actually brought them.  There were also some strange smells if vomit and fish in certain areas.  Also, THEY DO NOT WASH THEIR GLASSES. We saw someobe bring out a brand new box of glasses, open it and then place the glasses under the bar. One of the bartenders grabbed a cup directly from the box, filled it with beer and then gave it to a customer!   So gross will never go back.
