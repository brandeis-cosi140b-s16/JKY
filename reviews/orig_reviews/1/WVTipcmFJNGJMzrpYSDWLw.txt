Gross.

I love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.

No flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money.
