This has been the very first time Yelp has failed me. There is no reason this restaurant merits anywhere close to a four star average. I seem to think that people around here wouldn't know good mexican if it hit them (bit them?). I tried it after it first reopened at its current Mill Ave location and the food was horrible. Very bland and kind of cold. I have since stayed away, but after reading some very good reviews here on Yelp I decided to go back. I had the enchilada, taco, beans and rice combo (pretty much your most basic mexican dish). The beans were more like beany water. The rice was beyond bland. The enchilada was like eating cardboard wrapped around cardboard flavored cheese. The taco was the best part with some sort of flavorful beef. The chips were alright but the salsa tasted like cayanne pepper & water. 

This place is just another disappointing restaurant on Mill Ave. The area must be cursed.
