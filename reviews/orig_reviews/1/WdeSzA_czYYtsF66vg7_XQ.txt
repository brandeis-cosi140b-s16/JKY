The margaritas which Macayos calls "the best in Phoenix" are not. That's the nicest way I can say it. Just don't waste your money on them. 

The food is decent but bland. The guacamole was excellent. 

Problem is that any good Mexican food joint that can't give me a good margarita is OFF the list.

The server was decent but they only had about half the service staff they needed.
