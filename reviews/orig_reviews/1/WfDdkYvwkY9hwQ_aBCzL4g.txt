Aunt Chilada's at the Pointe is more about atmosphere than food.  It has a good happy hour, but the food is pretty pedestrian.  I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific. 

Was there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again. 

So, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate.
