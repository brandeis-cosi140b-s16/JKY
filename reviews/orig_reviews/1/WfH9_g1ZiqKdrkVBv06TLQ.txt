Went to scope out the place for a potential birthday party. The restaurant itself was nice and I really liked the atmosphere and decor. But then the food came...I don't know what that was, but it was not like any Mexican food I've ever had. Disgusting. The chips and salsa were nothing special but the food at the tables around me looked good so it didn't bother me. I had the Tia Rosa Burrro. After the first bite I could not eat anymore. The red enchilada sauce tasted sort of sweet and spaghetti sauce-like flavor. Weird. And the meat? Ugh. It was like pot roast but gross. The rice and beans? Flavorless.  Will never go back.
