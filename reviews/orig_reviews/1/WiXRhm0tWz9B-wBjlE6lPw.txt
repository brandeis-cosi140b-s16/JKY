Mucho gusto es much malo, mucho dinero por much nada.
Our order: 2 fish tacos, comes with salad $14.
2 chicken tacos, comes with salad $12.
A second round of chips is an extra dollar.
The food was ok, but at those prices should have been spectacular or at least filling.
If only if is was possible to review somewhere and give them no stars.
Mucho Gusto would be it.
