Horrible i uses To Love this place but never go at closing time they will serve you old chicken that taste like garbage not fresh , I can't believe I had to pay for something I didn't eat . 
Manager never came just the nice serve said he was sorry I will never be back I used to love Gallo blanco but this place is no good after 9:40 pm
