Food was good but service was terrible. Had a server named Victor. I ordered a margarita with no salt and it came out with salt. I let him know I had ordered no salt and asked for a new one. He took my drink, walked away, and then I watched him take a napkin and wipe the rim of my glass and bring it back. I really hate salt so I told him I saw him just wipe the glass, but instead of apologizing and getting me a new, fresh drink he got attitude and said I needed to taste the drink to see if I tasted the salt! Are you kidding me - how unprofessional. He then got attitude with my friend who was with me and asked if she had something to say also.  I will never go back - decent tasting taco but that kind of service is inexcusable!!
