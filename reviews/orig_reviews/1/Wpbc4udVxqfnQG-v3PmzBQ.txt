We went on Cinco De Mayo. I get that it was busy but the main hostess working was extremely rude.  We put in our name and waited. As we were waiting she was screaming at other patrons. We observed this for a bit.  The most shocking incident was when an older lady who was waiting for a table was called. The older patron, confused with all the people, began to walk the other way. The hostess grabbed this lady and yelled, "We are over here!!" Pointing to the section. After this we left. There is no excuse for service like this.
