I went with my wife on Friday evening at 8.  The restaurant was probably about 2/3 filled but not hopping.  We asked to sit outside on the gorgeous patio.  It really is a beautiful place to dine.  After a minute or two the busboy/server brought us out chips and salsa. They were pretty darn good.  Then... nothing.  We were ready to order our entrees, but nobody had even passed by to take our drink order.  One waiter kept coming out and conversing with his buddies at a table near us.  Another waitress seated an older couple 5 minutes after us.  While we desperately tried to get someone`s attention, that couple was brought out their drinks.  10 minutes slowly dripped into 15.  Finally, we simply walked out.

I get overworked waitstaff, and can have patience  with that, but this was ridiculous for a half-full restaurant, with at least 3 waiters working the patio area.
