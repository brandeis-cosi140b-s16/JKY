I hate to say it but it is one of the worst places I have been in a long time. It started by having to park in the Mud and then walk around the building to the entrance. The only reason we decided to go there is the false advertising for Sushi Bar. They claimed they just never changed the sign. Will all the business one would have to think they left there on purpose to trick people. We would have left had we not been going to the Opera and didnt have time to select another location. Poor service and small overpriced food. I have tasted better at a back yard get together. I do not recommend!!! People started walkingbout as they were not getting service. Bad start to our night!
