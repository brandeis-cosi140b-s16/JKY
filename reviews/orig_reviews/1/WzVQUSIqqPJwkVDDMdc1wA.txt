Horrible customer service. Took my father there for his birthday.  When the food arrived, he was the only one that didn't get his food. It took 15 minutes to flag the waiter and when we asked about his order the server lied and said it would be 3 more minutes. After another 15 minutes we asked again and were now told that his order "somehow ended up on another ticket and it would be another 20 minutes".   The rest of the table was now finished with their food.  When my husband asked to speak with the manager, the manager defended the server and told us if we didn't sit down and be quiet he would call the police! Needless to say my poor father's birthday was ruined.
