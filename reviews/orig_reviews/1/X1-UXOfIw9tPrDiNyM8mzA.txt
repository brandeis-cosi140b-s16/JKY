First off I don't typically give negative reviews and I barley know how to start. The wife and I were trying to find good Mexican food in Vegas. Upon reading many positive reviews on yelp we decided to go. Hope they can fix their problems. I ordered the burrito with green chile. Was bland and lack spice. Insides seemed like they had been run through a blender. All of it was way over cooked. Rice was mush, yuck! 
Also ordered the berry margarita. Wow what a train wreck. Had little if no alcohol. Was more a creamcyicle than a margarita. Big chunks of ice in the bottom. Was also spilled all down the side of the glass.
Now for the good. The salsa and chips are not to be missed if you go! Salsa had a great smokey favor.
You can make your own decision but, I won't be back.
If and when you are also disappointed try La Salsa. They have many locations. Price is on par. Also much better food and drinks.
