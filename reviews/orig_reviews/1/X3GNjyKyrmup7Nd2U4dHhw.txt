So, of all the places I've been in Las Vegas, this is truly the worst yet.  I just couldn't find any positives at all.  

Food - No joke, I got a fajita with maybe two-three pieces of steak.  It's like half of it dropped on the floor and they were like, oh well, only two pieces left.  Serve it up.

On top of that, it was truly awful!  No flavor at all.  I was eating onions and peppers on bread.  That's lovely.

Service - When the waittress asked me about this, I told her.  No complaint, just told her my thoughts.  Now, when the MANAGER came over, he looked completely unprepared, hungover, and like he was in over his head.  He stuttered like a fool, and just walked away.  There was no conversation at all.

Total busch league here.  No people, and I'm a bit shocked they're in business.  By the way, their signs say they have hooka starting at 10PM, which is a misprint, yet they keep the sign up.  Kind of funny.

Trying to be helping:  Go to Mesa Grill, which is the best in Vegas for Mexican (which is surprisingly bad in this city).
