So I have to say I've always loved Cafe Rio, but today has had to be the worst service EVER. Yes I know it gets busy what restaurant doesn't. I called in my order & was given a 20 min pick up time, I get there 30 min later order wasn't even started on. Manager says "O sorry we are out of rice did they not tell you" meanwhile I had already been sitting waiting for almost 20 more minutes. To top it OFF when they FINALLY had my order ready it wasn't even Right! I don't know if there's new management at this location but it keeps getting worse as time goes on!
