While the atmosphere is welcoming I found several downfalls. Waitstaff had attitude. We ordered guacamole and it was a puke green color like it was from two days ago. Also got soft shrimp tacos, the shrimp was somewhat edible but the tortillas were cold, beans were as well and disgustingly dry. Rice out of the box blows this place's out of the water. Only remotely appealing food item was the chicken quesadilla that was packed full of chicken. I'll keep in mind to make sure Im not sober if I ever return.
