I heard good things about this place, so my girlfriend and I thought we would give it a try. I would never return!  The hostess told us it would be about a 15 wait, and that she would text me when the table was ready. After waiting 20 minutes, and seeing 4 other tables being sat, I asked the hostess with no personality how much longer the wait would be. She told me she text messaged me a long time ago. That's funny, because! I never received a text. She then sat us. We waited 4 minutes for someone to greet us. Meanwhile, other servers are hanging out at the host stand. Two servers walked past our table and just looked at us. I decided to give up and just leave. I told the hostess we were leaving because this restaurant is an absolute joke. She said nothing, and simply rolled her eyes and raised he hands.  Customer service needs a bit of attention here.
