4 of us went there last night before The Who concert.  I'm giving it 1 Star only because of it's great location next to the arena....OMG where do I start?  We had to flag our waiter or someone else down about 5 times...he would disappear for 10-15 minutes at a time.  The $13 burrito wasn't half as good as $5 burritos you can get on Van Buren.
We go out @ 5 times per week so you have to be pretty bad to have earned "My Worst Dining Experience This Year Award!"

Avoid this place at all cost.
