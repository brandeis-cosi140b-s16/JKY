The servers are very sweet but the food is not great and certainly not worth the price. My man and I have tried this place several times (not many food options in this area) and the food never lives up to what people have said about this place. The chips always taste burnt/stale which leads me to think that the oil is old. The burritos are big but the meat or beans inside have little flavor- again tasting like the food is old. I have never dined in but the decor looks old, tired, cheap and neglected. For 4 dinner entrees and chips, the takeout bill came to $60. I'm gonna need better quality for that high price.
