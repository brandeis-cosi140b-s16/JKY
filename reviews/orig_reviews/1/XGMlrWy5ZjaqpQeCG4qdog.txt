Horrible, totally disgusting food. The waiter asked how the food was and asked us if we wanted boxes, being we took about two bites of our meal. We laughed and said no boxes, please...insinuating, the food is horrible. He smiled and discretely nodded in agreement, he knew the food was horrible too and works there. I don't know who would even run a restaurant with gross food , what's the point in running a crappy restaurant. The water tasted like sewage even after adding 6 lemon wedges to it. A Mexican restaurant that is too cheap to provide customers with bottles of habanero sauce or even tobasco for that matter. The food tastes so horrible they should at least provide that. Crappiest joint I've ever been. I'm laying in bed at a hotel with a rubber boot settling in my tummy.
