Last Friday after work I met up with 3 friends I haven't seen for a few months to catch up over drinks and appetizers.  First of all, the food was bland.  Secondly, and most important, the service was awful.  Water refills were hard to get.  But here is the real kicker, which I must preface with the fact that the restaurant had low to moderate occupancy.  After an hour and a half, a female staff member approached our table, placed her hands on her hips, shot us a don't mess with me look, and barked, "Do you want anything else??"  She might as well have said GTFO biznatches!  We left with the quickness and won't be returning.
