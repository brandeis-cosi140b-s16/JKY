Okay so this is more about service than food but food would have only been a two. No less than three employees looked at me while cleaning tables but said nothing. One woman finally asked me how many and I said one. She then went to clean off a high-top for another customer. WTF?? It took about 12-15 minutes to get a drink ordered and delivered. This is an airport. 1. People are normally pressed for time and 2. There is not a large seating area. 

When I finally got my Mexican Chopped Salad, it was mediocre at best. Soggy lettuce and barely flavorful dressing. It was by no means a chopped
salad. There was lettuce, meat, dressing, and cheese/sour cream (?). 

I tried to give my server my credit card when he brought my food to expedite my leaving. He said - I'm going to just leave this right here and placed it on the table. Huh? He then explained the computer system was down. So I asked if he could take cash. He said SURE! So I handed him a $20. He gave it back and said that he had no way to calculate my bill. Seriously? Have you ever heard of a calculator? The prices are in the menu. Ugh So you can't take my credit card and you won't take my cash. What do I do when my flight starts to board? He just shrugged his shoulders.
