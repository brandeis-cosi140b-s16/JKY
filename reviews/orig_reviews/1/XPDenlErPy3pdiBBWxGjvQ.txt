I feel bad giving this place such a low rating because the food is great, however, their service is terrible. After waiting nearly fifteen minutes for my food I stood patiently waiting to pay. A woman was standing at the register with her back to me, at one point she glanced at me so I assumed she was helping the people in front of me. Another employee seemed to be helping them more than her, so I kept waiting. After a few more minutes she turned around and said hey. I replied with a very irritated sounding hey, she rang me up with the attitude of me inconveniencing her. At this point I felt as though no one deserved a tip because of the wait, and her rudeness. So when I signed their copy of the receipt I drew a line through the tip area. When I handed it back to her she showed it to another employee, to which he replied "pendejo". Now I don't speak Spanish, but I know enough to know what that meant  when I looked at her she had a snotty smile on her face, so I took my food and walked away. I refuse to eat here again simply because of her attitude and the unnecessary insult. Expect great food, but don't expect service with a smile. You might even get an insult with your meal too.
