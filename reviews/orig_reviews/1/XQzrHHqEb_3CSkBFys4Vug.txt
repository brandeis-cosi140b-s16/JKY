Service was fine. Place is decent. Here is my issue. And Hey, Richardson's I reached out to you via email first to see if you would respond and make good but I never heard anything back. So if this cost you guests so be it. 

Ordered the Renello Platter, lots of food. Not complaining about the taste or the amount. But for the price this can't happen. The platter of food is enormous, so I got a take home container. The next day for lunch I went to eat the leftovers. I took a bite and got pierced in the roof of my mouth with a bone. Wasn't small. I'm a guy that takes big bites, so this bone wasn't something I noticed. It was sharp and over 2 inches. I took pics and complained. Nothing was done. I email management, nothing. I called, no call back. 

For a place that charges what they do... Get bones out of your meat. Disgusting. Not only did I lose my appetite but I got a cut in my mouth. 

Beware if you eat there for the bones in your chicken.

I won't be going back. And I hope you all reconsider before spending 20-50.00 a plate here.
