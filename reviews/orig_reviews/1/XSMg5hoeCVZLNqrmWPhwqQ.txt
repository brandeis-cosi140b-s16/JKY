Restaurant Review

Went here on a date last night. The food and the date were the same: DRY & UNAPPETIZING!

When we sat down they brought salty chips & salsa to the table. Gee thanks.
Waiter takes order and disappears for the rest of the night...lucky. I should've done the same.
Date ordered beer, (seemed pleased) I ordered water (I don't drink, but I should've bought an "Adios Mother F*cker" to ease the pain of this date!).
For appetizers, The Man Who Will Now Have A Relationship With My Voicemail ordered a bean/queso dip concoction...FAIL!! He also ordered us taquitos. SURVEY SAYS: EPIC FAIL!!

For the main dish, we *gags* both ordered chicken enchiladas. Dear Cooks, Chefs, and Owners of Yolos,

WHEN IT IS YOUR JOB TO MAKE MEXICAN FOOD, AND YOU FAIL TO MAKE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A CHICKEN ENCHILADA, IT IS TIME TO ASK YOURSELF: WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?!!

Will Yolos and The Guy That Doesn't Have My New Number ever see me again? Probably not, and by probably...I mean definitely.
