Unfortunately, this place must be crossed off my list. We ordered tamales and they were mush...could not tell which was cheese and which was chicken. Waiter also couldn't tell. Other food tasted fishy, possibly fried or warmed in a pan that had been used for fish. We had.not ordered anything with fish.
