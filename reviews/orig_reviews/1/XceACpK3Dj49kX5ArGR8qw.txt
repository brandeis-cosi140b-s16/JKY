I obviously went to the wrong place.

I placed an order for their Friday special by phone. Thick accented lady, but was sure when I hung up that everything would be ok. Went to pick it up, only to find out everyone there gave me a "deer in the headlights" look when I got there. Looks like I slipped through the cracks.  So I asked if they still had their Friday special. They said, and I'm paraphrasing their heavily accented English "Not today". The big guy came in (has tats and looks mean) and I asked him about the Friday special and he looked peeved that I asked him, and said NO WE DON'T. he looked like he was going to kill me. Well fine I'll just leave now, because there were plenty of flies in there and a customer(?) taking a nap on the back table, maybe passed out so it just wasn't worth it for me. I can get better service and food somewheres else.
