Back again at the Flamingo. The hotel has closed its coffee shop and cut back the hours on the buffet so the only places to eat most of the time is either here, the steakhouse, or the food court. 

Unfortunately I can't say anything good about Carlos & Charlie's again. The food is expensive and mediocre. The drinks are expensive and weak. The service is slow because there isn't enough staff. 

Go eat somewhere in The Linq. I wish I hadn't tried this place again.
