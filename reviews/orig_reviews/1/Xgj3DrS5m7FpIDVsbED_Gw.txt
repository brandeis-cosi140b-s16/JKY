Serious ethical issues at this restaurant. We had a party of greater than 8. 20% gratuity is to be expected. First of all they gave us a special menu *without prices* listed. My entree which I have gotten there before at lunch is listed on their website for $8.99. They Charged us $16 for the same entree (which I have not paid $16 for before). 
Then they charged "21%"- not 20% gratuity AND didn't disclose up front. On top of that they *included the tax in the gratuity* calculation. Then to make matters worse, I did the math and it was 25% gratuity even though it said "21%". 
'Interestingly' the waiter immediately knew what the correct amount for 21% (still including the  tax!) was off the top of his head...and said he would fix it... 
Unethical at every turn at this place. My bill would normally have been $11 all in, but the bill I received was for $24... more than twice the usual cost for the same food. Even when the made up tip amount was "corrected" it still was 21%, included tax in the tip calculation, and entree price was the inflated by 77%. Won't be going back.
