I had time before my flight and wanted a glass of wine to ease into travel mode. Blanco is located in terminal four, gate D and has a fairly large seating area. I didn't have to wait but a minute before getting seated. I would have opted for the bar, but that was full, so I got a table instead. 
My server showed up a couple minutes later and I told her I just wanted a glass of red wine. Rather than bringing me a wine menu she asked me what kind....merlot, cabernet, malbec......"I'll have a malbec" I replied. 
When she brought the wine over I asked for the check as well. Let me say how shocked I was to see a $20 charge for one single glass of wine!!! I stared at it and said "this is the most expensive glass of wine I've ever had...is this right?" She then replied "oh yah, I thought that was expensive too. I even double checked on the price to make sure that was right."
Excuse me??? I love wine and all, but my palate doesn't discriminate on the cheap stuff. I've never even bought a bottle of wine for $20 never mind a single glass! 
Needless to say, I thought it was rude of her that she double-checked with her bartender but didn't run over and say "hey, just wanted to make sure this was ok with you." 
If I ever find myself here again, never will I trust one of their servers.
