We came here while staying at the Cheaparral next door and the enchiladas were ok good but not while eatting the first one and there was a piece of hair chilling on top of the tortilla. Eww gross can you afford hair nets? The margarita was full of ice and sweet sour mix gross mama mia are you serious? Selling me a glass of sweet sour for $10.00 wow how tacky. The service was horrendous the waitress was a real ditzy broad who was more worried about what was going on after work then her own 2tables. I suggest go to another restaurant down the street instead of here.
