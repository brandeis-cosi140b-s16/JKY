Food was alright but I thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food Mexican that's really nothing special or unique. Me and my wife went there and it was over $20 and I was just barely full. It's a better value to just go to a local sit down Mexican restaurant or hit up another taco shop. In one word how would I describe? "Overrated"

Can't believe I've read some reviews saying you get a lot of food for the money. Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it "cheap" and "large portions"?
