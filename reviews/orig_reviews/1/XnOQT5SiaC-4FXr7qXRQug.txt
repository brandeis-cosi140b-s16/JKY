Agave was one of the first restaurants I went to when I moved to Vegas.  If I had written a review then it would have been 4 or 5 stars.

What happened to this restaurant?  The chips used to be phenomenal (sea salt FTW) and the guacamole was fresh.  Now the chips are inedible and all the food tastes canned.  The Mexican restaurant across the street at Red Rock Casino offers exceptionally better food.

If you haven't been to Agave in a while, do not bother.  If you are thinking about going, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else.
