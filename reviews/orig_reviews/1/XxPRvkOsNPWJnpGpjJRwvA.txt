Didn't like it. Reminded me of eating at Disneyland, overpriced and mediocre food. $4.75 for a single steak taco with barely any meat. An order of chips and guacamole is a cup filled halfway with guacamole then covered with salsa and cheese to fill the container to the top. $4.50 for that is a joke. If I order guac I want a cup of guac not some other stuff thrown on top to try and make me feel like I got a full cup of guac!! I won't be returning. I can get a better meal for my money elsewhere.
