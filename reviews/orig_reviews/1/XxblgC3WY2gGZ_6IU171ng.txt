Just left America's taco shop. Have not been here in years and I was very disappointed. This place has gone down hill, spent $28. 00 and I should have gone to Del taco the food is better and cheaper. The burrito had very and I mean very little meat and was bland at best. The tacos were tasteless. Big disappointment, there are a lot better taco joints in town, save your money and go elsewhere. Sad to see this used to be my go to place for tacos.
