If your idea of a fun night out is standing shoulder to shoulder watching a room full of douchebags and plastic women in a bar, then this is the place for you.  Will not go back.  Too loud, too packed, too fake.  Bartenders were more concerned about performing then pouring (some guy behind the bar was juggling, and then drinking liqour, from his SHOES...???), the meatheads in the bar were pre-occupied with shining up their sunglasses (that they wear "at night")....the entire vibe in this place is overwhelmingly douchey.  Overpriced, too.  At the bottom of my list for old town bars.
