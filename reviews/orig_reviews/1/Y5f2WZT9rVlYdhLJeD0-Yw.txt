Of all the words in the English language, only one word sums up this place....FART! The service is horrible, food is inedible, no flavor, no taste, no pleasant smells, over priced, slow to be seated and order placed, poorly lit, small portions, gaudy interior. This is the place out-of-town Caucasians think a Mexican restaurant should look and taste like. The worst part of this experience is that I tried this place twice (lunch and dinner) and both times was a nightmare. You know what they say... first time - shame on them, second time - shame on me!

Avoid this place like the plague. You'd get better food at Taco Bell (yes, I nearly choked on what I said - sad but true).
