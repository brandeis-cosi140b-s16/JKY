Went to Macayo 's order the Baja pizza. Worst ever no longer a fan of there food. All it had on it was some spicy cheesy sauce and I ordered it with pork instead of chicken.  To my dismay the amount of pork could fit on a teaspoon. They used to have a happy hour that was not present @ happy hour. Also found out there well tequila was piss poor. So order a premium Margarita. Good luck on quality of food!
