I liked this place the first time I went, but I just had to walk out due to the poor service. 2pm on a Wednesday, I'm the only person seated at the bar, the restaurant is maybe 20% full. I sit down and wait. The bartender doesn't acknowledge me, no hello, no smile, not even a menu. I have to reach behind the bar for my own menu, decide what to order, but I'm never acknowledged... I'm the ONLY patron-ridiculous! So, I left. Guess I will never be back here... Plenty of options in the area- I go out for the experience more than food, service is extremely important to me. Lousy impression. No wonder they were empty for lunch. I did count 4-5 employees as I waited to be acknowledged as well- no excuse!
