Terrible customer service. I was asked to leave for sending a text message to my girlfriend. I'm not exaggerating, my friends and I paid for bottle service and a table ( $300, by the way) and after having a fun time, not being rude or in any way breaking any club rules, I was asked to leave because I was taking a second to breathe and sending a text to my girlfriend, I have never felt so disrespected and cheated by a nightclub. I cannot in good conscience recommend this place to anyone from Phoenix or visiting. TERRIBLE service and extremely rude staff.
