We were in Tempe for a Water Polo tournament at ASU as an adult sports league. A group of us decided to meet up at El Hefe's for drinks. One of our players was black, working on his MBA, great guy. We were stopped by the bouncers who said our black friend could not come in "because he was wearing grey Nike's". I was wearing sandals. I questioned the bouncer as to what justified our friend's exclusion and he stated to me, "White guys like you shouldn't be hanging with N*ggers like him." We all left. I'm from CA. I've never experienced such blatant racism before. It looked like a fun club. Sorry the help at the door were such racists!
