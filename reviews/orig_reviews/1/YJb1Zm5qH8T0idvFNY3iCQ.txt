Do not eat here. Arrived to dirty tables, I chose the cleanest one. When the server finally came over, she didn't say hello or even acknowledge my existence, just started cleaning the table...but only the part I was sitting in front of, she left the rest dirty. Seriously, I took a picture. The girl finished wiping and said, "so you wanna drink or something?" I ordered a beer, but she spun and walked off before I could order an app! Over her shoulder she said, have your ID out when I get back. The menus were nasty and torn up. When she brought the beer i ordered shrimp tacos and some chips and salsa. She said the dish comes with some chips. I said can i have them now, with my beer? She said well would you like to order a basket instead? Seriously...isnt that what i asked for the first time? So the chip basket comes with like 4 or 5 mini cups of pico de giao stacked on top...again she runs off before I can question her. Finally I'm able to ask for salsa. "We don't have salsa, just pico." Why didn't you say that when I ordered it! "I figured most people know." this is an airport bar, do you really have regulars?! 

The food was meh. The menu doesn't show alcohol prices cause they are all exuberant...$9 for a single beer!!!!

First time in many years I've given no tip...and I sat there taking up a table while writing this, just to be an ass.
