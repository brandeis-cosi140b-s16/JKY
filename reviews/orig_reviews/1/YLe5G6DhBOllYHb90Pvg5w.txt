This place is beyond terrible, from the staff, to the decor followed by the service! I was pregnant at the time so I needed a slight modification to each dish (basically no goats cheese) and EVERY dish came out wrong, followed by the chef sending something else special which I also couldn't have. The only thing I enjoyed was the shrimp fish but it had a wax paper in it... We asked the manager about it and he said it was necessary because of the oils... Umm tacky and not necessary. Find a different way to plate it. Some of the sides were cold. I hated how the salsa on the menu was just salsa to add to your dish? 5$ no chips? Server had no idea what he was doing! I mean no idea... He had previously been a banquet server so didn't turkey understand service. Lastly, I hate that everyone thinks this place is so great. It is a lot of money put into a typical Scottsdale restaurant with a mediocre menu and no real charm. I came on opening week ... Yes a long time ago, but never wrote my review. So here it is.
