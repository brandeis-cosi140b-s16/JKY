This would be a 5-star review if I left out the food.  I love the building, the decor and the layout.  It is a bit loud and the waitstaff seems to wander a bit without real direction.  We were so looking forward to having a great new lunch spot near our office.  After our dining experience we have no plans to return.  

The food looked great... But it didn't taste great.  That's a real problem for a restaurant to overcome.  I did not enjoy any of the things I tried.  I had three different types of their tacos and only ate half of each.  The coffee beef was the worst.  The shrimp was the best of the three but again, wasn't great.  Heck, it wasn't even good or I would have polished it off.

The beans tasted as though they came out of a can and were off-brand.  The corn was probably the best thing we ate (besides the chips--but how do you screw up chips?).

When my parents came to town recently I took them there to show them the building.  My Mom was very excited and wanted to eat there and I dissuaded her based upon my experience.  There had better be some HUGE changes in their kitchen ASAP or there will be no hope for their future.

Great name but they don't deserve it!
