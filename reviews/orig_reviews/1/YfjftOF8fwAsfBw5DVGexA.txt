total tourist spot. We were even offered a photo taken at our table?? Weird. The food was crap, and way overpriced which is pretty normal for a place that doesn't expect locals to return.

pretty good margarita and that's about it and our server was on point

total disappointment price wise and food wise

I don't mind paying for something delicious but 6.99 for a cheese quesadilla for a child? I'll pass.
