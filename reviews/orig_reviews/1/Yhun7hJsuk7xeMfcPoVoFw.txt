Sign of trouble to come when we stepped out of the car onto a freshly used condom. Worst Mexican food we have ever had. Green chile  chimi was old dry dry dry pork...where was the green chile....complained and was told....that's the way we make it....really? Beans have no flavor and the street tacos are much better at Del Taco...Dirty tables,floors,bathrooms etc.. ....Never again
