okay...where to start.
I drive past this spot every day, and it is always busy!  WOW!
I'm thinking this place must be hella good Mexican to be so busy.
I gotta try that place sometime.

My friend gave me a gift card so I went alone for a lunch/ test drive.
I was excited! I ordered the most expensive item on the menu.
Steak and Chicken Fajitas $14.95
and ala carte chicken enchilada.

I should have left when there was a hair in my salsa but I know shit happens and let it go back with the server.

Here come my Fajitas!!  SIZZLING platter of 90% ONIONS.

ONIONS!!  I had to dig for the few scraps of beef jerky and boiled chicken.
I'm not kidding. And I did make a tortilla and try it......one bite was too much. 

Well, at least I had my enchilada right?
I was so bland that it couldn't have been more than boiled chicken...no seasoning at all.

The worst meal of my life.

I tipped the poor server 20% figuring she had a hard enough life working there.

I will never go back
