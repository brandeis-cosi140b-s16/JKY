So came back for a second chance .....cause I always do...we all have a bad night. .....got their special for the night and was almost non edible. Tuesday Nacho Extreme or something.  Again staff was great but whoever is working the menu and recipes should be fired.  Corporate gone amuck.... there's nothing here but really good folks trying to make a bad restaurant good. Sry.
