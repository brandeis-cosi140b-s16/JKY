The service is never good but this time we waited 20 minutes for a drink order and 1 1/2 hours for our food.  Chili Rellenos burnt, Torilla Soup a pasty mush and the tacos had no flavor.  The owner was rude and when we asked when we would get our food she said "That they are very busy and we would just have to wait"!!  If the owner says that there is no one else to go to for help.  It was a terrible evening.  I am a local and know all the restaurants in the area.  Try somewhere else!
