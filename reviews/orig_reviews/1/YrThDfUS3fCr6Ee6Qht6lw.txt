Very disappointed with my first visit here. The guys at the door were cocky. Our waitress was not helpful at all. My friend and I both ordered margaritas. After ordering, our waitress disappeared. Our drinks were the worst and expensive. We tried explaining to our server that we weren't satisfied and she showed no remorse. I don't plan on returning to Sandbar Desert Ridge again.
