Where do I begin? Horrible, horrible place. People who work there should not be serving customers, they should be tending a barn. They treat customers like animals. Food extremely overpriced, tables and floors filthy with food strewn about everywhere (all the time we were there no one cleaned any tables around us, much less the floors), it makes you want to vomit to see the overly full trash cans right next to the tables and no one cleans them, the woman who served the veggies/beans over the food, throws it all into the cheap aluminum bowls as if she were serving pigs and not customers. It was a very unpleasant experience. We spent $42 on four of us. We could have gone to Chipotle or Costa Vida instead and enjoyed a more enjoyable, cleaner dining experience. Never again. Does not even deserve a one star rating.
