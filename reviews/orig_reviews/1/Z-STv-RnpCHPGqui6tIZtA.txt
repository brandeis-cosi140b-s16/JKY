Went here last Saturday since it was in the same hotel where our show was. Big mistake! Husband ordered fish tacos and it was ok but not much different from any fish taco ordered through a fast food drive thru. I ordered chicken tacos and it was by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. It tasted like chicken boiled in water with a sprinkle of cheese on top. Nothing else. Sure they gave little cups of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole but it didn't help it taste any better. It's like they forgot to season it or something. I only took a few bites and gave up. When you spend $80 for two entrees and drinks you expect some edible food.  Oh and they tell you that you get a mini appetizer with every order so I got mini nachos which consisted of three tortilla chips and it took 30 minutes to get. This place was such a joke. Never again!
