No, no, no!  I've lived here for 12 years, and have never heard of this place, except through Yelp, so I thought let's give it a try.  The food here at this restaurant is not good.  Most of the people that are here come from the club, (sapphire) and are intoxicated, so yes, anything is good.  I'm Mexican and I know Mexican food, and this stuff is far from authentic, sorry Paco but your food is very bland and boring.  Never again.  Oh yeah, our bill was $90.00 for (1) queso fundido, (3) beers, (1) margarita, and two enchilada entrees.  Not satisfied at all.  However the service is great.
