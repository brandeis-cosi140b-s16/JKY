So the last 3 times we went to On the Border my husband found metal and a hair in his food. Different locations of course. We had gift cards so we decided to go tonight and take my mom and two boys. The waitress dumped his soda on him, did not get him another until the food came out, messed up his order, then got everyone refills except for him. She didn't come his food, his drink, didn't try to make up for the terrible service. Food pretty good but service was so bad.
