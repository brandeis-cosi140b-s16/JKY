I really do love your food. I had heard that you guys deliver so I googled it and to my excitement yes there was a tweet that said you do indeed deliver.  I went to your website to place my order but couldn't find the delivery option. i tried to create an account but that was a headache because it said I already had one, so I tried to retrieve my password for said account. Your system then said I did not have an account. I created one using another email account. Still no sign of delivery. I finally decided to call. This was a mistake. Daneilla answered the phone. I asked if you delivered she had to ask others if you did or not. The answer is no and said you tried it but it didn't work out. I understand that but why is there still a tweet about it? 
That is what I asked her and yes very frustrated at this point. She said she would let her manager know in a very "dismissive" tone. This made me more frustrated and angry. I just said take the tweet down or let people know you don't deliver, in a gruff tone. She then had a sarcastic tone to her voice and it was rather disrespectful. She could have asked if I wanted to come and pick something up or maybe what would make me happy but she would rather anger a now "non-costumer" more than he already is. As I stated I love your food it's your attitude I can do without.
