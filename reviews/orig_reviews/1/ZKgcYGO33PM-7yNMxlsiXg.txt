I've lived in Vegas for almost 2 months and  I've eaten here a few times. First time delicious. Other times it's been decent. But based on today's visit I will NEVER be back.. 
The service hasn't ever been their strong point but today was a new low. Ixcel was rude and unfriendly. My meal said it came with a drink on the board but she insisted it didn't and made me buy one. 
The food was spilt in my Togo boxes.. It seriously looked like they shook them up before putting it in the bag. The rice was dry and hard. The chips were flimsy and didn't crunch at all when I bit in to one. And to top it all off, my carne asada had a weird smell and a green hue., at least my dog enjoyed breakfast this morning.
