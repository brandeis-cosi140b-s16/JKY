I was excited to try this restaurant after reading the reviews.  Sadly, I was majorly disappointed. We arrived after the lunch crowd, yet had to wait a very long time for our food to arrive. We started with the table side guacamole and the avocado was not ripe enough ... The chicken taco horrible and pumpkin bread pudding too sweet. Do not arrive starving, because the wait staff moves like turtles.  I give this a three at best.  Not worth the $$$
