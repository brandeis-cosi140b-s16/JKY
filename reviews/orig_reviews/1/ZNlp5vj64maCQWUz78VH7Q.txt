The service here is incredibly inept.  Our order was messed up several times and sent back only to be messed up again! A simple taco salad with no tomato turned into an hour long back and forth ordeal. They  left tomatoes on, then we're brought nachos.

Our meat choice in burritos was completely off for the entire table and they took our glasses for refills but didn't return with a refill almost 20 minutes later.

The food was actually tasty when it finally came but not worth the hassle.   Management was in a frenzy trying to fix everything but the chaos continued. 

While tasty, Tequileria tragically tanked this trip.
