I had a really scathing review of this place and the owner emailed me and asked me to take it down, so I am.  But I have to say, I think the food here is dull and tasteless.  I would never go back.  One of my critical remarks about the food in this valley is that many places are dumbed down without heat or flavor.  So maybe this place is just fine for those people who prefer that type of food.
