"Fool me once...shame on...(uhh)...shame on you......(uhhhh).......fool me once you can't get fooled again..." --George W. Bush

12/06/2015:

After several months of blissful dormancy, I was compelled to revisit this "restaurant" by default (my primary choice was closed and I was on a tight schedule)....how do you say regret in Spanish?...oh yeah..."LOS FAVORITOS."

Throughout the duration of my visit, the staff's collective energy was overtly focused on discouraging any potential and/or current customers from firstly, coming inside; and secondly, dining in, in an unrelenting and negligent effort to close 25+ min early.

They shut down the main dining room that includes a majority of all the chairs and tables, in effect, creating an atmosphere of discomfort for the patrons (probably about 8 of us inside), forcing a standing room only type situation (there were only 2 tables in their improvised "waiting room", and about 7-9 tables in the closed section). My food was served in bag (wasn't given option to eat in) to pressure me to leave, and when I sat down to eat, the cashier locked the front door. It was 9:45pm, the posted closing time on the front door stated 10:00pm. So at this point, I was literally locked in, and incoming customers were physically locked out.

So if you want to be treated like a 2nd rate citizen by a 3rd rate staff, visit Los Favoritos within 30 minutes of closing time, especially on a Sunday night....when it comes to being disappointed, you wont be disappointed.

This second chance visit made me feel more foolish than our most foolish President's foolish quote was in regards to be foolish.
