Avoid this place like the plague it's double the price of a regular La Salsa ( they even charge you for chips and salsa really seriously). The waitress barely spoke English and you could hardly understand her. She took the order then she was MIA she never came to check on us. To the extent that we had to get another server to refill our drinks and get the bill. LaSalsa you should be ashamed to be employing such a low caliber of employee!!!
