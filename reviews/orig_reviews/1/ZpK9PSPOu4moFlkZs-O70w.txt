**Summary**
       - Cheap - I love Chipotle, but this location's service and portion size has been dwindling in months past. It's to the point, I'd rather drive an extra 10 minutes when I'm getting a craving for burritos.
       - Strike #1 - Trying to charge me for double meat when I didn't ask for it and they only gave me the normal amount.
       - Strike #2 - Being so cheap with their portion size as compared to other Chipotle's in town.
       - Strike #3 - Treating their customers like criminals when they screw up and order or forget to give you what you ordered.

       - After getting the normal amount of steak I usually get from any other Chipotle, the cashier charges me for double meat.
       - When I told him I didn't order double meat, he had to verify with his staff (since he didn't trust me) and then tell them they'd have to "talk" later.
       - This shows me that they are actively trying to lower the amount of meat per portion.

       - Ordering a steak quesadilla, the amount of steak on there, couldn't even fit half the quesadilla.
       - When they cut it into 4 pieces, there was a 1/4 of the quesadilla that had 2 tiny pieces of meat on it.
       - I ordered a bowl and drinks as well that day. After I paid, I asked the cashier where my drinks were and she told me she gave it to the person I was with, who had walked to the drink area to get napkins.
       - When I looked over and saw this wasn't the case, I told the cashier. The cashier has to walk around the corner and actually visually see she had not given the drinks to us before actually giving me the drinks.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. There are many other Chipotle's around town that don't try to cheat you at every turn.
