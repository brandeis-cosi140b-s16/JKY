Stay away from this place.  Way over priced.  Also, they do false advertising.  On Open Table and Yelp they advertise it as "$$," but average dish is about $30 a dish and more.  I don't mind paying that kind of money, but I expect a clean restaurant, professional waiters, and good food. The carpets had food and trash all over the restaurant even though our reservation was at 7:00 pm.  Our waiter looked unkempt and my daughter had to send back her drink because it did not taste right.  I also expect that a restaurant this expensive would have a restroom!  Yes, this is not a typo.  This restaurant has NO restrooms.  If you want to go to a restroom, you have to walk out of the restaurant, then walk down two flights of stairs, turn left and then walk even more before you find the restroom.  My steak was cold and they left part of our food out and we had to remind them to bring it to us.  Here is another false advertising, they have a picture of skirt steak which is so big that covers from one side of the dish to the other.  But, the one we got was four inches long and looked like less than half of the size of the steak advertised.  Three of us had ordered the skirt steak and we all got the same size steak, which was less than half the size of steak they advertise on Yelp.  There are so many other good restaurants in Vegas - but this is not one if them - not even by a long shot.  Save your money and try a different place!
