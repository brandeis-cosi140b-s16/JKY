Go for the ambiance or the location, but certainly don't go for the food or the service!  We used to come here as a large group for their occasional tequila nights.  I tolerated the extreme price tag and endured the mediocre food because they gave us a private room, had raffles and awards, and the tequila flowed generously.  

However, after three consecutive events where one or more of our group asked us to stop going there (usually because of bad food, bad service, or getting ill from the food), we stopped doing tequila nights.  Since then I have been back twice with other people for lunch. The first time I thought it must have been an off day, I figured they couldn't really be this bad and still be in business.  The second time was my last - they really are this bad. 

I haven't had fast food since 2003, but I'd drive through Taco Bell before I'd sit through a Cantina Laredo lunch.  So, bottom line, if you're just going for friends and drinks, it's a great place.  If you're expecting decent service and tolerable food, look elsewhere.
