Worst customer service I have ever experienced - unfortunate because the food was really good. After the waiter took our order, we never saw him again. Never came over to ask if we needed refills (which is necessary since the food is spicy) and didn't get everything we ordered. Pointed it out to the waiter, but still never got our guacamole and they still tried to charge me for it. Also, my wife had to carry her plate to the cashier just to get her leftovers boxed since the waiter just dropped the check off as he ran by.  If the service was even decent, I would be a frequent customer, but because the service was so bad, I won't go back again.
