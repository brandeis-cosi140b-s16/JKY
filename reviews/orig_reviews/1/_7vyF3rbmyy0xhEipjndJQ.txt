Here was our experience:

1.  Expensive food ~ $14.95 for side of guacamole? 
2.  So-so Margaritas - watered down and hardly a happy hour price at $8.00
3. Bland food - first time EVER added salt to shrimp tacos
4. Good server and nice atmosphere

Prices jacked WAY UP for downtown Summerlin.  Better Mexican at several places nearby.  Sorry to say, it's doubtful we will return or recommend.  Seems other people feel the same according to the reviews.
