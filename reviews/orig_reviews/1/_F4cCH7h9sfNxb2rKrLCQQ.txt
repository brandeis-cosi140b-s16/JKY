Either all these good reviews are bogus or they have gone through a major down grade. Flavorless salsa, stale chips the chilie relleno tasted like a grease soaked sponge the enchilada trio did not have the fillings they stated on the menu.  What else could add to the cold atmosphere than the glare of the sun reflecting off the car windshields in the front parking lot into my eyes at the table. They do deserve one star, the people were nice but the food was the worst I've ever had in a restaurant. Dont waste your time or money. I'm going to Anita's down the street next time
