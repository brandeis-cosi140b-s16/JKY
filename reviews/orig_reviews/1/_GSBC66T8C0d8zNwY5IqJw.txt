I had high hopes for this place. Turns out it's just another expensive casino restraint. The food took almost 20 minutes to come out, with absolutely no check in from the waiter. The waiter was also very short with me. I understand it's a busy place, but I deserve to be able to make adjustments to my food!!!! Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go somewhere with the same generic food but for less the price and less the attitude.
