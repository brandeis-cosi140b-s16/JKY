Lake Las Vegas is a ghost town!   Either way, we were anxious to use our Groupon and try out a new Mexican joint.  We walked in and there were only a handful of people, everyone looked lost.  No one greeted us, we had to walk around until we found anyone working there.  It was just the bartender.  
He was very nice and seemed overwhelmed, even-though he only had two patrons at the bar and two tables in the restaurant area.  He was the only person working.  

The food was disgusting!  We had the sampler so we could try out the place's signature plates; but it tasted like microwave food.  The wings were re-heated and the food left an icky taste in my mouth.  This place could have some potential but they have fallen into the death circle of Lake Las Vegas.  Its no place to visit.  Save your gas money and stay in town.  

How disappointing.  The bartender was super nice and trying, but the food was just plain gross and his margaritas made in a rush.
