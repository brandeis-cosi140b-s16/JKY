I have never received worse service in my life. My two friends and I came around 7 pm. We were not greeted for 10 minutes. When we were greeted we were brought the wrong drinks. We then did not see any server for ten minutes to get the right drinks. When we made our food order I asked for a mild version of the enchiladas due to a stomach issue and the waiter said that could be done. The food did come out in good time but when I got my enchilada it was terribly spicy and overall inedible. 20 minutes later.... when we saw our waitress again I asked her if I could order something else because it was far too spicy and not what I  ordered. She said "its new mexico style- we don't offer a mild version" I told her the waiter should have informed me that when he told me they could make it mild. We were met with a huge eye roll and a firm reach to take my plate. At that time I order chicken floutas instead since nothing else could be made mild. My friend ordered a refill on her drink, something we had not been given all night... it was not busy at all on a Tuesday night! By the time my new plate came out 30 minutes later my friend still had not received her refill. She walked up to the girl who took my order and said Hi do you think I could get my refill on my coke that I ordered and the girl eye rolled again and said "well you didn't order it from me". She brought her a coke and then the check immediately before I even finished eating.  They came back and asked for our payment three times will picking up one thing off the table at a time. More than we had seen them all night! Worst service I have ever had. Terrible wait staff with no customer service experience. The food was decent but the staff needs some training.
