No restaurant is worth the wait they put you through. First 40 minutes. Seemed long but acceptable. Then 20 more. Then 10 more. We've been coming to Rosa's for years -- from Tucson -- but now we are through. There are so many wonderful places that are actually honest with their customers. Not Rosa's. Not anymore.
