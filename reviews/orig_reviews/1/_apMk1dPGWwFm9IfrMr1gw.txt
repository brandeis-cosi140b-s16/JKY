HORRIBLE service. There was only one waiter and he clearly could not manage more than 3 parties at once. He was unable to explain the size difference between an appetizer and entree (later I found out it was because the entrees were smaller portions). I was served a glass with lipstick on it, clearly indicating that my glass was not cleaned. The chips were ok. To top it off, the waiter automatically added the tip into the bill and I had to ask for a receipt where I could adjust the tip. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant due to poor service, price, portion size, and dishonest billing practices.
