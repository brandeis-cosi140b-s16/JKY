I really wish I would have looked at the ratings before coming here.  This place is really really disappointing.  The food was horrible, they don't comp drinks at the bar and it was stupidly over priced for the overall quality.  When I expect to drop a couple hundred on video poker and a couple hundred on dinner I just really kinda expect better quality.  I will never recommend this place and its definitely not going to be one of my regular hangouts.
