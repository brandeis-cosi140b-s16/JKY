Bad choice for a Saturday lunch.  For some reason, we were seated in the bar. No big deal I guess. Server  was not friendly about how she informed us that the cheaper priced margaritas were a pre mix....we wanted a margarita but it was just the way it was presented that made us stick to water. It took forever to get our food. One burrito and a grilled chicken salad. I'm pretty sure she forgot to turn our order in. The part that really ticked me off is that she made no mention of the delta until she brought the check. Service was lousy. I also blame their management for poor training. Food was ok.... Too many Mexican food choices to say that I will be back.
