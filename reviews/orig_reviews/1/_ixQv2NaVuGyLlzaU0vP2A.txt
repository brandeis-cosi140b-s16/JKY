I went today for happy hour, my friends and I were less than happy. We ordered food that never came. I had one happy hour drink and the waitress asked my friend if she wanted another round and walked off without asking me, my drink was empty. Then 30 minutes pass and the server said "oh did you not get your margarita" to my friend. So we both asked for a drink then about another 30 minutes go by before we got our drinks and her response was "I'll make sure you don't get charged double for your drinks". Well I sure hope not! Then about 45 minutes to an hour pass with ZERO service, and another server stopped by asking if we were ready for our check. She cashed us out, we have no idea what happened to our server. One of the worst experiences I've ever had! Other people have told me that the service has become terrible there, but we gave it a shot anyways, bad idea! Myself and my friends all said we will never go back there again!!!
