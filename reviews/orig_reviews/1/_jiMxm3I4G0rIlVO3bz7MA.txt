Had a birthday here and the food was awful either drenched with sauce or the food just tasted gross the portions were even worse especially for the price. I wouldn't recommend it at all if you're looking for food at the Cosmo.  Everyone in the table didnt enjoy the food no one finished anything the only thing worth eating was the chips and salsa.  We all wished we went to the burger joint next to this place I guess lesson learned dont go to a Mexican-Asian fushion restaurant.
