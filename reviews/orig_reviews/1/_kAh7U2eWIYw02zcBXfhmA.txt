I always have a handful of groupons when I go to Vegas to save money and try new places. I regret buying this one. First of all, this is Mexican food you would find in the Midwest. So gross. Just because you put sauce and peppers on everything doesn't make it Mexican food. We had 4 different servers helping us. One came to the table and said "what do you want" Uhhhh ok. Then we paid extra for the guacamole and it was not made fresh at our table. It was frozen and tasted like water. The food was way over priced even for the vegas strip. Who wants to pay $16 for a tiny gross burrito?! And to top it off after being left disappointed and hungry we had to wait 20 minutes for the bill.  I love the flamingo hotel and they needed a younger place like this but they missed the mark this time.
