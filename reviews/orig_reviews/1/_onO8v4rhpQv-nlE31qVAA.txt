This is easily one of the most overpriced bars on the strip. First of all, they charge about $10 to get in. I expect covers at clubs but not at a place like this. Secondly, and this only compounds the problem, is that their drinks are overpriced. This I cannot say is surprising as most bars on the strip are. As far as the bar itself, it's decorated with a sort of hellish theme (kind of similar to that of the whore house from the beetlejuice movie) and they have music and a dance floor which are just okay. It is on the strip so you'll get your usual group of morons that come in. Again some of this stuff should be expected for a bar right on the strip. However, the little amount of people that they manage to get in amuses me because they can likely triple that count if they simply removed the lame cover charge. 

Management, if you're reading this, get your heads out of your asses. If you want to overprice your drinks like most bars on the strip then fine; but stop charging people to get in and maybe you'll actually fill up the joint. Your place can be a lot better if you stop trying to screw people out of their money. I won't be coming back here again until I walk by one day and they no longer charge to get into a bar where I'm already going to spend money.
