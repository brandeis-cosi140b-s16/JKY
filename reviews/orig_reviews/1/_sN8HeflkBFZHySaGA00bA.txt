Well, I would like to write a review based on my experience eating here, but unfortunately that's not possible. We sat at a table for 20 minutes without acknowledgement from any waiter, though there were several working the outdoor area where the unfriendly hostess had seated us. Sadly, we ended up walking out. We won't be back.
