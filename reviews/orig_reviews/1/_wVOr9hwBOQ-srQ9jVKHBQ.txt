Would not even give this restaurant one star! The worst Mexican food I have ever had. The food had absolutely no taste, and the plate was drowning in cheese. Disgusting. Similar to what another reviewer wrote, the beef tastes like the beef from Taco Bell. In fact, Taco Bell has better Mexican food than this restaurant.

The prices are also absolutely ridiculous. Have not seen prices this high in all of Las Vegas. They really need to lower their prices if they expect to have customers!

Lastly, the service was horrible. After taking a drink order or giving us our check, the waiter would disappear for 20 minutes.

Overall, a huge disappointment, and now I have a horrible stomach ache from the disgusting food.

Thanks Coyotes!
