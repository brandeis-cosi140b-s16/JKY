1 star is too much for this place. No flavor, lack of seasoning, & low quality ingredients are the reoccurring theme at this overpriced Resturant .  First off , They charge you for chips n salsa which is free at virtually every Mexican Resturant . The salsa is bland & no flavor.  
The ceviche trio was NOT fresh n we had to send back. The Chef try's to get too creative with his ceviche recipes as one is more disgusting n lacking flavor or seasoning as the next.  Way overpriced fajitas , which once again had zero flavor , no seasoning and very low quality meat (steak). They basically give u about 7-8 pieces of very fatty meat and load up on the vegetables and get u for $18. The chicken quesadilla literally smelled like that stuff u find between ur toes. We basically ate almost nothing and they credited us for most of the food. When the waitress agrees that the quality had gone done hill fast , it's never a good sign. Would never go back even if they comped the entire meal . I'm embarrassed for this place and the Mgr. seems so aloof to the problems . There are way better places to eat in Las Vegas for the same $$ , don't waste ur time n money at this place.
