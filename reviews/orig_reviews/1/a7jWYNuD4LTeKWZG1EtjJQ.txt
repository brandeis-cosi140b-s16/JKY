We will never eat here again.  We tried the enchiladas, carne asada tacos, and the ceviche.  Good grief.  All 3 dishes tasted horrible.  The enchiladas were smothered with a gross chipotle sauce, the carne asada tacos tasted awful, and the ceviche was way too tangy.  

Don't waste your $$$ here.  Save your pesos.  Trust me on this.
