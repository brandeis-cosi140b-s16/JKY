Canned mexican food, taco bell is better.... rice is boxed crap.. salsa bar is weak, canned salsa. Why they have all these high reviews is beyond me. Try it for yourself. But you have been advised to find a better mexican joint... won't be back..   OH, and be sure to try there homemade canned guacamole.. waitres dropped cap from salt shaker on floor, rolled around, picked it up, screwed back onto salt shaker and put back on table, Didnt even bother to wipe it off,  do they wash there hands after using the toilet?
