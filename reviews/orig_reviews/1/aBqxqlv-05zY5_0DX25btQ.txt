Who charges hot sauce at a Mexican restaurant? Apparently El Hefe does and didn't even bother to be up front about it. We ordered tacos and asked for hot sauce, so the waitress asked us if we wanted "Pico De Gallo, Salsa Verde or Salsa roja". So we said bring all three. When we got our bill she charges us a $1 each for the little salsa she brought out. If she informed us about charging us then we might as well got the chips and salsa for $3 that already comes with the 3 salsas.  

Also, our tacos were cold by the time she brought them out and service was slow when we asked for our check. Not sure why it was slow because it was only my party of 4 and a couple that were the only ones in there other the the 4 other people at the bar, so we wrote a note why we only gave 10% tip. 

However, we passed by again at night and it loooked poppin!! The nightlife here is probably the spot for this place because dining in during the day was not the business.
