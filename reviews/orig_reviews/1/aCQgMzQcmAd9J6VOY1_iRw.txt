I decided to give this place a try since it had good reviews, though my experience was far from good. The waitress was extremely rude and didn't seem to care about providing any type of customer service. The food was not good at all and when I expressed to the them that I didn't like it they basically looked as if to say "oh well" 
I will not be returning and would not recommend.
