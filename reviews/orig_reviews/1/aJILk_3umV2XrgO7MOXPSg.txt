Starting with waiting 5 minutes while the hostesses (yes, 4 of them) did nothing and didn't acknowledge us, I figured it wasn't going to be good. Gave number for them to text me when table was ready, they said 20 mins, but restaurant was empty. Then we got a beer at the bar, went back to the front to wait, they then sat 3 couples who just walked in, guy said he texted me, he lied, they did not. Finally got seated, waited 15 minutes or so for waiter. Then 15 more minutes for a beer. Ordered, her food came out 15 minutes before mine. Food was very mediocre. Chips and salsa actually are an extra cost, and the salsa they give you is about half an ounce. We will never go back.
