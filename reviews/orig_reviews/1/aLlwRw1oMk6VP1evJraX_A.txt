Worst bar concept ever.  No matter what drink you order be prepared for it to come in a plastic red cup. The gimmick is wasteful and pointless.  The bar doesn't provide for recycling even though the hundreds of plastic cups it throws out everyday are marked for recycling.  This place needs to get over the "red cup" trend and get into the now.  Very disappointed in the cliche.  Thankfully there are a couple other more respectable bars just a five minute walk away.
