What a disappointment this place is!   We experienced horribly apathetically lackluster service.  It took a long time for the waiter just to acknowledge us,  then, he took our drink order.   Took him about 15 minutes to come back with two drinks:  a weak, flat tasting rum and coke and an incorrectly poured, not very cold Sam Adams (it was half head.. of course by the time the waiter came back I'd drank almost all of it!).   Overall, from the time that we were seated until we received our food it was 50 minutes.  And, the dining room was at about 1/4 capacity.   The employees were milling about.. not serving the patrons.   
Our food was average.  Honestly, not a giant leap above Roberto's.  I think the service is better at Roberto's.  
Then, our check arrived.  It was incorrect.  They had added on an erroneous $2.50.  It took the bumbling staff members about 15 minutes to figure out that their cash register was (allegedly) malfunctioning.   

Ugh.  Skip this place.  You are almost better off going to Del Taco!  Seriously.
