I keep trying to like this place but third time is not the charm.  We went Saturday night and the security guard was training a new welcomer and he literally said "this is how you do it" when my friends and I came to the front of the line.  He pulled one of my friends out to the side and and started asking him questions.  Then informed us we could not go in because he was intoxicated.  We told the security multiple times that our friend has a lazy eye and just looks like this normally.  They are rediculous.  Dont waste your time for overpriced drinks and a small dance floor.
