Go to another location! Do not go here! I live right around the corner a will be not coming back. The service at this place has taken a huge dive and is not getting any better. I have just picked up my "to go" order which again was wrong, then I ask that them to remake and the attitude I was given was horrible! So sorry to have you create the CORRECT order. The food is great and the service is the worst.
