My family used to come here a lot when i was growing up, but we quit coming a few years ago. I recently come to visit my parents in Phoenix so we came back to try it out.

We were sure sorry we did. Hands down the most aweful margarita i have had in my life. The food and service were just as aweful.

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are a ton of awesome restaurants in Phoenix. Go somewhere else.
