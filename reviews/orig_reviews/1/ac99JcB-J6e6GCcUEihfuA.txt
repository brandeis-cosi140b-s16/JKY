This was a total dissapointment.....met with friend for dinner tonight at the Mesa location. First visit to Los dos for all 5 of us.  The host seated us and I'm not really sure it's a good position for him to be in. Odd sense of humor  and pretty off-putting.  Tried the salsa- very spicy, and read the menu to discover EVERYTHING except the flautas and may 1 o4 2 more items were NOT spicy. Decided most of our group didn't like their food that hot, so we decided we'd pay for our 2 margaritas and appetizers (2 orders of jalapeno poppers @4.50 each0 and our bill was $36. Seemed pretty pricy to me for what we got, although the attitude from the host/waiter was free and worth less, that was when he realized we weren't eating dinner there. Very unprofessional.  SO we headed up the road to Macayo's and had great service, delicious food  and a great atmosphere. BTW my dinner and beverage at Macayo's came to just under $20 dollars including tip!  Now that's what I call value!
