Food Poisoning. I used to love this place. Perhaps their good reputation made them complacent? Perhaps there are too many items on the menu (over 100!) for them all to be made fresh? Whatever the case, I ordered my favorite, Beef Mole Enchiladas, the center was a bit cool, but I plowed through it. Also had the fried ice cream- this was pre made, not fresh, horrible, this tasted old. I awoke at 3 AM shivering with flu-like symptoms. It gets R rated for horror from there. Never again.
