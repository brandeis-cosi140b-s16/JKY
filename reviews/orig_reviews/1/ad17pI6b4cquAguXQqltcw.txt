Sorry. I wanted to like the place but couldn't. On the cab ride the cabbie (who is by the way a retired NYPD lieutenant working 4 days a week now making $80+G/yr) gave us a small warning but it was too late to change our reservations. 

There were 6 of us. The nice waitress gave us the rundown on the place; its background, its fresh and organic use of ingredients and its distilled and filtered water. Hmmm. We ordered the guac. It was delicious but the chips were delayed. After her recommendation we ordered the whole snapper Veracruz. Fried fish in a sauce with olives, tomatoes, peppers. It was "ok". I've eaten whole fried fish before and I was underwhelmed esp since she talked it up so much. My friend ordered rice, which was not on the menu and it was dry and horrible. Like it had been sitting there forever. He had to send it back. 

We inquired about the ceviche bar. The waitress said the hostess must've forgotten to give us the extra menu. We had already ordered because we had a show to catch. But afterwards she brought us the menu and there were a few things that we wanted from, including the ceviche and some special tacos. Annoying.

I was disappointed with my braised short rib tacos. Despite the sauce they seemed dry. There weren't very many people dining. Not a lively atmosphere. Decor was lab and dark. And the waitress was not very attentive. 

When we walked out to catch our show I saw the celebrity chef's pictures. Mary Sue milliken and Susan feniger. I loved them on top chef masters. Top chef is the only show I regularly watched. I can't believe they would put their names behind this type of poor quality. So disappointed.
