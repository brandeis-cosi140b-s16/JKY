They have done more to piss people off with a Groupon they don't honor.  Would have been better off not having a Groupon.  We only had 3 people instead of 4 so they refused to honor the Groupon.  Hello people, 3 would eat less and it would cost you less.  Rude manager!  Offered to give me $30 I paid not $60 value.  We left and I will get a refund from Groupon.  Talk about bait and switch!!!!  Plus they have way too many table shoved together, felt like I was sitting with the people next to me.
