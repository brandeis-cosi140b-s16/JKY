Ok, so......got invited to the play day when they first opened. Which is usually comped, dropped a $250 tab, which is fine.....except the service was horrible and it took 45 min for ceviche, which came out hot because I assume someone left it under the headlamp? Fast forward 2 days, they had a glitch with the POS system and I got charged 12 times! Totally well over $2,000 which prompted chase fraud alert to lock out my account, 2 days later la comida finally put the money back in my account, but still retained the $250. I called to complain, not even a apology ? Ok so that was a while ago, I was over it! Until today! Lunch? Never going back.....ever! Which sucks because I live downtown and it's walking distance to my building. 

Service: deplorable, took 45 min. For 3 tacos, and got the wrong tacos.

Food: wrong tacos......sent them back and waited another 15 min. For new ones....they might have been good but i wasn't in the mood at that point. 

Same as before, did the employee even apologize? No did a manager stop by? No 

I know this is not how the owner runs his business! La cave and crush are on point! 5 stars in all areas! What's up with la
Comida?
