Just save yourself that time and money and go to Chipotle! The service here was so bad and the food was, at best, mediocre. The salsa lacked in flavor and the rice was painfully undercooked. We dined in and not once did anyone come out a clean off the tables. This establishment is a dump and I would be ok with never setting foot in this place ever again.
