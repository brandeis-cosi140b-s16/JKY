Don't come here with a party larger than 5. We were here for a dinner, with a party of 15. We arrived here at 7pm were sat, and our waiter took care of our drinks. Unfortunately, I believe it was also our waiters first table of a vast size. After sitting for about an hour, our meal orders were taken, and they came out in a greater than timely manner. Then we ate.....and played the waiting game. Our poor waiter was left to himself to divy up the checks (spilt between 5, all seated in order and not changing). He came back with our checks, which were not split correctly, besides one couples. Then, that couple paid (over $100), and the manger came and said it was confusing and wanted to split the rest of the check between everyone, at $25 each. This did not appease anyone, especially the people whose meals were less than $10. Finally, after about 45 minutes of trying to figure this out, the manager FINALLY came out and made us retell our orders one by one. This was a whole ordeal at a table full of previous servers that could have been easily avoided. 

Additionally, the food, it was just sub-par (will give props to the table side guacamole). 

Overall, there are plenty of different restaurants in this complex or other Mexican restaurants in the area to satisfy your craving.
