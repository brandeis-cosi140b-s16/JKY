This place deserves a minus star, however, Yelp doesn't provide a score lower than ONE.  

The food is mediocre, the service is the worst I've ever seen!  When the waiter/server screws up your order, they blame YOU and in so many words call you a liar for their mistake.  

Don't bother calling the manager - he has NO Customer Skills whatsoever!

I'd rather eat at Taco Bell than to eat at this location!  In the event Arriba decides to relocate the manager at this location, beware!  The manager's last name begins with a "G" (in case Yelp doesn't allow publication of names).
