I spent $34.00 for pick up..two lunches. I paid extra for a dinner size of rice & beans. What I got were portions for an infant. This is not the first time, but is the last. The food is not bad but was cold..like really cold. No plates, forks or napkins and every thing is wrapped in tin so I couldn't microwave. Plate would help. Im not going here anymore. Very $$$$$
