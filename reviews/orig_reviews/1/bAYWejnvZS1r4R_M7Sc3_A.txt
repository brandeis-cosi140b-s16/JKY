I know Airport places are generally overpriced but I think that for: a beer, a cocktail and a plate of nachos 45 dollar is way too much...
ah ...without mention that we waited almost half an hour...that's unacceptable on an airport location...we had to ask to put the nachos on the to go box...
The waitress was very kind but, I am sorry, if you can, don't go there!
