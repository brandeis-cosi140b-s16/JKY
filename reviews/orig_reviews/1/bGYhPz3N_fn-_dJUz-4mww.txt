Extremely disappointed!! I have gone to the Henderson location countless times and unfortunately the Sahara location falls way short. I paid $17 for shrimp nachos, but really received a box of chips with 6 medium shrimp. Being that I purchased 3 total for $52.00 we were very disappointed. With cafe rio,chipotle and Roberto's in the area those are all better choices than nacho daddy in terms of portion and quality.
