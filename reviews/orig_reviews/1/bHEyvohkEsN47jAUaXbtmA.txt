I'm not sure if I came here on a bad night but the food was so bad! I ordered the two taco combination plate. The tacos were "ground beef" which I didn't mind until it looked like the nasty consistency of baby food mixed with whatever Jack in the box puts in the tacos. My husband ordered a bean chimichanga and the beans were so bland and the tortilla was soggy and not crispy at all. The rice was super bland and had no flavor. The salsa was weird. It had a strange smokiness to it which I wasn't expecting. Even the chips was bland! I'm not sure what the heck was going on tonight as my husband and I chose this restaurant to try based on Yelp reviews and pictures posted. The food was so bad that I can't even go back and give it another chance.
