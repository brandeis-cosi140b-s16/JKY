What happened?!?!? This use to be my favorite Mexican spot near campus, but apparently it's heading downhill fast.  Went in for a quick bite around 8, the restaurant was almost empty, but the three servers still seemed way to busy to be bothered with my order.  Ten minutes to take an order is ridiculous.  Once my food finally hit the table, it was another 12 mins before I found the bus boy to track down my server because my order was wrong.  The food is consistently average, but the service is just awful right now.
