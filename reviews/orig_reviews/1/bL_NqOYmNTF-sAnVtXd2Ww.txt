This place has really gone down hill.

I had eaten here a few times and thought it was pretty good. Then we went for lunch and it was  incredibly busy one time we went for lunch with a 40 min wait so we decided to leave.   We went back a week or so later for dinner.  We had an incredibly long wait in the bar that seemed  to last forever even though there seemed to be plenty of tables on the patio.

They sat us inside in a very small room sandwiched in-between the kitchen and 3 large groups of very loud annoying people. There was only 2 of us not sure why were were relegated to such a terrible table.  Our food tasted terrible, oily, and the vegetables in my burrito were undercooked.  We didn't finish our dinner, paid and left.
I have a pretty strong stomach, but both of us got extremely sick from the food after we left. 

If you have to go here make sure you sit outside so you don;t get stuck in one the terrible side room.
