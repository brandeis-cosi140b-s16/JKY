My god. This is the worst restaurant in the strip. The worst restaurant I tried in 2014. You get the idea. It exemplifies why fusion food is sometimes a bad idea. We arrived in a group of 10 and shared a lot of food. Every time I took a bite, I instantly thought of some place where the dish is so much better. $6 taco? Even the $1.50 ones from the taco truck from the ghetto are so much better. The noodle dishes are an embarrassment to the Chinese. Save your money!!
