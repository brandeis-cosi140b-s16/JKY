I'm not even going to comment on the quality of the food because I always leave dissatisfied because of the horrible service. I have been here many many times and not once have I gotten decent service, especially at the register. They are all rude and slow and don't really care at all about their customers. All the workers are lazy and look like they hate their lives and take it out on their customers!
