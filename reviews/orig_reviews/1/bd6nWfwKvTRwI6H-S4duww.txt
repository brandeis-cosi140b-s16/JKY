The food is decent no doubt and when you dine in service is excellent. But if you order tacos to go beware. Not that Arizona is cold but in the winter it can get quite chilly outside. I went inside and one girl was nice and was going to get my food after I nodded yes it was cold outside but the other was like I'll meet you outside . Okay fine at least it's was sunny today. I ordered the chicken burrito and a taco. I asked for salsa since it was  a Mexican restaurant and I solely come for the salsa it's arizona there's Mexican food everywhere and was made to feel like I was inconveniencing her. Also she had inadequate knowledge of the salsa because what she gave me was incorrect. I asked for the spicy salsa and was given some green chili in a to go cup.  While I may dine in I will not order to go from barrio queen again the side taco shop is a bad joke that will make you regret your decision to have tacos unless you hate salsa
