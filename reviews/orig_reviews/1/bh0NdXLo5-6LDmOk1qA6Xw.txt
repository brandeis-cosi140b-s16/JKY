Signs all over the casino saying 'Happy Hour extended until further notice', but our waitress tells us at 6:15 PM that management is not doing it tonight.. ummmm?!

The food is way over priced for average dishes.  The chips for our chips and salsa appetizer came in a paper bag, and when they were gone nobody refilled.

Waitress brought us only two waters when there was three of us, and we had to ask her to bring the missing water.  Took forever to get the bill, refills, anything really.  Very poor service.
