In 2013 we were there a few times. We really liked the Fajitas with lots of meat, onions and paprika. When we returned this year we were really disappointed. In the pan were 5 small slices of beef and a few onions. No comparison to 2013. And we were really shocked when we got the check. 80$ for the two Fajita meals and two bottles Corona (8$ each), tip included. Just for comparison: we eat with two persons in the Cheesecake Factory for about 40-50$!
But the food in the Cantina isn't worth the money.
