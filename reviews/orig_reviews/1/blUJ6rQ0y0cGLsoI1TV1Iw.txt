I wish i could give this place negative stars.  The food was average at best.  I would have been better off walking across the street to Del Taco.  At least there I would not be served with the attitude of the server at Mercaditio.

My wife and I thought it would be a great idea to try this place.  I wish we would have stayed home.  we started the evening with an annoying uneven  table that ended up spilling my drink.  STRIKE #1

Next, my wife was encouraged to order a, supposed prize winning, pre-made margarita.  It was horrible.  we have gotten better margaritas at an Irish Pub down the street.  STRIKE #2

Then, we ordered.  Bad call on our behalf.  the food was average at best.  Like I said before, we should have gone to Del Taco.  We asked the waitress for more chips and she stated that there were only crumbs left and that there were none available.  Call me crazy, but i was under the impression that the chips were made there.  I guess this Mexican restaurant happened too run out of tortillas as well.  STRIKE #3


The list goes on... and on.....

As a long time Summerlin resident,  I will actually stick with the restaurants in town that serve good food without attitude.


The only saving grace about Mercadito is that it will serve as a great butt to many jokes amongst the 200+ residents that I will be attending a banquet with tonight.

Note to Spencer Campbell the manager of this sub-par eatery:  if your staff treats locals  this way, I would hate to see how they  treat tourists.  Thankfully, myself, my family, my friends, acquaintances, and associates  will stick to the Yardhouse on our biweekly visit to Red Rock Casino.
