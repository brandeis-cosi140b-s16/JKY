NOT GOOD. with so many other options in town, there is no reason to eat at Macayo's. I understand that this restaurant caters to folks looking for a Tex-Mex style food. What I don't understand is how it can be so below average. They cover all of their food in cheese whiz (gross). I have been informed that Macayo's is a local favorite, and has been serving Las Vegas for years. It's time to move on people.
