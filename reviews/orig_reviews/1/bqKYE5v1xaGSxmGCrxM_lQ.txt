If you like Mexican food or any food at all, skip this place. It's that bad. The absolute worst I've ever had. I didn't even eat it and the margarita was horrible too. It said it had muddled jalapeno but came with cut up jalapeno instead. It tasted freezer burnt. The rice was undercooked and tasted like something you get in a pouch for 79Â¢ at the grocery store. Taco, terrible. Beans, terrible. Guacamole looked and tasted like what is premade in the cold case at the grocery. Even just after a bite of each, my stomach hurt so bad. 
I'll never go again.
