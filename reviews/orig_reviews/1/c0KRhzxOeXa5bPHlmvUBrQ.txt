The food is decent. The service at the bar is HORRIBLE WITH LORI. she is not very friendly. Most bartenders are friendly and I've never met one like her. I had her before and thought maybe she was just having a bad day, but NOPE! I  also seen her engage with another customer and they looked unhappy and she wasn't accommodating to the request at all. They seemed pretty upset and I overheard her response and it was not friendly at all. Lori SMILE MORE, BE MORE FRIENDLY TO ALL CUSTOMERS PLEASE
