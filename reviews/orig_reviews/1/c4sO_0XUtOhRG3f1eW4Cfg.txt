I'd give it negative stars if it was possible. We made reservations for 30 people and they set aside the bar area for 10 people for us and the owner/manager was very rude to us when we questioned how they expected 30 of us to sit there. They eventually got us seated and the service from the staff was amazing. Then they decided to add 17% to everyone's bill which is okay for a group. But two of us who had $6 drinks had bills for over $10. That's like 66% not 17%. We questioned the owner / manager and he was very rude. We said we would go on Yelp and he said, "Do you want your ass beat?" Like seriously?! He almost got his ass beat.
