I came to this place as my husband had said heard food was good. It was Saturday night, dinner time. When my daughter and I came in, it was confusing. This was our first time, so I had to ask the cashier what to do. To his left was a burrito maker, similar to Chipotle, but to the right upper area was a list of items divided into line 1, line 2, line 3. Some people were there with trays. I was still confused. So I decided maybe I'll just order the burrito, someone was ordering in front of me, it seemed the easiest. While I was waiting for my turn behind this tall man, people with trays from line 1, 2 and 3, just went to the burrito counter with their trays that had tacos. They evidently also wanted burritos, but just blatantly went in front of me when it was clearly my turn. I go to the cashier again and complain telling him this process is so confusing why are they doing that. He mumbled something saying maybe he should put a sign. I left without ordering.
Attention management: Please send me a response once you change the ordering process. If you read yelp you will see that people are complaining about the ordering process. Fix it and who knows I might come back. I know people who go there for the first time will complain and tell others. Even if you've been there before it is still confusing as there are no definite lines and by the time people at the taco line go to order a burrito, yes their food is cold, as one person who wrote in yelp said. Please fix the ordering process. Thank you.
I can't review the food yet, as I left very disappointed.
