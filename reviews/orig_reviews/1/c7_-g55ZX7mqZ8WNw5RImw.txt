Seriously this is possibly the worst breakfast burrito I have ever had! I ordered a breakfast burrito to go and when I asked for extra hot sauce I got a huge attitude but, that aside I was excited to try it out. It looked like it would be pretty authentic . I came in and cut it in half only to discover mashed potatoes drenched in butter, the egg didn't look like egg and the salsa was horrible. Maybe that's not there specialty but, I'm not going to go back. I had to toss my burrito!
