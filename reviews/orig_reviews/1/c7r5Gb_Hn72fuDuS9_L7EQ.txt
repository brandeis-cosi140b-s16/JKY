The service was anything but.  Service? Is that what these folks call what there hourly workers provide?  It was more like "I'm here where's my money".  The food? Cold, dry chicken that was prepared earlier in the week and likely not at this location.  Fish tacos? No, that is the simplest and nicest way to say it.  One more thing, casadeis were cold, appeared to be made in a microwave and minimal.  Then I get the bill...  $12.00 for what should have been a $3.00 casadei.  No that was not a question.  Places like this have no business being in business and are the best reason I know to stay home.
