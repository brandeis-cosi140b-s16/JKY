Well let me just say what a challenge it was to get food there because we did not get any we sat down we told them we were extremely hungry so they brought us a bag of crackers we ordered the clam chowder and a turkey burger 40 minutes later they explained to us they had forgotten to put our order in and they were willing to buy us two beers terrible and believable we left did not even drink the beer we are still hungry in Vegas
