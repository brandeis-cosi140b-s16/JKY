1 star an only because 0 isn't available. Back again, for more punishment. GOD I can't wait for a better place to open nearby. There is nowhere else to go nearby so we have to come here out of lack of options. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. Food is good, patio is nice, service is atrocious! How the servers will drop something off at one table and not even address the new table who just sat next to it is unbelievable! HORRIBLE SERVICE!
