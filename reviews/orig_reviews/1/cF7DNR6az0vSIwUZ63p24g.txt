Every time I come here I get some bullshit problem, I don't understand why I continue to give chances. I placed an online order and came in exactly at my pick-up time to find noone ever saw the ticket print and never prepared my order, meanwhile the couple in front of me has now ordered just about everything off the menu and almost all the meat is gone. Since they hadn't even begun to make my order I asked for black beans and rice vs the double beans I accidentally selected. If I hadn't rushed to the guy making the food it wouldn't have had either because the cashier didn't remember and would rather the order be wrong than ask me again. I also asked for NO  cilantro on my salad order and without fail there was cilantro scattered all over. I have come to this location several times and have never had a smooth ride, there have always been issues or attitude problems. This time I am done. Save yourself what time you can; speak clearly and watch them like a hawk.
