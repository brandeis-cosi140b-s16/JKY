I'm not sure where all these 5-star reviews for Border Grill are coming from with words like "yummy" and "delish" liberally sprinkled throughout. I was taken to dinner at Border this evening and the experience was miserable. 

While the service was good, the restaurant was so dark in the dining area it was difficult to see or read the menu. The drinks available are very high-priced and were small. The cheapest margarita was $11.  The food was not much better than a frozen Mexican entree you can buy at any grocery, in fact, the frozen food would probably be better as well as cheaper. Chips were provided, unheated and accompanied by three of the smallest portions of different salsas I've ever seen. 

I had the "famous" Yucatan pork with a mess of stuff hidden under a pile of lukewarm greasy meat. The carmelized plantains promised amounted to two small slices of plantain that were cold and had the texture and appearance of hockey pucks. There were a few other things on the plate, all cold. No one at the table received hot food. The impression was that all the orders were simply pulled from a steam table and thrown on the plates. My dining companion had a quesadilla which appeared to not have been grilled. It was the Market fresh something or other, a cold and dry flour tortilla with some suspicious looking vegetable matter inside. It was so dark you couldn't really tell what was going on. Not one person out of four ate more than a fraction of the food. No one asked to take the leftovers home. The bill was outrageous for what was served. We won't be going back, especially when one considers the number of really excellent authentic Mexican restaurants available here in Vegas. 

Border Grill is just another high-priced tacky tourist spot among many others at Mandalay Bay. No real flavor and too much "Top Chef" showing off by using ingredients not suited to Mexican cuisine. Feta cheese on tacos?  Avoid and spend less money for much better food elsewhere.
