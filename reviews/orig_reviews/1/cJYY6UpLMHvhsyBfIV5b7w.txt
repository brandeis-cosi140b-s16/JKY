Possibly the worst service I've ever received, which is surprising given the incredible number of humans walking around that really appear to work here despite the glazed over looks in their eyes and lack of any kind of attempt to offer service.  I sat at a table with an empty drink gor 30 minutes and nobody ever game over to see how we were doing.  The young cocktail waitresses are just walking around slowly, taking breaks to chat with one another... not making any eye contact and having no sense of urgency.  I will never come back here.
