I posted a quick tip while I was there today but for some reason that doesn't show up on the Yelp website. WTF? Any how.. I kindly asked the bartender if she could put the golf on the TV today.. seeing as how we were the only people at the bar I figured this would not be an issue. It turns out all TV's in the entire restaurant are controlled by 1 DirectTV box and it was "first come first served" when it came to the channel that was on. She asked her fellow employees if anyone was watching the basketball game and 3 waiters responded "yes". It turns out it was the wait staff that was watching the game rather than catering to their customers and she said she couldn't change it. This is not the first time I have had HORRIBLE customer service at this place. It's a shame too because I like their crappy Mexican food and home brewed beer but with attitudes like that it's no wonder they have only 2 1/2 stars. How do you turn away customers and money just because the lazy ass wait staff wants to watch basketball? Never ever will go there again. P.S. Why does the logo show a chili that's farting? Might want to hire a real graphic designer like myself next time.
