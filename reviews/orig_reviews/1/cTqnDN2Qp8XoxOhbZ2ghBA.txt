Just witnessed a few Duck Dynasty looking bikers wielding foot long army knives reach over the bar, grabbed bottles of alcohol, and walked out.  But it gets better...they walked back in, sit down at the bar, and are getting served shots.

With 1 waitress, 1 female bartender, and 1 bus boy manning shop, not sure if they saw it or just ignoring it.

Either way, I would not recommend bringing your kids or date here. 

On the food:
Braised oxtail is good

Scallops so-so

Seared prawns were sent back as all of them were mushy and rotting.  Even the Buser said it stinks when he took it away

This place doesn't seem like it would be around after another few months
