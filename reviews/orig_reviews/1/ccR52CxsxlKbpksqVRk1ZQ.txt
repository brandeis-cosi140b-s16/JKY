After about 6 Sunday football games they discontinued their Football program where each week if you go you get free things, leading up to a Free Happy Hour with up to 20 friends.  3 of us were dedicated and going every Sunday dropping $50 to $100 bux each time, while suffering through HORRIBLE service, dirty conditions, a management that could give a shit less.  They obviously are focused on the night life crowds and not the daytime.  They old us on either the 6th or 7th visit when we whipped our cards out  and it was time for a free T-Shirt the bartender said "we quit doing those" and then the manager came over.  He promised that he would figure out something for us since we were loyal customer for the past weeks, he did pick up our drinks (1 each) and if I didn't have anywhere to be later that day I would have sat and drank all day on his tab.  None of us have ever heard back from anyone at El Hefe, let alone from JUSTIN (the manager) who promised us he would get back to us.  I will NEVER EVER step foot in this bar again.  Save yourself time and walk down to Majerie's, you won't regret it.
