i've been going to canteen for 3 years now. recently they introduced the 10$ minimum on credit/debit cards. however, i honestly forgot my card at canteen yesterday  while bar hopping on mill and when i went back to get my card, i saw a $6.00 charge. when i questioned the charge, both the bartenders at the back bar and the manager say " im sorry but thats a credit card charge because its a $10 minimum we cant do anything about that sorry". i tried to reason with them saying "im sorry i did not know, but ive been coming here for 3 years now", however, both the bartenders respond "im sorry honey, but the $10 minimum has been going on since we opened". i tip very well when i am at canteen at over %25, but i guess non of them care. the manager just stood next to me  without saying a word just looking at me. he goes "sorry, this is how it is". my advice is go to canteen to have a good time, but please please please do not buy a drink at all. they will rip you off, go to cue club across the street to buy a drink (5$ long islands). canteen is trying to take advantage of robbie's not getting any business.
