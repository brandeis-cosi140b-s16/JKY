This review is difficult given the fact that I am from Texas and consider myself a pretty harsh judge of good mexican food. Having said that, this place really did not fit the bill. I was excited as the restaurant had come recommended by friends that thought that I would like it. I ordered a margarita, the salsa sampler, and the four moles. The salsas (casera and chipotle) were interesting, not in a good way. The chipotle salsa was thick and almost creamy, not what I would typically eat with a corn chip. The flavor was so dense, it was hard to eat. The four moles were unfortunately a huge let down, which made me upset because I love a good mole! All of my food came out cold. The mole poblano had very little taste, the tomatillo mole was extremely runny and just tasted of tomatillos without any spice or extra flavor, and the guisado de pollo was just seasoning, not a sauce. The only redeeming part of the plate was the adobo mole. The meat was tender and juicy and the mole was well seasoned. The margarita was just okay.
I was so excited for good mexican food here in Pittsburgh; however Casa Reyna left a lot to be desired.
