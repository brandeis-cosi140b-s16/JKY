Over charged!! 7 dollars extra for pork belly instead of beef, when the plate itself is 10 dollars!!! Dingy dirty place!!! Cheaper at a nice korean or mexican resturaunt... should not call this place korean or mexican food its a really bad version on both! Nothing authentic nor fusion about it!! Not going back
