Gringo Tourist Food.
This is the kind of ethnic food where the people working there must be laughing behind our backs that we are actually eating this slop.
The "salsa" is mostly just canned tomatoes.
The tamales were so bland that only a heathy dose of Tapatio could bale them out.
In this stingy joint you have to ask for hot sauce since none is on the table.
The stringy beef and pork had all the flavor cooked out of it.
The rice was of course dried out and the beans forgettable.
The crunchy tacos came on a shell that's exactly the same as the ones in the yellow Old El Paso taco kit.
With so many wonderful and authentic Mexican restaurants that celebrate the heritage of that country it's a crime to eat here.
