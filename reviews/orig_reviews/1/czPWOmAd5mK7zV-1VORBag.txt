There are 2 separate menus: the one they post and the one in the system. You can't order from either. 
I watched a lady ask for salsa and she was told she would have to order a combo meal if she wanted salsa because salsa was not in the system. 
I ordered a chicken burrito, the ticket said chicken enchiladas, and the manager from Starbucks had to come over and help explain what the difference was to the chef. 
I came for the food, stayed for the tragedy.
