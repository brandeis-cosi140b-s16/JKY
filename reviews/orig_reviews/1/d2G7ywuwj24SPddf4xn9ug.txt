i was charged a $20 cover to walk in the door and sit at at a table with my friends, which was the first, and last time i will ever be coming here and i will NOT be recommending this establishment to ANYONE i know. as a local, i have a LOT of other places that i can (and would rather) spend my time and my money. have fun jerking around the tourists

for the sake of clarification, after a certain time at night, they turn the place into a "club" and as a result, they shut down the kitchen, and start charging a cover. my friends had arrived before that time cutoff, and they wouldn't use any common sense about me being able to come in and sit at a table, full of people, one of which came up to greet me at the desk.. and the guy that was working security was only succeeding in agitating me further. and would have rather had me trespassed and bounced out as opposed to try and resolve the situation respectfully and calmly. i wasn't acting like a "tough guy" about it, i was acting like someone who was just told he had to pay $20 to sit at a table 10 feet from the door, and the chump working security decided that intimidation was a MUCH better way to get my compliance about the cover.. 

the waiter we had was a very nice guy, with what little service he could provide due to the fact they had switched over to "club" mode. i couldn't even get an iced tea. but the guy got me a pitcher and left it at the table for me to drink


update as of 6/28, i emailed the light group representative that responded on 12/20/14, as yet i still have never heard back from this individual, i identified myself in the email and asked what further information they needed from me, and never heard another word, i would drop them to 0 stars for lack of follow through if i could go that low.. 
so nice job trying to put on that public face of "lets fix it", it makes you guys look like your trying to correct the problem, when you actually arent doing anything
