It's upsetting that I have to give one star to this place because I really love the food but my feelings changed yesterday when me and my fianc√© tried to eat there on st Patrick's day but they had their doors locked and didn't let us in. I can understand that there were a lot of drunk idiots that day and probably got annoyed but just because we were wearing green doesn't mean we were drunk idiots. We came all the way from Baltimore Maryland to come to eat at yo Rita's and this is how we get treated we kept knocking and calling the restaurant to let us in and they completely ignored us. Very upsetting and I will tell everyone I know not to come here anymore besides kaya has better fish tacos anyway and they don't discriminate !
