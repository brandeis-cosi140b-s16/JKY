BEWARE: They over charge!!! We ordered a total of 3 of their $3 margaritas during happy hour and were charged $15.98 ($7.99 x 2)  for 2 of them and $5 for 1. How did we get charged 2 different prices for the exact same margarita? All the guy could tell us was that it wasn't a 10oz pour? Excuse me! We first ordered 2 of the $3 margaritas. Then I had a 2nd one and my husband ordered a beer. They refused to even correct the problem even though it wasn't our fault. We specifically ordered "2 of the $3 margaritas, please." 

NOT TO MENTION the fact that we waited over 10 minutes for them to even greet us after being sat at the table. The place wasn't even busy! We sat on the bar side on a Saturday night (Aug. 8, 2015). Only 5 tables were occupied at 7pm. Should have been a warning!

We ordered our food and were tended to by 4 different people that night. Not sure who was our waiter! When I ordered off of the 3-course menu I was told that I could not take off the nasty red sauce in exchange for green. It says on the menu that you can't substitute anything, but it's just sauce that I didn't want. Didn't think that I was breaking any rules by asking for green sauce instead of red sauce. Unbelievable! For the record, I was sick after eating the red sauce and sick to my stomach the next day. 

If you want a bad experience, poor service, food that tastes like metal, and to be over charged come to Macayo's Depot Cantina! I'm sure it will be a meal that you never forget! 

WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!! Much better places to eat than this place.
