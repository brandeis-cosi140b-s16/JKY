I've been here three times. The first two times I had nachos which were ok. This third time we had a real meal and it was not good. The carne asada tacos tasted like I was eating a beef dip sandwich in a tortilla. The service was slow and I only counted 5 tables with people and 3 servers. Bummer. I like a good Mexican place and Carlos and Charlie's does not deliver.
