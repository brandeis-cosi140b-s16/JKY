20$ cover on Saturday Latin night. Went upstairs bar for a frozen drink, they didn't have them available upstairs and was sent downstairs for a frozen drink. Spent 40$ on my drink then was told to go back in the line to get back up stairs. Once in line and talked to the door guy I was notified that I couldn't go back upstairs with my frozen drinks that I had just purchased downstairs. Was extremely upset bc i was there for a birthday party. For a $20 cover, and to spend 60$ in the first ten minutes and not allowed to go back in. This was not a great first time experience. No one working at this place knew what was going on. They need to have a staff meeting and clarify rules to fix dilemmas like this one so this doesn't happen again.
