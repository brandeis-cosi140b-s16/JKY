Visiting family from Southern California.  We know what good Mexican is supposed to taste like.  My mom took us here and the results......

The good: was seated fairly quickly, drinks were out quick and food was out in a reasonable amount of time and our server was a nice guy. The bean dip appetizer was descent. That is the extent of the good. 

The bad:  it started driving into the dusty, dirty rough driveway they call a parking lot.  I ordered shrimp tacos with rice. They were nasty, barely cooked with runny chipotle sauce. Not appetizing at all. The rice tasted more like Chinese fried rice that had been under a heat lamp for a while. Dry and not appetizing.  My husband had the sopitas some tostada thing with very dry meat on the top of a greasy dough ball. Beans were horrible. Dry as a popcorn fart. Maybe microwaved and canned. Totally tasteless.  

Never be eating here again!!
