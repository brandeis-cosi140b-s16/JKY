The food is absolutely horrible and cold. The only thing I ate that was decent was my cup of tortilla soup but even then it was more tortilla strips than soup. I ordered the Charlie's chimichanga and I swear to you they used a frozen chimichanga and flash fried it. It was luke warm inside with grisly bits of meat. Disgusting! I couldn't even eat it. For $15 you would expect decent quality. I live in la and can get the same meal fresh for no more than $10. Hell I make my own baked version that tastes better than this crap. The beans were tasteless and less than a spoonful on the plate. The rice looked and tasted like it came from box. I've eaten at some not so authentic Mexican restaunts and none can compare to this bastardization of what they call Mexican food. Do not go here. They're regular margaritas was horrible as well. We threw our drinks away and neither of us finished our meal. Also, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa? 

Stay away, far, far away.
