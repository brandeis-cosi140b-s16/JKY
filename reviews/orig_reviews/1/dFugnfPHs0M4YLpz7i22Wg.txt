Although our waiter was very nice, he quoted the wrong special and I received the wrong meal.  My husband got his meal 15 minutes before I got mine and we were unable to dine together lest his food get cold.  And the seafood enchilada, which I ordered in lieu of the special, was not to my liking.  For all of the inconvenience, we were given a coupon for a free appetizer the next time we dine there.  Yeah, right, as though we would go back.  I will stick with Richardson's/Rokerij/Dick's Hideaway in the future if I want great Southwestern food.  Also, it was FREEZING inside.  I agree with other reviewers who said that the food is bland and swimming in icky sauces.
