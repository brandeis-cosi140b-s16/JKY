This review is based on several bad experiences with this restaurant. We live in Chandler and started going to this restaurant when they first opened. At first we were impressed with the chips and dips - 3 dip choices was great! But....then things changed.... We went there for dinner and one of the chairs was broken and when my mom moved it out from the table to sit down it pinched her finger to the point that she had to have her finger pryed out from the two pieces of wood and it had crushed her finger so bad that she was crying. You would think that a resturant would be mortified enough to at least comp her meal or appologize! They were not. The second bad experience was the food poisoning that we got from the tamales. Horrible!!! Several months later we tried again and this time we were charged for additional chips and salsa and my daughter asked for a side of salsa that came in a 1/8 cup container and we were charged $1.25 for it!! We mentioned it when we went to pay and they said that they now charge for any extra salsa or chips - period.
You would think that a Mexican restaurant with all the competition they have especially in Chandler would try a little harder for loyal customers. We have moved on and found Mucho Taco - much better food and service!!
