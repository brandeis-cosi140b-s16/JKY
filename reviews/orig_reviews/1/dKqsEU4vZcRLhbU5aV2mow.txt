Had a reservation for Xmas eve for 8 people. I called to confirm the Friday before & the restaurant called me the day of. When we got there they wanted to split the party of 8 onto two tables! The hostess said I'm sorry the tables are bolted down we can't put two together! The place was almost empty and you can't sit my party @ one table? I asked for a manager who was of no help simply stating we have a large table that's just about to get up would you like that? Yes thank you Mr bald headed manager I would like it as I have 8 people I would like to sit at one table. We waited another 10 for the table to clear then get reset. Then we sat and sat waiting I swear another 10 minutes for Caesar our server to greet us. I would have thought Mr Mgr would have been on it offering us an apology or some great service but no. Drinks took forever, screwed up the margarita because we said no salt so it kept getting worse. I ordered the $23 fajitas which came out on a warm cast iron plate on a wood trivet, every body's food was warm not hot. I will give credit to the taste of the food as I did like it, just wished it was hot. The server tried his best but it just didn't work. I wish them luck. Thanks for nothing I won't be back
