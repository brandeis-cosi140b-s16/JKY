It hurts to write this review because I have been to Jose Andres' restaurants in Washington DC and I have absolutely loved them and had great experiences with his food. 
However, China Poblano was absolutely terrible. My husband and I tried items from the Mexican AND the Chinese menu and while the Mexican was slightly better, everything we tried was awful. Everything on the menu is tapas sized, so you are expected to order 3-4 items per person. Luckily we decided to start slow..We had a number of different tacos (lobster, fried fish and mushroom) and all were greasy and tasteless. The guacamole and chips (which was $15!!) was ok. LIttle did we know that it would be the only truly edible thing we ordered! We then decided to try some Chinese items and got some traditional shu mail dumplings and mongolian beef stir fry. The dumplings had a bizarre raw pork flavor to them that was so disgusting that I actually couldnt even swallow the dumpling and the mongolian beef stir fry was completely bizarre... tiny little chunks of grisly beef stir fried with pieces of romaine lettuce?! And then the icing on the cake was the bill.. I know this is Las Vegas and I certainly wasnt expecting a budget dinner, but since we ordered very little food (4 tacos, an order of guac, the dumplings and the beef) and only ordered two agua frescas and no alcohol I was absolutely FLOORED when I saw that the bill was over $100! 

Definitely skip China Poblano-- if you want to try Jose Andres' fabulous food-- go to Washington DC... because you certainly won't find it here at China Poblano!
