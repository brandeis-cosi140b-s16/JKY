Ridiculous expensive. Cold nachos? When we told our waiter he said they were supposed to be that way. Yuk!  Won't be back here ever!  Talked to the Manager the next day and he barely gave me a 20% off for dinner (which I did not use).

If you are in the 21 group and want to party then this is the place to go. The music is super loud - not good if you want to actually eat. They push their overpriced drinks on you hard. $7 for a little plastic cup of Coors. 

This is a nasty place..
