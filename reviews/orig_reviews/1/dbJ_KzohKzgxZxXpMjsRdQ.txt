It's insane how consistently poor the service is at this location. The line always moves slow, there is never anyone at the register, the soda machine is constantly broken, and they frequently run out of ingredients. The last two times I've visited they were out of brown rice, this time they are also out of the corn salsa and other ingredients. I go here out of convenience but am going to start driving an extra ten minutes to visit Chipotle. The manager ought to be embarrassed by the way this location operates.
