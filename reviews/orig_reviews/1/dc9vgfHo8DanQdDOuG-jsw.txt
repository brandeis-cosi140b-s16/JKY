Beware! They might serve you soap in a cup!

My friend ordered a yinzerita that had SOAP in it! That's right SOAP! They clean their frozen margarita machine with soap and sometimes they forget to cycle out the soap before they start serving margaritas in it. My friend asked for a new yinzerita when she thought it tasted funny but the waitress insisted that there was nothing wrong with the yinzerita. Evenutally, the waitress realized there was soap in the yinzerita and gave her a new one with no apology or a refund. 

This is a serious health hazard! Seriously now, soap in cup? 

I've gone here several times for their happy hour and late night bar experience. For happy hour they have a ton of appetizers for half off and drinks including the mojito and yinzerita. The appetizers and drinks are just ok.

The ambiance is pretty nice during bar hours. If you don't like having smokers in your bar you could try steel cactus as no one is allowed to smoke on the main 2nd floor.  Sometimes they get your drink order wrong when it's busy so watch out for that. 

Overall they have bad service, ok food, oh and they sometimes serve you soap.
