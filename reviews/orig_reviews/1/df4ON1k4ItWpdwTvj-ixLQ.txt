Came here for a bachelorette lunch after a long day by the pool. First started off with waiting 20 mins for stale chips, that came in paper bag and salsa that tastes like tomato pur√©e.  Then watched our $18 chicken burritos sit on the tray outside the kitchen for 10 mins, brought to us, chicken COLD. Waitress never checked on us.  NASTY FOOD. Major mistake. Will never recommend this restaurant to anyone one!  No STaR worthy.
