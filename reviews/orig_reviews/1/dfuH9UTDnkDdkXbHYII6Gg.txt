Second time here and never will I return. Service is good drinks r good. But there food is just not my type.  Got chicken Chipotle last time n was just tomatoe sauce. Got drunk shrimp today and had no flavor. Sent it back to add some spices still the same. Only ate 1 shrimp that's how bad it was. Sorry but I'm from southern California and this is more for different type of people
