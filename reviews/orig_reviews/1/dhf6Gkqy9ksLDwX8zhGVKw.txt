I actually returned my .99c bloody mary because it was so thick and taste like ketchup. Seems like someone spilled a bottle of powdered garlic in the huevos rancheros. I also hate onions and they were in everything by the handful. Wouldn't recommend ever. My boyfriend is not picky at all and he thought it was gross too. The cheeseburger place next door had greasy breakfast but better than this!
