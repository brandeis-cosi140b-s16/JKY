Went there for lunch yesterday with my brother and sister in law who recommended this place. Ordered the chicken nachos and thought it would be good but I knew something was wrong when i got to the checkout and their register froze. Needless to say, it took them some time to correct it and my food grew cold even after i told them this would happen. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of my issue. Well, it came to fruition and when i finally sat down, my food was cold, the chicken was dry and just not very enjoyable and my brother had it worse as he was behind me in line. Would not recommend to anyone and the worst part was that the cashier said this was a common occurrence.
