After a long morning of volunteering at a local animal shelter my coworkers and I sat down at the famous (infamous) Los Dos Molinos for a filling lunch.  

I know 10 people at lunch is a challenge, but the place was empty and we were treated like it was a major inconvenience.  

Service was slow and unfriendly, I was never asked if I even wanted a drink, I had to make a significant assertion to get one glass of diet coke.  

I ordered two chicken tacos with no cheese, no beans... I know, it sounds boring, but it is what I wanted to have for lunch.  I received pork tacos and a plate full of beans.  

So how was the food? I can imagine dog waste tasting better than the taco that I ate.  Hell, I can make better soft tacos in my home kitchen anytime and run circles around this place.

Additionally, my coworker did not get his chili relleno until 15 minutes after everyone else was served and it looked more like soft green chili slop more than anything else.

To top it all off it took ages to get a check and when we did they would not allow us to pay separately...   

Needless to say I will not be returning to this place.  For much better food, service and cleanliness check out La Pinata near 16th Ave and Thomas... it is awesome.
