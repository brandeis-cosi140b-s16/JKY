A group of six of us went to Pink Taco last night.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the food for for the price.  First we all had drinks.  I chose a standard blended margarita at a ridiculous 13 bucks.  It was like a ten oz slushy with not much alcohol served in a standard bar glass.  For a 13 dollar margarita, I guess I was expecting something bigger, maybe presented in a cool way.  I ordered grilled fish tacos and they were fishy tasting and mushy.  Not even tasty, another disappointment.  My Bf ordered chile verde.  They brought him a cereal bowl sized portion of it which was cold to the touch.  It was obviously something meant to be microwaved, because it definitely was not freshly prepared.  The waiter apologized and disappeared and brought the same bowl back ten minutes later.  It had obviously been warmed again in the microwave because now it was too hot to touch.    The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal, as they were frequently replenished.    Our meal was nearly 200 bucks for the 6 of of......NOT WORTH IT!
