I have to say I was pretty disappointed in my first (and last) visit here. Upon walking in, the short brunette hostess/server with braces said "hi. Two?". No smile, horrible demeanor. After that lovely intro, I noticed the interior was very nice but the food immediatley negated it all. Our queso dip was okay, nothing special. The actual entrees were abysmal. I had the 6 rolled tacos which had slim to no meat in them and though I put sour cream and pico on them, the pico was lackluster and soggy, adding no flavor. I ate 2 of them and raised my white flag to surrender. My boyfriend got the enchilada platter and said it was "disgusting". Well, my love, you dragged me here over where I wanted to go, so. We left our plates and appetizer barely touched, paid our bill and left. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Never again.
