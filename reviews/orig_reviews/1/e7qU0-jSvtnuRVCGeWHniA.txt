I ordered a Carnitas Burrito and 5-rolled tacos around lunch time.

Carnitas Burrito - One narrow burrito!  Overall, this was half the size Roberto's would offer and the carnitas were the worst I've had in L.V. thus far; just bone dry, no chili flavor, no nothing.  I would have given it back if I had the chance.  No self respecting Mexican food establishment would dare to serve something so offensive to true Carnitas!  I really wish I would have snapped a pic of it's (lack of) size before I ate it.

Rolled Tacos - They were simply rolled tacos.  Line cook simply slapped on a half spoon of avocado (most of it completely missed the container) like he was in a hurry....I was the only one with an order!

I even gave a tip before they put my order in.  This is the second time, second day in a row that I've given tip to a food establishment and the employees totally disregard this act of generosity.
