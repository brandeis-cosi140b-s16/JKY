The service was horrible, the  food was mediocre.  For a restaurant located in Old Scottsdale I would expect better.  I arrived for my reservations at 6:30 and was told to go to the patio area and seat myself.  Once seated I sat for more than an half an hour before a server asked to take my drink order and I did not see the server again for another 45 minutes.  By the time my order did arrive I had been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours.  I ordered shrimp fajitas and there were no tortillas included!  I had to ask for tortillas, that should come with fajitas, and they took another 10 minutes to arrive.  By the time the tortillas arrived, my food was cold.  Then getting my bill proved just as great of a challenge and after waiting another 30 minutes I had to go to the bar to pay my restaurant bill.  Total time at the restaurant?  Right around 3 hours.  Frank and Lupe's was recommended by my hotel.  When I got back I was sure to let the hotel manager know what a nightmare Frank and Lupe's was and how dining there hijacked my whole evening.  DO NOT GO TO FRANK AND LUPE'S!!!!!!!
