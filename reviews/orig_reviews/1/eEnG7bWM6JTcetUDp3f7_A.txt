Ok...This may not be fair. My wife and I went here for breakfast.  This place is probably not known for its breakfast but if you advertise it then at least do something right. The service was lacking to say the least. The table was dirty. My coffee cup was dirty and disgusting.  My wife's pineapple juice was watered down and not even close to tasting like it should. The coffee tasted like burnt mop water. Perhaps the dinner or evening atmosphere is better. I don't know. The food was simply ok but not good enough to redeem the other issues. We have all been to dives where the food can make up for a bad experience. Not here. 

As a note the manager was apologetic and took the beverages off or bill and also applied a discount with being asked for that extra step.
