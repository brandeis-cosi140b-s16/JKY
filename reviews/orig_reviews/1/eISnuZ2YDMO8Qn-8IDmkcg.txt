Tonight we had a family gathering and went to Arriba because an Easterner was in town and wanted Mexican. What a huge disappointment! The food is insanely hot - even though we ordered "mild" dishes and the fish is nasty nasty nasty! We Arizonans are used to good fish tacos - and they exist up the road at Senor Tacos, but not here. Sorry, I can't understand how, in an area with a dozen really great Mexican places, how this gets by at all. Come to think of it, it wasn't busy at all so maybe the word is out! There are way too many great Mexican, non-chain places around to come here and waste your time and money. Oh, and there was no offer from management to to make the terrible food right, either!
