This is the first time I've written a Yelp review, but my experience at this place was so bad it had to be done!! First of all we for at least 15 minutes before our waitress came over to take a drink order. Our drinks slowlly trickled to the table one at a time, and were a combination of wrong and bad. Dinner w.as amazingly uninteresting. I had a caesar salad with grilled chicken - I know, it's a Mexican restaurant and I should have ordered Mexican food - but still I expected a nice, freshly grilled chicken breast on a nice salad. Instead I got a salad with virtually no dressing, covered with cold, pastey chicken. I tasted a few of my friends' dishes and didn't think it was a whole lot better. At the end of the meal, the famous fresh tortillas, which were supposed to be an appetizer, arrived at the table.

If you want a nice dinner with good service, look somewhere else!
