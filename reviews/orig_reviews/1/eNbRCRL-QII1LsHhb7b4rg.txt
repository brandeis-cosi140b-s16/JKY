Ok, so this place kept popping up on our yelp searches so the man and I decided to give it a try since we love New Mexican style food. We walk in and the hostess says there will be live music in 20 minutes in the bar area at 8pm. Awesome, we think. We sit down and immediately notice how pricey drinks and food are. Whatever, no biggy.. I order the green and red chile plate and he gets the enchiladas. (Mind you, they only have one enchilada option). My chile plate was shredded beef with enchilada sauce on top.. And black beans, definitely canned, and rice. That's it. If I wanted beef with enchilada sauce on top, I can get that at Filibertos. Red/green chile should be cooked in the sauce and very flavorful with a little spice. Very bland! Also, it came with 1 sopapilla to put the meat on. Just 1. So I have a plate of shredded meat with nothing but 1 piece of 3"x3" dough to put it on. No tortillas. And if I wanted ONE TORTILLA it was $1.50. Ridiculous. The enchiladas were lacking in everything from cheese, sauce, to meat. He asked for more sauce for his meal and it came in a big bowl with no spoon so he poured it from the bowl. The live music, btw, was so so bad. Loud and not at all dining appropriate. To make matters worse, half way through the meal they seat 4 high school boys literally right next to us.. In the bar area. The entire time they are extremely loud and obnoxious showing each other inappropriate pics on their phones and sarcastically singing along to the live music. Isn't it illegal to have underage kids in the bar area without a parent? If not, it is at least bad management. I thought for a second we were on that reality show "Boiling Point". We couldn't get our check quick enough. With that said, service was pretty decent considering the poor guy was by himself.
