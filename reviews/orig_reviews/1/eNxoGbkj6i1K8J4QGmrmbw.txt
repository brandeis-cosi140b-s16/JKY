GREASY!!!!!!
Picked up a pork and a beef Carlito's burritos to go, when I got home the red oil had drenched the inside of the bag! Good thing it didn't leak or else my car seat would have been permanently stained. Menu described complimentary add ons and premium add ons, well the cashier didn't even ask if I wanted the extra ingredients which I thought at least the complimentary add ons would have been included. Oh well, live and learn I guess. Afterwards I took my wife's plate to wash and the red sauce was so greasy that even dawn dish detergent wouldn't faze it! Oh no, I don't think I will come back. They have some Vegan choices? Really? Talk about extremes!
