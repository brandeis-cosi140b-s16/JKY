Rosita's was a real disappointment. I was craving a hard shell taco with rice and beans for lunch and gave Rosita's a shot at satisfying my hunger. I chose wrong.

The chips and salsa were okay, not great. The salsa was a pretty watered down and didn't have a lot of flavor. The chips were warm, like they promise, but tasted like they'd been sitting under the warmer a little too long.

I went with the burrito and taco lunch special; everything I was craving. I chose a chicken burrito and machaca taco. It was sorely disappointing. The taco was okay, but didn't have a lot of flavor; the burrito was horrible. 

A thick, store-bought quality flour tortilla filled with flavorless, boiled chicken and absolutely nothing else. I had to cut open the tortilla and douse the atrocity that lay inside with the remaining rice and beans on my plate and a large helping of salsa just to make this thing palatable.

Whether Mexican, Italian, Thai or American, really good food is all about flavor. Unfortunately, Rosita's had none to offer.
