Wow, seriously bad service.  We were waiting for our flight and sat down to eat.  Waitresses walked by but nobody came even after 15 minutes.  I flagged one down but she gave me a dirty looked and walked the other way.  I tried to flag another and she just averted her eyes.

Finally someone came up and was rushing us along rudely.  Finally the food arrived, chips and salsa, 3 small tacos and a tortilla soup + 2 drinks... over $60.  Mind you I pay a lot of money for food sometimes, but this was horrible.  The Carne Asada tacos were dry. The seasoning was bad and the tortillas were dried up.  UGH...  My friend had the tortilla soup and she was very disappointed as well.  Bad service, bad food with expensive prices..:(
