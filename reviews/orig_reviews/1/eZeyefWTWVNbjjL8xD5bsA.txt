Waited for 30 min for a table on a week night. The back patio was cute in a rustic sort of way.  And that was the only redeeming quality of the place. The waitress was surly.  The food was bland, soggy and basic. I had fish tacos. The fish was super mushy, the tortilla so soggy I couldn't pick up the taco or it would fall apart. Had to eat it with a fork! If I wasn't starving and there with small children I would not have eaten that mess! Hubby had veggie burrito.. He was also not impressed.
