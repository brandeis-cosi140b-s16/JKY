Where do I start... After we were seated, it was a toss up who would be our server... They were not that busy. It took almost 10 mins to get our drinks. I was excited to try their Bloody Mary after the description I was given. Should've had a beer. It tasted like ZingZang & thats all. Average at best. After 2 different servers - we got to order. The apps were good - queso & flautas. I then got the buffalo shrimp taco & Chicken pancake combo. Chicken was great! Fried chicken with corn flakes...yum. The street corn was good as well. The shrimp was undercooked. The pancake was poorly executed.... Like the idea though.... I think actual street vendors would've been better today. Maverick fell short of my expectations....
