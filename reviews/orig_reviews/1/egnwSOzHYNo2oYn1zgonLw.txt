Ok, so I thought I would give this place a tryone more time since everyone raves about it. I will not make that mistake again. I should have just left it alone and stuck to my original opinion... ok, but nothing special. Now I must say my last experience was horrible. To start the water tasted awful and the chips were cold and stale. How can you mess up a cheese crisp, well the Tee Pee did, again cold. My taco was made incorrectly and the chimi my friend got , not so good. I love good ol Mexican food, but this place has missed the mark. Thank god they have nostalgia working in there favor.
