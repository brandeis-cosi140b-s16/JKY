Always in search of a great Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and this ain't it! I wish someone would open a Tex Mex restaurant in town. Wishful thinking I suppose. Beyond disappointed, livid describes it better. 4 people cost $90! 

Walked in around 2 or 3 p.m., the place was dead-REALLY dead-no employees to be found anywhere! I literally had to go to the kitchen and ask if anyone was working in order to be seated! 

Finally seated, I inquired about a Margarita for Happy Hour and was told since I was in a booth, I would have to pay full price unless I wanted my entire party (me, hubs, 4 year old and 17 year old) to move to the bar! Total BS! We were literally the only people in the joint. You would think the goal would be repeat business or at least taking pride in their job. No such luck. Worst Margarita I've ever had and it made me sick for 2 days due to the rot gut Tequila, despite my request for top shelf alcohol. 

Appetizer was sparse and cost $17! Entrees were terrible and tasted like leftovers. Service was equally poor. No tea refills, no chip refills, no free queso like the sign on the table described. Waitress acted like she was in the weeds and we were her only table and in fact the only people in the entire place! I don't know how they stay open. 

Driving to Centennial to me is always a waste of time and this experience to me is pretty typical of the area and why I avoid it. 

We won't be back. It was so bad that I really should call corporate.
