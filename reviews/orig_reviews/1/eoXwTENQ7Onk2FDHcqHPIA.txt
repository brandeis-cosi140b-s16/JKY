After discussing lunch plans and deciding that we were  long overdue for some Mexican food my girlfriend and I decided to give Cantina 1511 a try.  For starters, the hostess sat us in a relatively unoccupied section and then sat subsequent patrons right next to us.  Although we were seated before the party next to us they got waited on first.  A few minutes later, Tim, our waiter materializes to taken our order.  Tim did take the time to help us navigate the menu and pointed out the main categories which was helpful.  After careful consideration, I ordered the two tacos - a carnes asada and whatever the duck one is called.  My girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas Verde.  Interestingly enough,  the fresh-made-to-order food came out not even 10 minutes after we ordered.  We barely had time to enjoy the greasy and over-salted chips that tasted of old cooking oil and salsa that tasted slightly worse than Old El Paso.  My girlfriend's entree arrives on a skillet with a pile of something under a pool of runny cheese and a another plate with two pitiful looking soft tacos (my entree).  We had both ordered black beans which were void of any real flavor and a complete disappointment (don't get me started on the Charro beans).  A minute or two into digging into her meal, my girlfriend realizes that there's chicken in her enchiladas.  We soon figured out she had been given the wrong entree.  Despite the mistake, the entree tasted like something you might get at a Senior's Center on Mexican food night. Thankfully she is no longer vegetarian.  We quickly flagged down the waiter and explained the mistake.  He said he would check with the kitchen but then showed up a few minutes later with our check.  Needless to say, we'll not be giving this place a second chance.
