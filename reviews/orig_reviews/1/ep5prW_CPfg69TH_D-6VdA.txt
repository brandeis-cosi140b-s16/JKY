My wife and I ate here hoping for a tastey Mexican meal.  It was dreadful.  I had the beef burrito and it was akin to mom's pot roast, shredded and placed in a flour tortilla with gravy over the top.  The only evident spice was salt.  My wife's cheese quesadilla was equally bland.  

At a fourth the price, Taco Bell is closer to Mexican than this.  We will never return.
