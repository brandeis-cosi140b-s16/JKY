Ugh.  Dining at the Venetian, I expect a certain standard to be upheld for both service and food quality.  Don't set those expectations if you're going to eat here.  The only thing tasty were the fresh, warm tortilla chips and salsa.  The guacamole was alright, though it was very onion-y.  (I detest onions, on a personal note.)  I ordered the grilled mushroom tacos.  They were awful!  The mushrooms were over-cooked and rubbery.  The queso on the tacos was bland and tasteless.  The tortilla for the tacos themselves was bland as well.  The colleague beside me ordered chicken tacos and complained as well that it was tasteless and inedible.  Neither of us ate more than the first half of one taco (though the platter comes with three).  I heard the Sangria was good from colleagues on the other side of the table.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his pollo con mole, though he said that the chicken was unbearably dry after a few bites.  Such a waste of food!  It really pains me to waste anything, especially food.  So if that sort of thing pains you too, I suggest eating somewhere else.  The service was also slow, curt and overall rather grumpy.  I guess I'd be grumpy too if I worked here and served up this yuckiness.
