We had heard this was a great place to eat--authentic and old family recipes. Reading the recent reviews we clearly missed the good ole days of great food. 

It's very nice inside and has that homey feel, but the food was awful. When the best part is the chips, you know it's not good. I ordered a meal with the Ranchero sauce and was so looking forward to it, but when it arrived there was zero flavor and no spice. As far as I could tell the Ranchero was made from green-watery substance with one/two small diced green chiles and one (I think) piece of a yellow squash.

The service was good and the staff was very nice, but I do hope they go back to the original good food. Never change a good thing and drive away the locals! 

I was sad it was not better. I'll watch reviews, as I love native Mexican food.
