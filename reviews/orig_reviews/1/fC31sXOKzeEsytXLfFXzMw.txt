I managed to find a place that is actually worse than Los Sombreros and Los Olivos! Scottsdale is known for food but very average food, but even with those low expectations, this small restaurant failed to live up to its "New Mexico" theme or to the definition of anything that I would consider fit to eat. it's a bit like dining in a small warehouse, crammed in with other people just a bit too closely and having to speak Spanish so that the bored people at nearby tables won't listen in. That works because we were the only Latinos anywhere near the place. 

I don't expect Mexican food in restaurants to be like what we have at home so I don't go with preconceived ideas to judge a place but food should be hot and I should not have to pick hard "things" out of my teeth as I eat it. A margarita out of a bottle should not cost seven bucks. These are just basic, common-sense items. Other reviews speak of inconsistency in food and service. I guess we hit it on a very bad night, but we won't be back.
