Literally two minutes from my old home and we were desperate. The place was totally empty at like 8pm on a friday night. My friend ordered the appetizer sampler and I order the spinach salad with no dressing add grilled shrimp! The waitress asked if we'd like to eat "together", weird way to phrase it, and I asked to have both dishes served at the same time.

Well, within 15 minutes the sampler was dropped off, no salad nor waitress in sight.  After about 10 minutes she tops by and I ask about my salad. She sneaks back to the kitchen and three minutes later informs me that it should only be about 10 minutes. She asks my friend if she'd like to have the kitchen "hang on" to the sampler and serve the dishes together in a couple minutes!  It was so absurd, especially since the appetizers were supposed to be served hot and the odd dip had already congealed.  A manager finally delivered  a salad, but definitely not the one I had ordered.  When I noted the error she asked what I wanted her to do, and I asked for the check and sent the salad back. Eventhough no food had actually been consumed she neglected to comp or amend the check! What horrible customer service!!
