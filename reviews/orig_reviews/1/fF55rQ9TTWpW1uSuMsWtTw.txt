Don't bother coming here. Scottsdale has so many other great places to eat. The patio was cute, but the misters were not turned on which became very uncomfortable for a hot Arizona summer night...inside seating is available. The one star was for our service and food quality. Our server forgot to put my order in and got my friends order wrong. Rarely checked in and had to call her over a few times. It was not very busy in her section, so no reason for her to be unattentive. Expensive and not that great. A MEH experience at best for a $70 tab.
