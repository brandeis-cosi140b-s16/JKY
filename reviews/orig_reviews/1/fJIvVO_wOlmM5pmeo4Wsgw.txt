Watermelon margarita was really good. Quesadilla was so so, nothing special and pretty greasy. Smoky salsa was tasty but break up your own chips were somewhat annoying. What ruined everything for me though was the bartender blatantly giving away drinks and begging customers for money. Will never return because of this.
