We had a party of 12  last night  after my sisters wedding  8/15/15 the waiter seemed to be a little nervous,clumsy  or something  he dropped a few plates that fell all over hitting my husband in the  back and almost cutting my leg just a little  scrap  but the manager there didn't really seem to be concerned  he just said "O let me help clear the table"... smh
