Worst customer service i have ever had... for starters a group of 7 met down there for a birthday dinner. 2 of us showed up a little after everyone else did it took our waitress 20 mins to ask me for my drink order because she never passed our table again after serving beverages to the others at our table. Then 20 mins after getting my drink she came and asked us if we were getting food. A couple of us said yes we are all getting food. She then continued to wave her hands in a circular "come on" motion. For what we took as a hurry up lets get this over with. So instead of going in an order we each just startes telling her our order. (Needing a refill by this point) she then precedes to take everyone elses order then walked away (still needing a refill) 30 mins later she brought us our food. We all ate (still needing a refill ) didnt bother to ask for a 3rd time for another drink. I asked for my check. 30 mins later i asked the manager of the bar i belive her name was Lisa. To get our checks she brings them back and they had things on them other people at the table ordered (if she would have went around the table  instead of a russian rullet style this would not have happened) i get my bill. I ordered 1 soda (free refills i did not recieve) and a dinner plate. On that bill was a gratuity of 8.00 i was pissed i was not going to tip her and when i asked why it was on there she smirked saying "partys of 6 or more is automatic " i told her she did not deserve thia tip at all and she said "oh well" .... tipping is for service. I did not receive 8.00 worth of service. So she took it as it was a for sure tip she didnt have to give good service being she would be tipped either way. I will NEVER go back nor will i tell people about this place. WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!
