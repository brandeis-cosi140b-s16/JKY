The place is beautiful but the food was obviously canned sauces, beans, and lacked flavor. Way over priced. Al a cart tacos is more expensive than a meal and they are regular sized tacos 3 for $20. The Camarones a la Diabla was enchilada sauce poured on top of shrimp. Not good. No drink menu... the response was "it's like an open bar so just ask for something and we'll see if we can make it. " Wife asked for a Paloma which is a simple tequila drink. Didn't offer choice of tequila and it came with a very low quality well tequila called Zarco. Drink was horrible. My wife asked for a spicy red salsa and the manager came back with a bottle of Tapatio and a bottle of Louisiana hot sauce then explained that the Tapatio is good hot stuff! It's to bad because the place is very nice but we will not go back. I don't like writing bad reviews but I felt I had to. We love trying new places but we were disappointed.
