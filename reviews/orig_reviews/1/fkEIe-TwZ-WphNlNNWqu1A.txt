Don't bother!  Stopped here before hockey game and ordered the salsa, chips and guacamole.  Was just ok.  Then made the mistake of ordering the mahi mahi tacos. Fish was very fishy tasting and not lot of other flavor.  Rice was terrible and the beans tasted like they came out of a can.  Not good at all !  Would not recommend !  Would give it zero stars if I could.
