Wow! Terrible... First, it's really hot in here... I'm not the only customer in here whipping the sweat of his face... Next, long island ice tea and margarita taste the same... Both have this really weird dish water after taste.. GF is now refusing to drink hers.. That's a first..  Just got the food .. Microwave style and not as good as Taco bell.  Ok dinner is done, one margarita not touched, one long island ice tea 3/4 consumed. Food left on plate 50% --- waiter has now disappeared for the last 15 mins.. There are now a lot of confused people trying to figure out if everyone who works here left for the night..  Waiter took off the $12 for the margarita but not the Long Island ice tea. I was really too hot to fight about it. Sonrisa Grill is  probably on top 3 worst Mexican places I have EVER eaten at!! Stay away!
