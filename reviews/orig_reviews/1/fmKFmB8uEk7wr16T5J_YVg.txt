Beware!  Had dinner round 5:00 at the bar had a couple sips of my margarita and felt odd and so did my boyfriend. Got food to go and passed out on the way home and don't remember anything, and my boyfriend woke up with an awful headache.Pretty sure the bartender put something in our drinks. Just FYI. The food I've heard is good but won't ever go back there.
