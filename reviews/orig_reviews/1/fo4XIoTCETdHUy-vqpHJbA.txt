Ok, so my last review wasn't great. I had a terrible experience, but I decided to try it again ( about a year later). So, I walk in to put in a to go order. I am the ONLY person in the whole restaurant. The hostess says hi, hands me a menu and walks away. Ok, whatever I'll look at the menu. 7 minutes later (I watched my watch) she comes back, but the bartender yells across the restaurant to her to take a reservation on the phone. I attempt to try and order before she gets on the phone, but I get a finger in the face instead and she says "one minute." I wait 5 more minutes. Still on the phone. There were 3 servers and a bartender doing nothing. None of them tried to help me. I turned around and walked out. No one ever said anything to me, no one asked if they could help me, nothing. 15 minutes waiting and nothing. I will never go back.
