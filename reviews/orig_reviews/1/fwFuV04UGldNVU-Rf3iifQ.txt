WOWWWWWW. This place sucked. 

Simply put, this place charges way too much money for low-quality food.

I hate that this is the first place I've reviewed that is forcing me to give it a one-star rating. I almost wanted to give it two stars because the carnitas in my tacos was pretty good, but the rest of the food and the entire experience was pretty underwhelming.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla appetizer and he said he had about two pieces of chicken in it. He was really disappointed with the taste.

I ordered the Two Tacos platter of carnitas. The tacos were all right, nothing special. I reeeeally tried to eat the rice and beans, but it was not happening. I tried eating them over and over and the taste kept putting me off. They just tasted so inauthentic and old.

I also ordered the almost $3 chips and salsa (I don't know why I paid for chips and salsa -_-) and those were just mediocre. Everything I ate pretty much tasted like it had been microwaved a million times or had that inauthentic store-bought taste. Bleghhh.

That's all we ordered and the total was almost $30. Luckily we drank water, but if we had ordered soft drinks or anything more expensive our total would have been at least $35. It was REALLY badly overpriced.

The service wasn't great, either. Nothing to rave or rant about.

I feel like I work hard for my dollar and I was so sorry I had wasted so much money in one place.

I will not go here again and I would not recommend this place.
