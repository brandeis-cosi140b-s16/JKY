This is my second bad experience at this location. The people making the food drenched the food with salsa after asking for a very little bit. My food was basically swimming in it. Ridiculously gross. Their customer service is complete shit. I went back to ask for a drink and the cashier barely made eye contact with me and just handed me a cup and very softly told me the price. If you're going to be working in a food environment you would think they would train their employees to have some decent customer service and be able to speak to customers nicely.
