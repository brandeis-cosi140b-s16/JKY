NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! 

We have no problem spending good money on food but this place was not worth it at all. It's disappointing because I think all the restaurants at Cosmo offer great food (even secret pizza) but this place is a disaster. Service is slow and food is barely average at best. Save yourself $150 for two people and eat somewhere appetizing.
