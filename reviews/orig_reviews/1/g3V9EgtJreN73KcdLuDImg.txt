Went in, it was not busy and was seated right away, then we waited....and waited.......nothing. Could not wait any longer. No service not a drink, chips anything. When we left 15 minutes later with our things the hostess told us "thanks have a good night" maybe it's because we just got done with a running race and we're still dressed in our running gear meant we didn't have money.
