SMH....Keep in mind I lived on the west coast in the mexican food capital of the United States (AZ). There was one bartender on a Saturday night, who was not only serving people at his bar, but he was making drinks for the enitre restuaraunt (which was full), answering phones and taking to go orders. Because of this, it was not the best service.  However, food was worst.  The salsa (whatever you call that) was not authentic, not good and very bland. The queso was OK! and my fist taco was just bland and not good.  The ingrediants that make Mexican food special are a combination of  citurs (lemon, lime), garlic, cilantro and salt. None of  which was present in any of the food!
