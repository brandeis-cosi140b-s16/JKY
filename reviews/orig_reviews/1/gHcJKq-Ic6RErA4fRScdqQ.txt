Terrible. If I could give zero stars I would. Cold tacos. Tough pork in the pastor. Over charred Carne Asada. And old tasting guacamole with a piece of the kitchen equipment in it. Flavorless salsa. Another odd thing is that they don't offer hot coffee. The girl said that they brew it And then refrigerate it for iced coffee, I suspect it was just yesterday's coffee. This place used to be so good and has been steadily going downhill. This last visit sealed my desire to never return. Too bad Americas, you had so much potential once upon a time.
