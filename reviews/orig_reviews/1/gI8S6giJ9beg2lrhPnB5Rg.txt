Tried the barrio queen in scottsdale, great service, very good food. Called the gilbert location, they dont do reservations. Was told to come and hour early to get seating for my party and the wait would be 45 mins, no problem. Got there an hour early (6pm) to get seating set up, expected the 45 minute wait (party was at 7pm)and the hostess told me it would be a 2 hour wait! I didnt give any grief but i was clearly unhappy about the miss information and found another restaurant that was able to seat us immediately. Everybody arrived to the other restaurant and was seated immediately, on time. Props to Brio  at SanTan mall for understanding situation and accommodating us. I did get a text from barrio queen at 7pm saying our table was ready. That was very upsetting but everyone was happy with everything at Brio. You missed out on a great party and a great deal of money Barrio Queen!
