After spending 2 weeks on the border, eating authentic Mexican food we were hoping for one last hurrah at Blanco Taco at Sky Harbor Airport.  We had the chicken tortilla soup and the pork burrito enchilada style.  The food tasted more TexMex than Sonoran.  TexMex can be good too, but not when you're expecting Sonoran.  To be fair, the pork burrito was tasty and would have been much better without the thick, dark red sauce.  The soup had a thick, heavy broth with very little chicken.  Not worth the cost.
