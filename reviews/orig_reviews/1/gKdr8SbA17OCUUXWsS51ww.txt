disappointing carnitas burrito. no kick in the dish despite being told it had spices. to compound that, the seating is ridiculous. There are 2 fox restaurants side by side (blanco and modern burger). I ordered from blanco and assumed I would be "allowed" to seat in the dining area. As I proceeded to sit this lady comes running and rudely tells me "you cannot sit here because you did not order a drink". Mind you I was siting on a crowded high table..... Not at the bar. When I politely old the server that I was waiting for my
Food order from blanco, she told me my order was to go (though I never asked for that). this despite there being at least 10 empty spots available. plain rude and terrible attitude. not getting my business ever again
