I visited this place last night, I decided to step over the fence from whiskey row,because I wanted to play cornhole,and the bouncer literally tackled me,and shoved my face to the pavement in the process. Meanwhile I stepped over the fence earlier on that night and nothing happened. This place has expensive drinks,horrible service, and bouncers that think they have a badge on. I will never step foot in this place again. If you want stiches, an expensive tab, and the rights of a slave this is the bar for you
