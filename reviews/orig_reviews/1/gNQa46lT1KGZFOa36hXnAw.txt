I won't be going here again.  I can honestly say that I didn't like anything about it.  Our server was somewhat friendly, but that's about it.  And there is a good amount of parking, given that the hotel is right there.  

The bad:  1.  Server only brought one set of silverware for me and my friend, and took about 20 minutes to bring the second set.  2.  My Coke was very watery.  Found out that the syrup line wasn't working, so they went to replace it, and then came back and told me that they were out of Coca-Cola... like it's some rare thing for a restaurant to have.  3.  The spinach con queso was very runny and had very little flavor.  4.  The steak in the skirt steak taco was VERY dry and very salty.  5.  The sopapillas come out with some weird butterscotch-tasting flavor added to the honey.  When I asked the server what it was, she went back to ask the chef, and then returned to tell me, "Yeah, it's something different, but we're not sure.  Maybe it's just a different kind of honey."  What?!?

One word:  Nope.
