HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!  AVOID THIS PLACE.  WOW, WHY DO I HAVE TO GIVE THEM A STAR AT ALL?  We sat for nearly 20 minutes and just got up and left because the 3 employees standing around talking about BS paid no attention to us and all we were asking for were menus and a couple glasses of water.  There were no other people around us.  Will never go to this WASTE OF A PLACE again.  We went to the burger place right across from them and it ruled.  Cant remember what it was called but the food was great and service was too. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN THIS PLACE.  VERY BAD AND NON EXISTENT SERVICE.  If I owned this restaurant, I would fire all the losers that wait there.  I am sure the cooking staff is very good, but the WAIT STAFF IS A TOTAL JOKE!  We heard that before, and now we know for sure.  Avoid them and maybe the bums that own the place will replace the losers.  Maybe they should let the cooks wait on people and get rid of the dumb asses they have now.  If you still decide to try the food, good luck and I hope you enjoy enjoy it.  I will never know if it is worth eating, but I do hope you are not in a hurry.
