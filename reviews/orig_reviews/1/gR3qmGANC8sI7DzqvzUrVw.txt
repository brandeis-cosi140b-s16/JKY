Positives: view of the Strip, Pacifico on tap.
Negatives: bean dip  was like water, chicken fajitas has microscopic pieces of
                  chicken and peppers, poor service...my dish was brought out 5 minutes
                  After 2 other dishes were served to my party, tortillas were brought out
                  5 minutes after I received my fajitas, tortillas were full of flour and you
                  only receive 2, inadequate parking on Sat. Night in their small parking
                  Lot, table side guacamole. Had too much lime juice which destroyed
                  the taste of the guacamole.
