Really slow service, even the hostess avoided welcoming us into the restaurant! If you crave just something simple, forget it  sometimes some basic nachos would be great, or a chicken quesadilla maybe, but not here. How about counting 5+ servers, only 6 tables and they all walk by and say nothing!  Service is nothing short of extremely horrible.  Oh then chops and salsa, nope!!  No tipping is the only positive thing, that's only because its to be earned!
