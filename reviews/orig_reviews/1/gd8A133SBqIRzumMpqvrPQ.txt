OK so I work in the restaurant business so I understand sometimes u have a bad day . So here we go (1) we called in an order and was given a price of 15.86 ..... when I get there its 18 and some change but I brought exact cash so I had to run back home and grab a couple more bucks . (2) when I get back in 5 min the price has went up go 21 and some change .  the girl behind the counter was like sorry we forgot to charge u for  veggies . (3) when I got home there was no rice in either of our bowls .  (4) the food was very bland  ! I mean how many time u gotta screw up something ??? I will say the mgr Jamie offered us a free meal  or money back but to be honest I'm going back to get my cash , I'll never eat there again   !!!!!
