Spend your money somewhere else!  Service was awful, food was barely warm and everyone made you feel like you were bothering them.   Ordered guacamole right away and never received it.  Food order came out with wrong items and the food server was iratated with us like it was our fault.  Waitress comes by and picks it up and just walks away and comes back later with another plate.  No apology and never came back to ask how things were.   We live here and there are plenty of other mexican places with better service and food that would love to have our money.
