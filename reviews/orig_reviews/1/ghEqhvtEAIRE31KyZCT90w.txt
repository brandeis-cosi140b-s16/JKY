I gave this place the benefit of the doubt after I asked the hostess why someone was being taking out in a stretcher. She merely said he had a medical condition and I had nothing to worry about. But I guess I should have known from the moment I saw someone being taken out on a stretcher that this would not be the best place to eat. 

But whatever we sat anyway.. I mean what were the chances we would get sick. =/      
We started off with the chips and salsa's which were awesome. We then ordered a Mojito for him and a margarita for me. We got a queso fundido to split and order some tacos.

We got through the queso, only drank half our drinks and 5 minutes later my boyfriend was not feeling well. We have no idea what made him sick but he literally broke out into a cold sweat in the middle of the retaurant. We had to call securty and almost rush him to the hospital.  We had drank water all day and had not eaten anything out of the ordinary so dehydration was out of the question. 

My boyfriend had to run to the restroom where he did in fact get sick.  I felt fine, i think partly because I was more worried about him. We paid for what we ate which I personally think it BS. I mean you made us sick!! But whatever...  I paid our bill while he waited outside slowly sipping water because he still felt like crap.

We hoped into a cab and got back to our hotel. About 15 minutes later I started feeling sick to my stomach. and yes... we know what happened next.

If I were anyone .. stay away from this place!!!  There is something seriously wrong with a place that can make three individuals sick within 45 mins and not do anything to make it better. 

There are far better placed to eat.
