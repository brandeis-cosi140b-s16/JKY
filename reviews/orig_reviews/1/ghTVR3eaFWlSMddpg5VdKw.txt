This was the worst place I have ever been to. It was dirty, smelly, and unfriendly. I ordered a veggie salad combo with white rice and no cheese. Basically payed seven bucks for white rice topped with plenty of iceberg lettuce, a couple of mini broccoli florets, a meager scattering of green onions, and half of a smushed grape tomato. Come on chino's, that is not a salad, that's guinea pig food! I took about four bites and decided I could not go on subjecting myself to that horrendous meal. Will never go back.
