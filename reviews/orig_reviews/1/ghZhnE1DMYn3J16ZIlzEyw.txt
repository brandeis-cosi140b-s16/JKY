Ever go to a place, but just before you pull in you have this gut feeling that you should just keep driving?  Yep, that's this place.  However, I had mixed signals because I had been there before, just once.  But it wasn't until I actually parked that I realized it.  However, I still didn't know WHY though.  I order a chicken burrito and then when I got it, BAM! The light went on.  The size of the meal...the BANG FOR THE BUCK!  That's why I had the gut feeling!

Needless to say, I felt like that kid in the movie, "The Christmas Story", who day after day ran to mailbox to check for his package.  Finally, upon getting it, he fills out the mysterious code which turns out to be nothing more than some stupid statement telling him to drink more Ovaltine?!  Well, that's how I felt upon walking away with that measly burrito for 8 bucks! - Like a sucker.   After sitting down in my car, I said to myself, HELL NO!  I'm not going to get jacked for 8 bucks for a POS burrito.  So I went back in and got my money back.  People are insane charging what they do for such skimpy portions.  Well, to the recent poster....there might be a reason why it's never crowded when you go in there - grimace proportions!
