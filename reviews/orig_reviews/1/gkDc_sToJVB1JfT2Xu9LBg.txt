Ordered a very basic Tex Mex entree, cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. It came out overflowing with way too much chili con carne sauce which overpowered the dish. It was flavorless, lacked imagination and looked like a plate of Alpo. I tried to find the manager to express my disappointment but gave up after 10 minutes of looking for the person. The tableside guacamole was not as disappointing but did lack flavor and salt and it wasn't blended properly. Whoever is in charge down there needs to end the moratorium on the use of salt at the restaurant, go visit San Antonio for a refresher on Tex Mex cuisine and retrain the cooking staff on the subtlety of chili con carne. Bottom line...they served me a dog's dinner.
