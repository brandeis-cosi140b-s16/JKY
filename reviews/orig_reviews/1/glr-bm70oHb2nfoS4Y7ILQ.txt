New to Vegas we heard this was the Best Mexican food in town, we were very disappointed. Atmosphere Excellent, Service Excellent Food....horrible.
My parents were in town and wanted to hear some Mariachi's so this is why we went.

We will never go back. Talking to other locals it may just be this location. So if you are doing to try them don't go here!
