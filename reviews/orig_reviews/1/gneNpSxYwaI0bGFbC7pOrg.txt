I went there last night with a large party (10). You would think they would see a larger group and be excited and or a least kind. However everyone was pretty short and rude. We decided to stay and try out the food, even the the table was messy and the menus were greasy. All of which should have been warning signs of what was to come. What we received should not be called Mexican food. We had hot plates but cold rice and lukewarm food. When we informed our waitress of the issue she stated she would get us more rice which she did. However she didn't take the plate back, she provided us a plate to put the cold rice AFTER we had asked for the plate in which to do that. I personally ordered the Carne with an Enchilada and it was the WORSE enchilada I've ever had. I've made better ones using canned chile. The steak tasted like rubber and was very chewy. There was 0 consistency with the food seeing as though 3 people ordered the same meal and none looked or tasted the same. I live in Phx now and i was hoping to show my family a decent spot for some Mexican food. I was extremely disappointed in this place and will never go to it again nor will I recommend it. If you're thinking of coming here just go to chipotle or even Taco Bell, it will be cleaner and the food will be done with pride.
