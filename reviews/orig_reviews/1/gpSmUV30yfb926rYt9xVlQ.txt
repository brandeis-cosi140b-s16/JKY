Disappointing. Waitress took 15 minutes before I flagged them down. They took my order but no follow up and waiting another 10 minutes to get my check. I had the chicken nachos which were average. Did not like my drink the Sergio. Was way heavy on the tequila and not refreshing and light which is what I was hoping with the fruit juice and mint.
