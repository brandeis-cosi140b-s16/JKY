I have been at this restaurant many times and have always enjoyed myself...until Oct 25th. (yes, I have been struggling with writing this review for sometime, as you can see from the date stamp of this review.)

I guess we have always gone on either: A) a Groupon or B) Happy Hour,  C) someone else paying, or D), so many marg's I never noticed the bill!?!?!

Either way...Late lunch on a Friday proved to be most different.

1). The chips were COLD..not just room temperature, but COLD..and HARD.
2). NO red salsa offered...were they out of it??? 
3). $35 for 6 Corona's...Let me repeat...$35 for a SIX PACK of MEXICAN BEER (I'm at a mexican restaurant, right?).
4.) LUNCH BILL totaled $70 for TWO PEOPLE.

uh, I don't think I'll make that mistake again.....EVER.

Word of caution....DO NOT ORDER MEXICAN BEER unless you got lots of dinero!
