If I could give a zero I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a 7:30 reservation.
Were told "We are overbooked".  Downhill from there.  There was no place to wait so we stood in the middle of the restaurant jostled by waiters and customers.  Our waiter was clueless and disappeared during our ordering and our meals.  The entrees arrived before the appetizer and the before meal bread came as we were finishing dinner. My chicken enchiladas had no discernible chicken and was just a large mush pile. None of us five liked our meals.  The only good thing was the roasted beet side dish.  Maybe this qualified for one star.
This used to be our favorite restaurant in the area.  No longer.  The staff
Treated us like we were in a post office.  The hype is killing them.  The kitchen and especially the employees need attitude and training lessons.
The owner needs a wake up call.
