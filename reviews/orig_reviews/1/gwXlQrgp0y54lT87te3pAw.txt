I don't know how this place gets such good reviews: I tried this place today and 1.) the girl taking my order through the drive through had a terrible attitude and have me a face like I was crazy, said nothing while taking payment and giving me good even though I was quite cheery with her. 2.) the food (a carnitas Torta) was super greasy, I can feel it in my stomach now (disgusting) 3.) the entire Torta was cold; meat, jalape√±o, bread... Just all of it cold as if it had been sitting out for an hour or so. I took three bites and threw it away, fearful for what sort of illness I may get from consuming food that has been sitting out (mostly worried about the meat). Don't come here, go somewhere else just not here.
