I've been to the Spotted Donkey Catina at El Pedrgal several times and it was always a pleasant experience.  Not the case at this new location.  Maybe the oil that fhe foods were prepared in was bad because not only was the flavor off but I had stomach problems later.

Service was below par as well....will not be returning.
