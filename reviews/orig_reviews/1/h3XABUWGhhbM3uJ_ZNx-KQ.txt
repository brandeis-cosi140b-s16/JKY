Service was bad even for a bro bar. 
Found this place while looking for food shortly after the Super Bowl. Big banner out front said "Super Bowl Party till 2am". The bouncer assured us the kitchen was still open and invited us in. 
The place still had a few people in it but no problem getting a bartender right away and asking for a menu with our drinks. We then looked over the menu and purposely ordered something that would require a minimal amount of effort to make and clean up in case the cooks had already started to close down the kitchen.
That was the last time we ever talked to our bartender or any other staff in the building. 
After about 20mins I personally went to check on the status of our nachos as the kitchen is open for the public to view. I saw the forgotten nachos burnt under the heat lamp. We were the only people to order food so I can see how it might be easy to forget. I mentioned something to a cook to remind him about the nachos then went back to my empty drink at the bar. Another 10mins or so before the cook took initiative and delivered us a plate of nachos that was not only burnt but now had been sitting so long they were cold. I might add the toppings were pretty light. Its a stretch to label this plate of chips "nachos".
By now the crowd had dwindled to mostly employees on or off the clock. It took another 10mins or so before anyone wearing a loco patron shirt came to check on us. I then told the bartender to forget about the nachos and bring the bill for the drinks. No wait on that. 

If you want to just close down and have an employees only party then drop some hints before i waste precious time thinking I've found food and drinks still open on a Sunday night. Take down your signs that boast you'll be open till 2am. And if you forget someone's nachos and get called out on it, have the decency to at least reheat and sprinkle some fresh tomatoes on those stale ass chips before serving them.
