If you eat eggs, and they serve them at Arriba's, be sure that the waiter knows the difference between "well done" and "over easy".  You would think that would be an easy concept to understand.  No sir, not at this place.  

Nothing turns my stomach more that seen runny yellow slimy eegs all over my plate.  It's just gross - I hate 'em and I thought that I made my waiter understand my distaste for anything but WELL DONE eggs - maybe it was a language thing, I'm not sure.  Oh, he offered to bring me a new order but honestly, my appetite was gone by then.  I did tell them that I would not pay for that stomach churning screw-up and he was OK with that but he did insist that I pay for my coke.  I didn't think I should have to considering that my WHOLE meal was ruined but I was glad to just get out of that place without throwing up.
