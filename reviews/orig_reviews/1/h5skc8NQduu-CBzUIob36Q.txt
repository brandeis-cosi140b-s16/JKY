This place used to be my spot-on New Mexican fix though after coming for many, many years here and a regular since 2004 at Richardson's and Dick's, a bad experience was way too bad where I will not be back.  Ordered my usual but with a waiter that is known to not be the best.  He was too busy singing to the '70 songs playing and left our food in the window too long.  After knowing after many years you can't touch the plate because it's too hot, well, I could pick it up and the red chile was PASTE!  No big deal right? Just bring a fresh order ? - NO! The new "GM" comes up and shows a ticket with times and refutes that the plates were sitting in the window.  Though I tried to tell him I was regular, he conveys that he was a regular for 26 years and yes sometimes the plates were "not hot."  Ummm ok but please don't spit in my face while talking and certainly not raise your voice.  Check please!!!!  After many years, it has continued to go down from changing the menu to experiences like this.  Pass ---- go to Los dos molinos down the street - 10th street and camelback - not New Mexican but the best Mexican in town!! Pictures are Los dos-
