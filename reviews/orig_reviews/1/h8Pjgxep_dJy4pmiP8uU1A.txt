Would love to review this restaurant but unfortunately when we tried to have dinner there we were told it would be a 45min wait. The place was lucky to be a quarter full with empty tables throughout. The server told us we could eat at the bar but could not sit at any of the numerous empty tables! Obviously couldn't be bothered having any more customers. Wouldn't bother trying again.
