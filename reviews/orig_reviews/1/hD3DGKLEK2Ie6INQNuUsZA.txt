Ok, I'm going to start of by saying our waitress was super friendly, and my friend and I received our lunch fairly quickly. 

1. The Guacamole: Cantina offers table side guac, which is great for those who love their guac freshly made. You can't really mess up guac, or maybe you can. In this instance, she did. The guac was flavorless and kind of soupy. I'm not sure how the soupy part happened, but it did. Maybe the pico de gallo was missing cilantro or something? SOMETHING WAS MISSING and I can't put my finger on it. And I won't. I'll never order their guac again. 

2. Chicken Tostada Salad: According to the menu, this salad is piled high with marinated chicken breast. Um, where was the chicken? I barely received any and I for sure didn't receive any marinated chicken. The chicken on my salad looked like cubed chicken that came out of a can. Totally underwhelmed and disappointing. 

3. Churro Bread Pudding: What in the bland heck is this? I've never tasted a dessert that had absolutely no flavor. Our waitress suggested it to us and said it was the best dessert on the menu. Well, if this is the best dessert on the menu, I don't ever want to taste any of the other desserts. Ever. 

If you couldn't tell, I love flavor. I love spices. When I go to a Mexican restaurant, or any restaurant, I expect for my tastebuds to be happy. 

Maybe if I ordered a taco or a burrito, maybe I would have had a better experience? Who knows? I don't know - and I will never know, because I will not be back.
