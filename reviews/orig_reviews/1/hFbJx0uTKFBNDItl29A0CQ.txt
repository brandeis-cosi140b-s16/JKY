Wow, I'm still the only person that doesn't like this place?? I don't get it. What am I missing? Oh I know... FLAVOR. 

Gave this place a 2nd try and was even more disappointed than the first time. Got a breakfast burrito with eggs, beans, cheese (supposedly), and green chilies. I may as well have had a piece of cardboard. Seriously, NO FLAVOR. I poured their salsa and hot sauce all over it and I barely noticed it (they use the word "hot" very liberally). 

Perhaps if I ate meat other than chicken I'd like the food here, but both the chicken burrito I had the first time and the breakfast burrito I had today were tasteless, so 2 strikes and you're out on this one.
