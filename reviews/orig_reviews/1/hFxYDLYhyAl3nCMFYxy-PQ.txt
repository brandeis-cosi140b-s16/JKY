Overpriced, the food was VERY salty, both our meals were not very tasty. Granted we didn't send the food back but never care to eat their food again, especially considering the price and difficulty getting to the restaurant. On top of this our waiter charged us for the dinner portion though it was noon and we specifically asked for (and received) the lunch portions. Finally we each ordered a drink, I had the Bloody Maria, and she had a sangria. The sangria was not very good at all, again didn't taste bad but certainly was not as good as almost any other sangria I have ever drank. The Bloody Maria however was grotesque! It was not palatable and a total waste of $9. It was salty, and watery (somehow at the same time), and tasted strongly of really bad tequila.

When all said and done it was $57 for a meal that was not in the least enjoyable. Though sitting out side was nice, I feel we could have achieved that pretty much anywhere on such a beautiful day. Needless to say we are never coming back here, especially considering there are so many other restaurants nearby.
