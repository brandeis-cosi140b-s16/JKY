What are these people complaining about?  Didn't they arrive blasted drunk?  This place was great!  Sure the hot female staff in daisy dukes advertised turned out to be a prissy dude in jeans, but that wasn't too bad since the female waitresses tended to have a muffin top.  The drinks weren't good and overpriced, but with a few good drinks and several okay ones before you get here, who cares?  I ordered the mahi mahi. It's all right that it arrived rubbery and tough, because I just sent it back and got the short ribs with spit tacos instead. Given enough alcohol, the blandly seasoned meat won't matter as you revel in the extra grease that was such an integral part of the dish. If you're planning on being blind drunk in the area and are looking for a place with a bathroom, this is an easy half star better than peeing in the street!
