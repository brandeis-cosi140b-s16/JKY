We went to this place because it had some good Yelp reviews, but I'm not quite sure what people were thinking. The server did not seem like he cared much about doing a good job, and he didn't even check back with us after we received our food. We ordered chips and salsa (they cost $2.95, but it seems like it is typical for Mexican restaurants to charge for chips and salsa in Vegas). The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. If that's the only thing you order there, you're doing yourself a favor. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito (it cost over $10, which seemed a little pricey), and it did not come with beans and rice on the side. I also did not get an option of what type of beans I wanted in my burrito, and that seems odd for a Mexican restaurant. I received my order very quickly, and once I started eating I realized why. It was a store bought, flour tortilla, with over cooked rice and I'm guessing canned re-fried  beans inside. The cheese inside was not completely melted. It was truly the worst Mexican food I've ever had, and I'm originally from California, so I've had good, authentic Mexican food. I would also avoid the margaritas at this place. They are very costly, and there is very little alcohol in them. You're better off buying a dollar margarita in one of the casinos. Overall, do yourself a favor and go to a different Mexican restaurant.
