We had a layover on our family trip to Cancun today. We went out for Mexican food and found Macayos Cantina. I have grown up eating Mexican food and let me tell you this place sucks! The food tasts canned or processed,  its dirty and the staff looks dirty and unprofessional. They had no knowledge of how to make a Michelada or a Mexican Preparada,  weird for a "CANTINA".... the waiter just said "we dont serve that here bro". The chips and salsa as well as the rice and beans were old and dried out. Avoid this place unless you are looking to get waisted with a bunch of college kids.
