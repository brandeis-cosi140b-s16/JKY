This place doesn't even deserve one star. We were starving by the time we sat down to eat and wanted to get everything moving quickly so by the time the server came for our order we were all set to go. I told her id like a bottled water and that id want an alcoholic drink in probably ten minutes ( the water I got was 8oz and cost 4$).
 
So after waiting about 35 minutes for our food, someone from the kitchen brings it out and rushes of before we realize we have no silverware! And then it took us another 15 min to flag someone down. So I asked him if he could take my drink order because we haven't seen our server in now over 30 minutes. He said he would tell her. 15 minutes go by and I flag the same kid down and tell him she hasn't been back! He says he can take my order now and I tell him I want a margarita. We wait another ten minutes or so and the server ( who we haven't seen since she took our food order) comes back and asks for my ID! At this point we're so fed up with this place we ask for our check  (which took her a while to get back to us, of course)

I wouldn't recommend this place what so ever, the bill was expensive the service was horrible, I would of rather gambled that money away then have to sit through something like that again.
