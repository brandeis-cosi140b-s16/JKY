I'll keep this one short. 

Bad. 

Service was painfully slow and pretty negligent. We never even got refills on our water. The food was bland, I've had better from (insert ANY americanized Mexican food restaurant here). 

It's a shame because they are in a great location and have an amazing patio. I would never recommend for anyone to come here.
