Came here for some dinner and drinks. Sat down at a machine and ordered a shot, the bartender asked if I was playing and I said yes. Put some money in and he brought me a shot. I guess my mistake I assumed it was comped like it would be at almost any bar in town if you are gambling. He didn't bring me a check or ask if I want to open a tab. So I order another one, same thing... No check, he didn't ask for money, didnt ask me to leave a card to open a tab. Again, assume its comped because I'm gambling. I keep playing, and ordered a couple more drinks. Next thing I know, he brings me a check for $50. I then politely ask him why every single one of my drinks are on my check and he rudely says "well that's what you ordered!" I'm sorry but any other bar you go to, if you're gambling at least ONE of those drinks are comped. I got charged for every single one of my drinks while he made me think they were comped. I don't have a problem paying but when you ask if I'm playing then don't bring me a check I feel like those are not being charged to me as that's how it is at almost any bar here. I love the summerlin location of this bar/restaurant so I'm very disappointed since this is right down the street from me. Guess ill be driving across town where the customer service is MUCH better. Please do not go here!!!!!! Unless you want to get ripped off.
