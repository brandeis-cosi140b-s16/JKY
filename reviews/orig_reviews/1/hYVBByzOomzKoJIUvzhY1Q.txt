I was interested in checking out Arriba as I heard of the hot hatch chilies. Even after reading the mixed reviews we took s shot and headed over for dinner. 

Chips & cocktails:  beer from tap was flat. Yup, flat. Don't see that everyday when going to a restaurant. Beer replaced with bottled variety.   Grande margarita ( house mix) was giant for $6 but I would have preferred my buddies flat beer. Nice size but nit very good and certainly not worth 1000 calories!!!    I drink a lot of slim-priced booze & was still not impressed. 

chips average, salsa bland, refried beans were the only added pleasure.  

Dinner:  my friend was not psyched with the cheese skin that arrived with his enchiladas. Creamy? yes, Shiny with weird skin?  Yes, Good?  No. 

Combo plate with green corn tamale was dry. Chicken enchilada was pretty good and seemed to have s lot of pepper seasoning. Thank god I asked for green sauce which saved the tamale. Rice and charro beans typical & moist. 
 
In a nutshell, when should have taken heed from the yelp 2 star reviews.  Food was less than average. Much better quality, pricing and taste at Chipoltle.
