The logo and decor of this place should be changed immediately! The decor of this restaurant promotes the stereotype of the "sleeping Mexican"- lazy, dirty, huddled under a saguaro.  Interestingly everyone working there were Mexican and about 90% of the clientele in the lobby that day was of Latino background. To have paintings of the "sleeping Mexican" on the window decor and on a large mural in their main dining lobby is offensive, especially in Phoenix with all of the attacks on people of color and anti immigrant laws coming out of the state legislator. Truly bad form. Shame I'm sure the food is great ...
