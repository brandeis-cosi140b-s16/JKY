No more! We have been regular customers for about five years now and were so treated like crap tonight that we will not be coming back. Service and food is always pretty hit and miss but we kept coming back because when it was good, it was good. We ordered their filet tacos which always come out cold but the flavor is usually pretty good. Tonight it comes out not only cold but greasy and has no guacamole on it. We tell the waitress and she sends it back. A little later she brings out a new dish that had the tacos so cold that the cheese was not even melted, barely any meat on it, and the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side. Huh? We complain, she sends the manager over and she (the manager) who has known us for a few years now is very snarky and rude to us about it. She doesn't understand why we are not happy with everything on the side. OK. Well, if that is how you treat regulars, see ya. To top it off, we were overcharged for the side of guacamole we ordered and the service was terrible the second half of our meal. We canceled the order and left. This is a place you definitely take your chances at.
