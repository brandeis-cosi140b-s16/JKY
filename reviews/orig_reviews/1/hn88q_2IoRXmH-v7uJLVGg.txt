this is the whitest restaurant i have ever eaten at in my life. first off the salsa is a essentially a can of corn with half a tomato on top. same with the rice and beans i ordered as a side. white rice with no flavor and what taste like store brand black beans straight from the can dumped on top. nothing had any flavor including the decor and the underenthusiastic waitress and the bland local art on the walls. i dont care if it is by a local artist its still a gosh darn painting of bob marley.
