Over priced and disgusting food.  Beans outta a can and premade shells???  Better Mex food elsewhere and expensive lunch.  Chips and salsa were gross....

I cannot for the life of me understand what people see in this place - other than the decor. Don't waste your time here folks....A LOT of better places with a lot better food and prices!
