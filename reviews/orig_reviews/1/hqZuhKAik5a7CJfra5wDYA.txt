I know everyone loves this place. I try and try to like it, something is just not quite right. Today we went in for  cocktails on the patio.   First the umbrella fell on me.  Staff had a very low care factor.  That I expect from this staff.  After waiting 25 minutes we asked about our drinks. And then we waited...and then we walked out. Service is hipster cool, semi non existent. Too cool to wait on you atmosphere.  They were not that busy. other tables that were seated after us had their cocktails and food.  And we waited.  Multiple wait staff walked by us pre order and post order.  No one asked a thing and no one cared.  The care factor is so low and it so obvious the staff could care less about the clients it is sad.  I have noticed this before certain folks are fawned over and others ignored.  Talk about restaurant profiling.   We are not hipsters hence we were ignored, discounted any number of words come to mind. let me repeat NO ONE CARED! Every time I go there I try to understand why folks are enamored. No more trying, no more going.
