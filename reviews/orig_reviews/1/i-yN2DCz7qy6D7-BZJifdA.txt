Ive been going here for quite sometime because their food is excellent but the service is very poor and after today when I went I will never be back there again. After standing there for about 7 min then they acknowledged me to take my order the person that took my order seemed to be the one in charge but was paying more attention to the two girls he was flirting with in the front table. Then the other two that were there one was running around like a chicken with his head cut off and the other was more worried on getting food for the cashier than he was the customer. Total disorganization they need a lot of work there service wise like I said the food is good but doesnt make up for the lack of service and it wasnt even at a busy hour.
