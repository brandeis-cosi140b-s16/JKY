How  is this place is still in business?    Very casual ,,,,,,  as in order food at counter and wait for your name to be called....   and  wait......... and  wait...... and  wait    and  wait.
45 minutes later.... BINGO  thats out order.     .......the celebration didnt last long as  they got it wrong.....  granted it was a complex order of one fish tsco and one veggie barrito.....  The most disorganized restaurant  I have ever been to...   I  should mention the food I guess..... Honestly, Taco bell is far better.... 

This place gives Mexico a bad name.
