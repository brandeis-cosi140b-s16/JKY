I had pretty low expectations for this place, which should have helped my rating but it was actually worse than expected. The food was bland and just tasted bad. They give you samples before you order which is a bad business decision on their part because we almost walked out at that. We ordered dishes besides the ones we had samples of and ended up throwing out half our food and leaving. They do have decent black beans but only in comparison to the rest of their food, not to other restaurants that serve beans.
