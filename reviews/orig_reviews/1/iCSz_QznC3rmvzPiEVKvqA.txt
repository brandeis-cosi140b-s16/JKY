Si Senor used to be family favorite. Haven't been there in almost three years up until today. We were disappointed at how much the quality in service and the quantity of food has declined with increased prices. Not sure if management has changed, but they now charge for every little thing. My mom ordered an iced tea that tasted like dirty dish water and asked for something else to drink. She was charged for a another refillable soft drink instead of changing it out complimentary. My brothers refried beans had a metal taste. When reporting concerns to management all they said was "sorry". We will never go back!!! If I did not have to give at least 1 star, I wouldn't but instead give negative stars. The only reason they are getting 1 star is for the sopa which is the only thing going for them.
