Decided to sit at the bar, bartender not very friendly the table was dirty asked for it to be cleaned she just did a quick wipe and it was still dirty the 12 dollar margarita tasted like mix and no tequila , I will give kudus to the shrimp ceviche it was really good , decided to eat the rest of our dinner elsewhere I'm gonna add to this they gave us our check and didn't even thank us for being there , totally need to learn about customer service I didn't want to leave much of a tip but my daughter is a server and suggested I leave at least 18% anyway geez
