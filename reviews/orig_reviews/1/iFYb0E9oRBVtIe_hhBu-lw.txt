This place was not good. The salsa with the chips was so hot I almost died, there menu was so unorganized and crowded I had to tell the server to decide for me. When I did get my dish ( I ordered the shrimp plate) the cheese on top wasn't melted it was ice cold, the rice was white and premade and tasted like plastic and the guacamole tasted like it was scooped out of a premade store bought container. I love Mexican and I will never ever eat there again.
