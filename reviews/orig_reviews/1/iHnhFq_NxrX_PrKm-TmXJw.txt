I initially was thrilled after locating on yelp was given a coupon for a free appetizer. Something I had not expected. A very nice surprise. Then when we got there were seated.immediately and atmospere was fun. I mentioned the free appetizer coupon and was told "are you sure its Hacienda. I showed her the reponse changed to okay I am going to check with the manager. She then left and came back and informed me that she couldnt find a manger, saying since we are sooooo... busy. There at the time were 10 open tables. She then ask us to come back to use the coupon again saying soo ... busy. We just ordered and tried to move passed it. She continued to bring it up 3 more times. Became very annoying. Food was fine. I had not expected a coupon and would have probably been fine with the overall experience, but I feel it is in poor taste to offer a coupon and then not honor it. Then with the waitress continually bringing it up and making excuses was unpleasent when we had not mentioned it since we first showed her and she began with excuses. So my overall rating would be average on the food, atmosphere better than average. Most employees were friendly and prompt with service but our waitress experience was poor that combined with an enticment of coupon and then nit honoring makes the experience below average.
