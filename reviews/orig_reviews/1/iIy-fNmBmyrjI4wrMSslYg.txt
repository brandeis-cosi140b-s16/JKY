Upon entering the restaurant, there is a noticeable vomit smell that is overwhelming. After seeing the prices and tasting the food, there is no wonder why it smells like vomit. 

While their chips and various salsas taste good, it is a Mexican restaurant so that should be standard. What wasn't impressive was the fajita burrito. It had no real taste and the chicken was dry. It also was expensive and not worth it. Their drink prices are also outrageous and while it may be the most popular bar in Shadyside, they are extremely slow at getting drinks and taking orders.
