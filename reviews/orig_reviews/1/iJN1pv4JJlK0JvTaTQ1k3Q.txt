If you could give zero stars, this place would have earned it.  Don't be fooled by the gourmet pricing... The $8 tacos consisted of dry flour tortillas with a few chunks of chicken jerky and a small scrap of lettuce. No sauce, no cheese, no flavor.  Burrito much the same. If presented with no other options, do yourself a favor and eat the wad of cash instead.
