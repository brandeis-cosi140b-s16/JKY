If you want to pay way to much for mediocre food and small portions then this place is your nirvana!

The $15 guacamole should have been a tip-off ... the waiter swore it was THAT good...so we gave it a try.  I'd say at best it might be slightly above average.  Unless its amazingly hard to truck an avacado into Las Vegas though, at $15 for an avacado, some lime, and a tomato they are making a killing on this dish.

Next up, salt and pepper tofu. This dish is best described as bland and unsatisfying. I love me some good tofu - but good this was not. Basically it was 4 pieces of tofu doused in corn starch and fried. Seasoned with some salt and pepper. There was a small chile garnish, but it was pretty bland and didn't give the tofu any flavor.  $12.88 for that gem of a dish. Disapointing.

The waiter raved about the famous fried rice, featured on food network, yada yada. I was really looking forward to it... It was ok. I appreciated that the vegetables were nicely, uniformly diced up for texture, but man it was HEAVY. Very greasy dish.  Again for $20 I expected something a bit more sophisticated. 

My wife had Gan Pung Ji Chicken, which to her was a big bunch of averageness for $23.00. 

Another annoying thing about this place is they bring your food out at random times. That meant my wife was done with her entree before I was even served mine. The waiter explained this was just how their restraurant worked. WHAT?! Why? It makes no sense. What kind of restraurant thinks that is normal?

Definitely would under no cirumstances eat here again. There are a lot of other choices in vegas that provide MUCH better food and MUCH better service at a MUCH better price. 

To summarize, if you are in Vegas and want to throw away some money. You can either hit the tables or hit china pablano. The tables are a lot more fun and at least there is a chance you may come out ahead. At china pablano however you are gauranteed to be a loser.
