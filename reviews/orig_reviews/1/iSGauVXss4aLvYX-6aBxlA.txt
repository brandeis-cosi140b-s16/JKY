This place deserves 0 stars WOW, this had to be THE worst experience I've ever had in any type of customer service environment. First of all, I shouldn't have to get up more than once to have a request fulfilled. We came with a party of 4, ordered a few margaritas, 2 appetizers and 2 tacos. We literally waited 45 minutes to get our stuff and only AFTER we told the waitress and manager a handful of times. We never even got our tacos, we were just fed up and left. Next time you want something done right at this place, don't waste your time. Go to the Scottsdale location, this ones a joke.
