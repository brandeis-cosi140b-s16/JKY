Ate here on 4/25/14. Ordered the chicken nachos which consisted of stale chips topped with a spray on cheese and guacamole that came clearly came from a tube.  I'm honestly not sure it was even guacamole.  I tried to order the chorizo nachos but they were out of chorizo. For the main dish I tried to order corn tortillas for my tacos but they were out of corn tortillas!  Fish tacos were literally a fish stick wrapped in a tortilla. 

Don't eat here.
