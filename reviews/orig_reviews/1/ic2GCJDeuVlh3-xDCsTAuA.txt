Ate dinner here a week ago.  They advertised a free buffet for happy hour but turns out it is nothing more than chips and salsa.   They also have a fruit platter but who is going to eat that with the cantaloupe killing so many people. When we saw the "Buffet" we decided to try dinner.  Did not like the food. Just a tiny step above fast food.  The side dish was sone kind of noodles but they were cut up in about 1 inch pieces.  The beans were mashed and I almost gagged on them.  The chile relleno was the best part of the meal but still not up to par with the Barrio Cafe,  I do not plan on going back here again.  Can't believe their quality of food since they are located in a high class neighborhood.
Their adsvertising photos below are terrible.  Photgrapher used very bad lighting and it shows.
