This is my first time eating at this establishment. After spending $15 on a sushi burrito, I asked for a small cup of ice water. The gentleman working there said were out of the ice water cups. You need to buy a soft drink cup if you want a drink. I don't drink sodas and I want a small cup of water with my food. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me the managers not here. I said can you give me a regular cup since you're out of the water cups? He told me NO you need to buy one. I don't feel that up selling your new customers is the right thing to do. 
I may not be the most savvy restaurant entrepreneur, but if you're out of water cups and your customer is thirsty, give him a regular cup so he can be a returning customer.
