Sandbar was just an overall disappointing dining experience.

I usually don't complain about the long wait.  In this case, 45 minutes.  However, it was the reason for the long wait.  You see, in my party, we have someone in a wheelchair.  Apparently, all the "handicapped-friendly" tables were in the back where it was occupied for a private party.  You mean, you rather have all the handicapped people in the back...hidden away?!?!?!  A wise manager would have had those tables scattered throughout the restaurant.

And the manager did feel bad.  Offered us a nearby corner table with steps to get there.  Oh Lord!  Do people not think?!?!?!  Like those people who offer menus in Braille to Deaf people.  Hell-o!

Finally, we get there!  Awesome...an interactive table!  You could check out the menus, play games, and even check Facebook on there.  Except...it didn't work.  What's the point?!?!?!

Chips and salsa were bland.  It was "$2 a Taco Night".  Uhm...sometimes simple is best.  These tacos tried to overwhelm you with so many different ingridents and they just turn out to be a mess.  Stick with simplicity, honey.

The only cool thing about this place was this huge overhang light that was covered with Dos Equus bottles.
