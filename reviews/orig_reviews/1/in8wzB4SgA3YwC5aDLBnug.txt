Why on Earth would somebody change what works? The decor has lost the sense of excitement that the old Mexican style created. The menu is now fru fru. They must have hired a chef who couldn't make it anywhere else and allowed him to destroy what the restaurant had been known for. Regarding being able to order off of the old menu, one is only presented with the "new improved" menu. I've gone back several times trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they never fail to disappoint me. Even the quality of the traditional foods has decreased. I guess you get the idea that I'm unhappy with the Scottsdale Macayo's.
