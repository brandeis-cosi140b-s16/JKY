This place nickle and dimes you $19 for two burritos and a side of chips....really? They charged us 35 cents per salsa when we said to go yet people dining in are dumping it on their plates...really salsa? Come on. Asked for guac on the side when it came on the burrito and they just didn't give any... Beware they are looking to save $ any way they can come on really? I support small business but come on guys. Treat us right and we would come back...not anymore
