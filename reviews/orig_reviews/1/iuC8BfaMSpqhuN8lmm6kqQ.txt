This place was such a disappointment. As you walk in there is a smell I think it's the carpeting. But we wanted to try these tamales so we stayed. The chips and salsa were served and these were not fresh at all. Both the salsa and chips tasted store bought. The food was not much better the enchilada sauce lacked flavor and the shredded beef inside the enchilada and taco was mushy. The beans I have tasted before but I can't place it. Now the tamale. So not worth $4.00 each. The masa was bland and the pork inside again was mush. The only good thing  here was the tortilla soup and the service. The empty parking lot and dinning area should have been a clue that this place is no good.
