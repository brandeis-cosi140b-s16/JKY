I'm so surprised this place has 4.5 stars because these tacos are probably one of the worst tacos I've ever tasted. The wait was ridiculously long, the service was horrible (super rude waitresses), and the food was ridiculously salty. The quesadillas are double the price but they're really just tacos with a chip on the top. Do not recommend. Super disappointed :( 





But the lollipops were on point. One star.
