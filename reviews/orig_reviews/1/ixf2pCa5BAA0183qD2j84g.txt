After reading good things about Chile Addiction I brought my family there on a Sunday night, but we had a less-than-optimal experience. From the time we entered the restaurant, we didn't get our entr√©es until 50 minutes later - and there were only five other tables occupied in the whole place. Our drinks (no alcohol license so don't expect a beer or margarita) and guacamole arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but it took well over a half hour for the rest of the food to arrive. 

Also, as we arrived the restaurant was very dimly lit (the sun was setting) and then when they turned on the lights everything was really bright. But when they tried turning down the lights a bit the lights started flickering. Miserable.

And then when the food finally arrived the disappointment continued. I was looking forward to the stuffed sopaipillas and the chiles but the whole plate was very bland. Nearly everyone at our table went for the salt shaker, which I can't remember happening at any restaurant in a long time.

I hate to give it one star because the two servers we encountered there were friendly, but everything ended up being a disappointment. Slow service, bland food and flickering lights that almost gave me a headache? I don't think I'll be back.
