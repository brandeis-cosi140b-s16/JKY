If you are looking for a party spot to hang out on the weekends, this might be a good place for you. I only say that because I was constantly invited to these parties by members of their staff as I walked through the hotel, & because I could hear the music bumping from my hotel room. 

If you are looking for a great margarita, this is not the place for you. Their margaritas are a joke & way overpriced for what they are.
