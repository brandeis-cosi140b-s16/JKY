Only redeeming factor was red sauce.

The refried beans were tasteless slop.... more like lard soup with a few mashed beans thrown in. Also tasted "off"

The rest of our meal (chicken enchiladas) were edible but a far cry from the quality available elsewhere.

Even though the place was not full, we couldn't find a clean table and had to wipe ours off with some damp napkins before feeling like we wanted to sit down.

We went to this establishment because there were a number of good reviews and it's close to the Mesa Swap Meet.

After eating there we wonder if all the good reviews were from relatives and friends, OR if it's changed owners because this place is definitely below average.

Sorry to say another local place we refuse to support.
