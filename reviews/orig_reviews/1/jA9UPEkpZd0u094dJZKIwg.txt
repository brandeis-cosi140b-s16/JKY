I love Cafe Rio and I think that for their food they have a reputation hold. I was disappointed at this location, I feel like a lot of the employees do not care to be there and therefore have crappy service, they also don't have he fun atmosphere anymore, I remember the first time I went to Cafe rio they were always singing and yelling free meal or happy birthday or whatever, it seemed fun, this time it was like an assembly line and I even heard an employee complain that he doesn't get paid enough. They had run out of a few drinks on the fountain which I think is unacceptable for a restaurant as busy as they are, and then my food, my burrito had a whole Bullion inside of it it it was so salty I could no longer eat it. They did fix it by giving me another burrito. But I feel like this location needs more attention especially as busy as it is. The bathroom was also very dirty.
