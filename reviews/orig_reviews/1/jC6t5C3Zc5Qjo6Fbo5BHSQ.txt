I was refused service by a bartender last night. Myself and a friend walked into the establishment asking for 2 glasses of water. The bartender ignored my two polite requests for water and thereafter stated "I can refuse service to whomever I choose." After changing my order to a sprite and water (to pay for some form of service) he asked to see my identification. I asked to speak to the manager and he claimed to be the manager. I wished him the best of luck in his endeavors and quietly left. I used to frequent this place,  as I am a student, however I will not step within 10 feet of this place.
