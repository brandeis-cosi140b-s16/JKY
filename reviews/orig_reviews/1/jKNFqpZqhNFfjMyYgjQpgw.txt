The service was horrible...the restaurant wasn't even busy and the waiter took forever to come and take our order...the drinks were ok and the nachos were good. The tables were not clean though. It was so sticky! 
At the end the waiter gave us the bill and Gil us gratuity wasn't included and to have a good day...really??? Why would you tell us that? 
Don't plan on going back there
