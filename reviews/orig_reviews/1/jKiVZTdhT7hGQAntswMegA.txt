What a change in Quality, really dissapointing.....

Let me just say the first 2 times I went to Diablo's I was blown away.  The BEST margarita I have ever had.  When we ordered it, we saw them hand squeeze the lemos.  We had several appetizers and it was all so good.  The salsa was really authentic.  That was around 18 months ago.

We went this past Saturday, March 27.  What a decrease in quality.  We ordered the margarita pitcher again, and they squeezed 1 lemon for the entire $30+ pitcher, and the rest was the mix.  You could taste the difference.  We ordered the shrimp quesadilla and the steak nachos, both are around $17 each and we felt ripped off.  The quesadilla had small shrimps, like the ones you get from the can.  The steak nachos, which sounded delicious were the most dissapointing.  it was basically little bits and pieces of meat, not sure if it came from a real steak, it was so chopped up it looked like it was just the extras they had left over.  You basically paid $17 for a stack of chips, a little cheese and literally 2 tablespoons of meat.  We left there thinking what a waste of time and money.  Having so many good choices in Vegas, we chose this one.  I will never eat here again, that is for sure.  I dont mind spending money, but it has to be worth it.  This one is not, and the sad part is, that it use to be soooo good.  I don't know what happened.
