This place was ridiculous! I payed almost thirty dollars for two tacos and a margerita...what the hell! AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, it wasnt even busy and our server took his sweet time taking our order and at one point I saw him come out, look at us,and went back and brought me my food which was edible but for the price I payed I could have gone to a regular taco stand and fed like 3 people with what I paid for two tacos! Then I had to wait almost half an hour for the bill which by the way I only got because the manager happened to walk by and asked if we needed something. Mediocre food, poor service, and really over priced for what you get.
