disappointing. we asked the waitress for suggestions and she provided a couple of suggestions including the "starred" pollo margarita. waitress recommendation, star on the menu, highlighted in red.. must be good right?

WRONG. the chicken was dry, the potato cake unimpressive, the seasonal vegetables were okay. this dish was so not very good that my mom who hates wasting food.. refused to help me finish it.  she hardly ever says that she doesn't like a dish, she'll usually just say "oh its different" or "its okay.." but she was pretty straightforward in expressing her displeasure at this dish.

this place is a bit overpriced, service was just okay and the food... i could have done without..  i don't live in the area, but even if i did, i wouldn't come again.. nice people, just didn't care for anything else..
