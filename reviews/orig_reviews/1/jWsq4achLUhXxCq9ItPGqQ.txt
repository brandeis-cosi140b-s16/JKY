The place answers the question "How can you mess up enchiladas?".  By smothering them in a cheesy mess and playing "hide the chicken", they do so quite convincingly.  The food is overpriced and they are surely fortunate to get a spillover crowd when the wait at Firebirds exceeds an hour as it often does.
