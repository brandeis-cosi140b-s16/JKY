This place blows!!! Their food is uninspired, tasteless and the wait staff arrogant. Being served cold enchiladas by a bitchy waitress is not my idea of good food or service. There are too many fine places to eat in town to waste ones time or money on this place. Oh! The house margarita had little to no tequila in the drink. What a dreadful place.
