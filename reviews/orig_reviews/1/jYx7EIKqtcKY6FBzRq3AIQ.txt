Wow, so if you want to eat at a place that advertises Happy Hour specials on 4x4 cards and then charges you full price despite the fact that you are handing the specials card to the waitress, who then supposedly talks to the manager and comes back to the table and said it was a "printing error" and you still owe full price, than this, my friend, is the place for you.

My five friends and I came here for happy hour that they had advertised as starting on Feb 12th. They have a DJ spinning some fun tunes, the sun is shinning, and we are drinking and munching away enjoying ourselves thinking we may have found a new HH joint. Our waitress seemed new, as she would have to ask the bartender every once in awhile if the offered the drinks we wanted, but she was really nice and apologetic to us and thus we have no qualms with her. It's the management that would not give us our happy hour prices that were literally laid out in front of us. It's not that we can't afford regular price, but who doesn't love a good happy hour. Poor business strategy. You lost five patrons. Back to Old Town for us!
