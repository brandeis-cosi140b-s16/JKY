The food is literally awful, and it's not cheap.  As a resident of Las Vegas who appreciates all our wonderful visitors, I beg you to spend your money somewhere else.  There are too many great places to dine in Vegas for you to even consider this place.  They take advantage of their location to serve disgusting food with thinly veiled indifference.  And who can blame them?  It's usually full!  You can have a meal you'll enjoy somewhere else on the Strip for about the same money.  Find one of those places, and stay out of this dump!
