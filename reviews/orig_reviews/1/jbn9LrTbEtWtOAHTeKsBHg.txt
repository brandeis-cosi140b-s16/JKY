What I liked most about this restaurant was paying the bill and then running far, far away.  My husband and I ate here several times over a two year period.  Don't ask me why, but we were as enthralled as Harry Potter on his first day at Hogwarts.

I had just thru 18 weeks of chemo and I actually felt like Mexican food. Like eating it, that is.   My husband thought another trip to R.C.C. was in order so off we went, as jolly as Spongebob and Patrick on their way to see Sandy Bottom.

Our waitress was as nice as she could b, but nothing could have lifted our spirits after our foray into the "Choose Three Dips" special.  We had spicy salsa, pico de gallo,  and a thin avocado dip that was a beautiful shade of mint but seriously lacking in taste and texture.

No complaints from my hubby re. the pork tacos but he was so tired , he could barely speak. Towards the end of his meal,  all he said was , " I'm not going to complain, we just won't go back.". He never complains about his meal; he just vows never to return and unfortunately no one remembers that  he was there in the first place. He ordered a side of black beans, too, but alas, the salt must've murdered the chef then invited all his friends to go swimming in my husband's pathetic little appetizer.

My meal consisted of 3-4 potato flautas.  The menu stated that the flautas were filled with potatoes.  First of all, each flauta was so overly deep fried  and hard to chew I forgot about the potatoes.  When I realized there were no potatoes, I simultaneously realized there were potatoes: about three shreds per flauta and and so overly fried they appeared to b a part of the corn tortillas.

If ur under 40 and enjoy partying outside on a restaurant patio, this place does have beer and liquor.  The problem is the food.  Get yours elsewhere !
