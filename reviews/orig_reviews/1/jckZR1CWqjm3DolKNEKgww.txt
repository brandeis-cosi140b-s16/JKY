We came here looking forward to celebrating my husbands birthday instead we have the most horrible service. The only lady that was nice was the lady taking "free" photos. The food was simply ok. It was way over priced. We could have drove 2miles up Charleston to a whole in the wall restaurant with better service and better quality food!
