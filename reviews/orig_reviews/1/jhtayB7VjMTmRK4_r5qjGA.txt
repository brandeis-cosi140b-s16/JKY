Yea it's the airport but Wow by far the worst Mexican food I have had in my life I went the safe route got the nachos, but damn these were bad soggy chips with sour cream and cheese straight from a tube and pile of onions on top for about 12 bucks, should have gotten the damn taquitos!!!. just need to stick with my tradition of an Irish  coffee at the Irish joint, all the food at he airport sucks
