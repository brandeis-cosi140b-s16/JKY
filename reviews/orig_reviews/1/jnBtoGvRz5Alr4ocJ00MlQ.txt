Looking for good tacos? Then look elsewhere. The meat is bland and very dry, the fish & chicken, super bland. Some may find this place as OK as long as they have never had really good tacos or Mexican food before.  If your idea of Mexican food is The likes of Taco Bell or the drive thru taco/burro shop, then this place may be your step up. If you know and like real Mexican food because this this is Arizona & all, you will be very disappointed with the food at Blanco.
