Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night.
We sat down for what seemed like forever before a
single waiter/waitress acknowledged our existence.
Yeah - so we looked like a sorry bunch of recently
released inmates all liquored up and nowhere to go
but still! So finally this waiter tries to take our
drink orders. We ordered a round and asked for menus.
We were then told that they stop serving actual food
around 10pm even though the place will serve alcohol
till 2am. Really? You have a crapload of people all
drinking and getting loaded for the next four hours
but you don't want to serve food anymore because 
you'd rather give that business to one of your many
competitors nearby? What kind of North Korean rocket
scientist running this place came up with that idea?
It's ok though because a competitor DID make quite a
few $$$ off us that night on both drinks AND food. 
And next time we'll know not to bother wasting our 
time here.
