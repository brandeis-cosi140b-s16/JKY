Horrible service. I didn't even get to eat the food because I was waiting so long. They guaranteed that if we sat at the bar we would get a table within 10 - 15mins. That didn't happen in fact it looked like they forgot about us. I even inquired about our placement and they ensured they didn't forget. Plus they said oh we will get you guys menus and they never did. of course I attempted to ask but couldn't get anyone's attention so we left. Do yourself a favor and go to some other Mexican restaurant if you want to eat and be served properly.
