DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE! I have been here one time before tonight and the service was TERRIBLE! That was 5 months ago. I took my friend here tonight for her birthday, and I was reminded why it has been so long since I came back. 

   I ordered the Crab Enchiladas, the crab tasted like it had been sitting at room temp all day.  My boyfriend ordered the Mahi-Mahi, it seriously tasted like they opened a can of tuna fish and slopped some smokey tasting brown sour cream on top. I took one bite of the enchiladas and almost became ill. Our SERVER was nowhere to be seen for 25 mins, at this point my boyfriend had became too hungry to wait and ate his canned tuna. My girlfriend had finished her chicken dish.  Finally when our server returned,I began describing to her how sour our fish tasted, and she kind of half listened to what I said and then took my plate away. She returned with a business card that had 20.00 dollars written on the back of the card in blue ink and a scribble to the left of it and said it was a gift card. 

    We ordered a dessert, that was okay, I expect that being an Arizona native, (Mexican restaurants don't always have the best desserts)then the bill came with all our food on it. This included the dish I DIDN'T eat. I asked for a manager, 10 minutes later a manager came over and told me what their policy is. Their policy is anti customer service. The manager actually started to argue with me, as I tried to explain my rational... By the way she was also a server working in the restaurant there. 15 minutes later our server comes back with our new check, we paid it and said good riddance! 

   I have lived here all my life, to everyone who is not familiar with Mexican restaurants here, Espinosas in Chandler (hole in the wall) and Barrio Cafe are the best by far that is in Arizona.
