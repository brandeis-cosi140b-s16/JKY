We tried Fausto's because we were in the neighborhood and the reviews were great. We were sorely disappointed beginning with not being greeted at the counter. The order taker was pointedly rude and would not even make I contact. We asked for a cup of tapwater and we were told that they only have bottled water, yet when we went to the Coke machine we saw that they do have a dispenser for water. 

The food we ate was average at best.The beans were extremely bland and had the texture of baby food. The tortillas were great. The salsa was okay but did not have any real flavor.

As we were leaving we mentioned to the man at the register that the Coke machine does dispense water. I suggested that maybe they could offer a cup for sale to future customers. The man behind the register was very gruff and put out and said "we don't do that." I got the impression that he was a hateful person. Perhaps we weren't the right color to be in their establishment. As I was speaking to him he turned his back to me as if to ignore me. As I was leaving he said something under his breath to me. Obviously something more intended for his coworkers to hear as in an insult or something. I asked him to repeat himself and he ignored me. I bet karma has something terrible in store for him.

Needless to say we won't be returning to Fausto's. I would not recommend it to anyone especially if you don't happen to be of Latin descent. You will likely get a cool reception and be disappointed with the average quality. Good food can make up for average service, but average food will never make up for poor service. Do yourself a favor and keep looking for a better restaurant.
