Horrible Service! The hostess had no idea what was going on. Seemed as if she was seating people in whichever order she felt like it. People who were there after us were seated before us and we were seated before people who were there before us. A group walked in shortly after us who had reservations and the hostess still made them wait over 30 minutes. The group told her that is not right that she is seating people before them, shortly after the manager comes and asks them to leave because of the profane language that was used towards his staff. She blatantly lied (no profanity was used) and the manager didn't even take the time to ask what happened. We chose to stay out of it as we were hungry and didn't want to be asked to leave as well but this was WRONG! They need a lesson in customer service. Once seated the food was ok. There are much better restaurants on the strip. I wouldn't waste my time or money here.
