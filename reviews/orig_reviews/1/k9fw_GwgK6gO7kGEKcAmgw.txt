Over priced with a menu smaller than my chances at finally hitting a 12 on the Field line. 

Group of four entered Saturday night hoping for drinks, food and HD to watch football. The food menu is small with maybe 10 items, all pricey given the expected quality.  Granted we were on the strip during Christmas week - one of the slowest in Vegas - so the "lively" reviews in other posts definitely were not relevant on our trip.  Perhaps  they were under-staffed with the slow week as well as we did not see a waiter at our table in the 5 minutes after we were sat.  Couple that lack of attention and (gasp) standard def TV's showing the football game... we got up and left.  We wound up at Nine Fine Irishmen in NYNY FYI.  Separate review but here's a hint - more stars than Diablo's.  

The only thing Diablo's is good for is the sidewalk on the north side of their building serves as a nice shortcut when walking from NYNY to the new Aria.
