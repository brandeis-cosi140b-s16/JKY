A good friend of mine celebrated her birthday here, because she thought it would be a great place to experience.  When she announced that her birthday dinner would be at Chayo, I was excited.

But...the service is awful and the food is edible. 

If you're sitting upstairs, don't order soup because your order is filled downstairs and they often forget or just won't fill the order. After I received my entrée, I realized I was missing my soup and mentioned it to our server. The response was, "Oh, they usually forget to fill soup orders. Did you want me to bring it up?" Ugh. Really? I ordered it, didn't I? 

The food came to the table completely out of order. Hot mess! The birthday girl was soooo not happy. I felt awful. At this point, I would not recommend this place unless Beyoncé dines here and makes a huge deal out of it. Sad. They have so much potential.
