Trying to exit the casino to get some fresh air and some decent food (also not overly priced), we realized that there were no exit signs and the workers wouldn't give us correct directions out, so we settled for Hussong's. Our first entree after a long day of climbing was a plate of chicken nachos covered in some odd white cheese sauce. We scarfed them down, they didn't taste half bad going down but coming out was another story. We were sick the rest of the night and following day from food poisoning. 
I went to go talk to the manager, face still pale I could hardly look in the restaurant, The manager basically said that no one else got sick so too bad for us. The best he could conjure up was "maybe" offering us some more food if we called some other number. I didn't want to risk throwing up again so I settled for this yelp review... 

next time we'll stay at the camp ground instead of enter a land of greed driven frat party hell, all well vomiting.
