The server seemed to think I was just a poor kid who wouldn't tip. So he was rude, took forever to bring my check and didn't even ask why I pushed my plate to the other side of the table with most of my food still on it. The Arizona burrito was a soggy pile of blandness. 
Oh how tempted I was to prove him right on that tip.
