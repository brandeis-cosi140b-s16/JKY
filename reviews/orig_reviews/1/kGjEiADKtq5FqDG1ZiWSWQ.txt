Sucked in by the "Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives" exposure, what a disappointment!!  The quality of the food was what you would get at a cafeteria and the prices were steep.  We ordered the veggie burrito, smothered along with a shrimp burrito.  Had one bite of the veggie burrito and just couldn't do it.  The shrimp burrito was tolerable, but nothing I'd order again.  The restaurant was clean and the ambiance was cute, the only two positives I can draw from this visit.
