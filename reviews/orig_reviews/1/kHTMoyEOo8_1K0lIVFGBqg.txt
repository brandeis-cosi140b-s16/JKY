So I was gonna meet my co workers here for a pregame drinking party before our company party at Dave and busters. I was the first one to arrive and waited 22 minutes before a server finally came over and said how can I help you. I refused service saying I've been here for 22 minutes. All she said was "I apologize, what can I get you to drink" I said I was gonna bring my party somewhere else and she didn't even care. I talked to a manager and didn't even offer to buy a round of drinks or take care of us at all. It's like they don't care and all that takes to serving is to look pretty. I've been a server for 6 years and I would dance circles against any of the servers at sandbar. Save your money and go somewhere else where they care about guests. I wish there was a negative star rating!!!
