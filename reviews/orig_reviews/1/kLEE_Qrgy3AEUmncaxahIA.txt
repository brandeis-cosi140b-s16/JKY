No! 

Listen, Vegas..I love you, I live in you, you are  my soulmate, you make me great food, you're cheap, you're hot, and you're pretty.....That being said, STOP trying to change into something you're not!!

I get it.. Downtown is cleaning up, getting trendy..I am all on board with it.. I am even embracing the hipsters , or are they still the regular DT homeless?  I can't tell, they both dress in ripped clothing and don't shower.. 

I have even grown to love Commonwealth and their over priced drinks made by *cringe* mixologists.. I'm trying, but I usually just hangout at The Griffin or Insert Coins until the terrible DJs show up. 

but La Comida, has no excuse to be pretentious and grossly over priced. It is a Mexican Restaurant off Fremont.   It's great to makeover downtown to a cool artsy, hip town..but does that mean I have to pay $10 for a beer and a million dollars for tasteless ceviche?  My friends and I went here for the restaurants first brunch,  they ordered what was a sad attempt at a breakfast burrito, which looked suspiciously like the ones from McDonalds, and I had some dry tasteless French Toast that cost me $15..  Sighhh..  

I will stick to one of the other dozen AUTHENTIC Downtown Mexican restaurants.. I will gladly substitute the trendy atmosphere and crappy over priced food for a hole in the wall, cheap delicious experience.    

My darling Vegas, being trendy doesn't mean you have to be lazy,expensive, and pretentious. If I wanted that,  I wouldn't have left that bitch L.A. to be with you.
