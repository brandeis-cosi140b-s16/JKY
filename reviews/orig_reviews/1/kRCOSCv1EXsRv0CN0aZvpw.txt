I had such high hopes for this place but it was not good at all.  This is the only time that I have left my table at a restaurant to go to the bar to get a refill on my soda.  The bartender shot our server some nasty looks but he apparently didn't care.  We ordered two sets of nachos, one chicken and one beef, and they were comparable to what one would have at Taco Bell.   Pass.
