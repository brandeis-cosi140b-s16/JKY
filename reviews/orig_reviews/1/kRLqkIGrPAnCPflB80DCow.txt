Service I received was even worse, although I think it all depends on which server you get. My waitress was very much lost. First she took my order. She came back to repeat my food order. She returned later to ask what drink I ordered. After a minute she asked again what food I ordered.  Kicker is, food was barely a notch above Taco Bell, only way overpriced.
