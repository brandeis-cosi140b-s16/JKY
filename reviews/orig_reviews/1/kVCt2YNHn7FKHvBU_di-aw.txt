Worst restaurant ever, use to be real good but over the yrs it went down hill!  Guess their more into the money than the food ...  So where to begin ...

If u actually turn the lights up or use the light on ur phone you'll see that the place is really dirty and not clean.  My kid dropped his toy and I had to use my phone to look for it under the booth and it looks like it hasn't been swept in yrs.  The menus have old crusty food still on it and haven't been updated or replaced since the last time I was here in 2006.  

Waiters are either rude or doesn't speak English, told him several times please quit grabbing stuff over my plate.  I will not be coming back to this place!
