My husband and I stopped in one evening and were treated like dirt! We waited at the hostess stand for 5 minutes before walking in and seating ourselves. Then we were asked why we were sitting at a table by a waitress and when we told her the hostess never came to seat us she just said okay and never returned to take our drink order or give us a menu. So we moved to the inside bar and were ignored by 3 different bartenders who services everyone else but us! Total and absolute disrespect! I will never and I mean NEVER step foot in this place again! Piss poor service all around!
