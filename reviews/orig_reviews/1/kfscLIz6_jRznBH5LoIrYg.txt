Atmosphere was great.  Service was ok until we waited 20min to pay our bill. We were sick of waiting and had exact change so we took the bill to the bartender. The waiter had the nerve to run out and stop us until he "verified". Really?! Now your present to your table? Then the bouncer had the nerve to tell is to get lost after we paid and tipped? Terrible way to ensure customers return. I and two others will not be returning and will discourage others of going.
