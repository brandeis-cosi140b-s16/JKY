I bet some of you that know me ask if there's any food place I don't like.  Well here you go, and I'm being generous.  I've been here before with so-so feelings about it but my latest lunch visit made it clear that this wasn't the place for my Mexican butt.

I was here for business purposes so I wasn't really paying too much attention to the menu and just went for the lunch special of two enchilada style tamales, both with pork.  Bad idea, as it seems the sauce just overpowered everything else and they certainly didn't taste like tamales.  The worst part?  The terrible feeling I had in my tummy the rest of the day!  I ended up skipping dinner because of it!  that's right, me Leo, skipping dinner!  That's unheard of!  You know what, just from thinking about it, I'm going to lower my review from two stars to one!
