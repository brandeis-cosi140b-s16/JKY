VERY disappointing. This used to be one of my favorite places in the neighborhood but the quality of the food and service has gone WAY downhill recently. The elephant garlic appetizer is still decent but most everything else has changed for the worse. I used to LOVE the carne adovada but now its just a small portion of pulled pork in a lame red sauce. (the carne adovada at Four Peaks in Tempe remains my absolute favorite). I grew up on New Mexican cuisine and fell in love with Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos when I moved here 13 years ago. Up until recently, Secreto was a contender. After the embarrassment of taking out of town clients there last week for terrible food and service, I'll never go there again.
