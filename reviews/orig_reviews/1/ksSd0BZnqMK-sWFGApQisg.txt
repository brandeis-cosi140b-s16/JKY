Apparently footware is very important if you decide to patronize this establishment.  We were turned away because members of our party were wearing "Jordan shoes" I'm assuming this is some sort of an act of discrimination.

 I will tell you this; I will reach out to the owner to describe my discontent.  In the long game though, they won't be in business for long so I'm not sure how much it matters.
