El Hefe...hmmmm! Taco Bell has better service and food! It's overpriced and the service is awful. The so called manager, Tina, did nothing and was unapologetic. We later find out she's not even a manager. The food was bland and salty. They messed up our simple order...and 20 min later the order is still not out. We left. We should of went to Salty Se√±oritas for Mexican.
