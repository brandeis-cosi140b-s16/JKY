I used to go to Jalapenos many years ago before they had a fire.  My friend and I checked it out tonight and were pleasantly surprised.  The layout is completely different, the menu is much more extensive and expensive ( OK though).  Our waitress JJ was right on the ball with drinks and our food order.  I had the shrimp tacos and they were quite good.  My friend had the seafood enchilada and said it was very good also.  We have one complaint though, and it's a big one for us.  This was something we didn't notice until after we ordered and the food arrived.  The people behind us had a dog in the restaurant and it wasn't a service dog.  The dog was medium sized and in some kind of nylon carrier with screened sides, and an open unzipped top.  When we mentioned to our waitress that it's against the law she said "Oh, it's OK it's in a carrier".  That did it for us, we will never go back there again. Instead of 3 or 4 stars we give it a one because of the dog.
