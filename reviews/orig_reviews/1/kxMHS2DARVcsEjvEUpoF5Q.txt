The interior was beautiful but the food....not so much. We went during lunch and three of us had different meals. None of us liked what we ordered. For the price, I think not. And to be honest, even if the food was cheap I would still say no thank you. Good try though.
PS Don't expect salt and peper shakers because they don't have any.
