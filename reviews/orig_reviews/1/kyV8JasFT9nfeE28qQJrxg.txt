I have visited this establishment several times (15+).  I have left another review under a different user name, however; tonight I am done with this place.  I ordered food to go at the bar.  I received my order (unchecked since it's been great previously), got home, and it was wrong.  I live less than 2 miles from this place and the hospitality was less than gracious after paying them.  

I asked either my food be replaced and delivered after having to drive there myself or my money be refunded.  The joke was on me.  The management was the epitome of backing up an employee who got stuff wrong.  Unfortunately, the conversation was left that I was incorrect.  

I typically abuse YELP for recommendations, and, I know it's bad to rely on others.  However; after this experience, I'm all in on reviews. 

After calling the offer was for me to come back, get a new entree and leave.  No way to get a credit for what I paid for initially.  I will never go back. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE .

Whoops.  Bonito Michoacan IS SO MUCH BETTER ANYWAY!!!!!!!
