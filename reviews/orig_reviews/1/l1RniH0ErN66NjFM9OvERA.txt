Poor customer service. We put our name down on the wait list, they gave us a call at 2:44pm to let us know our table was ready, we call them at 2:50pm to tell them we are on our way, we show up at 2:56pm and the rude hostess tells us they gave our table away because it had been more than 18 minutes. We showed her the time stamped call on our iPhone and she still refused to seat us. As a new resident of Charlotte, I will not be going here ever again.
