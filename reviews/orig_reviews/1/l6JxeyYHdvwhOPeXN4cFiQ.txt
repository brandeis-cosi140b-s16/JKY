This place is awful. The customer service is non existent. And when I ordered my food, the girl literally cut my order off to point out a person passing by, giggle and then keep talking about them while I was standing there. Then, when I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, she was so inattentive that she asked me if I ordered steak twice and I had to repeat chicken three times in literally less than thirty seconds. Come on girl, you can't be that dumb, you're just bad at your job. Half of these people here need to be fired. Extremely unprofessional. If you hate your job, leave it...but I guess no one would hire these people anyway. Did I mention the food sucks?
