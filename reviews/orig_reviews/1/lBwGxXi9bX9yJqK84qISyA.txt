I had a char grilled chicken single taco platter for $5.99. $1.50 extra for char grilled chicken. I guess grilling is so much more expensive than... It came with rice and beans.  Looked like about 2oz of chicken were on the tortilla, which was more than enough because the chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it. It was like chicken leather. pretty sure it wasn't grilled that day. $6.49 for a taco rice and beans that were inedible. I guess the $1.50 extra is to cover all the extra gas they use to ruin chicken on the grill.

Obviously they don't pay attention or care what they are serving people.
