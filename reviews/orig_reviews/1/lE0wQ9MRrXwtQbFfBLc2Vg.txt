We were looking forward to some Mexican beer, margaritas, and snack food. This was NOT the place we were hoping for. It took much too long for our server, Ellyn, to first check in with us. I chose one of the "skinny margaritas." It was one of the worst cocktails I have ever had. The calamari was fishy in flavor and aroma. The nachos were dry. When Ellyn finally came to check on us after the food was delivered, I had a list of four things to ask for including appetizer plates and salsa. She was quick to walk away as I was still asking for the first thing on the list. 

This was a very disappointing experience. I can say with absolute certainty that we will not return to San Felipe's Catina.
