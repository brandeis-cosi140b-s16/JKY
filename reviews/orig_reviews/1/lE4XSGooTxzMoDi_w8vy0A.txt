AVOID THE TEQUILA TASTING. Unless you really just want shots (not tasting), standing in long lines,  and being surrounded by copious amounts of drunken twenty-somethings. 

I bought a "Google Offers" for tequila tasting for myself and a friend. I had called to see how it was ran and what to expect. I was told it was similar to a wine tasting experience. LOL! We went upstairs to the bar area, where two elongated utility tables were out. There were two representatives offering (approximately) two ounce shots in small, plastic "sauce" cups. Which, by the way, we never did experience.  We gave up and left after waiting (standing) in line for fifteen minutes. It was more aligned with a keg party.  Not that we were upset, since instead of a sipping and a true tequila experience, we were really in the middle of a "free shot" until you get really, really drunk experience.  We left and headed over to the grapevine instead. Excellent patio, decent cocktails, (unfortunately a poor tequila selection, but that's not what they are known for). 

I do have to say, the manager was kind in an email, but we won't be visiting here again.  I can't comment on the food. 1 star for misrepresenting what they are offering, 4 stars for management. 5 stars to Google Offers for giving me a full refund without any issues.
