Amanda, our server, was the best part of this horrible meal!  Overrated, overpriced, over complicated food!  My salad was anything but colorful, the lettuce was yellow!!!  You are better off going to filibertos.  Sol is another North Scottsdale fancy version of food that should be kept fresh and simple.
