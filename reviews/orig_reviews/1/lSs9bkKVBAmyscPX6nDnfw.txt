This is literally the last time I deal with this location. 

As a general manager of another food establishment I understand the regular issues that can happen;
- someone taking an order incorrectly 
- someone making the order incorrectly 
- someone not performing a final quality check before the order is given to the guest 
These are all things that happen, and I would be the type of person to be understanding due to my job. 
My experience today was beyond unsatisfactory. 
First I called in my order around 12 with a 45 min quote for pick up. That's ok, it's lunch. I am stuck at my job all day anyways 630 am to 7 pm so waiting for a good lunch is worth it. I order the same thing everytime. When Alexis answered the phone she seemed side tracked and not interested; she didn't even repeat the order to me. My order was rang up correctly on my receipt though (I later saw) so it had to be someone on the line. I had my driver pick up the order for me; I buy them lunch every Monday. The total cost of it was $36 and some change, so it should be worth it. When I got my order it was completely wrong. The sauce was wrong. The burrito was wrong. The toppings were wrong. But the receipt was right. 

I call the location back and tell Alexis (who answers the phone again) that I wanted a refund on my burrito (just the part wrong) and she told me to hold and I went to a silent phone. Then mike got on the phone. I ask if he's the manager and he ignored me. He was so rude and short with me plus didn't even know the situation. I re-explained everything to him and he told me a refund couldn't be done without the card present. I ask him again is he the manager and he says no she is on the line. Now, I work at a food place remember? And I know when a guest calls, especially about a refund, you step away and handle the situation. I tell him I will hold till she is done and he says she has a meeting at 230 so she'll call me back before she goes. He takes my name and phone number down, and tells me she will call me back before her meeting. It's now been two hours and no call. 
This is the WORST customer service I have ever experience and if ANY of my employees treated someone this way or my shift leader did not address the situation immediately I would immediately reevaluate their role in my location!!!
