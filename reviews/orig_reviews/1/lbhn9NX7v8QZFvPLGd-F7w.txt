Unfortunately, we never made it to the food, let alone drinks.

We stopped by Tex Tubbs for a quick drink around 11:15 this morning while waiting for Alchemy to open (we were going there for lunch). We were the only 3 in the joint and were told by the 3 staff members chatting at the bar to take a seat wherever. The bartender stopped by our table and we told him we told him the 3 draft beers we had chosen.

5-7 minutes later, the guy was still fiddling around behind the bar doing random stuff other than pouring us our beer. We were seated about 15 ft from the bar, so it was clear to see he had no intention of making his way towards pouring us beer in the next few minutes. We were very confused. The other two staff members were still chatting at the bar.

We decided to just get up and wait outside Alchemy after watching no progress after about 10 minutes. We asked the two girls chatting "Has he poured our beer yet?" They turn around and look at the bar "No, doesn't look like it." We were now more confused. We got up and made our way toward the exit and said "Thanks, we're going to go somewhere else." To which they responded "Sorry."

Tex Tubbs. Get it together or you won't make it, period.
