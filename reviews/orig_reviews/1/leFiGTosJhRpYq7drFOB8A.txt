Staying next door, went in for a cold beer just now and no one would serve us waiters walking around but for 10 min. Two Gals walked in and the waiter went directly over to them. Needless to say we left and came over to the Tilted Kilt and we are now enjoying a cold one after watching Padres in 98 degree weather. Guess if we were young cut girls they might have waited on us.
