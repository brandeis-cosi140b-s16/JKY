Valle Luna just lost our business.  
Never-mind that they would not accept the Restaurants.com certificate from Valle Luna...the service sucked and the food was bland and tasteless. 
We have been customers at Valle Luna on Bell Rd for years, and the service and food is steadily declining.  
Our waitress had no personality, was barely friendly, put her fingers and a potholder in our meals, our drink cups and the chips and salsa were empty most of the time.  
The enchilada sauce was completely bland tasted like it was strait from a can.  Barely any meat in the taco or tamales.  The kids plates could not be considered a meal, maybe a snack, but definitely not worth 4.50.  
On this visit we did not have to wait to be seated, like we normally do, and I think I can see why, if the food and service are this bad all the time now it is not worth the money.  I think the only thing keeping them in business is the happy hour drinks and menus.
I will not be going back again, Valle Luna you just lost a customer.  I will be going to Manual's, or Macayo's, or any one of the other Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  I don't need to pay through the nose for bad service and so so food.
