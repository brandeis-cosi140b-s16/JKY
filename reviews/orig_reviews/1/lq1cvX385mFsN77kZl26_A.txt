YUCK. This has to be the worst tacos I've ever tried!
Between the music ,the look of the place and the food I only needed a shotgun to take me out of my misery. The beef and chicken seemed like they were marinated in toilet water and tasted like it. The recent reviews must of been by college students who were high and don't know good tacos... Run away
TO THE OWNER WHO KEEPS REPLYING BACK TO ME ON YELP 
YOUR FOOD STILL SUCKS AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM COMING DOWN AND SAYING IT TO YOUR FACE! YOU SHOULD BE SPENDING YOUR TIME ON IMPROVING YOUR FOOD NOT ON YELP!!
