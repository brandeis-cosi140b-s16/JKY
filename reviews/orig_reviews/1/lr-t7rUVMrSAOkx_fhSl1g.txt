Walked into a "busy" lunch time. Weren't even greeted but the menus were dropped at our table and the server took off. After waiting 10 minutes and without having been served at least water we took off and no staff had even noticed we were gone. Pricey taco menu. A good street taco is only $1 each. I will never return.
