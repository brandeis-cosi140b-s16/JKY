How can a place called the Pink Taco not have killer tacos on the happy hour menu?  

I had high hopes for this place and they let me down.  Service is slow,  corn tortillas were not good, steak filling was ok, and drinks were a little watered down.  The only really good thing was the bucket of warm chips .
This place should take a happy hour lesson from Tommy Bahamas!  They have killer tacos!
