I tell you what I love chipotle, the food is great... But this specific location sucks. My tacos had no meat in them, the rice was soggy and worst of all the guacamole was not fresh at all. Very disappointed with my experience at this location. Will not come back to this chipotle!  Plus there was way to many people working the line. There was like 6 or 7 people starring at you as you order your food. How uncomfortable!
