This is a great place to enjoy overpriced  poorly conceived Mexican food.  There were no combinations on the menu.  The food was generally bad, and felt like it was prepackaged.  You have to pay for chips and salsa, not just to have chips and salsa on your table, for every order of chips and salsa.  Even the Margarita was bad.
