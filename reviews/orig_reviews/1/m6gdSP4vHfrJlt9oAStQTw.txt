I wish I could tell you what Barrio Cafe is like, but my experience wasn't very helpful.

While traveling, I was at Sky Harbor for a layover between flights and wanted to get some lunch. Barrio Cafe was right next to my gate, so I decided to go for it even though the prices were a little high.

I was seated quickly next to an older couple, and shortly after I was settling into my seat they had an appetizer delivered. I asked them what it was, because it looked quite good, and found out it was the tecate breaded fish and shrimp. I was tempted to grab it for a meal, and thanked them for letting me know.

I perused the menu. No server came by.

I plugged in my phone at the A/C outlet next to the table. No server came by.

The couple next to me finished their meal. No server came by.

The couple requested their check and their waiter dropped it off, then turned and walked away. No server asked if I had been helped.

The couple next to me paid their check and asked "Has anyone even gotten you a drink yet?"

I checked my watch. It had been 15 minutes since I was seated, and I had 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to start boarding. 

I stood up to leave. The waiter who had come by to collect the check from the couple next to me asked how my meal was. I told him I didn't know, since no-one had ever taken my order.

He asked if I wanted to sit back down. I explained to him that I was concerned about missing my connecting flight, and that I really just wanted to get some lunch  quickly.

Instead of letting me go, he gave me a rather nasty look and said "Well, if THAT'S the way you feel, SIR, maybe you /should/ go somewhere else."

I'm very, very glad I didn't give them my money, and if I'm going through Sky Harbor again, I don't intend to ever return.
