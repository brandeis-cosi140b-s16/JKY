We visited Vegas over the holiday weekend and stayed at The HRH and ate at the Pink Taco.  We will never go back.  We were overcharged initially and the server helping us said he credited our card for the overage.  Well we received an alert that they charged us another $10+ the next day and apparently that was a mistake too.  We marched downstairs to talk to the manager and the manager was going to be in later that day.  We gave them our phone number and he did call us back apologized for the multiple mistakes and said he corrected the mistakes and that it would be a couple of days but the credits will show up.  Well we are approaching 6 days and no credit has shown up yet.  We are waiting for the manager to call us back.  We will never be going back nor will we ever stay at this hotel again.  This is ridiculous and a great example of some of the poorest customer service we have ever witnessed.  If you eat there I suggest you pay cash.
