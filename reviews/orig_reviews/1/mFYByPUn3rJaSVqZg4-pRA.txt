Worst mexican meal I've ever had, the burrito was a flour tortilla wrapped around bean goo. They gave me a tiny portion of salsa in a jello shot cup that got me through about a quarter of the burrito which is about all I ate before tossing it all in disgust. To to top it off they have no liquor licence so no beer to chase away the taste. If I was starving and they were the only place open ,I would just continue to starve.
