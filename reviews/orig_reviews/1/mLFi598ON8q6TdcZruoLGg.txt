My bf and I went for dinner on Saturday night.  We made it in time for Happy Hour, so we decided to try a variety of appetizers; carne asada quesadilla, crab cakes, fried oysters, ceviche and calamari.  We concluded that the only appetizer we might order again was the fried calamari.  The rest were just awful.  The crab cakes were not crispy or well-seasoned, the quesadilla was barely warm, the ceviche was extremely bland and the fried oysters tasted "not-so-fresh".  Everything tasted like it had been prepared well in advance and had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Also, not sure if we should blame the kitchen or our server, but all of the appetizers came out at once.  Two people sharing five appetizers should have clued someone in to stagger the items. The best thing going for TQLA is the decor and ambience.  The patio is a really nice feature, too.  It's too bad because we had such high hopes for this new restaurant.  However, if Saute (the previous occupant) couldn't make it serving fantastic food, TQLA, sadly, has no chance of surviving.

One last thing - the booths, oddly, were the most uncomfortable we've ever sat in!
