What a poorly ran bar. I stopped in with my wife and was told that we were not going to be served for a while, then told to move tables. The host was no where to be found and the bartenders just stood around talking. 

I have never been to a senior frogs in the U.S. Unfortunately , won't go back. For such a prime price of real estate on the BLVD, this place is waisting away. On a Saturday night, there was maybe 20 people in the entire bar.  

Ownership either needs to revamp the staff and quality, or make way for a better bar to take this prime spot. Sorry to say.
