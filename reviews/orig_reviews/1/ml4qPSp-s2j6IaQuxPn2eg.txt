Worst. Mexican. Place. Ever. 

This was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area. 

When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....

The black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?

The service was bad, slow and aloof. 

I would rather eat at one of the "bertos" instead of this crap hole. Honestly, save yourself the money and find another Mexican joint. I am in shock that this place has customers.  Not even deserving of one star. That bad.
