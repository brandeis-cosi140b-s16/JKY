The only offal item on the Applebee-style menu was lengua, and that was so dry and tough! Can an authentic Mexican restaurant really not offer other offal options? I think not!

If i wasn't there to meet up with some old friends (who got a recommendation from another friend), I would have turned around and left after just stepping through the front doors.
