First off, I have no complaints on the food. I come here a lot becuase its a nice cheap dinner after I play the tables for a bit. I usually visited Mi casa at least once a week. But now I will never go back. I went last week with my sister to grab some tacos. When seated we noticed this couple seeting near us just staring and acting extremely strange, almost as if they were drunk or on drugs. My sister and I started to feel harrassed by this couple. Come to find out that this couple actually worked at the restaraunt. When I told the manager Deb about our experience and how we were being harrassed she offered no apologies and questioned us as if we were being too sensitive. Meanwhile the employees who we were being harrassed by Cameron and Talia were continuing to laugh at us. I will not only never be back at Mi Casa but I also have no desire to ever play at the silverton again. Do yourself a favor and go to a station casino instead.
