we were enjoying ourselves and having a nice pre dinner drink at the bar and we were told we were too loud. The bar is very loud with upbeat music and crowded with people but the bartender said their standards were higher. We are almost 40 and professional. Then I spoke to the GM and he was unapologetic about the whole thing and said we could leave if we wanted to. Horrifying to be spending upwards of $300 to be spoken to that way. We stayed to assess the food and it ranged from fine to decent to dry and inedible. Please come here if you are elderly and quiet. Apparently the decent music is a front. So lame and disappointing.
