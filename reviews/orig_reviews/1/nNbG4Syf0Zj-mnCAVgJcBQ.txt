My co-worker raved about this place and said it was her favorite Mexican food place. Never again. The food was okay, not bad but not great. Priced very high for what you get. It was very busy, so I understand slow service, but one of the servers knocked a bowl of salsa off the table which hit the floor and sprayed all over me. Salsa in my hair, on my face, neck, blouse, slacks and shoes. Completely covered. They did not acknowledge the incident,  when I asked for more napkins I was made to feel it was an inconvenience. They finally brought me a wet paper towel and the bill at the same time. No discount or offer to clean my outfit. Not even an apology. I had to return to work and meetings stained in salsa. After explaining to other coworkers what had happened, they exchanged stories of their own bad experiences at this Rosita's. Be warned.
