Pros: great views of canal & blackberry mojitos

Cons: terrible & poor quality food. We had the flight of tacos & instead of putting different toppings (e.g. Sliced cabbage, lettuce, etc), they got lazy & put diced onions across ALL of the tacos.  I've eaten here previously & loved the tacos. Now, I don't even want to return. The chopped salad was also not fresh & we were convinced the chicken was going to give us food poisoning. Meat just shouldn't smell or taste like it was made last week.

Lastly, the server put the wrong order of tacos on our table & had to swap it out while we were mid bite. Overall, just a horrible experience. We ended up going to Chipotle around the corner & happily munched on food that wasn't going to make us sick!  I did NOT come to Vegas to eat at Chipotle, but that just shows how bad this place was.
