I've had YELP for a very long time and I've never written a review. However, my experience was so horrible that I had to write my first one. I want to make sure nobody comes here and wastes their money. The only thing good about this place is their location and their patio. The food runs anywhere from $9-13 for three tacos and two measly sides. The night was very nice, so we decided to check out VIDA and sit on the patio. The busy intersection is nice and excellent back drop. We placed our orders and thought the food would be excellent, especially at prices of $9-13 for tacos. Well the fish tacos had fried fish that seems like something from a cafeteria, and the steak tacos had two very small pieces of steak and was extremely greasy. I literally felt like I was robbed. DO NOT waste your money here. Only go here for the Monday night drink specials. Tacobell's food A+ compared to VIDA.
