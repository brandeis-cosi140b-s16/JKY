We were hungry before our flight to Fort Lauderdale so decided to get a couple of breakfast burritos. The burritos looked really good, that was the best part of the experience. The line to order was complete chaos, but hey, it's an airport so I forgive them. However, once we reached the register, the girl who takes the orders, and you know who you are, is the rudest employee I have ever encountered in any restaurant in my entire life. I almost walked away before ordering, which would have been the correct decision, but my family and I were starving and had already waited in line. I ordered two bacon breakfast burritos, and the rude employee yelled to me with attitude that my number is 2! This was also confirmed on my receipt that she gave me, number 2. Now, I waited amidst the chaos for the food to get done (took about 10 minutes), and then the girl yells out number 6! Nobody goes up to the counter, nobody had a number 6. Then she yells out, two bacon breakfast burritos! I went up to the counter and let her know, I think that's mine, but my order is number 2. She shoves the bag of food into my hands, rolls her eyes, and walks away. I was blown away that these people are still in business! I wish I had the girl's name, as I would be happy to pass it along to airport management. She was about 5'5, had black hair, was a thin Mexican, was working on Saturday February 8th at 9:00 a.m on the register at the walk up window. The food was absolutely terrible by the way, it was the worst breakfast burrito I have had in my life hands down. Sonic makes a better breakfast burrito, and I HATE Sonics breakfast burrito. Two burritos, a water and a chocolate milk were $22.68.Save your money!
