Oh my...one word terrible. Went to Calico jacks on Mother's day. First, the service was horrible. It's like the waitress didn't want to work. No drink refills, no one even came to check on us. For all they know we could have left and they wouldn't haven't cared. Second, food was terrible, no flavor. Last the drinks, if I order a drink and you don't have the mixing ingredients, don't try to make something just come tell me. Drinks were horrible. Will not go back. If I was the owner I would fire everyone and start over.
