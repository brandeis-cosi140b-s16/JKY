Miserable carne asada. True garbage served to me this past week.that my dog (if I had one) would not even eat. Numerous fatty pieces of carne asada inside my tiny $7 small burrito. I had maybe two good bites and then things started falling apart with fat chunk 1 and 2, etc. I unwrapped the burro and dumped the contents out and all you see is white fat. Who is in charge of quality control at this dump or maybe America (she is a woman) just thinks that tons of fat belong in carne? Wrong. This was a performance worthy of deportation and a visit by Sheriff Joe. Send the Carne back to Mexico por favor.
