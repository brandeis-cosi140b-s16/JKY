Absolutely the worst manager/ owner (supposedly) Maria. She is a the rudest and most disrespectful human-being, oh and her customer service sucks!! I picked up food & the container broke completely & pierced the bag & left sauce all over my car. I called to complain & she said "bring it back but not my fault if U drive crazy!!! " WHAT A B$*^#?!!!! When I arrived she then said, "not my problem!" Gave me my money back & said I was not welcomed back!!! She blamed me- the paying customer!!! DO NOT GIVE THEM UR $$$!!!! Not worth the disrespect!!
