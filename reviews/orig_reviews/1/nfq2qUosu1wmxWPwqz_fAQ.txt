Do NOT go here right now. 
I am sure this will be a great restaurant once they iron out all the kinks. We went last night with a party of 8, so yes it was a larger party, but 4 of the diners were kids eating off the kids' menu. Not too hard, right?!? We arrived at 6:05 at 7:22 we asked our server what was taking so long and if they could please just bring out the kids' cheese crisps. At 7:35 Two Adult entrees came out, and were cold. At that point we told our server the kids were "done" and we wanted to leave. He came back with the FULL check (even though we had still not received over half our food) luckily at this piont the manager had overheard our disappointment and told the server he would take care of it. Got home at 8:00 and instead of relaxing and enjoying the rest of our Friday night, I got to cook dinner for my family.
Loved the quaint feel of the restaurant, and hope they work out all their problems. This could be a great restaurant in the future.....just not right now. :(
