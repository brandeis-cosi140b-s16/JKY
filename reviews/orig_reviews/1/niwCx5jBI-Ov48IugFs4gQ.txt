Went to dinner here last night for my birthday. We had previously eaten here in May, 2013. That time we enjoyed the meal very much and planned on going back again for a special occasion. This time in no way resembled the previous experience. I had the # 1 combination of chile rellenos, chicken enchilada, and a beef taco. The rellenos was covered in some generic tomato sauce and was bland tasting. The cheese was very stringy and tasteless. The enchilada was so-so and the beef taco was almost Inedible. Beef was dry and the taco shell was hard as a rock. My date had a green chile burrito that had big chunks of pork instead of shredded, the chicken taco also had big chunks of chicken instead of shredded, and her cheese enchilada was basically a tortilla rolled up with sauce and cheese on top. She didn't care for any of it. She also ordered sopapillas to be served with our meal, and they showed up 15 minutes after the entree. When we asked where they were the waitress said they were "cooking them fresh".The bean dip was also bland and the chips were stale. Being a Specialty Room Chef in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I know good food. My hunch is that management has sourced cheaper product to cut cost and the quality dropped immensely, or the kitchen staff totally changed and doesn't produce the same quality as the staff from last year's visit. Lastly the table in our booth wobbled and we felt like we were sitting way to low, with the table height up to chest level because of the worn out seating. Also the music could drop a few decibels. It's not a nightclub. Needless to say I would never go back. Chipotle or even Taco Bell would be a preferred dining choice.
