So I heard from friends this pace is so good, I decided to give it a try. I was probably 10th in line and was waiting a good 30 minutes in line, several times I told myself just leave other times I said I want to know what the hype was about. Finally get up there and I order the barbacoa burrito enchilada style. I'm skiing the guy how do I order because this is my first time here, let's just say he rolled his eyes and was annoyed I was asking questions. The food looked great. I sat down a dug in my burrito. It was the most disgusting  burrito I ever had, it tasted like I put a spoon full of sugar in my mouth. Last time I checked Mexican meat doesn't taste like that. I'll never come back again. I'll stick to authentic Mexican food/restaurants
