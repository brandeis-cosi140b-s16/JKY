I ate at the original barrio cafe on 16th which was very good and interesting (maybe a little overpriced) but definetly recommended.  The airport barrio cafe was like the owner lost control of the car and drove off the road that has taken them to success.  I ordered a burrito (don't remember which) but it was soggy, with what tasted like canned chicken and a ton of sour cream.  Nasty!!
