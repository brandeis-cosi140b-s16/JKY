Just got home from my 3rd time at this place. I ordered...

Quesadilla.. Cheese is not melted all the way and the bag had no hot sauce, nor was I offered any.

Asada burrito.. Meat was cooked, then stored in the fridge, then taken out and put in a tortilla. The drive home was less 3 minutes and no way does meat cool to fridge temp, wrapped in a tortilla, wrapped in foil, and bagged, this fast.

What I don't understand is why this took 10 minutes and what the hell were they doing with the grill? 

If hind sight was 20/20 I would have gone elsewhere..
