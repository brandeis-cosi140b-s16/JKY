This place is terrible. They don't comply with operation hours and choose to close whenever they want. It's 7:30pm on Monday, and Yelp has listed they should be open until 8pm. We roll up and the building is pitch black. 

What happened America's?! You used to be a really good spot. Now you've closed down locations and operate inconsistently.
