Wow, for a walk up Mexican place, this place is disgustingly overpriced.. I got a two shrimp taco combo meal, and it ran me 8 bucks and change.. They have a chip and salsa bar THAT THEY CHARGE YOU FOR.. They also charge for refills.. This place really nickle and dimes you.. The food was the tiniest portions ever too.. My shrimp tacos, albeit tasty, were in the really really tiny tortillas, I finished my whole meal in less than 5 minutes.. If you want a similarly good restaurant, go to Sorranos, prices are about the same and it's a sit down place, they also give you unlimited chips, salsa and bean dip
