Three stars for the food and our MMA Attendant. He was great but his ability to earn was constrained by the snail paced bartenders. It took 25 minutes to get a beer and a cocktail.  Am I being an impatient @$$ you might wonder? Last February I had a going away party for 30 guests, and I had called days in advanced to allow for proper staffing, we were told we'd have a dedicated Attendant, and there were several times we were without drinks for 20 minutes plus. The service was so bad the managers comped 4 bottles of bottom shelf house tequila and vodka and a 20% discount on our bill. We did t drink the comped bottles but it's the thought that counts.... I guess. 

So here we are, six months later and the same thing is happening with the bar. We got water, ordered our drinks, ordered guacamole, joked with our awesome Attendant but no beer and signature drink. Now I've just worked a very busy day at a strip hotel, my group had 4 big parties this night, I am hangry, dehydrated and want a beer and my lovely lady is so amazingly sweet and calm, my beacon of light, who prevented me from being overtly hangry...for too long...

Anyway, the food is still fantastic. The chicken fajita was great, my seafood enchilada was okay, unfortunately, being next to the strip club brings a clientele wearing skimpy and revealing clothing, but if you're an event planner for a corporation or from out of town and on the conservative side, this is not the place for you.  This place has the potential to be great but it's more like a pig with lipstick.
