Place is a filthy hole in the wall. Food is awful. Chicken tastes old.... And I'm only talking about a chicken taco. The Salsa bar is a joke. The salsa is watered down and tastes like garbage. A salsa bar is a horrible idea to begin with... Breeds germs. The bathrooms are filthy which makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. A strong 1 star restaurant.
