My hubby and I recently moved from OR to AZ and have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the area, so we wanted to try Los Olivos. We had dinner at Los Olivos this evening and were very dissappointed of the food quality and taste!! We had sopes as an appetizer and as a main entry, my hubby had camarones al mojo de ajo (shrimps in garlic) and I had Flautas Ana. We didn't like any of these dishes we tried. :( Too greasy and no good taste! We are not coming back at all!

Service was okay.
