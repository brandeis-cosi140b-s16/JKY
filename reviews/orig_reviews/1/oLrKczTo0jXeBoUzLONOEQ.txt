The service was very, VERY poor.  Waited for a complete hour before getting water at the table.  This was after ordering food.  The food was of course even later in arriving than the water.  Were told that they only had two staff persons in the kitchen.  When the meals did arrive they did not arrive all at the same time or even close (first meal came and than had to wait for over 15 min more for the last meal to arrive).  On top of this the food was plain and boring.  A burrito to me has the the veggies(or meat) plus rice, beans, lettuce and salsa.  (Yes this is an "American" burrito, but I get this kind of burrito at many southern CA Mexican restaurants and it is what I have come to expect.)   What I received at La Casa Blanca (after I had to tell them what to put in) was bland and tasteless.  It was mostly tortilla and very little filling.  I will not patronize this establishment again.
