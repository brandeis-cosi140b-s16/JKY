I have to start off on a good note. .  the meat fillings in my tacos were tender and seasoned beautifully . .   enough said . . my taco was a slimy mess. . the FLOUR tortillas were drenched and turned doughy and nasty.   Upon returning inside to see if i could remedy the situation I was met with an impromptu line and had to wait ten minutes to get a corn tortilla and a fork.   Come on now. . . can you make a fork accessible to your patrons?   So I informed the young girl at the counter i was unhappy with the tortillas and she pointed to a VERY SMALL sign that said corn tortillas now available. . woohoo   We are in Arizona for Christ's sake . . tacos normally come in corn tortillas. . . flour should be the second choice.  So she charged me for a couple corn tortillas that were old and dry . . they tore in two when i folded them. .  So upset with my experience i folded my soggy mess up and discarded it.   and  I HATE to waste food.
