I ordered chicken nachos, it was a terrible choice. The chicken looked and tasted like canned shredded chicken. I was scared to eat it. I did eat the spoonful of beans that were on them,  along with the chips and guac. That was all on my plate that looked worth eating. I won't be back for at least a year or never. I hate it when my meal is tasteless:( ruined!
On a positive note I only had to pay 1/2 price due to happy hour.
