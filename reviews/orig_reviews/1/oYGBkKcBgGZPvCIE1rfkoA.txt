Decided to give Frank & Lupe's another shot since we were heading to Brush Bar again for an evening of painting fun. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cut it. 

The service was indifferent, rude, and was clearly not interested in us just like the previous visit. We were seated right in the main dining room so no matter what our server had to do, he had to walk by us each and every time. He forgot drinks, food was served to us cold, didn't even bring the appetizer we ordered. If he tried any harder to ignore us, it would have been downright funny. 

The biggest turn off was the glass of water he served to one of my dinner guests which was rimmed with ANTS. It was almost like they dipped the rim of the glass into a whole pile of the dead ants before serving it. How he missed it, I'll never know. It was disgusting. Not an apology. Not a discount offered. Nothing. 

This was the most piss-poor service I have received in a restaurant in a long time and you can bet your last dime it's the last time Frank & Lupe's will ever see me or the 8 other guests I brought.
