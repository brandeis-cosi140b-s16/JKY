We went to Nacho Daddy because a friend asked us to meet her there.  Service was slow, but they were busy.  Had a decent experience told the server we were in a hurry to the airport.  We hand him our credit card and left.  The food was actually good.  I called back and said that our bill was over charged by $10.  Our sandwiches were on the chalkboard special.  The waiter agreed, apologized, and said it would be corrected.  Few days later, my bill was changed 3.57 on my credit card.  Called back, told the manager the situation, asked that the bill be corrected once again.  He then haggled over item per item and came up the accurate  total while offering to change it, but due to his attitude over the "few" bucks.  I just said, " you know what leave the bill".  I will not be back and will not be recommending you.  This prompted my first review on Yelp, so here it is.  If a manager has no interest in maintaining a new customer, then I have no interest in saying that you will get any of my business, but two calls worth of hassle to fix a bill that they admitted was wrong to begin with.  No offer to discount the bill, come in get a free appetizer, etc.....I have thousands of choices in Las Vegas, Nacho Daddy is now not one...and like I said the food was actually good, but why go where your business is not valued.

lol, I like this yelp thing, no more sending emails to businesses to get back a "so sorry".  Feels good to know that the businesses are held accountable for their service standards.
