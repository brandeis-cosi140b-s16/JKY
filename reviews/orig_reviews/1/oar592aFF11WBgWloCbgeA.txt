stayed at the cosmopolitan over the valentine holiday and i had the the chance to eat the china poblano...the Chinese food was horrible tasted like DOG FOOD, the hot and sour soup tasted like soy sauce was the only ingredient in the damn thing, the 16.00 bowl of fried rice tasted like shit it was salty as hell. Stevie wonder could of done a better job. I'll"ll never eat there again. their Mexican food was some what decent. i actually liked the tendon burrito sorry i forgot the name . i cant believe they serve that overpriced crap!!!! china poblano should be only serving food to the Clark county jail...NEVER AGAIN shame on cosmopolitan hotel hope that place catches on fire...
