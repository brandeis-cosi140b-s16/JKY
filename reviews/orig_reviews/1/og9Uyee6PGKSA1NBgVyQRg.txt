I figured with all the good reviews that I would love this place. I was wrong. I ordered the chile green and red burritos, one of each just in case I didn't like the other. Both tasted pretty nasty to me. I was hoping it would have at least a semi authentic taste, but the meat tasted as if it came from a can, and not off the bone. I could only stomach about 3 bites of each.
