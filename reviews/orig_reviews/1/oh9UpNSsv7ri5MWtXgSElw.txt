Had wanted to try them again since they re-opened, but sadly disappointed! Walked in at 8:30pm and they said they were closed. Then they said they could do take out. Really?!! You have an open sign out that says you don't close until 9:00pm and instead of taking customers you turn them away?! We can't seat you, BUT we can still make the food and take your money if you take it and leave. No apology or explanation or come back and we'll give you a free dessert- anything? Again 8:30PM not 8:55pm- Needless to say we won't be back. There are too many other options with better service and the food is just a cheaper copy cat of Tia Rosa's around the corner. I'll pay more for some place that actually cares about customer service.
