ugh I wish there was no stars!  my experience in this place was pretty bad. service was not good and the  place wasn't even busy at that time ! the  food was really pricey i normally don't care as long as the food is amazing  but the food was OK. one of the people in my group ordered her dish with no meat and  when they brought all the plates out turned out they made all of them vegetarians so  we had to wait for them to remake our food  we all ate at different times, my coffee came late it seemed like the waiter totally forgot about it , I had to remind him. they brought us chips and salsa(since they re not complimentary) so we could much on something while we waited but it just didn't make up for anything. I would not recommend this place :(
