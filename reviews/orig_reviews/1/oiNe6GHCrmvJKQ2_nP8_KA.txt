First, I should state that I'm a fairly understanding person. I'm also what some might call an alcohol enthusiast. The point is, that I've been to quite a few bars - too many, in fact, to put up with the service at this establishment.

I had such high hopes for this place when it opened. I love tacos, I love booze, I live in the area. Unfortunately the service is so insufferably bad, that I haven't returned to this place in over a year.

The last straw was a completely botched happy hour attempt, during which a waitress failed to put in food / drink orders (at all, let alone correctly), twice. After our food and drinks finally did arrive, our waitress disappeared for an hour. Somewhere in this mess, she also became straight up antagonistic after being flagged down by someone else at our table. I'll spare you the rest of the frustrating details.

Bottom line: this is the only place I've ever debated leaving without paying. I finally was able to square up (after going to the bar to get our tab, since our waitress had disappeared).

Recommended alternatives:

For tacos: Yo Rita
For drinks: Brillobox, Remedy, Mardi Gras, hell even Kelly's has better service.
