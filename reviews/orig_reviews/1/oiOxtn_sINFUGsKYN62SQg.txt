I took my girlfriend there this evening and they brought out chips and salsa right away but no one came to take our order for ten minutes.  All servers were standing and talking to hostess who said she was a manager.  The server gave lame excuse that they keep moving her around and that she didn't know it was her table and didn't even apologize.  I don't know how food tastes because we walked out.  Definitely not a place to take your date too.  You lost our business.
