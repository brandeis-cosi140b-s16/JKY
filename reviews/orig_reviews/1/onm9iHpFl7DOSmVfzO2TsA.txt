You know you're in a pretty sketchy mexican food joint when the chips come out burned, cold and the salsa is watery. But, because of the positive review I had read in New Times magazine, I went ahead and ordered some food. I ordered a combination plate and a green chile cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was the only thing I found edible. I was sorely disappointed by my whole experience. I will not be returning.
