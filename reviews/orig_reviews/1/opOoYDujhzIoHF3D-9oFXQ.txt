With a hour delay, we ventured from Gate B to Gate C, the Southwest mecca and were drawn to the outside of Sammy's which caught our eye.   Things quickly went downhill after.

Service was slow but hopefully the food would make up for it.  We got a bacon cheese burger which was 13.50 but worse than a 2 dollar burger at your nearby fast food joint.  It was worse than your elementary school burger with the exception that it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. 

The so called breakfast wrap for 9.99 was filled simiply with egg.  Overall i felt robbed - in fact i think i would have felt better if someone held me up for 25 dollars then i could eat my miseries away after with enjoyable food.

Do yourself a favor and dont come here EVER.  Wendy's, Poepyes, and Villa Pizza is a few steps down and you'll pay 30-40% less and get better food.
