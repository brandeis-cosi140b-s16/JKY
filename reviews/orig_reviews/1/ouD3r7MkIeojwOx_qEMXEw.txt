Was there for Sunday lunch on the balcony.  I would give them "0" Stars if possible.

* Found 2 Hairs in the Salsa and Fajita.  TOTALLY GROSS
* The Salsa for Chips and Salsa was bland and we asked if they had a spicier Salsa and they let us know they had not made their Spicy Salsa yet.  It was 12:30.  She offered Jalapenos for our Salsa for a FEE.
* The Waitress was rude and no other servers want to help any other table.
* I asked the person who brought out the Food for a fork and he looked annoyed and didn't bring it.
* The Rice in the Rice and Beans side dish was not fully cooked. I let the waitress know and she brought the same thing back and was rude when I asked her to take it back and cancel the side.
* Everything is Overpriced.  A simple Chicken Burrito is $16!

I understand Vegas pricing but Hair in my food, Salsa and Rice unprepared and it was close to 1PM when the food was served, and RUDE Service was just too unreasonable!
