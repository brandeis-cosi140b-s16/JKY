I visited the new location on 16th St and Camelback and ordered the carne asada and al Pastor tacos.  The asada was truly tasteless and the lettuce so finely minced it seemed pre-chewed.  The al Pastor was slightly more flavorful when lots of salsa added.  The roasted jalape√±o was served ice cold.  Really terrible experience.
