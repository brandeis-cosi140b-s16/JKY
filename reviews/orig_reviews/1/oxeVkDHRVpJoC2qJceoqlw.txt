I had four hours to kill at the airport, so all I really wanted was a burrito and place to sit and eat it, so I went with Tequileria. Next time I know to go somewhere else. 

First of all, the waitress I initially had was a cranky older woman who kept yelling at patrons to get out of her way. Then, she came over to take my order, I proceeded to order the breakfast burrito because it was 11am... that's breakfast time in Vegas, right? Nope. She told me they were no longer serving breakfast and then quickly walked away. So I sat there for another 5 minutes waiting. She didn't even ask me what I wanted to drink. Then, a jovial gal (who I'm assuming is the manager) came over, apologized and took my order. 

I waited another 15 minutes or so for my chicken burrito. By this time I was starving. I dug right in and was totally disappointed with the quality of the chicken. Have you ever had canned chicken? That's what it tasted like. I finished it because I was too hungry to send it back. Bleh.
