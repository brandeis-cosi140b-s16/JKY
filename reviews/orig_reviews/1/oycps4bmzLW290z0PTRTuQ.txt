We have eaten at this location with our family for at least the last 20 years. They have remodeled, cleaned up the dining area and completely overhauled the menu deleating many favorite items. The service was horrible, we waited nearly an hour for our food which arrived in a smaller portion and lacked any flavor of Macayo's. Very disappointing and hopefully the chain does not implement this new menu through all the restaraunts.
