What the heck!? These people must be writing their own reviews! This place was absolutely gross. I felt really dirty after I step goodly in here. The menus are picture book with paper pages where the corners are all gross (looks like years of people licking their fingers and turning the pages)! DISGUSTING! I don't think they have replaced the menus in years! Then the tables are uncomfortable. The cloth on the tables are soooo long they get caught I everything. Then the lady who was supposed to serve us had a cordless house phone in her hand as she tried to wait on us..then as soon as she asked us what we may want to drink, the phone rang and she told us to hold on!!!! Then she proceeded to take this phone order while standing right by our table!!! The picture on the yelp reviews are shockingly different! The place was dingy and yellow in color, the place is small and there was only 3 tables full...and the largest looked like the family of this restaurants/lounge's owners. We went last night on a Saturday night which should've been a busy and exciting night. This was a disgusting joke! After this lady rudely put us on hold, we decided that was not how we wanted to spend out weekend night out!!! This place is again absolutely DISGUSTING!
