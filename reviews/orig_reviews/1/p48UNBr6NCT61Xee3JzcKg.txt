stumbled (literally) upon fuzzy's last weekend after Oktoberfest, my brief fun chasing down my other's friends bike cab made me hungry, and my brief conversation with an ASU coed who was wondering about the dick on my tee got me curious... to try out this place. I was seriously wanting slices but my friend Dani who I was walking with persuaded me to try out the place coz we were right next to it, and we were tipsy. So, walking in you really get that there's nothing local about this place, it's so commercial and chainish that it's disheartening with how Mill ave sold out. Anyways, saw the lackluster choices, and noticed that for breakfast burritos they were missing a basic item choice, a SAUSAGE burrito, heck that's common at every bertos drive thru, it's like a cheese quesadilla it's such a normal thing to order, WTF?! so ordered a bacon, cheese and egg burrito and waited for it to come out. Got the burrito and was dismayed with how non-hefty it was. for $4.50 i expect hefty, thick, with grease dripping, and it should be too thick to put in my mouth because it's so big BUT sadly this burrito was limp! LIMP! and it really wasn't satisfying, Del Taco's even better than this, and del taco tastes damn good when you're drunk, to the point you think it's so delicious that it's gourmet, sadly this was alright. My experience was eh, and the owner/manager dude asked how i liked it, and let's just say alcohol reveals the truth. Any chance of me coming back? never.
