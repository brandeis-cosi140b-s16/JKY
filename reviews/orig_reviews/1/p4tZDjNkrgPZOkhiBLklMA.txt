On Thursday, November 21, 2013, I attended a funeral down the street from the Teepee.  When driving there, I passed by the restaurant.  Seeing it, I remembered going there in the late 60's with my then husband and children.  My girlfriend, who also attended the service, also passed the Teepee.  She told me that she had eaten there also many years ago.  We were planning on having lunch after the service, so we decided to go there for lunch.  We invited 3 of our friends to join us.  None of them had ever eaten there before.  All of us drove a great distance that day to attend the service.  When we were seated, we couldn't even sit together.  Five people couldn't be accommodated.  When we looked at the menu, my girlfriend and I were surprised by the prices.  When we got our order, we were shocked by the appearance of the food.  The salsa they serve is the worst of any mexican food restaurant I have ever been to.  The so-called refried beans were non-existant and crusty.  The rice, if that's what you call it, was gross.  The enchilada was stuffed with a big glob of cheese, that was impossible to enjoy.  Now, as for the taco.  It was filled with mystery ground meat and dripping with a greasy liquid.  Why didn't they serve shredded beef instead?  I was apologetic to my friends and so sorry that I suggested going there.  The worst part of the whole ordeal is that my stomach was destroyed, causing diarrhea, and even today, I am not over it.  I will NEVER, EVER, eat there again and I will surely tell all my friends about our experience.
