This is the worst of the worst.  I visited this place while waiting for a show at the TI.  I order a taco salad that came out with brown lettuce and a horrible guacamole that tasted like cardboard.  The chicken was cold and awfully hard.  My friend had a cheese burger half way cooked with a pice of cheese that couldn't be melted at a 1000 degrees.  It wasn't yellow but orange cause it could've been the forgotten piece next to the grill.   We requested to speak to the manager but he was too busy to go to our table  but he told our waiter to give us 15% off.   I decided to pay just not to ruin my vacation by dealing with their lack of customer service.   But I paid $60.00 for a glass of water and two beers.  As I said, the worst of the worst.
