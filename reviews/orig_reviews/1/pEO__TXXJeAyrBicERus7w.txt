I really hated this place.  Granted, I am not a fan of Mexican food, but I know good Mexican food when I taste it, and I know bad Mexican food when I taste it.  I will tell you that this place is getting one star solely on the absolutely terrible food I had and the awful service.

First of all, our server was hardly ever present.  I found this strange considering our group of 4 was only 1 of 3 or 4 tables in the whole place.  We ordered an appetizer along with our drinks, specifically requesting for the app to come out before the entrees.  This didn't happen.  In fact, our entrees were served and we never received our app.  After we pointed that out to our waiter who decided to stop by after we were about 3/4 done with our food, the waiter asked if we would like for him to get it now.  Um, no.  We're done now.  Ugh

As for the food, it was far below mediocre.  I got the beef flautas and they were awful.  The meat was as dry as can be and had absolutely no seasoning.  NONE!  The shells were somehow soggy and flavorless.  Boo.  I order one of the easiest things to make on the menu, besides a quesadilla, and I get the worst possible experience.  What a shame.  Everyone else didn't seem too thrilled about their food either.  

I hate this place.  I will never be back.  It's hard to get people to come back when the whole restaurant smells like a port-a-potty.  I can excuse the filth, because honestly, doesn't good Mexican food come from a dirty kitchen?  See ya Mi Patio, I'm heading over to Filli B's.
