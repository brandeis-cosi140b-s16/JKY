I was happy to see a new restaurant finally move into the space next to Postino, so when it opened, my wife and I had to try it. I have to say the service and drinks were great, but the food was quite a disappointment. The chicken burrito my wife ordered was filled with over grilled vegetables, very little chicken and wrapped in a tough flour tortilla. The only flavor detected was that of roasted corn. I was equally disappointed in the tacos I ordered. I tried both the shrimp and the chef special scallop. The corn tortillas were grilled until stiff and dry. The shrimp and scallop were plentiful, but again lacked any kind of flavor. If you want to try any salsa other than the bland house kind, it will cost you two dollars extra. Not worth the cost, when you consider you would have to eat it with the generic tortilla chips they serve. The one bright spot was the Mexican street corn. It was very good. Overall, I would say skip this trendy spot and go across the street for much better food at half the price.
