Food not good, water was taken from the toilet i think, and service was only so so.  Just another fancy name, with fancy atmosphere, but they forgot to serve food that is edible.  And though you can order a variety of drinks, sometimes washing food down with a glass of water is nice. any restaurant that can't invest in a simple RO system for drinking water or to make their drinks with, shouldn't be charging $12 for an appetizer.  Small price to pay for a comfort that goes a long way.
