The food is basic and the service is not good.  The waiter did not tell us what food they were out of and the kitchen just replaced that food with something different or nothing at all.  It took a long time to get drinks and chips refilled.  We had no response to our complaints about the food.  Overall, you can get this kind of food anywhere, even the grocery store.
