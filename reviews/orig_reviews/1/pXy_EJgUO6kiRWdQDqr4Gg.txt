Horrible horrible business. Please don't waste your time or money here. Everything (even happy hour) is ridiculously overpriced for what you get. I'm a light drinker and 2 margaritas didn't even give me a buzz. Tacos are super small and not worth $2 at happy hour pricing. My friend and I sat at the bar and had to flag someone down each time we wanted to order something. I really wish Canteen would have stayed, they were the best. This place sucks and I'll never set foot in there again.
