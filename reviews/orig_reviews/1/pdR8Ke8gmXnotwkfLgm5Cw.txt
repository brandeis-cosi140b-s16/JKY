What a shame..  Been coming here for a few years and what started as a pretty good place to grab a bite has turned into something to avoid wasting money on.  Service is always good on the restaurant side, but the kitchen has gotten sloppy and inconsistent.  I always order the Maui Bowl to Go, but I could not tell you how many different versions I have gotten since about a year ago.  Not sure it they got a new Chef, but the recipe and portions seem to change each time.  This time today was the last straw.  I ordered my Maui bowl, got home to find there was NO SAUCE - just plain, dry steak.  What a waste of $11.  Save your money and time, head to a different location of Wahoo's or head down horizon and get some TMad, at never had and issue with anything from them..
