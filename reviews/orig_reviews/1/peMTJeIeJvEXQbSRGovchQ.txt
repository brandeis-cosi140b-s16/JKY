Horrible food and customer service. I wanted to love this place based on reviews. My personal experience was horrible. My waiter was very rude, as were the hotesses as if they didnt need any more business. On top of that a HUGE tip was taken out of my account when I didn't authorize a tip since i left cash. Claiming a dispute with 
Deutsche Bank as we speak! Beware customers..check your credit statements!
