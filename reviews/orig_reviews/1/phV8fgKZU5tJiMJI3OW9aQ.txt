Went to an Angels spring training game and got an ad for $1 nachos.  We saw their "great place to day drink" ad and though it would be good for happy hour.  The map showed it was down the street from Diablo stadium.  Ends up it's not, not travelling through a little mexican town to grab a beer/marg.  Get's a one star because I could not find the place.
