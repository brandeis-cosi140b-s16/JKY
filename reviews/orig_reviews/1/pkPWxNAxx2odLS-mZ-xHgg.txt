Distrito review

Today we tried Fathers day "brunch" at Jose Garses Distrito in the Saguaro hotel in Scottsdale. First of all, what you would consider brunch was non existent. It was simply ordering a regular meal and charged for every item. Portions were small and the quality of food was not what I would expect from an Iron chef. For example, the carne as ado was minuscule dry and unappetizing. The Benedict was made with brioche, which did not translate well. The mahi mahi tacos were smaller then I would expect from an appetizer but they were served as an entree and the list goes on. The drinks were tasty but served in tiny glasses and way over priced.  Worst of all the service throughout the entire experience at best, very poor. All in all we would not recommend or come back again to this restaurant.  It is  a disgrace to the Iron chef.
