Dined at the DC Ranch location with 2 guests in early May...great experience with very good food & excellent service.  Came back a few days later & it was like a different place.  Waited 45 minutes after ordering two non-complicated entrees.  I asked for Manager, who apologized for the long wait  & handed us our food to take home (he comped the meals, but truthfully, I would rather have dined in the restaurant).
  
Third visit a week later with hubby was definitely NOT the charm.  No Manager in sight (nor hostess), no attention for at least 10 minutes after sitting down, and server had a "I could give a rat's butt" attitude.  I specifically asked her about a particular entree as I don't like "spicy"... she assured me it was not.  HELLO...2 bites in, YEOW..hot, hot, hot.  She ignored me from the other side of the room, while I tried to get her attention (too busy gossiping with 2 other servers by the kitchen door!). I had to ask 3 times, 3 different employees, for some sour cream...to tamp down the heat from this "mild" entree!  By then, the food is cold anyway.

Finally, when our server showed back up to present the check (all smiley, because now it's "tip time") I indicated my essentially UNTOUCHED plateful of food and nicely said "this isn't what you said it would be....it's very HOT, in fact, I could not eat it". To my astonishment, she replies, "Oh really?  No one's ever complained before", then grabbed the plate & left.  No "sorry", no "may I get you something else?", nada.  REALLY?  By the way, the restaurant was NOT busy, so no excuses! 

Hey Owners:  either start training your servers to earn their expected tips,  or you yourselves need to hang around & make sure they're doing their jobs!  This server was indifferent & incompetent.  Even my husband, who is pretty easy going, was flabbergasted & said "I won't be back here anytime soon".
