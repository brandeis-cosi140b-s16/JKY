So, had high hopes for this time around at ol' 1011 N 3rd,  the place where restaurants go to die. To be honest I hope this one doesn't, and based on the reviews and how full the patio remains in the afternoons, I don't think it will. 

I would just like to share our less than satisfactory experience. 

First of all, it was happy hour and we expected some good deals, we didn't find any. The drink deal was $1 off. Whoop-di-do! My friend ordered a sangria and it tasted like old boxed wine. So then for food I though I would order fish tacos, and I go one (1) goddamn taco for 4.75. Is this Manhattan?  No it's 1011 N 3rd street, where restaurants go to die. Gimme a break. Won't be back.
