Very very rude on the phone!! Driving business away! When I called I was trying to order food my few people and the person on the phone just didn't wanted to take the order making very difficult ... When we got our food it was all messed up... She never gave us our salsa . Just sad to have that experience when the location on 35th n bell is so amazing!
