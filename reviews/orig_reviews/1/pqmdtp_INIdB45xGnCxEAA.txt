could never get a chance to get to this this place til this Sunday  with my family.And this place is a tourist trap ...FLAVORLESS.
Some one has gotta be tipping off people to post awesome things about this place because There is no way this place is what they say HUGE disappointment.My family and I try many different places and there are a ton of better flavored places .the asada had no spice at all and for 15.99 you would think it would do a hat dance .the enchiladas were border line the flavor of something out of box.and who ever posted the tamales were awesome???you better get your taste buds checked.3.75 for a giant tub of masa and a sliver of tasteless meat.You can look at the pics and see the serving look like there lame enough to be served on a paper plate.after we ate we couldn't believe a dinner for 3 with one drink each was 85.00 .those if you who really think this place is off the hook need to get out more often.this is vegaaaaaasss.i think this place may have been a good local spot at one time with all I hear about it ,but like some places like that they start skimping on quality .ill eat from a taco truck before I go back there again.
