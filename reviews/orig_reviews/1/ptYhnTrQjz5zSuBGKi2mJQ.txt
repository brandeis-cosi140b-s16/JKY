Overall it was not a good experience and we felt we wasted our food and dinner time at this place.

Nothing to write home about.  Over priced. Food not good & it was cold.  Everything was too spicy.  My family did not eat more than two bites of their food. We got Fish tacos, lingua, cabeza tacos and chicken quesadilla.  Menu ordering is not clear.  You have to wait in different lines to get different food items.  By the the time you are getting the second and third item from a different line, your first few items are cold already and you have waited more than you'd normally wait in a line to order your food all at the same time!  The nachos chips were greasy.

For the prices they are charging they're serving the food in paper plates and plasticware?!!  Better mex restaurants out there and less expensive.  

Not worth it.
