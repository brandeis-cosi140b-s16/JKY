Boy you people just won't give me a break on the photo thing....One of these days I promise but in the meantime here goes the review....this used to be a really great spot but lately it is lacking...We stopped in yesterday for a quick cocktail and to meet a friend....no great happy hour specials and no happy hour food at all (sorry but in this economy I'm kinda looking for a break). I wound up having the cactus margarita which I asked them to make with Sauza and it has to down down as the WORST top shelf margarita...I realize times are tough all over but it tasted like lemonaid and if there was tequila in it I sure couldn't taste it.....won't be coming back. We left there and went to Sierra Bonita where my expectations were more than met....please check out the review.
