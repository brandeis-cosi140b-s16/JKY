First I should let everyone one know to check your bank account after eating there they like too give themselves 20% tips even if you had a horrible waitress!!! They have done it to me twice now! I'm not sure if they know this but that is against the law!!!! I'm waiting for them to open today and they will be returning my money to my card ASAP! And this time I'm reporting this to the police! We had horrible service and it's my right to leave a small tip for bad service if I want!!! Remember check your bank accounts!!!! Never will I eat here with my family again!!!!!
