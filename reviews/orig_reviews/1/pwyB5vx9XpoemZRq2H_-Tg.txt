I wasn't even that excited to try the margarita here, actually.  But when I buy an $18 drink I expect some damn alcohol in it!  What's the point in some nasty, sweet, fruity beverage that's a chore to drink when it doesn't even get you sloshed, which is what I assume is the only purpose behind the drink?
