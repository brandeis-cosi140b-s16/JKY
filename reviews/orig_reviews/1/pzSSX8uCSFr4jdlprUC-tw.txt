Okay Yelp, you did me wrong on this one.  This is the absolute worst Mexican food that I have ever tasted.  First of all the food is not flavorful, I had to put salt on everything from the salsa to the beans and every item on my plate.  I ordered a combo plate with a chile relleno, chicken enchilada and chicken taco.  The chicken did not have any flavor and was very dry.  The chile relleno was full of water and the sauce on it tastes like pure tomato sauce.  Overall, it was a horrible meal.  The best part about my dinner was the tableside guacamole which of course needed salt and the wait staff who were very attentive.
