One of the most annoying bartender's ever. Website says $2 drafts for HH. I mention this to clueless bartender who starts making faces like he had a bad burrito for lunch. He wants me to show it to him on my phone, I refuse and we go back and forth for several minutes before he agrees to give me a Bud light for fore-mentioned two bucks. Winner me, loser Papi Chulo's and their empty restaurant at dinner time. Thinking about going back and showing Mr. Clueless the website tomorrow or pasting a copy on the front door. Overpriced food as well.
