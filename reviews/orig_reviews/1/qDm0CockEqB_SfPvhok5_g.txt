took the BF for lunch and he insisted on doing the review....

Ok so first time at this beautiful looking place very traditional look. First thing first ... No hot sauces...no beans... No tortillas....I was served an italian loaf in stead of tortilla chips...fries which is American with my tacos....and I could of made more traditional guacamole at home.... Sorry barrios cafe. You are not a "best in phoenix Mexican restaurant"
