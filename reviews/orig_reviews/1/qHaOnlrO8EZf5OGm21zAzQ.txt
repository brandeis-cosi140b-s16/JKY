This was the worst experience ever! I am so disgusted by what I saw the waiter do that I couldn't even eat my food. The waiter stuck his hand and arm in the horchata machine to fix something, and didn't even dump the horchata out. This place is so dirty! There is no customer service at all. I do not recommend this place to anyone. My husband and I will never return. very dissatisfied
