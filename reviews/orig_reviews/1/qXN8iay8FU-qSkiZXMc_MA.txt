The only thing good about our meal was the prickly pear margarita and the fact that the manager comped the food because we complained. The enchilada was so hard it was impossible to cut and contained no cheese inside - the shredded meat in the taco tasted like it was made several days ago. The chips were dry and not very tasty - also seemed stale. I would say that this food is some of the worst Mexican I have ever had - I would rather eat Taco Bell and that is saying a lot! Oh and they closed at 9 on a Friday - I would give them 2 months.
