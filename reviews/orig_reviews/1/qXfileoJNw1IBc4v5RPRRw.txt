Dammit I was in the mood for their "famous carne asada fries" first of all, dogs eat better. The meat tasted rubbery and chewy. The fries were soggy. Very pricey but it is in the Airport. However how can you label something the special when it taste like yesterday's garbage. I had to get tums to relive the pain of gas and upset stomach. Will not be going back.
