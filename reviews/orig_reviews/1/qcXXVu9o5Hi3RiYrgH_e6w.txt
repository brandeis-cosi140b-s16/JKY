Brought the in-laws here, the food was blah, the service was bad. Our waitress seemed to be easily distracted, wasn't entirely sure what we ordered, and managed to hang on to what was a cold beer until it was lukewarm while talking to either a customer/friend/co-worker. Not going back, not interested.
