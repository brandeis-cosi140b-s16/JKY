If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered a chicken burrito and it came out cold! I get it- this happens. It wasn't what happened but how it was handled that bothered me. It took 15 minutes for our server to come back (after 3x of requesting him from bus boys/ explaining to them what happened) and when he came his reaction was very unprofessional. He did not apologize and ordered to MICROWAVE my burrito! I said no thanks and then he brought the check that included everything else but still no apology. Do not go to this restaurant because the service sucks.
