Good service, horrible food!! The chips were stale and they charge for salsa that I could have made myself (and I'm no chef). I wanted grilled shrimp tacos which they didn't have on the menu. They brought me tacos with frozen shrimp that is normally served in those cheepie salads. I was really dissatisfied with the overall experience and even more dissapointed in the quality of food.
