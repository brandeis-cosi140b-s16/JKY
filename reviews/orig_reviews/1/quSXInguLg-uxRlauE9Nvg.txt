Cool setting, Good service HORRIBLE FOOD.
What a joke, the enchiladas tasted like chilli cheese fries.
My Torta was on ciabatta bread & looked like it was from subway.
We sent 1 plate back & they offered a free drink which they ended up charging on the bill. Sorry but I wont be returning to this "American-Mexican" Spot..
