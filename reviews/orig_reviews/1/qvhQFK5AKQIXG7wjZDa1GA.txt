The Service was horrible. The Kids said the steak was tough! They charged for chip refills!! which is terrible enough and
They never told us in advance.  Really disappointing. Did I mention the service was horrible. And they weren't even that busy. Never brought drinks needed to remind them four times for silverware ? Ridiculous
