Arribas! Where the FLIES will eat more than you will!

Oh how the times have changed.  We have frequented this place for years but our most recent experience was horrible. Horrible to the extent that we will not be returning.  The service was slow at best.  The food was not bad, we had the tacos al Carbon and they were pretty darn good, even if they did take 30 minutes to show up.
The issue was the sheer number and volume of flies in the restaurant.  it was horrifying.  Our kids were upset, we had to use napkins to cover up the food, etc. its hard to enjoy your food when you are swatting at flies the whole time.

When the manager? [red haired female] came over to see how our meal was we told her of the flies.  She asked if we wanted to sit elsewhere - well we were 80% done with eating and unless the flies are well trained to attack that one table, I suspect they would just follow us. Her only reply was one of acknowledgement.  That was it.  Nothing more.  No apology, statement that they would address the problem, etc.  We told the server on our subsequent rapid departure and his response was merely an apology.  Anyone with an inkling of customer service would have done a little bit more.  I was not looking for free food or anything like that but at least something more than "Oh".

Bottom line: Never Again.  If there were that many flies in the dining area with such little concern from management I shudder to think what may be happening in the kitchen where I can't see.
