Service is absolutely dismal. First we waited 40 minutes on a Sunday night because they barely have any seating. Once we did get a table they were quick to bring chips. Only chips. The waiter never mentioned the salsa bar. I knew it was there but still. Then they didn't take a drink order. After waiting for 5 minutes we walked up to the bar area and begged for water. Last thing I wanted to do was eat chips with salsa without something to drink for over 45 minutes. Another 10 minutes went by before they finally decided to take our order. Then the wait began to get our drinks. It took another 15 minutes to get our drinks--sodas, nothing fancy. This was after we watched the waiter make plenty of other drinks for other tables. He made 3 margaritas for a table that got there after us. Finally after one hour and 45 minutes our food arrived.
