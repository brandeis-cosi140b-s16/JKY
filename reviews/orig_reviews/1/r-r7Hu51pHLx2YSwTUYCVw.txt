Soooo disappointed!!!!! After years of patronizing Dos Caminos at the Palazzo, I was excited to finally have (and try) a new "high end" (HA!!) Mexican restaurant. As you can see, it's pretty rare that I post, but please be forewarned this establishment is NOT worth the price for the food quality, nor the service. The guacamole was bland, and not made table side a la Dos Caminos, or Rosa Mexicano. $12??? I don't think so.  We waited almost 45 mins for our food, only to have 3 of the 5 meals served. 5 mins later, mine arrived. After mentioning my concerns to two managers (in suits), the 5th and final meal arrived--lukewarm. Sadly we barely received an apology...other than "the kitchen was behind". For $30+ entrees, I don't believe anyone would accept this type of service. What made it worse was management didn't offer any type of goodwill gesture despite our gently provided comments. As someone who has worked in customer service/hospitality for over two decades, I can truly say I was extremely shocked.  Please do not frequent this sad excuse for a "nice" restaurant.  Was really hoping for an amazing experience. :(
