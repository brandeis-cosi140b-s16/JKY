I've chosen to go here once. Usually I end up here because there is a line at Piccolo Forno across the street so I grab a drink until they call me. *side note- Round Corner Cantina should pay Piccolo Forno a royalty because every time I go to Piccolo Forno there are people at Cantina waiting to be called to Piccolo.*

Anyway, I chose to go there once to see how it is on a Friday night. I'm a shorter guy so it takes a little effort at the bar to get a drink. The bartender (a male) notices me and says "I'll be right there bud" - which I hate, no one wants to be called "bud." I'm having a conversation with a friend but I'm very obviously the next person in line and I keep making the "I need a drink" motions. Eventually the bartender returns to where we are- next in line- looks over my head, right over me, I start ordering because I think he's just busy and not making eye contact, and takes he order from the guy behind me! 

I'm irritated so I say "WTF man?!" [But the words not the acronym.] "You said you were going to be "right here bud, then you take he guys behind me's order?!" 

Bartender snaps his fingers and before I know it the doorman- or whoever he is- is trying to escort me out. Mind you I haven't had my first drink yet, not drunk, not even that rude. Just trying to get some service. The bartender asks me - "are you going to chill the 'F' (uses whole word) out??" I say "I have been chill but okay." 

The doorman 'allows' me to stay. I order a double jack and diet- I never order doubles but I knew I had to because I didn't want to relive the aforementioned experience.

$18 jack and diet double. $18.00. Yes, eighteen. 

Not going back. If you're in Lawrenceville, and not waiting to get into Piccolo Forno, you can do much much better and if you are waiting for Piccolo just go to Franktuary right next door, you'll pay less and get treated with respect.
