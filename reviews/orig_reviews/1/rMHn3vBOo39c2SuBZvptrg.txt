AMAZING....LY awful!  Every time I go to this location is like a trip to idiot island.  The employees act as if the customers are annoying little gnats interrupting their dull conversations.  I have yet to receive an order that is correct, but like a moth to the old flame I go back because the food itself is still pretty darn good.  Until today.  I phoned in a takeout order, which usually results in a look of awe like you just landed in your spaceship.   Cold and runny food, no ice, and no lemonade, I think I've finally learned my lesson.  However, tomorrow is coconut shrimp taco Tuesday so no guarantees.....
