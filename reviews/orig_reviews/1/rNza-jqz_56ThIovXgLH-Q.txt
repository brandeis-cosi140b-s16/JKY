Ehh, the tortilla chips were too thick and hard for me, my jaw hurt and I got a headache from eating them :(

Tableside guac was so amateur! They had all the ingredients already in the bowl and the dude just mixed it up.  Didn't even ask me if I wanted it chunky or anything. 

I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu -- a filet steak with two cheese enchiladas.  Now, the sauce was pretty good; it was chile gastrique.  Not sure what that means, but it was sweet and went well with the steak.  I really liked the cheese enchiladas, too.  The menu is proud to stick a little * next to the filet, saying you can get it cooked to order any way you like, but they go ahead and ignore your request, lol.  I wanted medium rare and they gave me well done.  I got a second one but eh, wasn't in the mood for it anymore.

Go to Bourbon Steak at this hotel if you're here instead :)
