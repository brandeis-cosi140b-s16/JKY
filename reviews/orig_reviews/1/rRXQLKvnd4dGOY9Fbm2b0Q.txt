The only reason I'm giving this place one star is for their customer service.  And it doesn't go for everyone there either just one particular taquero that's goes by the nickname "guero." The lines as you know are always super long well thia guy suppose girlfriend showed up with looks 20 people instead of waiting in line like everyone else she would just go up to the front of the line and order whatever she liked. She went up to order like 10 times and every time cut in front of anyone who was next.  When not only us but other people in line complaint to this guy by "Guero" he just ignore everyone and would stop serving the person he was serving to do her order her. Myself as a business owner finds that very unprofessional. And doubt if I would return to this exact location. I prefer take the drive to Chulavista where every customer is treated equally and faster service.
