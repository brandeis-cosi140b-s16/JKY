This place at the airport is horrible.  I paid $12.00 for a cabo wabo margarita that was plain.  The food is horrible, the service is horrible. Stay away = $53.00 for a lunch and wendys would have been better.  Also there is a bar waiter that talks constantly.  This was not a good experience, I dread seeing it on my VISA in a month!  
Save your money !!
