I came for the free chips and salsa, also the water, since that's the only thing the busboy brought over, the waitress could not be bothered to come to the table... Oh she looked at me w couple times, but was busy with a larger party of 4... Me being by myself must have creeped her out.... To bad, I tip well for good service, shame there was none to be found here.
