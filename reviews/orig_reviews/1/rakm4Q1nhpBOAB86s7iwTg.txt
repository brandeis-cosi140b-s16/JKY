I came in for lunch on a Saturday with my daughter and small grandsons. It took forever for our server to come to our table. There were several female severs standing around the bar area socializing, nothing else. Our server finally arrived after about 15 minutes. Took another 10 minutes to bring us our ice tea and water, which both tasted very bad. Our drinks were never refilled once. After being there for 40 minutes how much longer it would take our food because we were in a hurry. All of the plates and silverware were dirty... Blahhhh....When our burritos finally arrived, they were soaked in grease... GROSS!!!! I wouldn't ever come back here even if I was paid!
