Worst service ever,  food ordered showed up at different times, which is not a good thing when it's a party of 10, plus a few dishes were wrong. Had two servers that were scatterbrained, it wasn't even busy for them to take so long to get drinks when needed.. 

The food was overrated, overpriced and overcooked, (due to microwaving). 

No wonder I have not been to macayos in 15 years,  it sucked then and now more than ever...  Horrible place, they should shut the doors and call it a day for good
