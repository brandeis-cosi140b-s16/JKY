Since when do they charge you for chips and salsa?! To top it off, ordered a bean and cheese tostada. The waitress returned to inform us that we can't order a tostada because it's on the lunch menu and it's dinner time. We asked to then just order an al a carte tostada (we are at a mexican restaurant right?!). I was then told by the manager that they can't make a tostada (mind you they offer it for lunch) because he doesn't know what to charge. So I suggested he make up a reasonable price as we just want 1 tostada. He said he would make it for us just this once but never again. 

Oh great. Thank you.
