I don't know where to start, this the most crappiest Mex-American food.  Damn chipotle crazy infused food.  Sweet and not even hot.  I hate when Mexican food is mixed with something else I call it pretty Mexican food.  Like for example from this place why damn why would you put lettuce in a Mexican shrimp cocktail and damn freeze dried banana chip inside.  All chip salsas where more sweet than hot.  Gucamole DAMN!!! My wife who is Persian said what kind of gucamole is this lumps of avocado lazy cut up onion,cilantro and on top chipotle crap.  She called it lazy gucamole.  Damn damn damn what crap.  Service is friendly so that's why I give you guys one star.  I won't be back well maybe for cinco de mayo  celebrations that was decent.  Well I know why all beer no real food being served.  Damn!
