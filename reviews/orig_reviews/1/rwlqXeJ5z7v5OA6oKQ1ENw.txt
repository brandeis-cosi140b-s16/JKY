My wife and I found this place months ago and we where very excited to come back and watch football games when the season started up again .. We call at 10 am and ask if a certain game will be playing they say yes .. We show up we ask are u going to show a certain game they say yes .. Until we sat down at the bar , young guy in charge of changing Channels was very rude to my wife and we kept on getting the run around .. Very bad first impression we will not be returning very bad for this place because we always bring a big crowd .. So we went down the street to pkway tavern and got excellent service ..  Not sure yet if that was a positive thing at The end lol .. GO BOLTS
