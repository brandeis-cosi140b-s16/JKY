I went here with my 2 girlfriends for dinner and drinks. After waiting 15 minutes to get service at our table we ordered food and 40 minutes later waitress comes to ask us what we would like to eat. We tell her we already ordered put food. She said oh yea let me check on it. We ordered a salad and nachos. The nachos looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp and burned and everything cold and sour cream looked like cottage cheese. After never being asked if we wanted a re fill on drinks we paid and left small tip due to bad food and bad service. 3 of us noticed on bank statement we were over charged from what we paid for tips. Do not go here unless you want waitresses to rip you off.
