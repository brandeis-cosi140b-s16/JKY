Customer service is the worst I've ever experienced. I ordered online and was told it would be ready in 45 mins. I get there 45 mins later only to find my order hasn't even been looked at. So I have to wait another 20 mins to get my food which was all wrong anyway. I paid for side orders and didn't get them either. They didn't even care. I'll never go back and I'll take great delight in telling others not to go either.
