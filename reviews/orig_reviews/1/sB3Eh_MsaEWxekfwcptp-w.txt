I stopped in after seeing they had Mexican food. After hearing a girl yell sit anywhere I found a booth. The lighting is horrible everything looks red and dark. I had to use the light on my phone to read the menu. 

I was told it was happy hour so all alcohol was but one get one free and they had a bunch of margaritas. So I thought oh wow the coconut one sounds creamy and good. She brought me two margaritas on the rocks at the same time. So apparently you can't drink one and order another. Which means if you are slow like me the other one is watered down. I didn't even touch the other one. Heck I couldn't even drink half of the first one. The margaritas were not creamy or even good. But had a fake coconut after taste. 

I ordered the queso fries nacho style, which was a huge portion of steak fries with some cheese melted on top and some whole pinto beans a scoop of sour cream and guacamole. They were super dry, I wouldn't order again. Also ordered the Taquitos. My server asked if I wanted steak (not beef) or chicken. I chose steak. What I got was ground beef shoved into flour tortillas and deep fried. They were on top of a bunch of romaine lettuce and had a side of sour cream and guacamole. I would not order these again either. 

The server walked past me several times. Finally I had to ask for the check. She asked if I wanted to go boxes since over half of everything was there and to go cup for my margarita. I said no because I won't be eating it later. 

I will never go back for food or margaritas. But I guess the 2 for one happy hour might work on shots.
