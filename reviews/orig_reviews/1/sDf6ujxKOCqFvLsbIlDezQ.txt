Checked into a hotel on University yesterday and decided to drive down the street looking for a restaurant. I should have gone to Subway and saved myself about $20. They didn't have any 100% blue agave other than Patron, which I don't drink. The house margarita is Jose Cuervo which is headache city, so I ordered unsweeted ice tea. I was hungry so I ordered the Fajita Trio, consisting of beef, shrimp and chicken. When it arrived I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it, so much food. The beef was tough, the chicken was dry, and the shrimp was passable. The refried beans were runny and the rice wasn't very good. I could go on, but I think you get the picture. The entree was $16.95 and I didn't finish it, nor did I ask for a doggy bag. Rosita's Fine Mexican Food is misnomer. Oh yes, I did have to rush back to the hotel to go to the bathroom. You can figure out why.
