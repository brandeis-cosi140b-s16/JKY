My friend and I came here for happy hour/light early dinner while staying at the resort. I had specifically asked for a saltless margarita, and I received one with salt. I ignored this and carried on. We each ordered a prawn skewer and a bowl of albondigas. When we received the soup, it ways way beyond salty. 

We managed to notify the waiter who said that he would be right with us. Ten minutes later, he responded to us and we asked for the other soup instead. Another 10 minutes pass and he was VERY attentive to everyone else in the restaurant but us. Mind you, this was not a very busy restaurant and there were only 3 other tables with customers. 

He ended up bringing us a cup to sample and our shrimp. The shrimp was very good and we ate that, but he was very slow in attending to us. My friend and I, tired of waiting, decided to add up our own bill and left money as the service was abysmally slow given that this was NOT a bustling restaurant. We noted that the prices were overly high for such bad service and then we went to Auld Dubliner, where we were also disappointed. We are usually good customers who do not usually complain unless the service and/or food suck. Do not patronize this restaurant as it leaves a lot to be desired.
