We have been several times to this location.   The food is tasteless and bland.  I paid extra for grilled chicken in my chimichanga, what I got was a glob of canned retried beans and a couple pieces of soggy chicken.    Not to be rude, but I can get a better chimichanga from the frozen food freezer at 7-11.   These people don't even try to put out a decent product.
