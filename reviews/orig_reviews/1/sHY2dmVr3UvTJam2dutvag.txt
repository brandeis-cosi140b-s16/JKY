The food looked good but I don't know for sure. The pricing was okay but the staff could use some improvement. I was delivered the wrong order to my table twice and by the time they got it right the food they served us was ice cold. We complained and they said they  "could fix it again if we would like". Long story short we were fed up and decided to leave. They actually had the nerve to ask us to pay for our iced teas.  Will never go back and have cautioned everyone I know to stay away.
