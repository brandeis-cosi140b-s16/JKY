Incredibly rude staff, heard them talking behind the counter about other customers; ordered a burrito bowl and was given an actual burrito, staff looked at me like I was crazy when I brought it back and said my order was wrong, then proceeded to talk to each other about it when I was standing right there. Too bad the customer service is awful because the food is actually not too bad.
