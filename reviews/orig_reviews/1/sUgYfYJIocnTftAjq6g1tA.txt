My family has catered from Carolina's before and LOVED the food.  I am hosting a party in the near future and wanted to cater from there.  I called to speak with someone about catering and was on hold for over 5 minutes.  I hung up, went on the website and was going to research it there.  I was unable to print their catering menu due to the way they have it uploaded on the web.  So I called back to talk to someone about catering.  After being on hold another FIVE MINUTES, Thelma came on the line and I asked her to fax me a catering menu...she asked me to hold so she could get a catering manager on the phone. I told her I had already lost 10 minutes of my life to holding for that already, gave her my number and asked her to fax me the catering menu.  A moot point, because if it takes 10 minutes to get someone on the line, how good is the catering service going to be?  I'll be getting my catering from another company :(
