It's pretty hard to screw up Mexican food, right?  This place manages to do it quite well.  I recently went there with a large group (8 of us) to celebrate a birthday, and I was embarassed that I was the one who recommended it.  I had never been to the one in DC Ranch, but had walked past it at night and it looked like a lively joint, so I chose this one because of the central location.  

Where do I begin?  The club soda in both my cocktails was flat, I ordered lemons and got a lime,  and the chips were the absolute worst I have ever tried...like tasteless pieces of cardboard-no lie.  It was the first time I can remember not gorging on chips and salsa before the main meal.  The salsa might have been OK if I'd been able to get one of the nasty chips in the thimble-size bowl.  I just gave up!  My chicken quesadilla looked like they had warmed it up in a oven, the tortilla wasn't browned, the edges were dry, and it was just plain boring.  We all ordered different dishes and not one of us was happy with our meal.

On the positive side, the prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is kind of fun if you're into rusty signs and plastic fish hanging from the ceiling,  They also have a large patio that was well-misted and at some point they had a singer/guitar player performing.    It was a relief from the horrendous  soundtrack of classic rock from the 70's that was annoying me all through dinner.   I was a teenager when those songs were current, but seriously,  who wants to listen to The Who sing "5:15" in a bar in 2008?

Unless you just want to hang out on the patio and drink a cerveza, I wouldn't bother with this place.  There are too many other great Mexican restaurants in town.
