I dined here with my family on a Saturday evening. We felt like having Mexican food and margaritas. Goes hand in hand if you ask me. The first thing I noticed was a confusing menu. I wanted fish tacos, so I searched the menu under tacos, and seafood. Neither section offered fish tacos. So I ask our server why they didn't offer fish tacos at a Mexican restaurant of this caliber. So she directs my attention to a separate menu called "chef's specials". So I order my fish tacos and house margarita on the rocks. My margarita makes it out 10 minutes later, and tastes like sugar water. So I asked my server if they put any alcohol in my margarita, because if I remember correctly, she had checked my I.D. She then explains to me that it is a premixed margarita, then offers me a $5 shot of tequila. So you're charging me 10 bucks for a premixed, practically virgin margarita, and then you're going to make me buy an extra shot just to have some kind of alcohol! Umm..you can have it back. 

Then my tacos come out. I explain to the others at my table that my tacos had no flavor. All I could taste was the sauce, bell peppers, and a tortilla (which was flour. Who serves fish tacos on flour tortillas??) Then I open one of my tacos to examine, and find 2 little chicken nuggets sized pieces of fish. Really? 

Awful food. Awful drinks. We will never be back.
