I have been to sumomaya twice before and have really enjoyed the experience. I loved the food and they have my favorite drink in town. Tonight however for the first time I walked out of a restaurant. After no one, but the person who poured out water (his name was Seth and he was so nice!), came to our table for 15 minutes we left. The table right next to us was being waited on and despite being walked by at least 8 times total by 3 different people not one person acknowledged our table. Best part was on the way out the hostess who greeted us asked how the food was....because 15 minutes is the usual table turnover time. Really upset about this one and honestly unless they fix their wait staff problems I don't think I will comeback or recommend them :(
