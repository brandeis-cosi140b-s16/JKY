Im guessing everyone there is new to the business or any customer service skills. For starters, they take way too long to even come offer you any drinks and another long wait until the drinks come. They take long on ordering and bringing you the food, its just tacos and burritos how long can it take? Our burritos came and it was cold!! Let me mention the place was empty so being busy can't be the reason. Finally after waiting a while the server decided to come ask how the food was, when we told her the problem she went and told the manager ( I have no idea how she became the manager), instead of just apologizing and taking care of our meal she stood there and said I don't know why or how that happened and offered 10% off...YES 10%!!! We saved $1.80 off our bill!! holy shit thank god for her I really needed that $1.80! I find that offensive to offer me a dollar off when really the burritos should have been replaced or free. Also, I have ate there 5 times now and only 1 time the service was good because the food was to-go. The food is pretty good especially the burrito(when its hot) but a little too over priced. Only because the food is good I will give them a star. Oh and if you're planning to go with a bunch of people, they barley have space so I would call ahead of time or go early daytime when its empty. In the end, if you only care about the food and not service this place is good but if you're like me and being charged restaurant prices for a burrito it better come with good service.
