Atrocious. 

Service sucks, the chubby waiter was a complete jerk off. There is outside seating and the "hostess" is inside so I thought it was sit down and we come to you. I gathered from the stink face said chubby waiter was giving us, that it was not. I went to the hostess and of course she said she would let our waiter know that we are out there. He showed up, threw a few menus at the table and walked away. 
The menu had standard americanized Mexican food. We opted for steak fajitas ($25), 3 mini lobster tacos ($12) side of cilantro rice ($5) and a Puncho Villa jalapeno tequila mixed drink ($14). The fajitas were okay - IMO they should have come with rice - which was better than the fajitas. The "lobster" tacos should be relabeled as batter fried bits with lobster flavor. Absolutey awful. The chips and salsa were the best thing on the menu and they were FREE! 
The bus boy was very nice and attentive but that chubby waiter really needs to think about another career choice.
