I do not understand how people give this anything more than 3 stars.  It is awful.  there is no flavor to any of the ingredients.  It is as if you boiled rice, cooked chicken, and bought a flour tortilla from wal mart and call it Phat burrito. Their website offers franchising opportunities..are you kidding me?... there is no process, flavor, or recipe to franchise.... any place boil rice and chop lettuce and wrap it in a flour tortilla and call it a good burrtio... please do not for one second think that this place has anything on moes, chipotle, qdoba, vida, or taco bell.... I am dumbfounded at people who can rate this at 5-stars, it makes no sense to me at all.  Oh the somewhat talked about queso?!! .. let me just say that I held it upside down for an extended period of time and nothing got on the floor, it essentially broke the horribly stale awful chips as you tried to dip it.  I had half the burrito 5 chips and gave the rest to the dog (true story), and felt bad letting him eat it.
