This place was recommended by our hotel so in spite of the fact that Yelp only gave it 3 stars we tried it. I could not believe how expensive the food was and Baja Fresh or Chipotle would have tasted better. The meats we all ordered in tacos were dry and overlooked and the Carne Asada tasted like a salt block. I sent back the margarita (and I NEVER do that) because it was so bitter and almost floral tasting (like a bathroom air freshener). Save your money and go ANYWHERE else. Oh, the guacamole and salsa we're good.
