Upon arriving at this restaurant, I came in with high hopes of great food but was quickly met with utter disappointment. The food was good, but nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and have lived around it my whole life. The thing that really bent me out of shape, was the God awful service I received. I was treated as if I was a pile of dirt coming in to buy a burrito, no greeting, no smile, simple questions were answered with disgust. I will never return.
