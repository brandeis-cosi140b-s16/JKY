Since this is apparently owned by Baja Fresh, how could I go wrong? Trust me, this one was VERY wrong.

I would give this one NO stars, but Yelp won't let me.

BEWARE the nachos. These people should be investigated for false advertising. The menu says the nachos have cheese. Yeah. And the Pope bows down five times a day facing Mecca to pray. It's not even close to a cheese sauce. It's some hydrogenated oil based abomination guaranteed to produce heartburn. Why waste decent (not great but at least decent) black beans and guacamole on this?

Why waste your money on this? Even though it is less than $10 for the nachos, they were very over priced for the "quality" so I gave the 2$ rating.

I spoke to fellow passengers who had come in, seen my "nachos" and decided to walk to the far end of the airport to Pizza Hut. At least they were happy with their choice for lunch.
