CHECK YOUR CREDIT STATEMENT! 

We went to the Sandbar on Thursday. Paid with a credit card, $81 and left a 25% cash tip. Saturday we checked the credit card statement and it showed a $20 tip added to our charge. I called and was told they would credit the overage. When they called Monday for my credit card info they acted like it was no big deal that their wait staff had done this and that they didn't review the charge slips.

I know it is only $20 but how many others has this happened to. So it's more a matter of business principles and trusting the establishments that you choose to spend your hard earned money at. 

So if you like bad tasting food and people stealing from you then I highly recommend the Sandbar. 

On the upside the beer was cold.
