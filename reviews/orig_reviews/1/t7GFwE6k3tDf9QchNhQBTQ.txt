I am honestly shocked by the high reviews of this place. When there are so many fabulous Mexican food restaurants in Arizona, do NOT waste your money here. 

The pros:

1. Neat decor and location

The cons:

1. Chips and salsa for $7.00!!!! Are you kidding me? You get them free at almost every other Mexican food restaurant. That should have been my warning sign.

2. The rest of the food was outrageously expensive. 
 
3. The quality of this over-priced food was sub-par at best. I had the fajitas and they were just not good. 

4. The bathroom sink was very unique and after taking a few minutes to discover where the water was actually coming from I found that the water was actually passing over BLACK MOLD! This was enough to make me want to vomit since I had washed my hands before eating my not so good fajitas.

5. A 20% gratuity was added on our bill. I felt that was a bit presumptuous. 15% is acceptable for a gratuity then let me add more if I want to. 20% is not a given. 

6. This is petty, but they spelled "chipotle" wrong on one of their menu items.

Overall, I was very disappointed in this place. There are so many great, award winning Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale alone, why waste your money here? I won't return.
