Went here for the first time with friends last night. I understand you are going to have to wait on a Saturday night. The wait was an hour long and included watching the table we ultimately were seated at sitting empty for over twenty minutes. The food then took about an hour to arrive. It is crystal clear to anyone paying attention that this place on this night was poorly managed. The food was ok, but the whole experience was so poor I would not return. I am not a review or complaint type of person, but I use yelp quite often while traveling and thought others should know.....
