Living in Downtown Tempe for several years now, I'm always excited to see a new restaurant on the scene.  Very disappointing!  I'm a fan of great Mexican food and wasn't expecting top of the line fare being it is basically a taco shop, but this was horrible.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the place has a cool vibe, but it ends there.  I had a ground beef taco and a shredded beef taco.  Got both to go as I was walking home, but ate the ground beef taco there.  Yuck!  Almost went to get my money back, but they all seemed so happy about the opening I just didn't have the heart, and I figured maybe the shredded beef would be better.  WRONG.  I took a few bites as I walked down Mill and found the nearest trash can to dispose of the rest.  This is hands down the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted, and just may be one of the worst restaurants I have ever tried.  I feel bad for them, but there is no way they will last 6 months, obviously they don't care or just don't know good Mexican food.  I can't believe that this is a chain and there are more out there somewhere!
 
I would say to stay far away from this place, but it is so bad that it's almost worth a novelty to stop in and get ONE taco to share if you happen to be walking down Mill one evening.  You will see what I'm talking about, amazingly bad food, you will not believe they are charging money for it.
