Your grand mother from Minneapolis Minnesota will say, "It is the best Mexican food she has ever had" Provided she has never been to  Taco Bell.
The only Hispanic I saw was the 75-year-old bus boy.
Large dinning room with 10 to 15 crying children.  I don't blame them.
The waiter will ask you  for his tip upfront .as this will be the last time you see him. Women seem to be runners not wait staff. Bean were soured and the meet over cooked.
