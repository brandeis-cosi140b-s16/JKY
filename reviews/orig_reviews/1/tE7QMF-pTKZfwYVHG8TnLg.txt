The building is spectacular!  The service is horrific.  Have tried the place three times:  1) Soon after the main openng...the service was slow and chaotic.  They got a "pass" since they were new and getting going.  2)  A bar visit which was noted for slow service, expensive drinks and very unfriendly bartender.  3) Sunday lunch visitc tables were not cleaned from prior patrons' visit.  Request for clean up was met with excuses, resistance and attitude.  Walked out after waiting for a few minutes to no avail.   Manager notified;  her resonse was a half-hearted apology.   Better food and superior service elsewhere...ie La Santisima.
