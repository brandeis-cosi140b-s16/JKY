Inexcusable slow takeout service, time and time again. 

It is insane that it could take 40 minutes to get a burrito and quesadilla. Keep in mind all three times I was there it was 7:30pm or later, and was slow. There is a serious kitchen issue at this place. 2/3 times the food was very good so I tried to overlook how gotdamned slow the place is, but tonight was slow and poor quality- and like my boys Hall & Oates- I can't go for that. 

If the owners don't invest a little time and attention to this place- soon it will be known as the place that used to be phx burrito house. Pull it together and do it quickly. I want them to succeed but life is too short for a 40 minute burrito.
