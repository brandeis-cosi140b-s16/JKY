Food awful.  Service even more atrocious.  This place should be avoided at all costs unless you're just there to get drunk and play video poker. Our friend had her wedding reception dinner here.  It was a small party only 10 people and everything was wrong from start to finish.  They lost half of our orders and started bringing everyone's food out.  Had to take our orders again.  Then everyone got their food except me.  Took an hour and then they got my order wrong... Again! Wow.  2 hour hosted beer and wine and all of us only got ONE beer.   Water glasses empty for days.  The dessert was awful too.  How do you screw up fried ice cream?!?
