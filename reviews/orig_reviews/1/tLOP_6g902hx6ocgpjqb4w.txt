I went to this restaurant because I was craving mexican food and the reviews were great. Being new to the area, I am still exploring new spots.  I was extremely disappointed.  The waiter was terrible, the food was definately not worth the price, and the house margaritas didn't even taste like they had tequilla in them.   Next time I want to go out for some great mexican food, it won't be here.
