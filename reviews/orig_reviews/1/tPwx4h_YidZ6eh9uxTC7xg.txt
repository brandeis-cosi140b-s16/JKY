Me and the wife decided to give this place a try. We came in on a Thursday and the World Cup was going on,it was a bit loud but to be expected. I ordered the dozen oysters, seafood bowl, and chicken fajitas. We washed that down with hands down one of the best red beers I have ever had. 
Now onto the food. The waitress brought us out two waters which we didn't ask for and charged 1.50 a piece for them. The oysters were hands-down the worst oysters that I have ever tried in my entire life. They were not spoiled however they taste like River water smells and they were not cold even though they were served on a bed of ice. The seafood bowl was equally tasting like River water with a bit of saltiness however the broth was completely tasteless besides the hot sauce and salt and I put into it. The chicken fajitas were cooked well there was plenty of chicken fajita and also came with a side of rice and beans however the tortilla wraps or disgusting and fell apart in your mouth while you're eating. 
The prices are absolutely ridiculous the chicken fajitas were $16 my seafood bowl was 17 ,two beers were seven dollars apiece you could just go and get the same quality food for probably a third or a half of the cost.
The only redeeming factor of this place is the furniture inside does have a Mexican island feel and the Mariachi band was pretty cool but the food is utter trash and the level of attention that the workers placed on the customers was also poor.
I understand the World Cup was going on however these employees are being paid to serve customers but without the customers they would be out on the ass.
