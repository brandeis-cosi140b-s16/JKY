Their service is really fast and the food comes out fast but then again it's just Mexican food.  

Their nachos are ok but a bit of a rip off considering the price.  $4 extra if you want steak or chicken on them.

Their burrito is alright but there isn't really anything in it besides steak, beans, and rice.  They put this weird sour cream on top and put the lettuce on top as well.  It's a bit bland and tasteless really.  Their chips and salsa are alright but also a bit bland.  The salsa is too watered down.

I had an interview here as well and the manager only hires girls to be servers.  Every girl that would go up to be interviewed he had some creepy smile on his face.  Then again, what else do you really expect in Vegas?

Anyway, the food is a rip off considering its Mexican food which is extremely cheap to make in a restaurant but that's just Vegas prices.

I don't know if there is a trick here with their sides or extras like at Lucky's.  I haven't been here in a few weeks because it's so overpriced.
