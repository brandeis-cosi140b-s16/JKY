I need a new favorite mexican restaurant, everyone goes off about agave....I was soo dissapointed. First off the atmosphere was cool and the staff seemed nice. After we sat it all went down. The Guy took like 15 min getting our drinks, we ordered a burrito to split and an appitizer of guacamole.we got no chips...what kinda Mexican place doesn't serve chips before a meal? We finally got our burrito with no extra plate...the plate was so tiny we Made a mess..then after weweredone theybrought our guacamole..with no chips....how do we eat it with no chips? They did take it off the black, but didn't refill our drinks at all the whole meal and we had to get up to pay cause our waiter never came back.....and the food....nothing even that good...the red sauce tasted Like pizza sauce....ewww...ill never go back....sigh back to looking for a good Mexican restaurant. ...agave...booooooo
