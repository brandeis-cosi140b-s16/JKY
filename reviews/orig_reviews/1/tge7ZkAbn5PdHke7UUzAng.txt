One star from a vegan perspective. This is a great restaurant if you love meat and cheese. You can even get away with being vegetarian here if you like lots and lots of cheese. But when I asked the waitress if there was anything on the menu that could be made without cheese, she looked at me like I was retarded and said, "You really should just order a salad."

I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I was prepared to eat something doused in cheese, but I bet other restaurants/chefs would have at least tried to accommodate a request like that. I even asked if the chili relleno could be stuffed with the beans/rice side dish instead of cheese, and the waitress said no (the beans are made with pork broth anyway, so it was a moot point). 

Oh well. It is very rich and tasty food, but if you are strict vegan and you come here with a group (which would be the only reason a vegan would even walk in the door), eat at home or plan to stop at Green afterwards.
