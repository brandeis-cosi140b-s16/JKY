IS IT THE WATER ? 
My wife dragged me to this place maybe five times before I finally said enough. The food and service was poor each time. I tried 5 different items on the menu and they all tasted the same (like not good cafeteria food). The atmosphere is OK if you sit by the water. They have a nice Mexican tap beer selection (the best in Chandler unfortunately for me). And this place is crowded too so somebody likes it. I just don't get it.
