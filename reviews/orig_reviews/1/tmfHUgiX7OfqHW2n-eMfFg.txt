the only star I am giving to this restaurant is for our waitress, she was very nice. The food was nothing special and they are very proud of it because the prices here are insane for the quality of the food. The "front desk" service first put us in a table in front of the kitchen exit, not a place to have a table and I asked her to give us another table, so she moved us to upstairs and the table was almost in the middle of the hallway next to the stairs railing... well half of it. Restaurants are planned to sit people comfortable... here you have the feeling they are trying to add as many tables as they can. We are not coming back because 2 Magueritas (not impressed at all both with size and taste) one appetizer (they basically warmed up CREAM cheese... yes cream cheese, and diced up some jalapenos and called that a cheese dip) a Taco salad and a quesadilla for $80.00 it is to much.. We normally have the same stuff on other competitor's locations and we don't spend more than $50... with more volume, and the most important... wayyyyyyy better food, with very comfortable tables.
