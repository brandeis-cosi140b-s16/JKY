Disappointing. The Avondale location must have different cooks/recipes because I've eaten there multiple times and always been pleased. The Scottsdale location on the other hand was terrible. The location is good, but the restaurant still screams Bennigans or Luby's or whatever it should be but isn't "Mexican." The salsas were blah. Again, Avondale is doing something different. The queso was nearly inedible with a very coarse, gritty texture. The plates came out and although my food was hot, my son's plate was cold. The cheese enchilada was boring. The beef "burro" was.....was....I don't know how to describe it. If the beef was on a hoagie it would have been a bad Philly cheese steak too. But, it was more suited to that than a Mexican burrito. 

Overall, I apologized to my family that I forced them to go there for dinner. Considering within 2 minutes of driving, there was Maggianos, Gordon Biersch, and a plethora of great restaurants, I was sorry I made them go. As we were leaving, I commented that the best thing I had was the water and my usually easy going daughter agreed. If you find yourself at that corner, pick another place.
