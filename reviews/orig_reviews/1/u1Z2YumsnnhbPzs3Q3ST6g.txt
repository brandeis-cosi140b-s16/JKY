Service was piss poor!! No chips/salsa, and we couldn't get any service after ordering drinks which actually wasn't an real issue because NOTHING on the menu jumped out at us, but we opted to at least get a margarita.  After not seeing our waiter forever, we asked the hostess for our check....nothing..... So we asked another waitress...nothing....finally, our waiter came to give us our check and he was interrupted by yet another table who was unhappy with their service as well and took forever to run our card!!! Sorry Chayo, but there are WAY too many options on the strip Vegas to have such horrible service.
