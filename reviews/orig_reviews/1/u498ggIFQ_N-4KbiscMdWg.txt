I've been to Old Town Tortilla Factory several times and always recommend it for out of town guests because of the great patio. On my last visit, all four in my party were terribly disappointed with their dishes. There was no flavor, no spice - even though we all ordered the "spicy" dishes, and completely disappointing considering the high prices. The margaritas - at $12 a drink did not contain much tequila and were watered down.
