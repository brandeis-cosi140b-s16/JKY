This place is not worth your time and money. Second visit to this restaurant, first was when they first opened. Friday nite visit, restaurant was crowded, Marachi music being played. Seated quickly, drink order filled promptly and chips, salas,beans brought. Ordered a Chopped salad and chicken fajitias. Plates served hot, but items beans/rice were cold. Rice was tasteless and hard, Beans cold a bit sour, which leads me believe they weren't fresh. This restaurnt is way over-priced for what you get, you;d do much better at some local mexican restaturants close by. Won't be back ever again...
