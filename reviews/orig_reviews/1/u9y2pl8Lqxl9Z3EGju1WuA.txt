After we ordered and sat down my daughter called the sanitation rating to my attention...after I seen that I just couldn't get past it - so that being said not sure if it was good or not I got disgusted. So I'm going to rate there sanitation score seeing as I know the business of health inspections this business is the lowest I have ever stepped foot in (91). You NEVER want to eat at a restaurant that is below a 95.5....just sayin'.
