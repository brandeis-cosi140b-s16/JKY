I'm from NM and nothing between the 5 of us in my party had anything remotely close to New Mexico cuisine. I should of thought twice when I asked the server what part of nm they're from and he looked at me with a puzzled look, they're from Wisconsin but they spent some time in NM. From now on its los dos molinos for me and mine for real New Mexican in AZ.
