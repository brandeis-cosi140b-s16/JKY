Sorry Nacho Daddy but I'm giving ya 1 star. I've never walked out on a restaurants before ordering but we were not impressed by the atmosphere or the lack of mexican dishes offered. We were craving tacos and were disappointed to see only one dish on the menu. I know each restuarant has there own complimentary snacks brought to the table like bread or chips and salsa but here you give jalepeno corn bread muffins and sadly they weren't cooked all the way and were so tiny. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better experience for us.
