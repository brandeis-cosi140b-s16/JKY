I came here with my husband for a date night, and let me say how our night went from okay to horrible.

1.) It took forever to get someone to take our drink order, i think my husband timed it being around 20 minutes before someone came.
2.) Once we ordered our appetizer and our meals our appetizer didn't even come.
3.) When we ate our food something didn't seem right, my chicken was way undercooked and when i voiced it i was immediately turned away and made it seem like it was my fault.

The vibe we got from this place is just horrendous and we will never come back again.
