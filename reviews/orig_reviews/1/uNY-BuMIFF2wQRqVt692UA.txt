My husband and found this place a few months ago.  The food was great so, we returned several times.  It wasn't until our last three trips that it all turned sour for us.  The service was slow and I mean no refills on drinks, food came out after long time etc.  What irritated me the most was our last visit.  The place was busy as usual and we waited to order drinks, then our food and then NOTHING.  The waiter never came back!!!  We found out later he walked off the job with two other servers.  Our food came out and it was cold.  Then we needed drink refills and nobody came by the table.  Then we just wanted our check as we had friends with us and their was no service.  My husband finally flagged another guy down, after an hour of waiting and asked for a bill.  NOTHING!!! It wasn't until we were ready to walk out that he said to the supervisor at the hostess stand
