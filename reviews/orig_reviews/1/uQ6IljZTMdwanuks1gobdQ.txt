If this is the "best mexican in madison," then I'll not be eating much mexican. It is authentic, but there were bones in my chicken taco, which was somewhat bland besides that. I also ordered a torta and a pork taco. The pork taco had flavor, but the torta was light on meat and felt like a mouthful of bread. I didn't finish my meal, which is very unusual for me.
