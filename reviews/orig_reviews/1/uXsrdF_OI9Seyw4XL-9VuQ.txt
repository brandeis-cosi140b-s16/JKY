My friends and I went here for Happy hour.  It looked like a fun spot for a few drinks and food. We sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly, that is about all the good I can say about this place.
We were served with a dirty plate, the food was horrible.  We ordered chips and salsa, which was good.  The steak Quesadilla, Ceviche and taquitos were terrible. The margaritas were very weak.  
I had a coupon so that is why we decided to try this place.  When the bill came they would not accept it for Happy Hour.  It does not say anything on the coupon about not using for Happy Hour.  The bill also had many mistakes, over charging on several items.  
We will not be going back here, even though I still have my $25.00 off coupon.  It is not worth being served horrible food.
