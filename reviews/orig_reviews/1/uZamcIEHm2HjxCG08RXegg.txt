Outrageously expensive place does not serve Mexican food, but instead food that has been manipulated by a chef to resemble something from Mexico.  Some items are good, but you will leave hungry and broke which is not the best approach for a restaurant to take.  Drive into one of the great places in Phoenix if you want real Mexican food, and some money left in your wallet.
