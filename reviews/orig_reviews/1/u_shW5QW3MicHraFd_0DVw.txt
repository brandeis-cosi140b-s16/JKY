I generally dont write reviews on fast food type places because they tend to be the same, a-ok type food. This place was horrible though.

Came here on a Sunday night at 8pm. Proceed to wait inline and order food. There was only 1 person in front of us yet it took forever to get our food! The burrito maker kid messed up the burrito for the person in front of us 2 times so he had to remake it over and over. Then when it came to my turn i ordered a grilled chicken burrito basic toppings. He places it in the conveyor heater and proceeds to finish the 1st customers order. My burrito goes through the conveyor and comes out and just sits there...what was the point of heating it up if it get cold sitting there?? Finally the customer in front finishes. I get my burrito and order a side of chips+salsa. Again i wait for the guy to go in the back to get more chips. 

So i finally sit down to eat my burrito. Its not good at all. Its not even hot. The chicken tastes like the Tyson brand frozen stuff you get at the supermarket. The rice had no flavor, it was basically a tasteless burrito. The only thing that was good was the salsa for the chips. I really didnt see the hype for this place. Chipotle is 10x better and the chicken taste like chicken! definitely would not eat here ever again. id rather get a hotdog from 7-11
