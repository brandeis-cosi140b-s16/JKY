I arrived to stay at TI tonight darling 11:30pm.  I haven't even had a drink when I was in the floor and I heard my favorite song playing at senor frogs. I walked in around 12:20 and went to the bar to get a drink. 10 minutes later, a bartender never took my drink so I decided to leave. There was shredded paper ALL over the floor and I fell and twisted my ankle on it! I was in so much pain and so embarrassed. No one came to my aid and I told the security to clean up the floor cus someone could get hurt even worse! He told me, " that's confetti Fuck off!" I couldn't believe it!!! I asked to speak to his manager and again he told me to Fuck off!!!  My foot is swollen and I can barely walk.  I wouldn't have made such a big deal if I had been apologized to and seen they were cleaning up the mess, but instead I was told to f*** off several times. I'll be filing a lawsuit this week!!!
