Place is awesome. Food is also good. Service sucks and what ever you do look at your bill.   We went there with another couple . My good friends pick up the tab.  After paying we left that night they told us the bill was 345.00.  WTF.   We went over what we ordered cause we had a menu the bill with drinks came to 165.00.      Really 2 lady's 2 men. How much food can we eat.   We got a total of 5 dishes.   1 drink each.
