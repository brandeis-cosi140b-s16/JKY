I tried to go here, but the bouncer wouldn't let me in because of my out of state ID. I was visiting from South Dakota. I'm 23 years old! The bouncer was such a jerk about it. I called the manager and complained, just because the guy was so mean to me! He told me we could go find a cop and have them scan it, after I said that would be fine, he told me to leave. ??? No thankssss.
