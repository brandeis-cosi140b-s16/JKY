[Edit]
I'm downgrading this establishment after the bullsh!t I went through today.
I've been frequenting this place on a regular basis. I love the tacos. However, as I stated, they charge .50 cents per credit card transaction (which is already a bunch of bull).
I placed my order and saw they had fresh pineapple juice.
I asked to add that to my order but instead of adding the juice to my order she charged me two different transactions on my card!
I told her it was a bad move but she didn't care and gave me some BS about the cost and blah, blah, blah.
Taking cards is the cost of doing business.
Don't think I'll be going back.
Sucks because they do make good tacos but I'm a stickler for service and fairness.
