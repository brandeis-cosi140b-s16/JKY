NOPE! HUH UH! DOO-DOO! Ok. This is pretty harsh. I was there for the first time on 9/2/2010 before the last of the Cardinals pre-season opener for a bite before the game. There was a wait....ok....got it! However, their were open tables? Don't GOT it! The hostess said "Your table is ready" yay! "Oh, by the way would you mind sitting on the patio"? We were game for it. The Hostess then walks us through the patio and out to.....wait for it......Arizona beach area?! Low back, low to the ground wooden benches and beach style chairs. Yeah, sure in Arizona 100 plus heat. Not happening. So, we wait for an inside table. We eventually get one. The friendly waitress Jesse takes our drink order. We wait about 4 minutes or so.....perfect. Jesse takes our food order. We wait about 50 minutes for not so good food. I was with 2 other people. We ordered the following. Person #1 ordered Nacho's w/ sour cream on the side. Person #2 ordered a grilled chicken Quesadilla and I ordered fried Ice Cream. They were all terrible. The Quesadilla was as thin as Taco Bell's and three times the price. I mean they were SKIMPY! The Nacho's I was told were chewy. Nice, just what one would like, chewy nacho's. Jesse our server did apologize for the wait saying this " Im so sorry you had to wait. I keep telling the staff to hold off on seating people to give the kitchen a chance to get caught up" WELL, that explains why we could not be sat inside when there were tables open. So, like I said. Pretty bad execution, bad food, long wait. NO GOOD! If you go keep in mind too the menu is extremely limited. So, ADIOS....thats goodbye in.....well I'm just sticking with the theme, using my resources!
