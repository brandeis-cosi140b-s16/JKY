There was a homeless man collecting the trays on the outside tables, didn't think much of it and continued in. Took a few minutes to figure out what I wanted. We proceeded to walk up to order and the homeless man was blocking my way. He smelled like alchohol and tried talking to us. He stood there staring blocking our way until I finally said excuse me and went around him. The workers could see the whole thing!! I tell the worker the man was bothering us and pointed him out. By then the homeless man was at somebody's else table bothering them. The worker did nothing so I told him to get the manager. The manager didn't want to do anything either and tried to laugh it off. Finally she went and told him to leave a good 5 minutes later. 
Then I got charged for 3 tacos instead of 2! The charge is almost $1 for extra cheese! They put the cheese on the bottom of the taco, I want cheese on top but not for an extra dollar per taco and a song that is sung when you order extra cheese. 
On to the food.... The pork was dry and flavorless.. The barbacoa was sweet and I really don't want my tacos to taste sweet like candy.
Overall I will not return or reccomend. If I want those types of tacos I will stick to chipotle.
