I honestly have to say that this restaurant is terrible.  I ordered the BBQ Nachos which looked good at the table, but lacked taste and the chips were stale and lacked freshness.  Then we ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas to share, again the presentation looked good, but once you tasted the meal it lacked so much flavor.  The additional plate with the rice and beans were horrible.  The rice had no flavor and was crunchy and the refried beans seemed like they were cooked and re-cooked which makes them dry up and taste bad.  I would not recommend this restaurant for a Downtown Las Vegas meal.
