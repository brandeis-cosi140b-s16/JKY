I went here with a group of people, and I'm really glad that I wasn't the one footing the bill, because if I was, I would have been angry and disappointed. We came into the restaurant for lunch shortly after it opened, and our table was literally the only party in the entire restaurant. You would think that would give us a pretty good chance of getting good service, but no, the service was terrible. The waitstaff managed to mess up not one but two special requests, and it took over an hour to get our entrees. With appetizers, the meal was an hour and a half affair. One of my biggest complaints was the salsa-- it was EXTREMELY watered down. The Pace salsa that I buy at Costco is better quality than their salsa. The portions were small, and the food is not at all authentic Mexican cuisine. I guess it's some sort of fusion cuisine. Whatever it is, it's pretentious, and it falls flat.
