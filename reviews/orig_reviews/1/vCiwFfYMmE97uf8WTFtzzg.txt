Went here for lunch today.  Its lent so no meat of Fridays, so had to go with fish.....shrimp burritos sounded good.  Originally was going to go to Wahoo's but we wanted some Margaritas with lunch and Chevy's has great margaritas.  Should have went to Wahoo's.  Its lunch time and was not that busy at all.  We sat out on the patio, and the service was SLOW.  No silverware, took awhile to get our drinks.  I ordered a shrimp burrito....my food comes out..I get shrimp tacos.  Waitress asks if I wanted it taken back which normally I would have but we were starting to run out of time( had to be somewhere at 200).  The people we were with came a lil later than us and it took a long time for them to get chips and salsa, and their appetizer order came way late as well.  So I get the bill and was charged full price for what I didn't order. Normally I would ask for a manager or something but now it's getting danger close to being late for my 2 pm thing i gotta be at.  The food was good but the service made the meal not so great.   Also here is a free tip.  When you order a margarita order the small.  I had a large and it was 11.99 I didn't want to get blasted but wanted another so I ordered a small one for my second.  I emptied the ice out of the empty large one and dumped the small one in the large glass and it was almost the same amount (probably less than 2 oz).  Shame on you Chevy's you just lost a customer I hate shady stuff like this from a so called reputable chain establishment.  Should have went to Wahoo's!!
