My review from last night was deleted so am reposting:

I don't typically take the time to write reviews, but I want to add to the other poor reviews of this place because they are correct.  Everything here is overpriced, very small portions and average quality food.  We tried a variety of dishes all on our waiter's recommendations and were not impressed.  We were assured it was family style servings, but the portions were actually $2 side dish sizes for $20+.  Cosmo has a lot of great restaurants, this is not one of them.
