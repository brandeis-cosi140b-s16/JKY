We waited for almost an hour for our food for pick up, we were hoping it was worth the wait since there were so many people and it seemed like everyone loved the food, well I was WRONG! The meat was DRY, the horchata was STALE and tasted BLAND. If you want good Mexican food I'd go to filibertos instead and at least the wait will be far less than an hour. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Food was just AWFUL.
