I imagine this could be a good place but the staff isn't getting it done. No greeting upon entering.  Just a "sit anywhere." Sat down to find our table was sticky and had food crumbs on it. Our waiter had 2 tables of people including us and there were only 3 or 4 tables of people in the building.  No excuse for everything taking way too long. After 10 minutes he had forgotten that we ordered water and had to be reminded. The warm salsa is not good. Food prices are good but the drink prices are way too high. $9 for an average margarita is not ok. I would like to think our food tasted and looked good when it came off the grill. However,  by the time it reached our table it was not. The fajitas were barely above room temperature and chewy.  Enchiladas were warm-ish and bland.  I am not usually one to complain but this whole experience was bad for us. We paid our check and left without eating more than a few bites. There are many other good options in this area and I am not planning to return unless I hear about some major changes to this place.
