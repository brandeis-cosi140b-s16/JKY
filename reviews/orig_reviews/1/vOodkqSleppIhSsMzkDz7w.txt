My girlfriend and I have been going here for about 2 years now. The last two times here the service and food have gone downhill. Great location and view is awesome. I guess they are leaning on that for your dining experience. I ordered the fajitas last visit and this time I tried the enchiladas, fajitas had no flavor and the enchiladas tasted like the microwave variety. Sorry to see this place go downhill. Hope they fix the problems. Also it's extremely noisy with the band playing. I figured the band was on the weekend but it seems every night. Maybe if they got rid of the band and concentrated back on the food I would go back! No offense nobody wants trumpets blowing off in their ears when you are trying to eat!
