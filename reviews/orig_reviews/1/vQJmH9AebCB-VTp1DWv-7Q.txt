I am really hoping I just had a rare bad experience at this place but that never happened when this was Super Mex.

My first review was glowing. They seemed to have not missed a beat since becoming JC from Super Mex. All was on point then minus the chips and salsa. This last visit I had was just disappointing.

They still have the grilled veggie burrito on the menu that Super Mex had, and I decided to order it again now that they're JC. Man, what a mistake! It was absolutely flavorless and overdone on the black pepper. I mean OVERDONE! All I could taste in each bite was black pepper! Brought my Mom for the ride and she said she could smell the black pepper clear across the booth! Absolutely awful! The waitress asked me if everything were good and I lied and said yes only because I was in a hurry, and didn't have time for them to do it over.

My Mom was a fan of their chimichangas when they were Super Mex and she said her order this go round as JC was extremely flavorless as well. And my favorite waitress wasn't there anymore. :(

At the end of the day, goodbye Super Mex. You will be missed. Also, goodbye Jalisco Cantina, but you will not be missed.
