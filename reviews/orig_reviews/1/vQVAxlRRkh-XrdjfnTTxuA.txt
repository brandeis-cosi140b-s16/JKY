Do not waste your money. Worst chimachanga ever. Carne asada very good the tortillas were a disaster. Soggy. Chips and salsa nothing special. Chips
 old and stale. Burrito wrapped in cardboard. Taco salad dressing not good either. Besides it was expensive. Across the street is the red white and brew which I highly recommend.
