Waitress first day on the job.  Can"t speak english.  Doesn"t understand me.  Food is ok. View is great.  Sign says max play gets you free drink.  What it means is $20.  So they can't even write what they mean.  This place belongs in Mexico.  Sorry but this is USA.  I ask for lunch chili Verde I get tagged dinner and am charged for it.  Terrible, don't go here.
