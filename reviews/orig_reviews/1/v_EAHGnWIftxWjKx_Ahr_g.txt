I hate Yelp.  I detest that people would rather sit through a bad restaurant experience than be proactive on the spot, get a manager and make things instantly better. Instead, they fester in their car ride home and then critique what could have been fixed.  Because of this I don't get too negative and slam places... normally.

That being said guys, this was terrible and you need to 1. know about it  2.  fix it.  There were three people at your bar on a slow Thursday morning.  There were two bartenders, someone doing inventory and digging through the coolers and some other random staff on the floor.  The service was absolutely and completely non-existent.  Zero sense of urgency - at an airport none the less.  The employees were seemingly staring off into space and having random conversations with each other -  completely ignoring customers, tickets, bussing dirty plates, etc...  I have been in the industry for over 20 years and the anxiety I felt because the place was running so poorly was overwhelming.  The three of us at the bar, all complete strangers, were looking at each other in disbelief.  I guarantee we are all still talking about how frustrated we were.  A keg blew when this poor guy finally got some attention and the tap exploded foam all over him, only to be told by the bartender that "it happens all the time".  He got his beer 7 minutes later - a restaurant eternity.  Come on guys - I know it's an airport but it's still your name and you have to get some attention down there.
