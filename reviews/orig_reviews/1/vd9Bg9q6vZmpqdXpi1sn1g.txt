I am so gravely disappointed with the customer service at Diego Pops. After making multiple attempts to book their patio in April for a wedding rehearsal dinner, I have been ignored. I have called for Corey, the head coordinator for booking for over 2 weeks now. I was given a quote of around $10,000 which I am more than willing to pay. When I called and spoke to Ericka last week, she promised me that Corey would call me that evening, after she told me that they had meetings over my event. 
So, Diego Pops- you have meetings about my potential booking but refuse to return my call? 
I am disappointed and so confused. Boo on you, Diego Pops.
