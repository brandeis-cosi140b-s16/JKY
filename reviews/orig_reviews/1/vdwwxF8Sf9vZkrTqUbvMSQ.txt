I have no idea what kind of customers are giving this place so many stars. What must they be eating at home? The only good thing that I can say about this place, was that our waiter was very nice. But even he did not bother to ask us if our food was alright. The fajitas only flavor was rancid meat. I mean, it tasted old! And how do you call a cheese crisp a crisp, if it's a soggy mess? I had high hopes for this restaurant that was sitting empty for so long. But it was not to be.
