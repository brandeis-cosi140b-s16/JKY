Average.  First of all, I went to the Taqueria Guatalahara that everyone in Madison raves about.  Because I was dining by myself, I was offered the counter.  I asked for a table and you would think I was asking for a free meal.  After being escorted to a dirty table in the back with previous occupant's drink wet rings on the table and a menu plopped down as the snotty biotch started talking to other customers, I discovered they don't have margaritas and plus, you have to spend $10 to use a credit card,  I got up and left.   I arrived at la Hacienda determined to get Mexican food.  It's authentic.  The staff is authentic. I know, having travelled a lot to Mexico.  There was more staff working for pennies than customers.  Okay there were only about three tables of customers there.  I ordered and within 3 minutes, my dinner was in front of me.  Again, it's not the American version you get as "tex-mex" but it is what you get in Mexico.
