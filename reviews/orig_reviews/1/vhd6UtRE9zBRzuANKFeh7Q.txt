not the best for family dining and man was it not worth it! I am a huge fan of Elmer's Tacos (right down the street) and thought I would give Guedo's a try for once. MISTAKE. What kind of a place doesn't take CC's?  Disappointing to say the least. Food was below average and the lack of service and smiles really annoyed me.
