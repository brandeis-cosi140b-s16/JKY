This is poor food and slow service even by airport standards. Had to wait for friends to arrive in Term C & this was the closest (best?) full service options.  The cheese fries were so cold the few pieces of grated cheese in them wouldn't even melt. I was seated next to the pick-up window & had to listen to every server talk trash about their customers. Just all around a poor experience.  If this was anywhere other than an airport, they wouldn't stay in business a month.
