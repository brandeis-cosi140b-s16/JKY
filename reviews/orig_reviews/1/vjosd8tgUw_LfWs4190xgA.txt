Three of us came in on Saturday October 18 around 1330. We ordered chips and salsa and guacamole. The salsa was too spicy, the guacamole was good. Our Server was nice, but not personable. One of us order the stacked enchiladas, one had a chimichanga and the other other had the blue corn enchiladas. The chicken in the blue corn enchiladas was tough and she only found one shrimp in the other enchilada. The other two plates were not edible due to the spiciness of the sauces. Even before We left the restaurant I felt sick to my stomach. We can all tolerate spiciness, but what we had here was too much. If you are going to serve food this spicy at least give your patrons a warning. I will not be coming back.
