Terrible!! My wife dragged me here once again last month for her birthday and it was our last!! Here's how the nite went - sat down waited 15 minutes before we flagged down a busboy for chips and water. Chips came out hot and fresh with some tastey salsa! Thats when we should have left! We finish our chips and salsa - still no waitress, no menus and no waters!! And not just us mind you, the entire section!! Finally, a waitress gets to us and asks are you ready to order? Again, no water and no menus!! After another ten minutes makes her way back with water and menus and we order. Food comes out in five flat!! Precooked slop! Fish tacos stunk! No flavor - all fishy smell! Heres the kicker - shes drops a check on the table when we start eating and then gone again! She never comes back - no refills, no boxes for the kids meals, nothing! Again, this is the entire section!!! Well, I was going to skip out on the bill but, I paid and of course left her zero tip! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, AGAIN!! My wife even apologized to me about going there - on her birthday no less!! AVOID! THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!
