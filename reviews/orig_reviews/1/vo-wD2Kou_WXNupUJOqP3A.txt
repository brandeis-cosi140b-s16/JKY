Agave has the worst service in Las Vegas! 

I've been to this restaurant several time and I can honestly say I have NEVER had good service here. Good luck getting anyone to greet your table, take your food order, or get drink refills in a timely manner. Also, you might want to ask for the check as soon as your food arrives at the table because you wont be able to get anyone's attention if you need something else. 

On two separate occasions, I've actually had to go to the host stand and ask someone to have our server bring the check because we had not seen him/her since our order was taken.  

If it wasn't for the Black Bean and Cheddar Soup, and the Crab and Shrimp Enchiladas I wouldn't go back.
