I didn't care for it all that much. I was really looking forward to it. But it kind of let me down. Really expensive. The salsa was very good though. I would of given it a 1 star had the salsa not been so good. I wish I would've just had a drink and chips and salsa. Then I would've left a very positive review. But me and my wife both felt horrible the remaining of the day also. Just kind of recurring burps of the food all night. I didn't want to eat my burrito, but at $15 for the burrito, I ate it anyways. I would've rather eaten at chipolte.
It ended up being worse for my wife. She spent all day on the toilet and puking. Then off to urgent care. Food poisoning is considered the most likely cause. I felt pretty bad after eating there but at least I wasn't doing as bad as her. $70 later for a crappy dinner and kind of ruining our trip to vegas. 1 star now. Only because they don't have negative star ratings.
