Worst service EVER!! I called in so I wouldn't have to wait. The lady said 20-25 minutes. So I show up 40 minutes later, because they are notorious for under quoting the time. I get to the window to pay and ask if my order is ready and of course, it's NOT! Then I ask how much longer and the girl says 20-25 minutes. I also remind her I was told 20-25 minutes initially. Her response, "We are busy... I don't know.... We are busy.."
