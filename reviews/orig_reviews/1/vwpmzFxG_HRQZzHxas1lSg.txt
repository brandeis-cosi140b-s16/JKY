I AM REALLY BIG ON FOOD SAFETY!

I came here to try some Hawaiian Style Tacos which I haven't had in awhile.  I come in and a girl who looks like she was prepping something in the back earlier asked me what I wanted. She proceeds to grab gloves without washing her hands first. Her hands were clearly dirty and she grabbed the OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVES! Hello, the gloves are used for a reason!  I told the young lady to wash her hands and get a new pair of gloves which she did without question. 

Now she has gloves on, waiting for me to order, she is leaning against the counter with her gloves on the side of it and everything.  She then makes my taco Salad and straight grabs the salad with her hands. Maybe the counters are clean I said to myself as I kept picking my selections. She then grabs a tray which didn't seem clean as a bunch of water spilled over as she picked it up and put it back down.  Grabs my bowl and sticks her fingers in it.  At this point I'm over it and would rather starve a bit and find another option than getting sick from improper food handling and safety. 

Please train your workers on Food Safety! Then maybe I might come back one day.
