We haven't been here I a couple of years because it was terrible the last time. It hasn't changed. The chips were ok, salsa is fantastic. I ordered a margarita and it tasted good. For that one tiny sip in the glass. It was so packed with ice there was nothing in the glass. I had Tacos pastor. The pork was dry and the tortillas ice cold and dried out. Husband had a quesadilla because he didn't like the menu. It was supposed to have corn of which there was none. He is a glutton and only ate one piece. It came laying on a mound of potato salad???  If he doesn't eat something there is really A problem. We both feel gross from eating food that was gross. Never, never again. Husband says decor and salsa rate them a star. Oh and even worse we got seated in an area packed with kids. They were screaming and throwing stuff, standing in chairs. What happened to babysitters?
