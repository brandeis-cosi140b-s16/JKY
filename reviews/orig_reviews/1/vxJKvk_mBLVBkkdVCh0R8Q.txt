This was the worst experience I have ever came across. The male server was the most disrespectful person I have ever met. Considering I am a bartender an server at a Mexican restaurant I know how to treat customers right as they are always right if they are not satisfied. We asked if they had beans an rice an he told us to go Taco Bell if we wanted that. He said his manager told his employees to say that... How disrespectful? I asked for a blended margarita an he said to go to 7 eleven an get a slurpee there... I will never come back to this place unless they get new management or figure out how to communicate w costumers.
