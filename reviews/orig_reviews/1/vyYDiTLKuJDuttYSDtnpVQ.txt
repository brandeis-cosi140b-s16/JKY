I'm in Vegas for work for a month. I stopped to get some food here and it was horrible. Worst Mexican food ever. Everything was just bland. No flavor, none. Taco Bell is better than this place. Also it said no smoking and there were signs everywhere but people were smoking inside and it smelled like stale cigarettes. I realize as a Californian I am often biased as to what constitutes good mexican food. But this place was the worst I've ever experienced.
