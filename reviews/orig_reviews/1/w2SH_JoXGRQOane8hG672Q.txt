Would have put zero stars but it won't let me! I have been here so many times but now I'll never come back. We come for the club in Saturday nights and I loved to come here because there is no dress code but then we came with 10 heads and all of a sudden they change the dress code, without even posting something in their web site and we couldn't get in because one of the guys in our party was wearing Jordan's! We took a $40 can ride just to get here and we come here all the time and they are telling us no even after we told them we were planning in getting a few bottles! Plus they were so rude about it! I'll never come back after this and am so disappointed!!
