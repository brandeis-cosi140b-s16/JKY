Wow.  If it was possible to give a place negative stars, I would have.  I purchased a gift certificate for this restaurant on restaurant.com.  My husband and I took our three small children there on Saturday night.  The hostess looked annoyed that she had to seat us.  Once at the table, three waiters passed us by without asking what we wanted to drink, etc.  Once we had been there for about 6 minutes, a bus boy brought us some salsa.  He asked if we knew about the salsa and I said no, we hadn't eaten there in years.  His response was "oh it's the same" which didn't explain anything at all.  We continued to sit for another 10 minutes or so, with no drinks, and thirsty children as waiter after waiter passed us by.  The table that got seated 30 seconds before us got their food and we still hadn't been served even a glass of water.  At this point, we left.  On my way out, I decided I should talk to a manager.  The bartender got him for me.  As he was coming to the front, he refused to make eye contact with me, and actually passed me right by and was chatting with the hostess at the station.  When I said "excuse me!" he turned and said "yeah."  I explained to him what happened and that we were leaving and his response was to turn to me, gesture to the restaurant and say "the restaurant is full, you think you make a difference?  I have never been so insulted in my life.  I would never return to this restaurant, and I would never ever recommend it to anyone.  What a disaster.  The customer sevice sucks, the manager is an ass, and the entire experience was a total joke.
