Not healthy at all! 
...I came here thinking it had a variety of selected foods and it didn't. I was completely disappointed. Everything looked greasy, dirty and old-looking, like if the food was from several days before. It didn't look fresh at all. It gave me an instant unpleasant perception as I walked in, so I decided to immediately turn around and walk out. As I looked up, I saw LOS TACOS and felt like I had betrayed my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world. Thank God I just had to walk across the parking lot to get guaranteed amazing food at LOS TACOS.
