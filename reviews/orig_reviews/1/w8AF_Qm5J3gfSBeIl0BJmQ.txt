I was really looking forward to eating here. Container Park food options are pretty limited and I assumed with a name like this, and all the controversy surrounding the name which I think hyped up the anticipation at least for me, it's got to be good. I was wrong. 

We ordered two steak tacos and a steak salad. The steak on all three items was super dry and completely lacked seasoning. The tacos didn't come with lettuce or cheese. Really nothing other than dry meat wrapped in a tortilla. Fail. 

The salad was even more disappointing. There wasn't much lettuce, mostly cabbage and the portion was so tiny!! Can't believe I paid over $12 for this teeny, tiny  The dressing lacked any flavor. I was really disappointed with the food here. 

It's a bummer but I will not be returning and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
