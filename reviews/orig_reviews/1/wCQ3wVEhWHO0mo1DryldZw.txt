Like William T. I too have been coming here since high school. I'm 52.  I made a special trip to pick up some take out from them. 9 miles round trip. Highly disappointed on all levels. I called to express my disappointed and the attitude I received from Hannah...I was a little taken back. Sorry to report today was the last day for me and my husband at Los. Who packs a tostada on top of enchiladas covered in sauce?!?! My tostada was so soggy it was disgusting. AND who packs all the heavy items on top of a flimsy box containing an open face cheese crisp so the cardboard is sticking to the cheese!! Eww!  My tamale was dry, I didn't even bother tasting the enchilada, it looked dry too. Way too many other Mexican restaurants to choose from within 2 miles of my house including Carlos O'Briens. I'll just remember the good ole days when the food and service was good at Los.
