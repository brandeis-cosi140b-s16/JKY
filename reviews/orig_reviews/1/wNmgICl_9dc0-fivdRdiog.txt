My partner and I went for an early dinner.  We were inspired by reviews on Yelp and Echo Magazine.  When we entered we got escorted by the Host to a table for two and supplied with menus.  He was not welcoming or talkative, just doing his job.  Shortly after, came the waiter, who was hostile and obnoxious,  to take our drink orders.  He made no eye contact and seemed impatient to get our order over and done.  The girl server who brought us our drinks and the chips with salsa was the only kindness that we were shown throughout our short visit.  There was also a screeching child making the atmosphere even more unbearable. The chips and salsa were underwhelming and my Sprite tasted like it was dunked in toilet water.  I would have reviewed the food but the waiter never returned to take our order so we decided to pay for our drinks and go.  No one stopped us to ask why.  They just didn't care.  I don't know if their food was good or not but we know when we are not welcome.  It was one of the worst experiences we've had in Phoenix.....Manuel P.
