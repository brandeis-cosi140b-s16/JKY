Ate here this past Saturday 1/25/14. At 2pm. As always, I ordered the Carne Asada, with pork, beef and chicken. Shared it with my 
Daughter and even had enough to take home to my other daughter.    Nine hours later all three if us were throwing up like mad!!!!!! It was aweful!!!! 

It had to be this dish as it is the only thing the three of us had eaten that day. 

Before we had all gotten sick that night, the leftovers had been put into the fridge earlier that day, So, unbenounced  to me, on Sunday night, my son ate the rest of it. I had no idea, UNTIL 3 am on Monday morning, he was hacking all over his bedroom!!!! 

I asked him what he ate, and he said the left over Tia Rosa!!!! OH Lordy! I had forgotten it was in the fridge!!! 

So, just wondering if anyone else got sick from eating Tia Rosa Carne Asada eaten on or around Saturday, Jan. 25.  

I have never had a bad experience at Tia Rosa and we eat there often, but I am going to call and ask for a refund! I know accidents happen, but I am not going to pay for improperly prepared food that made me SICK AS A JUNKYARD DOG!
