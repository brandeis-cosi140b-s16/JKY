This was the closest I've ever come to eating actual rope. 

The chicken was so dry I asked for box so I could use it to anchor my boat. After two thunderstorms, the boat and chicken-based boat device are both in tact.

Additionally, all of the other purported "meat" used to fill taco shells were equally as unsavory.  However, none of the other fillings had anywhere near the tensile strength as the chicken-rope. 

Thanks taqueria canonita! 

PS - if you do have a need for cheap rope, don't plan on going here with others. You'll  end up paying for all of their chicken-ropes, as well. They do not split checks.
