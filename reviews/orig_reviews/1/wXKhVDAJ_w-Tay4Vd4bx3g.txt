Just tried them for the first time and I have been waiting for them to open. Terrible terrible terrible. I asked a veggie burrito with no gauc and it was covered in it and I dont like mushrooms and she said that there weren't many in the veggies and that was a fabrication. I tossed it in the trash without eating it And the tacos that we ordered tasted like they had been sitting there for awhile and they were soggy. I'm glad we tried it cause now I'm not wondering and I won't be going back
