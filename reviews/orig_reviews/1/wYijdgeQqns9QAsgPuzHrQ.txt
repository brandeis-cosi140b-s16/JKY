Food was well below average and well above average price! 

Service was even worse, so bleeding slow, ask for manager, even then it took 15 for this little man to come to the table. He was condescending and obviously in over his head. Never apologized for the slow rude service, never offered a dessert or round of over priced drinks. 

So much has changed over the past few years at Hard Rock, no consistency, poor service from all levels.. No wonder they are in the dumps! Do yourself a favor, walk right past this place, go eat on the strip.
