Let's start with the positive: The food and drinks tasted great.

WORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A VERY LONG TIME. We ordered three margaritas and two orders of tacos, and the bartender charged us for six margaritas and four orders of tacos--plus he charged us for the beer of the guy next to us. When I tried to get him to fix it, he came back with the wrong amount a second time (still over charging us), and the the third time he just ran my credit card without allowing me to see the itemized bill. I was mortified, and he extremely rude.

Also, the people next to me gave their credit card, and when they attempted to get it back, they were told by this same bartender that they never gave him their card. They insisted for thirty minutes, and which point he said to them," NO ONE HERE HAS YOUR CREDIT CARD. YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU GAVE IT TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND YOU DIDN'T" When another bartender gave them back the card a few minutes later, there was no apology.

Z Tejas is right across the street. The food is delicious and the bartenders are phenomenal. I was just there and without my even saying anything, when the food took over twenty minutes to come out, they comped our entire meal!
