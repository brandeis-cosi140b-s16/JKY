I'm DONE with Cafe Rio! The last couple of times I have been to this restaurant, I have noticed a decline in many places.
To start, I was in on Tuesday about 5:00. This place us being run by a bunch of children who are loud and unprofessional. There were at least eight employees standing around in the dining room and two employees smoking in front of the restaurant. It looked like a high school cafeteria. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL. 
Next, I have watched the prices grow and the portion sizes shrink. What used to fill the container almost all the way, now barely fills half. Two burritos and a bag of chips comes to $25.00.  
There are several other similar restaurants that are MUCH cheaper. Cafe Rio used to be much better than those places but NOT ANY MORE.
To finish, after getting home and digging into our mini burritos, we found that they were full of CRUNCHY rice and the chips were totally stale. 
I am DONE with this Cafe Rio! I wonder if the owner knows that their restaurant is being run into the ground.
