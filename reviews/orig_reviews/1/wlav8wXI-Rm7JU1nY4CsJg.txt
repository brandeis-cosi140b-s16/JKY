Ordered 3 Carne Asada Taco's for about $8. Order came out quickly and as I was handed the bag I looked inside and said, oh, I ordered 3 not one. Or are all three wrapped up in that tiny piece of tinfoil? You got it! 3 micro tacos that were at best an after thought. I walked out and about half way to the car, looking inside the bag opening the tin foil at the saddest sight I ever saw - 3 wanna be tacos that were aborted at birth... I said to myself....No I am not the one getting taco f**k*d here. Went back inside and said sorry this is not going to work for me. Instead I went over to 2 Hippies Taco's on 5th and Cambelback where they sell "REAL" taco's. 3 for $6 including tax! All 3 of America's Taco's could readily fit inside ONE of the 2 Hippies Taco's and have room left over!!! No joke! No attempt was made at customer satisfaction so I shall not return to America's Sad Taco Shop.
