I'll just list a few bullet points for you to consider.

-Seated quickly
-Ignored by server
-Forgot Mom's margarita
-Server called my son "big man"...all night.
-Cheeze whiz on my burrito
-Tacos that tasted like vomit
-Every table seated in our server's section was in and out before us
-Wrong bill delivered
-Manager never stopped by to find out why we sent items back and asked to be removed from bill.

The chips and salsa were "ok"


Even though I've been in the past and enjoyed the experience, I most likely will not return.
