My husband and I went for the first time today. He had been driving by Sylvia's for a while and wanted to try it. I'm going to just get to the point the food was horrible except for the chili con queso which is an appetizer. The beans were terrible and the rice seemed even worse. It had such an old after taste. The service? The worst we've ever experienced in the 9 years we have been together. The waiter was upset with all the staff, getting mad at them, rolling his eyes and yelling at them all. I've never gone out to eat and have been so uncomfortable and felt so much tension before. Not only was he messing up our order but it was like he was irritated with us for being there. He was not only giving terrible service but was just so irritated i couldn't even ask a question. forget the fact that we would have liked refills on our drinks. We couldn't get out fast enough. Our waiter was named John or Shawn. This was our first and DEFINITELY last time ever! We are also really good tippers but again this is the first time in 9 years that we were forced to give such a bad tip. We did call on the way home but there was no manager to speak with. We told the girl on the phone about it but she obviously wasn't to concerned because she listened, said she was sorry and then click! DO NOT GO HERE, THERE ARE MANY WONDERFUL MEXICAN RESTAURANTS IN THE VALLEY THAT DESERVE YOUR MONEY!
