When I arrived they was a stretecher taking some guy out with oxygen.... usually a bad sign.... I ordered a Mojito which was very good, our table shared an appetizer which then got us all extremely sick (some worse than others) and I felt like I had been poisoned and needed my own ambulance. 24 hours later I recovered..... the food tasted good, but I would not return based on this experience... Obviously some kind of contamination occured in the kitchen while we were there...scarry
