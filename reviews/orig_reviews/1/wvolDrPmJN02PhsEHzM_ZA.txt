Bartender stressed the authenticity of how traditional the food is here but yet they will NOT serve a customer chips and salsa. Claims there wasn't a button for it (what ever that means) and it wasn't worth losing his job for it. If you order the $10.95 tableside guacamole you can have chips. They do HAVE chips and they DO have salsa but it's not available to customers. They offer $25 meals but no chips and salsa. What a sham.
