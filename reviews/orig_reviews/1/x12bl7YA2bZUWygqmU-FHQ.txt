Apparently not being fluent in spanish is a problem for these people. When i asked if they sold posole i was hung up on. Rude. N seriously the health department should probably be called. I didn't know asking if they sold a product that i wanted would be an issue. Im sorry im white i guess. Rude people shouldn't be working in customer service.
