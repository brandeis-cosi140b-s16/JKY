1-star is putting it lightly. They're lucky 1 is required. My waiter was horrible, to put it lightly. He spilled a drink on me, didn't clea it up or even bring extra napkins so I could take care of it myself. He brought my brother-in-law a half empty soda, charged us full price. Charged us for the drink he spilled on me. My sister ate one bite of her meal and wanted to send it back but the waiter was no where to be found until ::surprise:: the check was ready to be given. He took it out of our hands so quickly, and after about 5 minutes and not having brought our cards back to us, we spoke to the manager. The waiter was confused as to why we asked for the manager. He didn't think he did anything wrong! Insanity. The manager offered us free entree cards and we declined. Never returning.
