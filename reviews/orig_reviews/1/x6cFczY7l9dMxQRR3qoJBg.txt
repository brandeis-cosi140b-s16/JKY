The building is nice to look at,  but the food is terrible!  My 2 younger kids both ordered tacos from the kids menu with rice. Both love mexican food and neither could stand the flavor of this salt filled meal. It was like an entire container of salt was dumped onto each plate. I order beans which were disgusting.  By oldest son ordered a carne asada burrito.  He normally can eat anything and turned this food away. We walked away refusing to pay as none of our food was eatable. We will never go to this restaurant again.
