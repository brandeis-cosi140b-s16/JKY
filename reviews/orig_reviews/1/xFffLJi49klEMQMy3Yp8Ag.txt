Ruru Tacos are very bland, anticlimactic, and just flat out boring. Here's the breakdown:

Taco #1: I asked for a carnitas taco, and there was a layer of chicken on the bottom and pork on top. Who does that? 
Taco #2: The Fried chicken taco was beyond over fried, dry and the chicken pieces were obnoxiously small. It was almost as if they cleaned the bottom of the frier and gave me those pieces. 
Taco#3: I'm never one to order a steak taco, so I don't want to judge too harshly here. Nevertheless, it would have been nice not to take 1 bite and not have any steak left for the rest of the taco. The whole Korean steak idea was good, but that doesn't mean you can skimp on not seasoning your meat. 

All in all, This menu needs to step it's game up. Fall back on the slaw usage on the tacos as well - this shouldn't be the main way to spruce up poorly seasoned meat. One quick tip: if you're calling it guac, actually mix the ingredients together and BREAK DOWN the avocado so it's not technically "avocado with a side of chopped veggies" Also, not to mention that I don't know why a taco place doesn't even have the option for rice and beans. 

Lastly, I'm no taco snob/expert, but a side of rice and beans should be a dead given to have on the menu. I was fairly disappointed in this place but I'm sure my business will be given elsewhere. Over & out!
