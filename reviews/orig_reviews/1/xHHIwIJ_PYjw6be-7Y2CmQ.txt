5 stars for our server......one star for the cooks/or food runners lack there of. 4 tables in the restaurant, we watched two get their food after we ordered, so we were estimating that our apps were on there way......nope....still waiting...it's only a order of nachos & wings....still waiting...I figure it's ok since wings do take a lil longer to cook.....still waiting....30 minutes our apps arrive. Cold!!!!!!!!!! Seriously!!!!! It's no wonder they have horrible reviews and such a low star rating on here!
