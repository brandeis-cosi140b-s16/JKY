I treated my mom and aunt to lunch. The restaurant was pretty empty but we were advised that the restaurant was booked from 4pm until close. That would've been an acceptable response if it wasn't 2 in the afternoon. We were told we could sit at the bar ( 6-8 people were already seated and being obnoxiously loud) or at the bar tables ( which were filled with plates and glasses from the last patrons). The hostess and manager ( assuming) seemed annoyed by the fact that we asked why we couldn't sit at the plethora of empty tables, to clean the tables around the bar and explanation as to why no one wanted to help. Visiting with a convention and being treated the way we were makes me EXTREMELY unhappy and wouldn't recommend anyone visit this establishment. 
The only saving grace is Sal. He was super helpful.
