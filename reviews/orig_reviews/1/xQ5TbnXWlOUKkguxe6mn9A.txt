Unfortunately, I really did not enjoy my time at poncho's like my friend described to me. We were visiting Phoenix for a conference so my friend who is from Arizona mentioned Poncho's to me as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix because President Clinton specifically stopped by for authentic Mexican food. The story sounded very promising so we decided to try it out. 

The place was fairly crowded with a line about 30 minutes wait time. You could tell that the place has some history because the decorations are pretty old. Since there was a line, we felt pretty good about it just like my friend said. However, we started to feel differently as the waitress took us to our table through the restaurant. There was a very distinct smell around our table in the room. We couldn't tell whether it was the smell from the kitchen which was next to our table or the smell of old carpet that have been soaked with years of Mexican food. Regardless, what the smell was, it wasn't pleasant so here was the first impression. The menu provided some traditional Mexican food items, which were fairly authentic. However, the chips and salsa were underwhelming at the best. My main dish was again disappointing to the point that I didn't even remember what I ate. This was definitely one of most disappointing meals that I had for a long time. Personally, I will not recommend Poncho's to anyone and will not return to this place again.
