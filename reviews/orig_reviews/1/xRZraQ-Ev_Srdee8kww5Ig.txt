Worst service ever. Ive got so day that this place has the worst customer service and the food is just ok. We had a group of 8 people on a Friday afternoon and it was hardly busy at all. Sat and waited for about 15 minutes before anyone came up to give us menus. We actually had witnessed several servers dancing with each other in front of guests and especially us while waiting for someone to come for the first time. We finally walked up to one of the servers to ask who's serving us. From there we ordered food and some drinks and while 3 of the 4 people got their food, the 4th had to wait close to 10-15 minutes to get hers. Although she did order a few minutes after us. One of our friends didn't even get any silverware for her food, and none of us received any napkins. We had to ask for everything which took a long time. I not any of my group will be back again as I couldn't believe how terrible service was and how unprofessional the servers were. Most need to be fired....
