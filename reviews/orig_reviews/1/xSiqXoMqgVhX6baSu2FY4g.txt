We have patronized Macayo's since 1972 and never felt it was a poor choice until last week.  We ordered a single taco to accompany a bowl of soup.  It was no better than what is offered at Jack In The Box but was priced ten times more!!  Don't bother to go to their website and try for justice, they either do not read complaints or do not care to respond to them.  Apparently we are slow learners but we will not return to be treated like scum.  In house help was no help at all.  $5:00 tacos of that caliber are a disgrace.
