I am very surprised to see such high ratings for this place.  The ONLY thing going for Dos Gringos is the atmosphere.  It looks like it would be a fun place to hang out and have a cocktail with friends.  That is, if you can actually carry on a conversation without going hoarse because you have to yell to be heard over the blaring music. 

This was our first visit to Dos Gringos.  My husband and I went out without the kids during this visit.  I saw that they had a kids menu but didn't look at prices or choices.  The food was extremely disappointing.  the chips were obviously dumped out of a bag somewhere in the back and the salsa was....bland.    I ordered a pick two combo which came with mini (very mini, three bite tacos - could have been one bite for my husband) , flautas and rice and beans.  I swear that there could not have been more than 1 Tbsp of meat in each taco and flauta.  I don't think that the flautas actually had meat in them.  I take that back, a disgusting charred bit of steak fell out of it on my last bite.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos with rice and beans.  He ended up with substantially more food at a cheaper price than mine.  His tacos looked decent, but the meat I tasted was unimpressive. 

We don't plan on going back to Dos Gringos anytime in the near future.  Even the chain restaurants have them beat and that's not saying much!
