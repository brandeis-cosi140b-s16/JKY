If I could give this place negative stars I would. Actually I will NEGATIVE FIVE STARS HAHAHA! The idea of the place sounds kind of cool, outside, beach theme with sand volleyball, it even has a tiny pond.  The only problem is that little pond is a mesquito cesspool and the sand gets every where, chip crumbs too, the place is kinda dirty. The drinks are average $8 price, dance floor sucks, their arent very many attractive women,  lots of old people:). Oh and the staff,  they were pretty busy so I understand, but one guy in particular was kind of rude and heres the kicker as i finished my drink that i ordered from him, I realized there was a HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION STAPLE IN MY MOUTH!!seriously it was in my drink but, im such a lay back drunk tho i didnt even bother complaining because it just seems like something people do to like get free drinks and stuff.  Plus how would I really prove it. It was a black guy about 30 something years old that served me the drink not trying to be racist just warning people.  Luckily i wasnt hurt, and i guess it makes a moderately interesting story.  I wasnt being a douche or anything either I just came up and ordered my drink, he couldnt hear me and he asked again kind of frustrated with me and thats pretty much the exchange we had and then poof! STAPLE DRINK! Idk if it was on purpose but seems pretty wierd thing to show up in a drink accidently.  It was actually a little bit funny to me. Also this place is more bar than a restruant.

If you do decide to hit up Salty's ask them to hold the staples.
