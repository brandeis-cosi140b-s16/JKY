Overpriced!! The food was alright. the service there was absolutely *HORRID*. I get better service at Roberto's. lol. The drinks took forever to get, the food came out overcooked and super late. half the party was completely done eating and the other half had not yet even *received* their food. the manager was terrible. will never go there again.
