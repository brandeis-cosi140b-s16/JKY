Normally I enjoy this place, but the last time I went, the service was terrible. Not only that, the food was sub-par as well. 

I was greeted, as usual, when I walked in. During this visit, however, a young employee named Tyler made me wait in line for several minutes while he typed away on his phone. I was the only one in line at the time, so this was frustrating. He didn't seem to care about the quality of service, but I wasn't really there for that to begin with. I was just there for the food. 

Unfortunately, the lettuce and bean sprouts were both stale and flavorless. The kalua pig tasted fine, except I was given half as much as usual (not exaggerating).

I typically love this place, but I'll probably have to go to a different store next time because my most recent experience at this one was disappointing at most.
