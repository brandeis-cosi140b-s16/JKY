As much as I love Carolinas, I got sick for the 2nd time recently.
A breakfast burrito (Chorizo and egg) which looked a little grey, but tasted good. 
I wasn't horribly sick (like what happened the time before), but it was enough.
I can't go back.  At least for a year or two until I forget.

I just worry sometimes that things happen so fast in there is the quality and cleanliness always what it needs to be.

I have eaten at the Cactus store 100 times and sick twice is too much.
Still great food and a great spot, just need them to be more careful.
