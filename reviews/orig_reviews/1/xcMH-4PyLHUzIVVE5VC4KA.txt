Some friends and I stopped in for karaoke. We ordered drinks ( I had the $30 margarita)  and had some nachos. Omg the nachos were so bad. The drinks were fine. The kicker was when the bill was dropped off I noticed it seemed high. I asked for the detailed recipient. The server added 8% gratuity and there were only 3 of us in our party. Totally deceiving and glad I asked for the itemized receipt.
