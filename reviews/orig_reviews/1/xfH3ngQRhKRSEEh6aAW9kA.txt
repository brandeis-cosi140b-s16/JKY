First off let me start by saying I love cafe rio but today was the worst experience I've had from any restaurant ever. The cashiers name is Jennifer. To start I ordered my food and everything went well. I paid for my 2 burritos 2 salads and 5 drinks. Then the cashier gave me my 5 cups and I told her I wanted large not the regular size. She had already rung me up so she got irritated because I said that. She said she couldn't charge me for the difference so I would have to get a refund and wait for my refund for two days on my card. I said that's fine. Then after she rung me up I got my receipt for the large cups but not for the refund. I asked for a copy of the refund receipt for my business card and she said she couldn't do it. I said I needed proof in case I didn't get my refund and she got mad and in Spanish told someone else "atiendela tu" with a annoyed voice like saying you deal with her. The other girl comes and gives me a receipt. I asked the girl that was clearly so annoyed her name and she said Jennifer and rolled her eyes. Then when I was filling up my drinks she proceeds to tell the other girl I'm Spanish "estaba enojada la estupida" - translation that b**ch was mad. And started saying other things but I already forgot because I got so angry. I said "you need to stop being so rude" then she walked all the way from the register and confronted me and said laughing "what what am I said" I said "I know Spanish and you need to stop being so rude". She got closer and said "I'm not doing anything to you plus she's my manager", laughed and walked away. I left and a customer followed me and told me to yelp it and contact corporate. I'm so irritated with how unprofessional and rude she was.
