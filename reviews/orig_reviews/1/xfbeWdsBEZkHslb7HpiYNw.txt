Worst service ever! We had planned a birthday dinner party for 16 people for over a month. I checked several times on arrangements, including the menu. I was assured everything was in place. When our party arrived we all had to stand outside in 106 degree sun for over 45 minutes after our reservation time. Then they could not sit our entire party together, so 6 members had to sit at another table several feet away. Then they gave my guests the wrong menu. After all this, one of my guests asked for extra sour cream and they had the nerve to charge me a dollar extra for it. My husband's 70 th birthday party was a huge disappointment thanks to Tia Rosa. I complained to manager and got an email reply saying he would "coach his staff." After reading other reviews it sounds like more than coaching is needed. At least he could have offered to refund my dollar for the sour cream! I would have spent it at many of the other Mexican Restuarants we could have chosen!
