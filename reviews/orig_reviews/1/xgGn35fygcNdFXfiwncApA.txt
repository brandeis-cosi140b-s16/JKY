Hubby and I wanted a nice Mexican meal after a ceremony. Decided to give this new restaurant a try. We've had our fair share of experiences in the Mexican Food field; from Mundo, to others in Las Vegas, Mexico, South America & even Australia. The prices are high but not that bad. Food wasn't worth the money though. Guacamole was ordinary and my mom's enchiladas taste much better than the ones I had there. I won't be visiting again. Disappointed.
