We had our Christmas party here Friday night.  We paid 26.50 a person for 39 people.  We also charged several other fees that was almost half the cost per person.  

What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  The food was average at best, but the management was rude and unaccommodating.  We still had 6 people who had not gotten up to get a plate of food.  We didn't have enough food, and requested some more food.  We were told we needed to order off the menu and pay for it separately.  This is AFTER paying for the buffet for all 39 people. 

When you bring almost 40 people to your place of business, that's not how you treat them.  Go somewhere else for you parties, you will be sorry if you go here!
