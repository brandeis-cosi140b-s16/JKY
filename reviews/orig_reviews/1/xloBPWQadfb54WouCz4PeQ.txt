I don't know if the late night cooks don't care or what, but the food was HORRIBLE. My boyfriend ordered a chicken taco & it was completely soggy like it's been sitting for hours. He also ordered enchiladas and they were also soggy because the meat was so wet. I ordered the pollo a la chapala (which sounded good in the menu description) chunks of chicken breast saut√©ed with onions and covered in sauce, &cheese...I came home excited to eat my food and it was a whole fried chicken!!!!!!! I was so grossed out. We literally threw all of our food away:(  we only live 2 miles away but I didn't even want to waste my time to go back & complain.
