Was not impressed and will not be back. First our waitress was an older woman who carted all of our food over on a cart. If she can't carry the food out maybe she should do something else in the restaurant. Felt bad to ask her for anything. She never refilled our chips and when we asked for a spicer salsa she said they had none! Really! Then my husband ordered a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with cream and my husband does not like creamy food. It did not state it on the menu. When we told the waitress about it she did nothing to fix his burrito. Will not be back!
