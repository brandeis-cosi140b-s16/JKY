This was my second visit a few months apart.  Was ignored when I walked in, Bartender just looked at me.  I should have left.  Waited another 5 minutes to be seated, took a long time for the waitress to come back...only a few tables were occupied.  Ordered nacho's they were cold and not very good.  I will not return.  Mid week slow night = crappy service and bad food.
