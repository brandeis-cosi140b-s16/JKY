A far cry from actual New Mexico food. Chips and salsa not complimentary. Salsa is not hot or good. They dont serve pinto beans. Ive tried this place twice. The last time was with my fiance, neither one of us was happy with the food. The best thing about this place is the outdoor patio and atmosphere. I was born and raised in New Mexico. I will never go back to this place.
