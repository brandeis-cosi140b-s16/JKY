Don't come here if you want good food. We left very disappointed.
We had halibut tacos, they were bad. They smelled funny so the wife and I didn't eat them because we were scared they would make us sick. Also to note, their rice was borderline cold when served and tasted nothing like Mexican rice I've been eating at most other restaurants. The limes they served with their beer were brown on the edges, not something I like to see. 
The food network was here filming for their show the first night we tried going here so after waiting for 1/2hr and they hadn't opened yet we left. Maybe they are trying to save this place?? Its going to need some real help with the horrible food they served us.
With the food they served us that night, this will be added to the list of closed up shops in the village at Lake Las Vegas adding to the ghost town.
