After a few days in Vegas we had the urge to chow down on some Mexican food. We were pointed to Gardunos by some locals who claimed that this spot had excellent reviews.

Bottom line the food was awful. We ordered the fajitas and some flautas. The beef in the fajitas tasted pre made and the tortillas were dry and hard. The flautas tasted like the kind you would be in the market and just shove in the microwave. Truth be told I would have rather had Taco Bell.

I assumed that Vegas would have excellent Mexican because of its geography but I then again Las Vegas is a tourist town with a lot of hit or miss restaurants.

If you decided to ignore this review just please keep some pepcid on hand if you eat here.
