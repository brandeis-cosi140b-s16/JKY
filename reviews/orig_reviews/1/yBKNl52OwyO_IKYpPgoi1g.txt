This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's.  So here's what happened yesterday.  My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this.
