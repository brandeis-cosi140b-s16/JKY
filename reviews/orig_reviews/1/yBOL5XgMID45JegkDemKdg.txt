This place may have decent food but the employees at the drive thru are ghetto. My son went in to order a quesadilla. That's it a quesadilla we waited over 30 minutes for 1 quesadilla. I finally went inside to see why it was taking so long since people who had larger orders and ordered after him were given there food prior. He was basically overlooked since he was a kid. I asked one of the chola girls there if the quesadilla was going to be ready anytime soon since it had been more than an 1/2 hour she said what did you order. I said my son ordered a quesadilla but apparently he was over looked she just said oh ok she yelled back at the 3 stooges that were cooking the food and singing like they were at home laughing and just said yeah it's almost done. WOW !!

The other people waiting noticed that my son was over looked as well one of the ladies told them they should give him 2 since he had waited so long but she was ignored. 

This place need to send there employees to Finishing school.
