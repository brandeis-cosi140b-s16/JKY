I'm staying at one of the nearby hotels and got some recommendations to this place. I walk into the bar to order some take out. The Girl at the bar is nice and helpful but the rest of the crew were just walking around aimlessly speaking Spanish to each other which was very rude. The guy that took my order ended up ruining my order twice. I asked for no meat on the nachoes and they put EXTRA meat... I also ordered a bean and cheese taco and he ends up giving me a pork taco...wTH man the guy doesn't even apologize and I left very dissatisfied. What a waist of time and money. . .
