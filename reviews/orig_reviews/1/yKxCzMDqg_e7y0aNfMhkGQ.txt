Terrible food.  If you're looking for nasty variety Sonoran food, then this is the place for you.  I could deal with the 80's decor, the mediocre margarita, the meh chips and salsa (super watery).   With runny beans (my fav), an enchilada sauce that was blah, and an inedible tostada I pretty much reached my limit.  My boyfriend's green chile tamales were comparable to eating a sponge.  Suffice it to say, if left to sit for 10 minutes, one could have eaten their dinner with a straw.  Don't bother.  You would be better off at Chipotle.  Apologies to our waitress, she was nice enough but didn't make up for the awful food.
