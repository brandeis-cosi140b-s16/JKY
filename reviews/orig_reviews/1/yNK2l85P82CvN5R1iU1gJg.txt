Went to this place on a business trip. I  didn't expect much from a Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I didn't expect the food to be lower grade than your elementary school cafeteria.

I ordered the Cancun burrito. The tortilla was too thick and not soft and thin like it should be. The shrimp was not deveined and the steak was mediocre. The burrito doesn't come with beans, so there's not much to work with besides steak and vein popping shrimp smothered in grossamole--which was below average as well. $12.99 haha heeeeelllll naw, would go for $6.99 tops and expected to be served in a shanty, hole in the wall eatery. 

Another neg was the time you spend waiting for the food, was with a group of 11 and it took 2.5 hours. Better to just dine on the chips and salsa, that's the only good part
