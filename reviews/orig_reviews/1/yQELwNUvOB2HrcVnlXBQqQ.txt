My last and final comments on the matter:

I gave them credit for being honest,  however with that comes with FILLING THE OBLIGATIONS you make during our call. 

Clearly,  once you thought I was placated you simple slid me back over into the ignore pile.

Shame on you Upward Projects.......

It wasn't that HARD just do what you say your going to do, less people will get angry if you do.
