Terrible service. I came in cause everyone gave this place good reviews. I mean I'm sure other tacos el gorda are good but this particular one was absolutely horrid. I kept asking for carne asada fries and they kept sending me down the line. When I finally got to the line that serves asada meat, the worker gives me carne asada tacos! I asked him for asada fries again and he gives me plain fries. At that point I just accepted it and went to pay with my parents. They ended up double charging my dad for our food. When my dad went to correct the issue, they lady said that it wasn't her fault. After about 5 minutes of argument, she caves and gives my dad the extra money he paid. The food is ok. I tried some tacos and they were pretty good. The service is what needs extra work.
