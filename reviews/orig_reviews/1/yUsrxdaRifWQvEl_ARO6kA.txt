My husband and I went one Saturday for lunch and were SOOOO disappointed in the service that the would have to be superb for us to ever considering going back, but unfortunately it wasn't. 

The salmon I got was pretty decent and the chicken mole enchiladas my hubby ordered were pretty decent, too. But the young server (he looked no older than 14) never should be on the front line of customer service. He seemed to never have heard of lemon with iced tea before, as the 3 times I asked for it I received a blank stare and finally on the 3rd time got my lemon.When he delivered our meals, he quickly disappeared without napkins or silverware. So we flagged down another waiter asking for napkins and silverware, his response, "I'll go get your server." So by the time he reappeared our food was cold.

The place seemed disorganized and like they had no system in place. even though I could literally walk there from my house, I don't think I will be returning.
