Just one word...CRAP!!!!! Canned Enchilada Sauce( you can tell because it had that tin taste) and the service sucked and the manager could not care less. All he did was water the plants outside. It took them 20 minutes for the server to come to our table, and it was not busy. He had 2 tables outside and 4 tables inside. its called STATIONS!!!! Someone needs to head back to restaurant management school. Never Again!!!!!!!
