I give this place 1 1/2 stars because the food is terrible and the waiter we had last night was aggravated from the moment he sat us. This is not good Mexican food. My 3 tacos could have made up 1 whole taco. There were literally 4 tiny blocks of steak in each taco, the cheese was disgusting, the rice was salty and dry, the beans were the same way. My family and I will not be back.
