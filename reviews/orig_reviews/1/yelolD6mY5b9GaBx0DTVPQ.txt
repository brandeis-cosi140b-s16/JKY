Wow it gets worse. i wasnt a fan of this place before and i keep coming back but it SUCKS 
first off theres no AC on a nice hot summer day in las vegas. they have some horrible air machine that blows the hot ass hair on your back

the people who go there are mostly ghetto , last time i was there i saw ANOTHER fight break out in the tent then the dumb security comes and pepersrpays everyone so the spray gets in our food and eyes and nose, my eyes start to hurt and everyone starts sneezing..
come on , so ghetto. the lines are CONFUSING 

theres a damn long line for carne asada and another for the al pastor. ARE YOU GUYS STUPID? dont do that

this place is aweful its a mess its dirrty and looks like a dump
its TRASH dont go here the food is average but everything else sucks 
stay away 

oh and bring someone who speaks spanish or else good luck

god i hate this place ghetto and dirty
