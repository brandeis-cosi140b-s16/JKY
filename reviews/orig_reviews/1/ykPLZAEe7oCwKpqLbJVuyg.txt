I was in town and was excited about coming here. My sisters and I got tacos dorados, aguachiles, & Empanadas de camaron. Later that night we ended up in the toilet throwing up non stop. We got food poisoning!!!! We were throwing up the whole way back and I had to go to the ER. Do not eat here! It was the worse experience I've ever had. My stomach is barely recuperating from Saturday and Sunday. Just thinking about the food is making my stomach hurt. I will never come back!
