typical crowded and loud place with expensive drinks.  I've been in a few times to this location, and typically i would have given this place a couple more stars (not four more, but a couple).  After my visit last night, i will most likely never be returning.  Last evening i got off work where i serve alcohol and food stuffs to people, my boyfriend picked me up and we headed to sandbar to unwind and enjoy the rest of our evening.  We arrived around eleven in the evening, and my boyfriend bought me a vodka sprite.  We proceeded to dance and have fun when a bouncer approached my boyfriend and told him he had to get me out of there, but he could come back, obviously my boyfriend left with me.  i had had ONE drink!!!! now i know i can be exuberant sometimes, and im not a great dancer, but i was not by any means drunk!! nor was i causing any problems or even talking to anyone besides my boyfriend!!!  i feel insulted and i am even more shocked, because the past few times I've been there i have seen people who were clearly over served!!  i highly doubt i will ever return to this place!!
