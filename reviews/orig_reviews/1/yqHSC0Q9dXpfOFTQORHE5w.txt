Very disappointed! I've been to this restaurant a handful of times and it's never been outstanding but it killed your Mexican cravings. Today I left the restaurant thinking why didn't I go to the new Farmer Boy restaurant instead. Everything seemed pretty average until I had to take my two young daughters to the restroom.........filthy! Mind you there are only two toilets and one was clogged, gross! ! It looked like a restroom in TJ! My husband ordered the Chile Verde and it had no spice and they must have been low on the meat. I ordered the grilled talapia, it was smothered in this green, garlicky disgusting cream. Fresh fish should not smell like fish and this didn't smell like fish, it smelled like sewer!! I'm sure that's why it was smothered in the green sauce. The refried beans had so much lard you couldn't taste the beans. I sent my dish back, i was not going to risk getting food poisoning.  My daughter ordered the pork tamales, she gave me a taste and the same thing with the beans pure lard, I told her not to eat anymore because she could get sick. Sure enough she spent the whole night throwing up. Never, never will I go back to that sewer in the wall. Bonito michoacan or Viva Mercado are excellent choices, they have clean restaurant and their food is always fresh and clean.
