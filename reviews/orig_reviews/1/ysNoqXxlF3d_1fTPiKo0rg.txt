I ordered food online 30 minutes in advance. I came in and the order wasn't ready for another 20 minutes. Food sat out cold while the cashier jerked off and I got a cold unappetizing meal and was late back from my lunch. I saw five people get food before me that ordered while I was there in person. I ordered a salad. It's not rocket science. Utterly disgusted by this place. I hope they go out of business...
