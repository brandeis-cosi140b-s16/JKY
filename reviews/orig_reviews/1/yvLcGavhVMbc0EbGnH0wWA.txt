so i was walking through the cosmo with a big group and we decided to stop for lunch at this place. it looked nice but nothing special. i ordered the lettuce wraps and lamb potstickers to share with someone. the portion size was EXTREMELY small. i could have ate it all by myself instead of sharing and still not been full! the food was okay. i probably wouldnt remember the meal at all except for the fact that it was so expensive and i walked away hungry! i payed $4 dollars for a small thing of chips and salsa (isnt that usually free?!) and for the two plates i ordered (potstickers and lettuce wraps), 1 non refillable cup of juice and a can of sprite and two SMALL tacos (2 or 3 bites) the bill came out to a wopping $78!!! i couldnt believe it! the ambiance of the  place was very cool but i would NEVER recommend this place to someone unless they have LOTS of money!
