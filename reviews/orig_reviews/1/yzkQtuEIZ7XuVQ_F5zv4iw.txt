This is hard for me to write. We loved this place. Went there a few times a month and always had a great time. There were occasional hiccups, but there is everywhere. However, this last time we went, about a month ago, left me so upset and annoyed. We went for happy hour, had a great time, really liked our server and everything. He let us know that his shift was finishing up and we settled up with him because we were done ordering and just finishing up. Our bill was $73 and change. We wrote in a $20 tip on the line and my boyfriend wrote the total as $103 and change. Our server came by and grabbed the check after we had signed it. After he took it I realized that we did the math incorrectly and it should have been $93. I gave him the benefit of a doubt and didn't track him down thinking that he would do the right thing and close it out with a $20 tip. However, when it posted to my bank account it drew for the $103. I was rather insulted because $20 on $73 is a fantastic tip and we were still sitting there when he closed it out. He could have come back and asked us what we meant. I called the manager a couple nights later when it had posted on my bank account and explained what happened. She was very responsive and said that the GM would call me the following day. She took my side saying that he should have closed it out with a $20 tip. Needless to say, no one ever followed up with me. All I wanted was my $10 back. We've spent hundreds of dollars at barrio queen, always taking VERY good care of our servers, but we can't say we will go back. What a shady thing for a person to do, scam an extra $10 out of me. This entire thing has just left me shaking my head.
