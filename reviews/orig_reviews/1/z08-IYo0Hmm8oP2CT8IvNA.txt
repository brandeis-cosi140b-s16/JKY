You are in Vegas, you can find better service and food so don't settle on this place. Service was super slow and place was only half full. Maybe a good place to have a drink and watch a game, but find something else for food. My chimichanga was barely worth $5 much less the price they charge, as the chicken cubes  were sad and scarce. I went along with the group and checked Yelp as we sat down, we should have left but didn't. They try to offer guac with everything, you get a small and I mean small cup of guac that is not good at all.
