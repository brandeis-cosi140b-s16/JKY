Ugggghh, what can I say about Chino Bandido...

It's a shit hole on 19th and greenway in a dumpy shopping center.

The food isn't really that good, and the place is not clean.
My friend raved about this place, so I went with him... I even ordered his suggestion, some chicken bowl thing.  The chicken was grizzly and the serving wasn't even that big for what I dropped.  

I think the idea of the place is cute, but the execution isn't there.  I mean, a filiberto's or a cheap chinese joint destroy this place, and you could buy a burrito and a chinese combo at both together for only a few dollars more than a combo at Chino Bandito.

I just do not understand why people like this place.
