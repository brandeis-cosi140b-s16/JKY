I love coming onto their yelp page to read the horrendous reviews because it reassures me that I'm not crazy. We ordered take out from here again and holy shit never again. My boyfriend called in 6 asada tacos but I guess since he doesn't speak Spanish, they messed up his order and gave him espada tacos. I was so irritated. I called and it seemed like their intention was to make US feel stupid. I got the "we read the order back to him and he confirmed." I'm like... Espada/asada. 

The only slight redeeming point was them trying to comp us. I have yet to go pick it up. This was about 2 months ago. They can fuck off. Soooo done with them, will never ever be back. Over priced, bland, and rude service. What's the point?
