I was at the Hospitality Expo at Mandalay Bay and decided to stop by and grab a quick bite at Border Grill. It looked like they were packed with people from the convention and the servers looked really overwhelmed. There were empty tables but however the hostess told me the only available seating was either at he bar or high tables at the bar. Me and some other expo attendee agreed to share one high table but we were waiting for the waitress for a long time and no one came to the table. I spotted one empty seat at the bar and ran for it. Once finally seated, I ordered a few tacos and a water and the person at the bar gave me an annoyed look for ordering only water and finally when my order arrived it was not correct and arrived with no silverware and napkins. Since I was sitting at the bar I tried to put my purse down and looked down and the floor was filthy and disgusting, It would be nice if there were purse hooks. I decided because of the lack of time to take my food to go and finish my meal at home. I ordered pork tacos & it was an unbelievable amount of fat with the meat. When someone cuts the meat for the taco you would think they would remove the fat but the tacos were about 50% fat. yuck!
