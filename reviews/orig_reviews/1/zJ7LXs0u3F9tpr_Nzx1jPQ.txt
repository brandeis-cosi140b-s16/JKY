This was one of the worst places I've ever been to. Horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes while servers looked at us as they passed, but no server came to talk to us. When I finally approach someone I was told not to take it out on her. So I didn't and I called the manager over. He was full of apologies but not much else. My family and I left and we went someplace better. Don't waste your time on this place when there are a multitude of other better places close by.
