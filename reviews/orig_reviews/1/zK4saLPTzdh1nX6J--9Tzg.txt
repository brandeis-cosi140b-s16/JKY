Nice ambiance and good chips and salsa but that's about it.  Our meal was ok however, one person's tacos were so soft they couldn't be picked up. They ate only the inside with a fork and said they weren't impressed.  The wrong margaritas came to the table however the taste was fine.  However, I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEGING CHARGED THE WRONG PRICE and for the WRONG MARGARITA.    I pointed the incorrect price out to the waiter and nothing was done.  What was more astonishing was that I told the owner about this and she gave me her card for "next time." WHAAAAT?   If there's a problem with the bill you DO NOT FIX IT NEXT TIME, YOU FIX IT THIS TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There won't be a NEXT TIME if this time isn't fixed.  

People are nice but have NO CLUE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  There are far too many options in the area for food that customers won't tolerate poor service and a lack of common sense.  We specifically came to here and went out of our way...not again.
