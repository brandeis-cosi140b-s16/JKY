Food was mediocre but service was awful.  Hostess apparently thinks she owns the place, waiter didn't even know what was on the menu.  Worst part was the place was dead, only 4 tables inside and half of the outside was open and they took 20 mins to seat us on a Friday night.  I should have known better.  Won't ever be going back there again.
