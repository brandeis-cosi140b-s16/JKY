Every time someone brings up this place I literally cringe. Now before I continue, when I dislike a place with the amount of hatred that I have for an awful place like arribas, there is a good reason. I will never base my opinion off of one meal, I will give a place multiple chances before I write it off completely.  The food is absolutely disgusting, either too salty or not flavorful at all, I can not stand a single thing at this place. Just thinking about it makes me wonder how this place stays in business.
Nachos..nasty
Enchiladas..nasty
Rice...nasty
Flautas...NASTY!
I could go on forever!  How a restaurant can screw up a big bowl margarita is beyond me..but somehow..this place can do it! Don't go here, recommend this place only to your worst enemy. EW!
