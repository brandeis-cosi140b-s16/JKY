Desperately want to like this restaurant since it's in my neighborhood. We have given up on it and tried again and again for years. Food is mediocre and the service (with sporadic exceptions) is terrible. Clearly management does not care or cannot get its act together. Thursday evening it took 20 minutes to get two sodas because they were "out of clean cups." We were still charged for those sodas. There was a good crowd that night but also many employees walking around. They likely needed more direction. None of our visits here have included the manager stopping by the table to ask how our meal was going. I wonder why? Perhaps, there is no one managing this operation.
