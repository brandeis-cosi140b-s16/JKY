I think this place is way over rated on here. I like to try locally owned restaurants and I'm ok with less traditional food. But this place was not good. I ordered a shrimp dish, and the shrimp were like rubber they were so over cooked. My husband ordered a burrito that he wasn't a fan of either. The salsa was tasty (maybe bumping it up to a 1.5) but it might have been the stuff you buy in the refrigerated section at frys. The small things weren't their either. No water, no refills on chips and salsa unless you asked. Waaay overpriced too. $16+ for 3 draft xxbeers. They charged $6+ for 2 sides of pinto beans. Unfortunately we won't be going back, I was excited about a Mexican restaurant near out house too!
