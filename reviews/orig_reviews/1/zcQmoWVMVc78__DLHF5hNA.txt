My husband had gotten food from this establishment for me - after picking out all the veggies I had asked NOT to have on it, I found a beautiful black curly hair in the middle of my food. I promptly called to see if I could get credit for my next purchase; in broken english they told me I had to bring in the food AND the hair to get another nacho, which could only be received the same day (and didn't apologize either). Needless to say, I didn't have much of an appetite for nachos after that. My best advice: instead of just wearing hats, you need to add some gloves to that equation - specially when you have a bunch of men with hairy arms and hands working with food (DUH)!!!!!!!
