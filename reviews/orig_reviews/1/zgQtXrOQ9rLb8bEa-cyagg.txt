How Rude! My husband and I went in a few weeks ago. There were no customers in front of us in line, we stood there for five minutes waiting to order. NOT ONE EMPLOYEE even acknowledged our existence! They were all standing around joking with eachother, which is great, I love seeing a workplace where everyone gets along, just don't ignore your paying customers. Won't be going back to this location.
