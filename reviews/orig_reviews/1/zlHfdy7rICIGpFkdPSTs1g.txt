I had a fajita burrito. It was okay. My wife had a burrito cup with grilled shrimp.  First, they left the shrimp off.   Then they brought it back out with gray,  uncooked shrimp scooped on top. 

Service was horrible.  Even though my food was cooked correctly, you can get as good or better anywhere in town. 

We won't be back.
