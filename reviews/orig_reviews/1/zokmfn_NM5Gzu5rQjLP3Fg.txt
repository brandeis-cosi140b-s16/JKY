I don't understand the appeal of this place.  Unless you have a seat at the bar or are lucky enough to be trapped there and can get the bartender's attention, the service is abysmal at best, non-existant at worst.

Note to everyone - if you plan on having dinner, you will be there all night.  Cancel all other plans.  If you're lucky, you will get your dinner around last call.

The one time I was actually served food at Round Corner, the food was pretty good..  It was also empty, so that is why I was able to actually order.  

So maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole, but we arrived at Round Corner around 7.  We were seated quick enough, however the waiting game had just started.  We weren't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10.  At least she returned with water for all.  She took our drink order and left without our food order.  

This is when I realized we were in trouble. At 7:45, she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again.  Yes, if you're doing the math, it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks.  All beer.

She returned around 8pm, by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round (to get a head start on that) and ordered our dinner.  That was the last we saw of her.  

After another 15 minutes or so, my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress. Our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason.  My friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances.

By 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room.  At 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to Tamari never to return.
