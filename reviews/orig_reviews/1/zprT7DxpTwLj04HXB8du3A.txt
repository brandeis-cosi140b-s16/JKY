We had a party of ten show up on Friday, 5/16.  It felt like the waitress had just been trained on up selling.  Order tequila shots but she recommended one of the higher priced brands. We struck with one of the lower cost ones, still $9 a shot, but she persisted. Food was good enough. Retired to the bar, ordered a round of drinks, threw $80 on the bar. Money and bill gone, we order more drinks. New bill shows up with all the drinks from the first round still listed.  Pointed it out to the female bartender and she returned the $80. She must've figured that there were so many of us, someone else would pay. She's a crook. Cute small brunette, with a black spot on her soul. 
Dear managers. You've got a problem. All of us attended a party the next day and Pacos got ripped. Great potential, but ripping off customers, we'll never be back
