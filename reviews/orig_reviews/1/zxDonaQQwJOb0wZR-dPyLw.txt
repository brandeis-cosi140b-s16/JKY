Used to be one of our favorites, though the last two times in have disappointed. Recent outing included drinks downstairs and staff was unfriendly and uninterested in helping guests.  Dinner upstairs was a poor experience. Our entrees for our party came out about 10 minutes apart and to make matters worse two entrees were incorrect. One entree was replaced and the second was replaced using the previous plate with a portion of the meal replaced.  Has Rokerij lost it's touch?
