I REALLY wanted to love this place after my foodie husband raved about it after having seen them on TV. I was hoping for a hole-in-the wall, amazing food, cheap eats kind of place. I tried them three times to see if I was just there on a bad day. I finally went there to try the tamales, but of course it was a day they didn't have them. Bummer. They did have a super delicious margarita, though! 

As a business owner, I hate to be too critical of another person trying to make a living running a business, so I am glad for the great reviews and the people who really enjoy Roberto's. I just wasn't one of this people. I wish them the best, though.
