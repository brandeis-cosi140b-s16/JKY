Sad my first official check in and it has to be given 2-stars.  It's more like 2.5, but in the restaurant world, you are either a 5 star or not, so we have to round down.

I really had a lot of hope for this place, but was sadly disappointed.  

We had to make reservations as apparently this place gets pretty packed.  It is located outside of Marquee and next to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Reading some yelpers and also having followed Chef Jose Andres and his accomplishments, we figured we'd give this place a try.  The place was jammed packed on a Saturday night, and did have to wait a few minutes, but it allowed us to see the decor of the place which I really did love.  It's a Mexico meets China fusion restaurant which is a very interesting concept and worked out well, sort of...

The various tacos were great, I would say this is the highlight of the place.  Definitely a fusion of flavors and not your run in the mill choices - worth n order or two.  The other tapas were ok, some better than others but no where near the chef's best - after ordering them, we sat there thinking hmm, should I have just gotten a taco or two more instead?  The drinks were inventive: salt air margarita (salt foam on top) and lemon drop with jelly noodles (looks like chicken noodle soup).  The margarita was hard to say the least.  Strong salt in your face followed by a heavy handed (strong) margarita - was pretty hard to drink.  Then tasting the lemon drop (w/jelly noodles) was hard to sip in itself.  More like a soup than a drink, and strong yet again.  I thought it would be an alcoholic boba-ish drink, but it came up very short of those expectations.  All in all, for some tacos, its a great place, but anything else, maybe hit up Holstein's next door and grab a drink at the chandler bar before marquee.
