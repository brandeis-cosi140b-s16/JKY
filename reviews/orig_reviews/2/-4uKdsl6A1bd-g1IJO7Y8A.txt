YIKES! Unimpressed. 

I have a pretty strong stomach and this place did not leave me feeling well. Maybe it was because of the overpriced food or the sugary drinks but either way... not good! I know Cabo Wabo is a chain so you can't expect gourmet food but for what I paid, I expected something edible. 

Our server was very nice and that was the only really postitive thing about this place.
