One thing Phoenix has in abundance is good Mexican food.  I mean REALLY good. So it's beyond me why anyone would settle for mediocre. Which this was.

It was bland.  It was greasy.  The shrimp dish we ordered had no spice or flavor at all.  My chips were fresh, which judging by the rest of the reviews here was a lucky thing. A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.

Yes, my butt shared the same space as Bush Junior's did (according to the plaque at our table), but that didn't enhance the experience.
