Beware of what may be in your salsa!!
I work downtown and go out to lunch everyday. I was so happy to hear that El Sombrero had reopened.  So I invited a coworker to go with me to tryout the new menu. The restaurant has been completely 
redone. It looks really nice. The waiter promptly arrived at our table with the complimentary chips and salsa. We started to eat the chips and salsa when my friend felt something at the bottom of the salsa bowl.
To our surprise it was a stick of chalk  We called the waiter to tell him about it. He pick up the chalk piece and the bowl of salsa without saying a word. He came back with a new bowl of salsa. My coworker and I were stunned. He never said Sorry.
It was as if nothing had ever happened.
At the end of our meal we thought that the manager would stop by and say something but no one did. 
I was very disappointed with the service. It really overshadow the food. My order number was #836 (10/6/14).
