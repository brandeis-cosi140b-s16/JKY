I preferred this place much more when it was SuperMex. I don't know what other changes were made when it became Jalisco's but IMO it has gone downhill. The menu is a lot different. The carne asada nachos my son always gets is no longer the same dish. They now use a different white cheese that tastes so waxy and cheap. People who have eaten cheap cheese know what I mean! My former go-to meal was the steak fajitas. At $12.99 it used to be so tasty and portion was large enough to bring home another meal. I think the same item is $15.99 now. Smaller portion and not as good of flavor as the original. My son and I both agree the steak meat they use for the nachos and fajitas just suck!

I gave them one more chance when I dined in for breakfast and ordered the chorizo and huevos quesadilla. Honestly, it tasted like I made it at home. I'm definitely a doggie bag person but I wasn't inclined to eat the other half of my quesadilla anytime soon. 

The plus side is the chips and salsa. I'm glad they finally changed from whole fried tortilla rounds to triangular chips.
