So disappointed in the bartending skills. Orderd a Moscow Mule outside and it wasn't even served in a copper cup! A glass mason jar?! Seriously, that fad is over. C'Mon, copper mugs are a necessity for mules! And it tasted of lemon juice. Straight lemon juice. Ewww. No! I blame the bartender, not the establishment but it was a putrid mix. Won't be back anytime soon and definitely won't order a mile when I get there.
