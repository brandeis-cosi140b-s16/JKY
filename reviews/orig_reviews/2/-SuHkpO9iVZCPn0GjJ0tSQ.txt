I'm so behind in reviews that I never got around to reviewing Tacos El Gordo before they closed this location. Well, I just wanted to say that while the food was okay, the dining experience as a whole was rather forgetful.

First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?

The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.

Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations.
