I've had better but I've also had worse.  That's the best I could say about the food at this place.  It's a bit overpriced as well.  It's not a 3 star... more a 2.5 star.  

I ordered the pork poblino and it was decent.  Nothing really to shout home about.  I'm from San Diego so of course there are tons of Mexican restaurants down here and fast food places that you can get tastier food and pay way less... 

One thing that bothered us though was that our friend ordered the steak nachos.  The guy brought out steak tacos because that's what he thought she said.  Instead of saying "oh I'm sorry, let me fix the problem," he basically said, "i heard tacos"... like he it was her fault and he wasn't going to help... that was a bit rude... part of customer service is being nice and making sure that if the ordered is screwed up then you see how you can make it better... he did not attempt to do any of that... FAIL! 

I really wouldn't come back but I wouldn't tell someone they should never eat there... I would just tell them to find a better option for Mexican food if they can.
