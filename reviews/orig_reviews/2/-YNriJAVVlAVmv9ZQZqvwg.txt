I've had better mexican food than this. Tried this place out today b/c my co-worker suggested it, and i was a bit disappointed. It was not busy, yet I felt rushed and confused as to why the lettuce and salsa was on the side instead of in the burrito. On top of that they charge extra for sour cream. I honestly felt the food wasn't that great at all. Chipotle taste way better. Even Roberto's is better food. This is like fake Mexican food. Maybe it was the location? but we will not be coming back to have dinner at  this place again.
