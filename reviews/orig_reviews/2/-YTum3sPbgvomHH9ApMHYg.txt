Not my favorite. I didn't really know what to expect in Cuban food, but I do know that I had it one memorable time at Cha Cha Cha in Haight -Ashbury, San Francisco, so I was excited to see a fun looking Cuban restaurant near my new place. However, it was a little bit bland for my liking, literally lacking in taste. I could see potential for the atmosphere being fun with mojitos and dancing in the late hours, but it's a no for dinner. I had the "camarones al ajillo" which are large prawns sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine. Didn't taste like anything I couldn't make myself.  My date ordered "lechon asado" which was a slow-roasted pork dish, but again totally lacking in flavor, with just a boring side of rice and beans. My favorite was the cuban sandwich appetizer with plantain chips, tasty, but not something I've been craving ever since. Sorry Havana Grill, you have yet to impress
