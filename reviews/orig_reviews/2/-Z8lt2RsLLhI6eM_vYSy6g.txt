THE GREAT:
 
The slaw was great! Sweet, probably had some mango and pineapple in it. If you do visit, do yourself a favor and get some slaw. Yes even if you don't like slaw. It's that good.

The salsa was really good with juicy canned tomatoes, fresh onions, lime juice, and cilantro. 

The chimi was good, maybe overloaded on beans and rice. But what made it good was the sour cream, lettuce, pico, and guacamole. 


THE NOT SO GOOD:

Fish tacos were so-so and the menu said it came with the excellent slaw, but I had to ask the manager for it when he walked around and asked if everything was ok.

I didn't like the black beans at all because they had some meat, maybe pork in them. Wish they would specify that stuff on the menu.

The secret to good margaritas is fresh lime juice, simple syrup, and tequila. They don't know the secret. It was only sour mix and tequila.



THE DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE:

Slow poor service. Thankfully the guy in the blue dress shirt, likely the manager made a round on us, and after waiting at the end of the meal, I walked to him and gave him my credit card and asked if he could ring us up. Our waitress was slow to take our order and then disappeared. I saw the hostess cross hatch a 5 by her name as she seated us. Apparently 5 tables was just too much for her. 


SUMMARY:

They did offer and few unusual drinks and dishes. There is some potential here, but It's not even in the same galaxy as Cantina 1511, for example. 

Perhaps I will revise the star rating after my next visit. I at least know what to avoid next time.
