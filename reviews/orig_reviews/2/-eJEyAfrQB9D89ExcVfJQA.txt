There are better places to get Mexican food here in the valley. GO THERE! The waitress was moody and not helpful... we had to literally take a fork and knife to the salsa to cut up the tomatoes. The quesadillas were awful. They were out of Mexican beer. WHAT!?! They rest of our party was just 'okay' with the food. The food is pricey for what it is. Then... They messed up our bill! It's our second time in. Bc I believe in second chances. I will not be returning.
