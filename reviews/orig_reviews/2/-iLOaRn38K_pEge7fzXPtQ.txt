Since it has had a 4.5 rating for a while now, I went to see what all the hype was about.  It's a little hard to find as it's tucked away on the northwest corner of the shopping center.

I was greeted in Spanish (no comprendo?!), ordered a Carne Asada burrito ($5.10 after tax), and it was ready no more than 60 seconds later.  It was hot though, but I wasn't impressed with the size.  There was a little topping bar with salsas, pico de gallo, and some other stuff.  I was done eating and out of the place within 4-5 minutes.  Keeping in mind that I was not eating that fast, that should give you an idea of the size.  The taste was decent, but nothing special.  There's a slim chance that I'd go out of my way to give this place a second try.
