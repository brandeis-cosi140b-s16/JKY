Service is my number one priority.  
We had to wait 5 minutes just to get seated during a very slow lunch hour 12:30.  Server missed a few things and had to be reminded.  Food was not very good but I really liked the hot salsa that came with the chips prior to our food arriving.  It was very good spice level for me. 
Bland place at best.
