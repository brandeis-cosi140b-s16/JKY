We met up here on a Saturday for a work group happy hour. Seems like a fun atmosphere with surf board tables and beach sand patio and cabanas. 
The food however wasn't good. I was going to get the batter cheese curds but the other lady said she had them and they weren't good. She felt like they were bottom of the barrel curds, so we tried the bbq chicken sliders. I was expecting the chicken to be tender and shredded, it wasn't either. It was gross. And the other ladies food came with a curly hair!!
My drink "liquid Marijuana" was watered down, you can taste mostly pineapple juice and it was light green. Should have been a darker green and not watered down. 
I wouldn't waste my time going here again unless I had to.
