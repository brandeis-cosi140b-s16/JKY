Im going to have to agree with the negative reviews that have recently been posted. Went their this morning at 10:45 to beat the crowd and that was about the best thing about our visit. Chips and salsa took very long to arrive along with our extra bowl of bean dip that we had to ask twice for. My wife had the street tacos and I ordered the pozole. Her tacos came out lukewarm and she was very dissatisfied with the taste of rice and beans. My pozole was lukewarm as well when it arrived and i had asked for extra radishes when I had ordered and I received three pieces of a radish, seriously. They gave me about a tablespoon of cilantro and onions for my large bowl of soup, seriously. This is just being down right cheap not to mention that the radishes were dry. Now onto the fact that my water was only refilled once and I had to ask for that to be done. When refilled it had no ice so I was drinking warm water, I could have gotten colder water out of the tap. I honestly hate to post this because we have had good food from them before but it looks like that is a thing of the past. Oh yeah, they also overcharged us on our bill. Pick it up Leticia's or you are going to lose other customers.
