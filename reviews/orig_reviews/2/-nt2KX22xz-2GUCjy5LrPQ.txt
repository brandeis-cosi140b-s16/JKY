I really wanted to like this place...they have great prices, it's close to campus and where I live, It can be fun place to get some beers, BUT the food sucked! I ordered the student special with tacos, sweet potato fries, and black beans. To put it simply, everything lacked flavor, the tacos were very inauthentic, overdressed with sauces and sour cream to hide the blandness of the protein. Surprisingly even the fries and beans sucked. I gave it an extra star because it's a decent watering hole for some late night cervezas.
