I used to love this place when it was Park Central, but now it is no bueno. It's a huge happy hour hot spot for cool people, but the food is mediocre at best. For example- we ordered chicken and steak tacos on happy hour and all we got were tortillas with meat and cilantro. Really? Gordon bierch serves better tacos than this place. Overpriced and overhyped in my opinion.
