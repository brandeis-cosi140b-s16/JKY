Visited on April 28 with a party of 7. Arrived at 7pm and should have paid attention to the fact that the place was only about half full. It wasn't a bad meal, it just wasn't a great one.

Drinks-house margaritas are half price until 7pm. We were able to take advantage of that which was a good thing since they were not very strong.

Food-chips and salsa (green and red) are complimentary, but are not brought to the table automatically, you have to ask. And you have to ask for refills on the salsa. Both salsas were very good, nice and fresh. The red salsa was spicy, which I love.  The chips were sub par in my opinion. Some crunchy, some chewy and tough.   Everyone at our table ordered a variation of the two taco meal. The variety of taco options was very good.  I had a carnitas one and a shredded beef one. Carnitas one was very taste, and I liked that I got the option of a soft corn tortilla instead of flour. The beef taco was served in a special shell, I did not care for it. It was a fried corn tortilla that was a little hard to bite into, and did not have a very good taste.  

I love trying New Mexican places when traveling, this one unfortunately was a slight disappointment.
