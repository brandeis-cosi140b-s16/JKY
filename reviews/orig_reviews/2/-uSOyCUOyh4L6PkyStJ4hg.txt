A friend suggested we try this place and unfortunately he must have had a better experience then we did... first off the A/C was broken when we arrived so it was hot - we sat under a fan to get some air circulation (this probably didn't help with my attitude of the place -wasn't their fault and they were working on it but hey...first impressions). 
We sat down and got our menu's, it was the dinner menu and WAY too expensive for us - we thought about leaving just then but decided to order drinks and an appetizer (oh yea, no drink menu so I guess you have to wait for the bill to see how much the drinks were), but then the waitress (who was very nice) suggested the lunch menu - much better but still priced a little high. We passed on the chips and salsa appetizer deal she told us about that was for 4.. priced at $18 (ummm no). So we decided to order... she took my order first and then took my girlfriends order - then she walked away, not taking the orders from either of our husbands (well okay, guess we are sharing then).
So the food arrived, quite quickly, but the serving size was smaller than what I expected for the price and not really a meal you would usually share. The food was very good and full of flavor though. 
We probably won't go back to this place with all the strange issues we had and the prices are just a little too high, especially considering the huge number of competing Mexican restaurants.
