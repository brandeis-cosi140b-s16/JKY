I wasn't impressed. First of all, my plate wasn't clean.  It had caked on food on it.  Then to the food:  The salsa was good but the tortilla chips were the thick, extremely hard kind and I felt like my teeth were gonna break.  For an appetizer we ordered Vasito de Elote, which is fresh grilled corn cut from the cob, served in a cup, topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, Valentina hot sauce, cilantro, and lime.  It was delicious, but a very small portion.  Then my bf ordered Chile Verde which is slow cooked pork with garlic, onion, peppers and tomatillos served with flour tortillas.  He was very pleased and after having a little bit, I agree that it was delicious.  On to my choice which was the California enchiladas.  They're basic cheese enchiladas and I had them served with calabicitas and rice.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't very good either.  The rice was bland.  It's hard to explain what was wrong with the enchiladas.  They were simple cheese enchiladas but not very cheesy and red enchilada sauce poured over the outside.  Just not cohesive, I guess is the best way to put it.  The best thing this place had going for it is that it was a beautiful day here in February and the patio had delightful ambiance.
