Being new to the Charlotte area I was excited to try a new place for Happy Hour/early dinner in the Southpark area. Disappointed is an understatement. 
We arrived about 515pm, the place was dead, and it took a solid 20 minutes to get our drinks and chips/salsa. There were 5 in our party, all of us had cocktails. 
Anyone who thinks the guacamole is good has never been to an authentic restaurant. It is a novel idea to have it made at your table, but it has zero taste. 
Our server was rude, slow and snapped her fingers when we needed water refills. Our chip bowl was always empty and any request from extra napkins to a cocktail re-order seemed to be a huge inconvenience to our server. 
The queso dip was good, but at 9 dollars, way overpriced. 
I ordered the 3 taco meal; the turkey and bacon taco was verry salty, and I LOVE salt; the beef taco and chicken taco were ok and you could tell the entire meal had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The refried beans were delish and the highlight of my dining entire experience. 
The beans, fresh drinks (although pricey) and location get it 2 stars. I doubt I will go back.
