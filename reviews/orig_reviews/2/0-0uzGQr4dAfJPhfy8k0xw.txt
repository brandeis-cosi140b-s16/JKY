Went there for lunch with my young daughter. Very disappointed! Small portions, large prices. Everything is ala carte including chips and salsa. There is no kids menu not any items on regular menu that are kid friendly, so don't take your kids. I ordered the shrimp tacos which came in a thick, spicy stew like sauce. They were horrible so I sent back and got carne asada tacos instead, which were fine but nothing special. 

Pretty sure that the positive reviews are coming from employees or someone with a vested interest in the restaurants survival so take those reviews with caution. 

If you're familiar with Red Rock then you know they've been undergoing a lot of changes recently in terms of restaurants and overall service most of them not for the better. This restaurant is no exception, which is too bad since RR in desperate need of a new hot restaurant. Cabo Wabo was better than this place.
