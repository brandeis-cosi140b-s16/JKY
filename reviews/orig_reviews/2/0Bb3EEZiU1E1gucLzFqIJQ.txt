Really like the atmosphere and the food is pretty good , but not always consistent.  Tableside guacamole is great . My main issue tho is Idon't understand the price of the drinks for the La Brava Margarita?  It comes in a VERY small glass with ice filled to the top & barely two sips for $10 ??? Several other drinks on the menu come with huge glasses. Fix the drink menu and might get 4 Stars !
