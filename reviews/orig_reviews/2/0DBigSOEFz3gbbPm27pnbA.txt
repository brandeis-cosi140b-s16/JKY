We dined there last night and sat on the patio. The house margaritas were sour and had very little tequila in them. Chips and salsa were delicious but an extra $3 charge. The guacamole was delicious and highly recommened. We ordered tacos for $3 each as a Tues. special and they were not special. Very small and just somewhat tasty. One order of fajitas was good. I would not recommend this restaurant as a $150 bill with tip for 5 on a night with $3 tacos and 2 for 1 margaritas was very pricey.
