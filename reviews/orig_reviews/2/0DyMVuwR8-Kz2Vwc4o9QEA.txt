This was yet another stop on what turned into our Fall Break Tour of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants of 2009.  Unfortunately, I disagreed with Phoenix Magazine again.  It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.  

And waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back.
