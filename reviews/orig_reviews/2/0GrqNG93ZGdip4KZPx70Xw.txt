Ok, so never tried this place, even though it is less than 5 minutes from my house. We (me plus 2) get there and they are super busy. Thought it was weird since it was Monday night at 8pm...but there is a wait. They have exactly- one server, one busser, and one bartender serving food to help out. We only waited about 15 minutes..not bad. We sit down, wait about 15 minutes to see a server...we decide what we want to eat by the time he actually gets there. He takes our drink order and as my friend starts to give her food order, he walks away. He comes back takes our order...we never see that guy again until the bill. When our food came, our entrees were supposed to have tortillas...but no tortillas. I got the Carne Adovada plate which was SUPER salty and had no flavor at all. It was as if they mixed masa with it to thicken it but didn't blend it well. My friend got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were pretty good, nothing great and my other friend got seafood enchiladas which had hardly any filling to the enchiladas. I asked 3 times for the tortillas...that never came. Our waiter came after we were done with our food and asked if we wanted more drinks. We were done at that point.
