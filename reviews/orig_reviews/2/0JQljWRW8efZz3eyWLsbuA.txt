The food here is blah. I'd rather eat tacos from a dozen places I pass on the way here... The bar atmosphere is crowded on weekends... standing room only in fact. Drinks are okay, lots of TVs to go with the fake beachy vibe. The music was not my groove but did observe some hilarious drunk dancing that was the most entertainment to be had... If I am invited to yet another birthday bash here, I may or may not decide to come.
