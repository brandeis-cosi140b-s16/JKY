Big Mistake. In Phoenix looking for a quick meal. Decided to eat at the bar and service was about as slow as I have experienced in a long time. I don;t blame the bartender, she was the only one I saw lifting a finger while everyone else stood around.  Food came before chips and  Iprobably should have filled up on the chips first.  This was not much better than fast food and lacked anything that would make me want to come back again.  
Some event was going on in the room near the bar and the guy running it was loud and complaining that the night was going to suck.  I don't want to hear about business issues while I am just trying to have a quick dinner and catch a little sports.  
There are many better places in the Scottdale area, don't waste your time here.
