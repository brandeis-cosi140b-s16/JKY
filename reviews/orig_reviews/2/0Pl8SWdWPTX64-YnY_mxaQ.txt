Hit or miss service. Sometimes if you're lucky there's someone paying attention at the front of the business but if you're not aware and walk right inside without them seeing you you'll be standing there without help for awhile. On occasion they have really friendly and outgoing staff that seems to get my orders correct and then there's the ho hum servers that can't seem to get it right. You definitely notice the correlation and if you return you learn who to avoid if possible. Last trip they were unaccommodating when they left the sour cream out of my califronia burrito leaving it bland and dry. I went back and politely asked if I could get a side of it since they forgot to add it and they told me its $1.50 extra for some sour cream. The other Mexican food place in this mall hardly charges that much for fresh guacamole let alone a scoop of dairy. Typically the food is good though but again it all depends on the server.
