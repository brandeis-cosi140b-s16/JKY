Had dinner here with the family the other night...probably will be our only visit to this restaurant. The neutrals to negatives outweigh the positives.
We started off with an order of the Skillet Nachos. These were pretty good - no complaints. The toppings weren't overdone as you may get with other restaurants nachos that drown the chips creating a mushy mess.
For an entrée I had the Cubano torta. This was good and had a nice flavored mustard. The rest of the family ordered a variety of tacos. This is where things started to go downhill. Rather than have each person's tacos on individual plates they were brought out on one big plate, family style and everyone had to guess and sort out which was what. The feedback I got on the tacos was they were OK...nothing spectacular. We also ordered the strEAT corn to share which did have a nice flavor. However, all the food came out warm, at best. One positive of the food is the portion sizes were just right. 
The service was pleasant enough and the décor was very nice, but those things alone will not warrant another visit. Also, what is with the Tommy Hilfiger style logo?
