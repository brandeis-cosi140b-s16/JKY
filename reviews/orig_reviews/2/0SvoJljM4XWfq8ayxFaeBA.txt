The food is delicious and my margarita was to die for. But the service was pretty rough. Our waitress checked on us three times. Once to take drink orders, once to take our order, and once to bring us a pitcher of water. Between 7 of us we went through that pitcher rather quickly and then we didn't see our waitress for at least 40 minutes. I had to walk to the bar myself to get our check. If it was busy I could totally understand this but it was 3 o'clock on a week day and there were maybe 4 other people there sitting at the bar. I would say the main downfall is that the servers aren't very interested in helping their guests but like I said the food and drink is really good!
