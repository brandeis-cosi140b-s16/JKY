The food tasted great and I loved the decor.  They have a 12,000 lb black granite panda wearing a sombrero.  That was too cool.  The food was great and not expensive, but the menu was a disaster and you had to study how to write in the proper codes before you could order.  This really wasn't needed as we were the only people in line.  Also I got sick after eating this junk, it only last for ~4hours but it still sucked.
