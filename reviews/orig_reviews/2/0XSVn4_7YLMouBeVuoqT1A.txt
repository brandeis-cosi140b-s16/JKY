We were staying at TI and wanted a quick bite after a long poker tourny. We just wanted to order something and take it up to the room, but were told that's not possible. (What???) What's the difference if I order it and ask for a to-go box as soon as it comes? I don't get it. Also, they close the dining room early by Vegas standards, 10pm on a Saturday night. We ended up ordering some queso at the bar. The big bowl of queso only came with 3 tortillas and no chips. We asked for one (just one!) more tortilla and were told we'd be charged for an extra order. Are you joking?! They ended up giving us one, but not without some coercion. The margaritas were okay, but nothing to write home about. I ended up bailing early because since we were forced to sit at the bar, the smoke was bothering me. Overall a bad experience!
