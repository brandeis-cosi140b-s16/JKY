I wanted to love this place just for that fabulous patio.  We tried 4 types of the margaritas and they all tasted off, like the lime juice had turned.  We also had the three amigos.  The queso was the best out of the three by far.  The guacamole didn't have much flavor and the salsa looked so red and fresh but I couldn't get over the one flavor that I believe was cumin.   Just not my favorite, the salsa would have been awesome without it.
