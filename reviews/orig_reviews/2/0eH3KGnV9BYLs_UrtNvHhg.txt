We ate at Segundo on April 26 around 2 pm at the bar. The bartender was very unfriendly, didn't welcome us, didn't introduce himself. He just kept talking to a friend that was visiting him at the bar. There was a lot of f..ck, s..t, etc... in their conversation that we got an earful.  He pretty much ignored us. The food came out fast, guacamole, elote and cheese foundu was really good, tortilla soup not so much. Probably will not go back there..
