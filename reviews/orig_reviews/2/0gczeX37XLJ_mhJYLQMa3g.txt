Oh man, I miss Tacos El Gordo. This place has no idea what they are doing. The workers are pretty cool, but they are SO SLOW. Inside the shop was sooo warm and stuffy, the workers were sweating, and serving your food. The meat was super salty, my tacos were drenched in grease.  

Never coming here again.
