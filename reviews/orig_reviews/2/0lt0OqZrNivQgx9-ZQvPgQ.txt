Food is not really worth the hassle here folks. Barrio Queen is very proud of their food (very expensive for what you get) and I've never had anything but loooooooong wait times on a table AND on the waitstaff once you are seated. Being local I know to expect Scottsdale prices, but the food and service do not justify it here. My first visit my husband and I sat at the bar and were ignored for a good 10 minutes.
On my last visit I took an out of town business colleague here raving about the food. We had terrible wait times on our server and was flat out ignored by her, which was par for the course considering my first visit. Two chances, same poor service, will not be returning.
