I loooooooove Fuzzy's!!!....until today! I have a huge family. I ordered 8 steak tacos and 8 fish tacos and chips with guacamole. Tyler took my order and refused my military discount, claiming because it was a Tuesday there weren't any extra discounts because Tacos were a $1.50.   Now I have been coming to Fuzzy's every Tuesday since I moved here from Ohio and use my military discount.  I'm familiar with the owner who is a Michigan fan!! He teases my son's for wearing OSU gear!!! Tyler was rude loud and obnoxious, refused to add my discount and shoved my receipt in my face and said "Look lady I'm not giving you a discount, do you want me to get fired" The manager was not there but Westin , I'm assuming was taking the managerial position for the day, stepped in.  He assisted us with a smile, was cordial and added my discount. Meanwhile, Tyler stomped away from the cashier station pouting! Terrible customer service...terrible example of empathy!! Tyler makes Fuzzy a place I never want to come back to!!!  Thank you Westin for all of your help and for keeping Fuzzy's onTuesday regular for us!!!
