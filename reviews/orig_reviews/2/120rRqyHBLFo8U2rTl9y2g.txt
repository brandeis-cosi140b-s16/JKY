My husband and I decided to play "tourist" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says "Doesn't this taste a little funny?"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.

PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the "deer in the headlights" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!
