Ordered Fiesta nachos ( total disappointment ) albondigas soup, chips a salsa ( salsa tasted like canned tomatoes with a little cilantro and onion ). The nachos were soggy and loaded with tasteless shredded chicken and beef. Soup was slimy and the meatball tasted like un-seasoned hamburger, the only thing that was good was the cold beer !
