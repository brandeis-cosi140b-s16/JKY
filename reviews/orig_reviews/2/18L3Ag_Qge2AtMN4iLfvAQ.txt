Horrible. Overpriced food. For Dare I say. "White people" who never have Mexican or Chinese food before and don't know any better?

GUESS WHAT? I didn't know any better. Only in Vegas can restaurant robbed their customers like this.

THERE WAS NO FUSION FOOD OF ANY KIND....  I want my money back....
