Yuck! This wasn't our first choice for dinner and should've waited the hour to get a table at Los Dos Molinos. Anyways, we ended up here and thought we would give it a shot. We started off with the tortilla soup which was pretty good. The chips and salsa were pretty good too. I ordered carnitas. My meal was so bland. How do you mess up carnitas? I had a huge plate of food but it was mostly consisted of lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, ect. There was hardly anything else, not that I would've eaten it anyways. So I we decided to order deep fried ice cream and disappointment hit again. It was ice vanilla ice cream with corn flakes sprinkled on the top. Unbelievable! Well now we know and we will never go back there again!
