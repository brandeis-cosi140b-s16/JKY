We were starved and it looked so inviting....Looks can be deceiving. The menu is sparse, okay I get it. But just because it's inside the airport doesn't mean you have to throw quality out the door. Look in my younger days I was in love with Sammy Hagar..haha...But dooode....really what makes you think just because you can sing, you can open a fast foodish restaurant. It was really mediocre and the wait staff, personalities of turnips. My husband says " what do you expect they work at the airport". I say "hey a job is a job, so some enthusiasm that you are getting a paycheck" geez...... Okay I guess it would work in a pinch, when you need some fuel and to rest your weary bones...and they do have cocktails and brews.....
