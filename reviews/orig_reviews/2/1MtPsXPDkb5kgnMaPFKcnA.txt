Was confused by the 'Haus' spelling but after learning about the Brat Haus ownership commonality, it made sense... well sort of.  I was hoping for a nice draft list here too but there were only a couple craft beers among the standard Mexican tap handles.  On the whole the food here was decent, though in some ways a bit ordinary and bland, i.e. the green salsa.  I asked if they had a spicy salsa and other one was given, but it was served in one of those plastic ketchup-style squeeze bottles and was not spicy at all.  Asked again, and they gave me a metal bucket of hot sauces.  

Good value for the tacos on happy hour, but I'm struggling to find myself there for full price for those same items (the portion size for the price).

Service has been all over the place on my visits here, from average to horribly inattentive.  The same goes for food prep time and it wasn't always consistent, for it was almost like my food came faster when it was very busy and was slow to arrive when few people were dining here.  Perhaps the server took awhile to ring in my order?
