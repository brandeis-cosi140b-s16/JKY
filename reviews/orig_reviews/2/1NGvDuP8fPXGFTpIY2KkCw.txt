I love the food at Cafe Rio, but, the customer service is lacking.   The employees cannot hear your order due to a glass wall.   It seems that all the employees are yelling and are rushing to make the order without any regard for customer service.   Again, the food is fantastic, but, I can't seem to understand why the staff is so rude.  I have been to several locations and have found it only to be this location (On Eastern) that I have this problem with.
