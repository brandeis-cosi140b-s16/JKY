The first time I came here I had a great experience. I have come here 3 times since and this will be my last time. Unfortunately, the environment inside is super noisy. The patio is the only perk of this over priced taco joint. There is a new restaurant in town called Bakersfield that has a lot better of environment and 100x better food and it's right down the street. Not to mention the sanitation rating was a 90.5 at RuRus. Plates will be taken off the table while you are still eating and you won't get out of there for one person under $20... Sorely disappointed expensive margaritas for them to be mediocre.
