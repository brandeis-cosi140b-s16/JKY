We ate here since we awere going to watch the criss angel show and we were staying at the hotel , heard it was suppose to be pretty good food.

The food wasnt good at all, ended up not eating much of my fajitas casue they didnt have any flavor at all and they were watered down and the ortillas were all hard.  My boyfriend said his stuff was bland as well .  FOr the price you would expect the food to better.

I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone, The atmoshpehre was the only nice thing about it.  And it wasnt crowded but now i see why.
