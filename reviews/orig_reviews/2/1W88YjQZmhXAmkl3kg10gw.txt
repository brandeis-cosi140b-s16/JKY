Close to the worst service I have had anywhere in Vegas. 

I was here with a large group of people that had come in for a convention. They really love this place and eat here every year on their convention Saturday night break. Our party was a large party - about 20 people. We had a rooftop reservation. They assigned us ONE waitress who claimed she was new. First off: why on earth would you assign ONE person. Second: why on earth would you put a new person on such a large group?

Drinks: We ordered a pitcher of house margarita FOUR times. FOUR TIMES!!! We ended up giving up ordering from the waitresses and got up from our seats to order from the bar. In the end, we waited about an hour for the drink I believe. We were never asked for refills, never asked for water, etc. We continued getting up from our seats and walking over to the bar for drinks. 

Food: The food was actually fine. I had the chicken tostada salad, which was really good. I can't complain about that. 

When it came time to get the check we were told our check was split up into 4, even though we hadn't requested this. We were fine with that because we understood we were such a large party. The waitress came around to each group of people and had US refresh HER memory on what we had ordered. When she came back with the split bills the orders were all messed up! We ended up grabbing a menu, writing it down and adding it up ourselves with the sales tax and tip. They are lucky we are honest!


To those dealing with injuries: there are no bathrooms up stairs. I have a broken knee cap and I had to haul it up and down a flight of stairs. Another annoyance to top off the night. The only redeeming thing about this place was the free live music that started around 10.

I honestly hope the managers figure out a better way to manage large parties, because ours was not handled well at all.
