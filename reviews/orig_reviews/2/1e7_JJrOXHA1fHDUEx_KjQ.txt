The service was less than exceptional. The water was warm. We asked for extra chips and didn't get them. The food was meh. My Chorizo Omelet came out burnt to the pan, yet the cheese wasn't melted? My boyfriend ordered the Pastor tacos and those were gross. The pork was dry and tasteless and the pineapple topping tasted like it came straight out of the can. The only good thing I can say is the margarita was good. However, it was the smallest margarita I've ever had. Needless to say, I won't be returning.
