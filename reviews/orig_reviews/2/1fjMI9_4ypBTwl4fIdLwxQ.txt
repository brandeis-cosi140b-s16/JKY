Rather average and uninspired. Nearly every Mexican restaurant pronounces itself authentic, however Fiesta Mexicana falls well short in that regard with bland, lifeless fare. The atmosphere is open an airy and the service is, well, serviceable. However, the bar is set high when offering Mexican food in Phoenix and there are many more flavorful options. Also, this establishment does not accept American Express, which I find to be unreasonable.
