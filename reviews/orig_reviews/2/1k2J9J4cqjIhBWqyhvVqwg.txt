I had high hopes for Nacho Daddy but the food didn't quite deliver. Based on my experience at the Yelp event held here earlier this year I was excited to come back and try them out for a full dinner. At the end of the meal, everyone I was with agreed that the food was so-so and nothing special. I had the carne asada taco plate, another person had the buffalo nachos and the other had the grilled fish tacos. Food=average, service=good, atmosphere=average. Based on the food, I probably won't be back.
