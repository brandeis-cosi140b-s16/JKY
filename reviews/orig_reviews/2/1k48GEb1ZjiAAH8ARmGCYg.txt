My husband and I have been trying out new restaurants recently. We have been driving to downtown Phoenix from North Scottsdale, and have found several fantastic restaurants with great food, service, and definitely worth the drive. We decided to try Hacienda's Mexican Grill, since it is literally across the street from us. What a disappointment! The food was ok but the service was horrific. The bartender was too busy watching tv to do his job and our waiter was more interested in sitting and visiting with a couple of other customers, to remember our food, our drinks, or to pick up our credit card. We had to ask 3 other employees for help because our waiter was so lame. I don't see them being in business much longer!  I'd rather drive downtown in rush hour traffic for dinner!  Too bad because we need more good restaurants in North Scottsdale.
