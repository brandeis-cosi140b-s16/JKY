I went the same night Rick H went and had the exact same experience, I think we must have had the same waitress. When we asked what imports she had on tap she listed Bud, Coors, Miller.....LOL She was super sweet and very new so Im sure she will be grerat in a couple weeks. This was our second time in,  We went opening week ( I know my bad) for our first time and waited and hour and a half for the food so tonight's dinner was comped to try to woo us back in.  Nothing stand out here just your Typical Sonora Mexican food nothing special, nothing terrible.  I think the bar will do well and since the closest competition is maccayo's I'm sure this place will do great.  Sorry to say I haven't discovered my favorite new Mexican food place in POPO"s, shame because it''s 5 mins from home.
