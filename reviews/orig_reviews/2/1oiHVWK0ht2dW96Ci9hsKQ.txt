Unfortunately this place is a total bummer. Having grown up in Southern Californina, trips to Baja and Hussongs was part of growing up. When we saw a Hussongs in LV we were so excited that we planned our Happy Hour around it. Ugh, what a mistake. Being a lover of street tacos we ordered 12 for the table and some others apps and entrees. The $3 tacos were borderline edible. Quesadilla and Flautas were good but come on, not hard to mess those up. Tacos sucked and took forever to get our happy hour beers. Definitely would not recommend Hussongs.
