Well....as a huge fan of fish tacos, I was excited to try this place and see what they offered. Meh. I had fish tacos and my husband had i think had the chicken tacos and we both left hungry. For the price you pay for the meal (if you'd call it a meal) it leaves you very empty. Maybe not bad for a late night bite to eat and a drink but I wouldn't suggest going for a dinner. Oh and the fish tacos were just average.
