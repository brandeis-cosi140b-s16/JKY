Loved the fish tacos!  But wow, what happened to this place over the past twenty years since I first started eating there?  I know the KFC/Chandler city battle years ago took its toll due to politics and winning and keeping the location... but come on -- update the place please or at least clean things!  20-year old decor isn't acceptable given horrific chairs, tables and more.  Also wtf is there a BBQ guy outside in the entry area doing with his food and aromas?  I don't get it.  The BBQ smells didn't mix with the fish tacos or beer that we had ordered.  Memories are great but apparently they are better than what exists today. No mas.
