A very large restaurant in the New York New York Casino. They offer "outdoor" seating - meaning on the fake city streets within the casino. We chose the outdoor seating so we could people watch while we ate.

The Margarita was too sweet and a little watered down. They served it in a plastic cup rather than glass. That was a bit of a disappointment. They are generous with their chips and salsa. They also made us table side guacamole which was very good.

For dinner, I had a beef burrito. I've had better.
