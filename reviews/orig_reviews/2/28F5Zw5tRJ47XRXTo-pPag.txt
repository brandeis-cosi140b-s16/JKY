My friend was raving about this place so we went over there together with our kids one evening.  They took her order right away, and then it was at least five minutes before they took our order.  There were five to six people behind the counter, but not much appeared to be happening.  There were two people standing directly opposite behind the counter, but they did not even say" hello", "welcome ot Gadzooks", or "be right with you".  

Now, lets' talk about the menu.  Extremely confusing.  It's very unclear how to order a meal.  Additionally, there is no kids menu.  I asked if they could make my daughter a cheese quesadilla, which they were more than happy to do, but when I went to pay, I discovered that the quesadilla was the size of a small pancake, and they wanted 3.50 for it.  I told them for that price, they needed to add another quesadilla, which they did without question.  I think at Chipotle you can get an entire kids meal including quesadilla, rice, beans and drink, for about the same price.  So my suggestion would be to add a kids menu.  

Okay, now for the food.  It was decent.  I ordered the spinach mushroom enchiladas with a goat cheese shmear.  I left feeling hungry.  A side of rice and beans would have been great.  I don't know if they offer that or not, but it doesn't come with the meal.  

While my friend likes this place, and will probably go regularly, I doubt I will ever go back.
