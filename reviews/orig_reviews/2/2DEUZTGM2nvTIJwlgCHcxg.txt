Pretty cool concept at this place but the customer service wasn't very great. After being in line for a while and next in line to have our order taken, another group of people walked in and went to the other side of us. It was a group of teens. The man at the register asked if they wanted to sample and then took 15 minutes to give them samples and completely blew us off. It was as if we weren't there at all. So we had to move over to another line. Then the person who took our order was very rude. Most of the tables were dirty with crumbs all over the chairs. When they brought our food to our table, they told us that one of our order still needed a quesadilla, rice and beans that they were waiting on......of course they forgot so we had to go ask for it 15 minutes later. They brought the quesadilla and beans. It was the wrong beans we asked for and they forgot about our rice. They even burned our meat. The quesadillas were really good but nothing amazing. TERRIBLE service. The worst I've experienced eating out ever.
