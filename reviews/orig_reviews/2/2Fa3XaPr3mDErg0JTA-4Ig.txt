Service -- not so much. :(
Food - - we just stopped in for nachos, and they were super cheesy. 
Margarita - - 99c during happy hour 3pm-6pm. Meh! Tasted like a lot of sour mix, but what can you expect for 99c, right? 

The nachos were $11.99, but then marked down $2 to $9.99 for happy hour. 

Needless to say.. we've had better nachos. But really the lack of service will prevent us from coming back. 

What were we thinking? :)
