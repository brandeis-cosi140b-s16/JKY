I have mixed feelings about this place. The setting could be called warm and romantic and the main attraction is the patio, which is hard to secure, so you will end up sitting in the loud inside area. 
I am not sure why the place is so popular. If you call, they are usually fully booked, but if you just walk in, there is a big chance you would be seated within 10 minutes. 
The d√©cor is a mix of Latin and American steakhouse and doesn't have a unique identity in my opinion. It would definitely need a makeover to stay popular, given all the cool places that are popping up in the old town.
As for the food; I have been there three times already and the experience has always been average. Based on my last experience, I don't think I would go back. Most of our hot appetizers came late and cold. The taco dishes were mediocre and there were not enough staff to attend to our demanding party.
