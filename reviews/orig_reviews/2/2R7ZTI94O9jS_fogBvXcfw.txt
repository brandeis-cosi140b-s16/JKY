unfortunately for this place, their food is pretty good but their prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! 

I ordered the quesadilla de maiz w Carne asada and a water. she asked if I wanted some crumbled cheese and a drizzle of sour cream on top so i said sure. then I asked for a bit of guacamole on the side (seriously, "a bit" - it only lasted for half my quesadilla). 

my bill was OVER $15

i almost ordered a horchata but she said a glass of that was $5!!!

like I said, pretty good food but ludicrous prices. I will not be going back for this reason. I hope you enjoyed the extra few dollars you charged this one visit instead of having a return customer who would have brought an extra person back, possibly a couple times.
