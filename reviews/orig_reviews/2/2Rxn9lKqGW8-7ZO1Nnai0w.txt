This place is good for two things:

1. Margarita headaches
2. People watching (exceptionally good for this)

Ok, this is Vegas; but this place was pretty terrible as far as the food went. I don't think thats why anyone would go here... but still. Skip it.

The margaritas are, meh... sugary and headache-making.

Anyway, good location, you can see the Bellagio water show go off every half-hour, but aside from that and watching all the weirdoes walk by, no redeeming qualities. Save yourself the $50.

There was a Michael Jackson impersonator just standing on the sidewalk and not dancing though...

Skip it
