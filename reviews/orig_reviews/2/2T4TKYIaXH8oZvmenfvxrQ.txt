The shrimp enchiladas were good but the service is marginal at best.   They have a great attitude and are friendly but not very attentive.   Waiting to pay for 15 minutes. And they still have not come by.  Good thing is we had the patio to ourselves.   I would give it another try if we are in the area just to see if it was a fluke.
