Hubby wanted street tacos & this was recommended by a few people.  We walked in at noon right as they opened & it was already packed.  They had a salsa/condiment bar right in the middle of the room which kinda skeeved me out since so many people we're standing around it (flipping their hair, coughing etc).  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos & hubby ordered 1 carne asada, 1 pastor, & 1 taco with carne & green chile. They came out right away & I was really impressed with the amount of meat they gave us.  My meat was pretty pink & I wasn't sure if it was due to a marinade or being undercooked? The meat was pretty flavorful, I did like that nice smokey taste from the grill. I could only eat 1 taco, it was way too greasy for me.  The tortilla was greasy as was the meat.  My husband devoured his & couldn't stop talking about how these tasted like the ones back in Mexico. I felt pretty queasy the rest of the day from the amount of grease.  Since my husband loved it I know we'll be back, I noticed they had bean tostadas & bean tacos so I may try that next time.
