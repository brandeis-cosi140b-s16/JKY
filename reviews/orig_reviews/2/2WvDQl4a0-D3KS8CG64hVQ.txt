What happens when you throw a lot of pretentious ingredients on a flour tortilla and charge $9 for it? You get Yo Ass Ripped Off. 

The $5 Mushroom Tostada, which my friend described as "gross," was an unidentifiable mass of ingredients that meshed into bland mediocrity. The "tacos," ranging from $5-$9 a pop, were decent, but only worth $4 at most. Service was slow, the men's bathroom was located in a dungeon, and look, I get it: people eat here to say they've eaten here.

This is more of an expensive Tapas bar then a Mexican Restaurant. There wasn't even rice and beans on the menu. For shame!
