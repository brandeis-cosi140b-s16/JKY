Susan and Mary Sue did not WOW us.

My wife and I were looking for a place for a light bite for dinner and decided to try this place. We shared the Kobe Beef Sopes, Watercress salad and Tecate Carnitas. We told the waiter that we had a late buffet lunch and will order a few dishes to share. He seems to be very concern that we did not order enough food and kept asking if we want to order more. This made us felt uncomfortable.

First to come was the Kobe Beef Sopes. It was tiny piece of beef wrapped in two quarter size corn masa topped with mango red cabbage mint slaw. The slaw was well seasoned and very tasty. However, I can really taste much of the beef since it was so small.

Next, we had the Watercrest, Jaicama and Orange Salad. The salad was topped with 4 little bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. The salad was very ordinary and the bacon wrapped dates were salty.

Lastly, we had the Tecate Carnitas. They gave us a good portion of the carnitas for this dish. However, the taste and quality of the roast pork is very mediocre. It is like the carnitas you get from an ordinary Mexican restaurant. There was only one piece tortilla came with the dish and it was all dried and cracked. It was not something that I expected a high end restaurant would serve to its diner.

When our bill came at the end of our meal, we found that there was $1 charge for  tap water in addition to the our  other drinks. We dinned at many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and never have anyone charge for tap water.
