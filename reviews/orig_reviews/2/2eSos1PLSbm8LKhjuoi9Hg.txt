Stopped in after a movie on Saturday night with a couple of friends.  

The staff was very nice and attentive.

The food was average and my order came out wrong the first time.  The waitress took it back and they corrected the problem but by the time it was returned to me it was lukewarm.   The food was ok but nothing great.

The drinks were pretty good and average priced for Town Square.

I was surprised how dead it was for a Saturday night.  At about 10:30 there was only one other table occupied.  It looked like they were setting up for some after hours activity but I get the feeling there weren't going to be a lot of people showing up. 

On the way out 2 of us went out the wrong way and the douchey bouncer barked about us going out the wrong door rather than opening the tension barrier and saying "Have a nice night ladies."  But I guess one doesn't need common sense or good manners to be a bouncer (you are representing the establishment after all).  

All in all the place isn't terrible but it certainly isn't something I would recommend to others.  I also don't think its going to be in business a whole lot longer.
