If you're staying at the Luxor, this is probably your best bet inside the resort for food. When I stayed here, it was for a sales convention. I went when I first arrived at the hotel, and then two nights later with coworkers. My first visit, I had a margarita and some chips and salsa. It took about 15 minutes for the bartender to even ask me what I'd like to drink. The bar was dead, except for a couple sitting to my left who were loud, obnoxious, and had zero class and foul-mouthed language at 2PM on a Tuesday. 

Second visit, I had the shrimp quesadillas-- they were okay. A little too cheesy, and a little less shrimpy, but they were good. Probably because this is a very Americanized version of Mexican food, more like a Chili's. Best part was my typical gigantic refillable Vegas margarita glass which I refilled about two more times before I left on Friday.
