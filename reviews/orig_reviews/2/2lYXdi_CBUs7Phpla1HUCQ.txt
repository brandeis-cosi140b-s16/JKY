This was disappointing for a number of reasons, some of which may have been outside the control of Los Dos Molinos.  

It was built up quite a bit from people who had been there or heard of it.  I was excited since there are not a lot of awesome restaurants that I am aware of in this area.  Maybe the other locations are better, this one was NOT up to much.  It seems like it's trying to get by on being famous for spicy food (not my thing) and kitschy atmosphere.

We tried going by for lunch and couldn't find the door.  I am still not sure if it was closed or not at noon on a Saturday, but it looked deserted.  We tried again later at dinnertime.  The inside area was PACKED.  It was like a third world airport.  A screaming baby and rude party-girl customers didn't help, but the atmosphere inside was cramped and not ok.  

We ended up sitting on the patio which was fun and eclectic, but not the most comfortable.  There were benches and things instead of normal chairs and it was lit strangely.  The atmosphere outside was marred by more obnoxious kids and the guy at the table next to us noisily losing his mind over the service quality and other things.  Great entertainment!

The service quality was pretty marginal.  They seemed really short staffed, and we had to wait forever to place orders and then longer than expected for pretty much everything.  They were crowded, but that should not have been short staffed on a Saturday night!  

There are warnings that the food there is SPICY and they are not messing around.  The salsa was painful, the options were between too spicy for me and biological weapons.  I ordered a bean burrito, which was not actually spicy.  I forgot what my date ordered, but it was just ok and not particularly spicy either.  As a vegetarian who is spice-averse, there weren't tons of options.

There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I don't see coming back here.
