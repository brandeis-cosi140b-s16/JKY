Mixed feelings about this place.  Good food was a plus for sure and the outdoor patio is very pleasant.  Drinks and food are pricey but thats to be expected but the service really blew.  We were with a large group but man the waitress never even came to my end of the table except for my initial order, I had to get up twice to get service and they never even brought chips and salsa. We were the last table in the place and they practically ignored our table.   Wont be returning with so many choices.
