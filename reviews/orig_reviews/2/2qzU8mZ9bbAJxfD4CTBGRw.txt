It's really surprising that in this Southwestern town the best reviewed Mexican restaurant on yelp was so entirely a non-event. The enchiladas came smothered in cheese (good!) but the red sauce they were gooped in was so oily I couldn't stomach even one out of two. And the oiliness didn't stop there. Even the "authentic" Spanish rice was practically deep fried in oil. Though it's true you can actually taste the tomatoes in the rice which is the truly authentic way to make this dish, the amount of oil in it made it slip right off my fork each time. Oh, and the salsas that everyone else seemed to like came in two varieties, 1. sweet and chunky but completely devoid of cilantro or onions and 2. pureed with a hint of spice, still no cilantro and not worthy of being called "hot" like the waiter did when he set it down on the table. 

It's too bad this place didn't live up to the reviews because the building and atmosphere were definitely unique and sets you up to have a good time. One positive I can say is that their blue agave margaritas went down smooth and tasty!
