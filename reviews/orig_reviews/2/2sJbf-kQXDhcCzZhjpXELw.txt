This was my second visit to this Los Dos Molinos.  The first experience was fairly good with good food and decent service.  This one I can't comment on the food because we never had our order taken.  It appeared there was one waitress and one bartender and one busman.  Chips and salsa were brought promptly and the salsa was excellent as always.  However the waitress never came by to take our order.  After about 15 minutes we left for Arriba's where the service was excellent as always.
