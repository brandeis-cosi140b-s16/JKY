The food here was great.  We got the taco platter, which was great to share!  The drinks and ambience were very pleasant, even during a busy Friday evening dinner service.  It's tucked into a nice area in scottsdale with plenty of valet parking nearby.

Our waiter was fine, although she had a habit of repeating what we'd ordered as a question.  The guy who cleared the tables was just bad, though.  He took plates too early without asking if they were done, and managed to spill a heavy mole sauce on us.

The food was great, but since the service was terrible, I will stay away from here.
