I am officially missing the boat on the big deal on Three Amigos. Always crowded whenever normal people eat, the service leaves everything and my mother to be desired. I understand that they're probably nice people but during my latest (abeit, 5th) attempt at giving Three Amigos a shot, they took over 30 minutes to get me 1 beer and forgot our appetizer for our table entirely. The food is OK, but that's coming from someone who LOVES Mexican food so I'm always wild about everything because how can you not love any and everything Mexican? This is where the problemo lies - theyr'e just not doing anything great at Three Amigos. I got the taco salad and in the past have tried the enchiladas verde, nachos and fajitas and all are - eh. The bathrooms - ick! They get less attention that the tables, so needless to say on busy nights they're not visions of cleanliness.

Part of me just wants to love all over some Three Amigos because I love East Charlotte and love Mexican food and love establishments that love Yelp, but Three Amigos, I sadly will say adios and go to you no longer.
