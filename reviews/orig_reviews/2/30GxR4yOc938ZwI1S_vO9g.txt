I use to come here quite often for their happy hour. 99 cent margaritas and half off all appetizers. How awesome is that?! All that and comes with chips and salsa and bean dip, which the dip is really good. I stopped coming because my boyfriend got food poisoning from this place. (our thought is its from the salsa, because it's the only thing I didn't eat and he did) 

Well anyways, we came back last night with some friends and I ordered a 99 margarita. It was hard. Our waiter kept trying to get me to order the $8 margarita because the 99 cent one is watery and has like no alcohol in it. I don't care! It's 99 cents and I'm a lightweight anyways, so just give me that dang margarita. Then we came to ordering. Now let's keep in mind we had dinner and we came around 930 at night. We ordered beef chimis and a cheese crisp to share. Our waiter said, that's it? In a 'really, Wow' tone. Alright... He says, and leaves us. 

He just wanted us to buy more in the end and make us feel bad about getting just happy hour. I'm sorry, but if you don't want people ordering 99 cent margaritas, then don't have it on your menu.
