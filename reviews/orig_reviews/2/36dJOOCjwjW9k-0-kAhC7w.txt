I wanted to like Azteca because I have always heard such good things from other people, but it just didn't do it for me and I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there.

Went for dinner on Saturday night, got there early and were sat right away.  The chips and salsa were good.  I ordered a Paloma, which was tequila and grapefruit juice and more, but I don't think its what I received.  I could have sent it back but it tasted fine, so I drank it.  We had some queso to start, that was also good.  For entree I got the camarones mexicanos, basically shrimp with onions, mushrooms, green peppers, in a tomato sauce with rice and cheese.  First shrimp tasted very fishy, the rest were better.  But the dish had a sourness to it, the mushrooms were the worst offenders and I couldn't figure out why so I stopped eating them.

So the food overall was fine but the restaurant kind of skeeved me.  There was water underneat my feet so that bugged me, then one of my friends touched some gum stuck under the table and at that point I was done.  I mean I know we're at a restaurant at a Days Inn but come on!!  Finally our server was just not very good or friendly and I sat with an empty water glass for a while.

So I gave it a shot but I doubt I'll be back.
