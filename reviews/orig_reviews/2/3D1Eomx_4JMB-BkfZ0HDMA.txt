I was looking forward to trying this place. I was disappointed off the bat when they didn't offer appetizers, like bean dip, etc. Our food was just alright,  enchiladas with mole sauce, portions were small and sort of sad, everything tasted kind of blah. As we left we paid up front, the waitress wiping down clen silverware dropped the cloth on the dirty floor, picked it up and kept on wiping down " clean silverware"... I can't return after that.
