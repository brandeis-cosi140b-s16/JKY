The only reason this place has two stars is because the food was ok... If I was solely rating the service it would be 1 star.  I arrived on a non-busy week night with my boyfriend for some food and drinks.  The hostess greeted us and sat us at a good table.  Our waitress came soon after and took out order.  We had a coupon that she presented to us.  After she got done rolling her eyes, she said that she had to ask the manager about the coupon.  The coupon was approved and we ordered our food.  While we were eating, we needed more fixings (sour cream, guacamole, tomato) so we asked out server for more.  She failed to mention that it costs extra for more sour cream!  As we were finishing up our meal, I guess it was taking to long for us to leave, so the server decided to put our check on the table and hover around until we put a credit card down.  Keep in mind we were only at the place an hour tops!  As we put the credit card down we again reminded our server that we had the coupon.  She took it with the check.  She came back and placed our receipt on the table.  We looked it over and she had not used the coupon!  When asked about this she simply said, "Sorry about that. You can use it next time."  -Really Chick-  Never mind that we were from out of town.  I was beyond annoyed at this point!  For me, service can make or break a meal!

Overall:  Food OK,  Service young and unprofessional. 

Recommendation: Skip this place and go elsewhere!
