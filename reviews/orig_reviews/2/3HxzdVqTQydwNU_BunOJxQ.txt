I've been here quite a few times over the year and on my most recent visit I noticed that the food and service have really gone downhill.

Macayo's claim to fame is that it's founder, Woody Johnson, invented the chimichanga by accidentally dropping a burrito into the deep frier. However, as any good Arizonan knows, this claim is challenged by El Charro restaurant in Tucson where they also claim to have invented the dish in the same year.

Either way, you'd think that a restaurant that wants to lay claim to such an important event in food history would make an effort to maintain its reputation as a quality Mexican restaurant, but this doesn't seem to be the case.

We stopped in the other night and started with some cheese quesadillas for us and the kids and they were incredibly bland and boring. 

For a main course, my wife had the steak picado and I had the green chile chicken picado. My dish is described on the menu as "tender chunks of marinated chicken sauteed in a fiery blend of tomatillo salsa, strips of poblano chiles and habanero". Nowhere does it say, cooked beyond recognition so that the chicken tastes like dry pieces of cardboard.

My wife's steak picado was not tender, but tough.

Additionally, our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times. I never received the sour cream I requested and once the food was at our table and the waitress had left behind a pitcher of water so we could do our own refills, we didn't see her again despite the fact that several members of our party had ice tea and could have used refills.

In a city and state full of GOOD Mexican restaurants, you'd think that Macayo's would try harder to compete, but I guess not. If it's my choice, I won't be back.
