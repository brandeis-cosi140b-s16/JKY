I've been a loyal customer for over 4 years at this location but had a horrible experience during my last visit. I was told that I would halve to pay for the complimentary chips that I had been getting free every single time I have gone before. I was also charged an additional 50 cents for extra lettuce GARNISH, but when I got my order, there was LESS garnish than normal. Of all things, the manager was the one to take my order and deliver my food! She was not accommodating and did not make any effort to better the situation which was very disappointing. She should do a better job of catering to the customer, making sure they leave happy instead of nickel and diming the customer on 100% complimentery items. Definitely will try to avoid Jennifer next time I am in. The other employees are always really great and helpful!
