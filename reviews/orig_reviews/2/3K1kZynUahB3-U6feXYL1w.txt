Ehhh... this place is incredibly mediocre. I had heard the food was good so when my boss offered to take me, I was excited. The atmosphere is just blah. Taneko was such a beautiful restaurant and so rich and warm, and Fox just seemed to throw a ton of cans of white paint on the interior and ruined what was a very beautiful dining room. But I get it, with the whole beach theme... it's just kind of ugly now. 

The chips and salsa were just okay. The salsa better than the chips. I had heard the enchiladas were good, but I opted for a heathier option and ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas. The tacos were incredibly average. I had to scoop out most of the pico de gallo just so that I could hold them. The beans were beans and the rice is not your average Spanish rice, but just white rice with butter and corn. I completely missed any authenticity of real Mexican food. The waitress highly recommended the flan, and I am not normally a fan of flan but we ordered one anyway. I would have rather eaten a Jell-O pudding cup, honestly. It was nothing special at all. 

I would honestly not waste my money here if you are wanting real Mexican food. This place doesn't have it.
