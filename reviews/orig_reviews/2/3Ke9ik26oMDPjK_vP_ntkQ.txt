Worst service in my life.  Took forever to get drinks.  Not once was my water filled. Have lived in NYC, Philly and this place would not survive.  Mediocrity is the standard in PGH.  Food ...asi asi.  Sorry but it's the truth.  Don't like posting scathing reviews but hopefully the owners read this and step it up.
