The food and drinks are great but they get a low rating because every time I go there the bar is full of children that are screaming or running around.  They are close to my work but the last thing I want after a hard day is to go to a bar for drinks, food, conversation, or to watch a game, and be sitting next to a table of 3 or 4 kids in a bar.  Even the several times coworkers and I have gone there for lunch to relax, there has always been a table in the bar with 3 or 4 young children.  Often being loud and throwing things like their menus around.     They have several screens with games on. But this bar is never going to be a place where many people want to come unwind with the bar full of loud children. They need to take a lesson from Red Robin (who's bar is always packed) and make it 21 and over only.  On my last visit I heard a guy at the next table who was annoyed by 3 loud children seated in the bar say, maybe the bar should have a toddler section. The mother was oblivious and stayed on her cell phone for at least 10 minutes while the children entertained themselves and made noise.  I would say that 5 of my last 6 visits, there have been loud children in the bar. My coworkers and I will have to look for another place to stop after work and for lunch.
