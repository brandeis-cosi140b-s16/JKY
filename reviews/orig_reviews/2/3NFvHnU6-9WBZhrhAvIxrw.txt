Food = 4 Stars
Service = 1 Star
Location = 3 Stars because the patio was closed and this is where we originally wanted to sit  :(

I came here on a Sunday evening, It was PACKED! We had to give our IDs to the desk to get a table pager; which I found uncomfortable with. 20 minutes later, our party of 4 gets a nice booth in the back. The server was cute but seemed rushed. We gave her our cocktail order and it took about 10 minutes for her to bring them back. Most of the ice appeared melted already in my Margarita but it tasted Awesome even though the salt had all fallen off. 

We placed our order for the apps and food and that was the last we saw our server for the night until paytime. The chips and Guacamole were awesome. I really enjoyed the salsa as well. My salad was rather boring, so I was going to ask the server to bring me some black beans or something to add to it, but sadly she never came back so I ate it how it was. Everyone else had mexican dishes and loved their dinners. The refried beans were really good.  

I never was offered a water or cocktail refill :( I was freaking thirsty by the end of my meal!! My poor Bf tried the spicy sauce and had nothing to wash it down with by sour cream lol 

We wait for what seemed like and endless time for the girl to bring the check after we had finished our meals. My bf wanted dessert, but it wasn't offered so we paid and left. 

I would go back... But definitely not let her wait on me.
