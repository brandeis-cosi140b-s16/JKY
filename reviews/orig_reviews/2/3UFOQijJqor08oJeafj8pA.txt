Ok, here it goes. Came here with my wife for her birthday. Upon arrival, looks great, pond out front is a nice touch. Outdoor seating in the right weather looks like it could be really nice. Inside, its fine. 

Chips and salsa were delivered right away, and quite good to boot. 

Wife ordered chicken fajitas and I ordered beef fajitas. When they arrived, everything seemed OK, although both seemed overly greasy, and after a few bites, it was very greasy. The beef and the chicken had zero seasoning on them, they were both very bland. The sides they give to build the fajita are ok, but no sour cream? Seemed odd to have to pay for a side of sour cream when we were paying $18 per plate of fajitas. The house-made guac was very average. One last note about the beef - it was cooked to well done which made it quite tough. The portions were quite large. 

The service was good; offered informed suggestions and was prompt and polite.  

Overall, the experience was fun with the wifey. But the $18 fajitas left much to be desired. Havent decided if we will give this place another try.
