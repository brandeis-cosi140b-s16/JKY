The food is really good the salad with both dressings is AMAZING!!! The fresh hand made tortillas are also really good. I love that they have a little free casadilla for kids. It's the perfect amount for the picky eaters. The reason for the 2 stars is Evey. Single. Time. we are there the service is absolutely AWFUL. The staff is so rude. It's like they try to be even more rude every single time. I only ever go back because it's so good. We've actually started driving out to other locations to get better service. Tried doing phone orders and it's worse. If you are up for great food go for it if you can handle the bad service.
