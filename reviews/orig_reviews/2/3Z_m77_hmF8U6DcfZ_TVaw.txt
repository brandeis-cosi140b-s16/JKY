Dear Pink Taco,

I so wanted to love you ever since my mom came to a catered event her several years ago. When I was picking out Restaurant.com certificates, I just knew I had to have you in my life. I love "upscale" Mexican food, and was hoping you could deliver. Sadly, you did not. 

Your hostesses sat us very quickly and I applaud the quick chip and salsa delivery. I didn't realize how hungry I was until your delicious salsas were in my face and your warm chips were breaking all over the table in my impatience. Little did I know this was to be the best of the meal. 

Your server took approximately a year to even take our drink order. Then, throughout the meal, he proceeded to commit two cardinal sins in a restaurant: asking if we were doing okay with his hands full and his back 3/4 turned away from us, as though we were an afterthought, and the second, putting the check down before asking if we wanted anything else. Pink Taco, this server did not earn his included 18%. 

On to your strange food choices. I ordered your famed Pink Tacos, which had little flavor until I added the aforementioned salsas. The tortillas were good, the pickled onions too, but the chicken and black bean paste were dull. I so wanted to like your taquitos, our chosen appetizer, but the flavor was strange and by only receiving 3 tiny taquitos for $7.50, I sighed for those who would pay full price for them.  

The bottom line, dear sweet Pink Taco, is that you have all the potential for a great awesome upscale Mexican food reinvention--great decor, interesting menu items, and a provocative (albeit silly) name.  Somehow, you missed the mark and I hope we can be together again under better circumstances. 

Love,

Molly T.
