I really want to like this place because I work close by, but I have one thing to say... 

I always get the same thing because its awesome, 

Green chili burrito enchilada style with green sauce 

It is soo good but every time I get it the pork is pink (not my favorite) so finally when ordering I asked for the meat to be well done and explain why... I was told no.....no?.... hmm... I asked over and over why and nobody could give me an answer.... 

SOOOO my only guess is that its a pre-made frozen burrito that they slap some sauce on....other than that its not bad.
