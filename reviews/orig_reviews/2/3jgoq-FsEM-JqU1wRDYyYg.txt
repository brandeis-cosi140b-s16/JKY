We were thinking of going to Garcia's at Arizona Mills Mall and decided to go here instead. It wasn't a big mistake but would have been more satisfied at Garcia's.

The table we were sat at was too close to other tables for that "intimate" feel. Our server was great, however. The food wasn't all that good. They bring you chips and salsa. The salsa, in my opinion wasn't that great.

Most likely won't be coming back as there are better options out there.
