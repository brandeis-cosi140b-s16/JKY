Having just moved from California, I found myself on a quest from Mexican food in the chandler area. Entering Nando's I was immediately impressed with the ambiance that's reminiscent of a Mexican cantina designed in Disney land. 

Unfortunately, first impressions were not an accurate representation of the quality of the food. The salsa was  mediocre and the chicken in my tacos was completely over slated, making the beans and rice the star of my plate. 

All in all, if you solely gauge your eatery by its ornamental value, this would be a good venue for you.
