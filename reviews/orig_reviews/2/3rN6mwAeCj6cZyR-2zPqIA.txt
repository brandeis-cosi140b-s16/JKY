I ordered nachos, which do NOT come with refried beans. I ordered them for an additional charge, and received a very small side container of dry, unsavory, refried beans. As a whole, it wasn't necessarily all bad, but it was definitely not good or impressive. I ate about 1/4 of the order, and threw the rest away.

On a lighter note, the waiter was polite. I was the only customer, however, which doesn't bode well with me.
