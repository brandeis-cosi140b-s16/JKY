***Update***

I decided to give this place a second try since a friend kept raving about their food. The menu prices on the website are incorrect. The menu prices at the restaurant are higher. The tacos come here with beans. One taco is double the size of your typical taco. The cashier asked me what toppings I wanted. I asked for onions and cilantro. She said there's onions and cilantro in the pico. Um, OK. I've never heard of that before in a simple carne asada taco. Also, I asked for no beans. There's a $1 charge to remove the beans. WTF? It's not even mixed in together. 

They nickel and dime you for every topping. My two carne asada tacos and shrimp tostada came out to a whopping $16.22! If I ordered a drink, it would have been close to $20. I can understand if I was at a fancy Mexican restaurant but these prices are excessive for a casual Mexican place. The food wasn't good enough to justify the price. There was barely any seasoning with my meat and without my cilantro and onions, it wasn't the same. Also, I wasn't pleased with the paper thin slices of avocado. I can find better tasting tacos in L.A. for a lot less. 

So again, the cashier wasn't very friendly. The menus are not clear nor descriptive. Where are these toppings on the menu? Outrageous prices for mediocre tacos. No thanks. This place made me miss L.A. a lot.
