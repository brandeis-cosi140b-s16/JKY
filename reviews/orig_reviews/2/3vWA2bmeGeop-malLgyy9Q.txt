We came here with high hopes but were highly disappointed. The service was horrible (our waitress would disappear for long periods of time and would ask is what we ordered several times), the margaritas seemed watered down (house and Cadillac) and our tacos were less than desired (in fact 2 of them were cold). The shrimp taco was by far the weirdest taco I've ever eaten! We saw others order the fajitas and those looked much better....maybe I'll try that next time. 

We are going to try the Tempe location in the future to see if that's any better.
