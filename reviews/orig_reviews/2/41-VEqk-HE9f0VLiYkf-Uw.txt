I know I shouldn't have expected an authentic Chinese/Mexican restaurant, but I can't help it.  We were hungry, my grandma wanted to be at the Cosmo and we thought this place looked cool.  While it looks cool and the staff is very friendly, I was very disappointed with the food and the prices. My boyfriend bought...well, I can't remember the Spanish name for it, but he said it translates (literally) to Spoiled Cheese.  It was my first time trying it, but he said that it was mediocre for how much he was being charged ($10 for a small thing of cheese and a few tortillas on the side, WHAT).  I got the Papas Fritos, which was actually filling because it was really just a bunch of fries in mole and queso fresco.  It was ok, I expected there to be more cheese and the fries to be crispier. Also, again it was a small amount of fries and it was worth $7.  'Scuse me, but I could go to Robertos and get a huge ass box of Carne Asada Fries for that same price.  I would get five times as much as you gave me. My grandma got the pork buns (Siopao) and man.  That really disappointed me.  After being an avid Chinatown visitor of both LA and Las Vegas, and being of Filipino descent, I was appalled that these four, dainty buns were $12.  If you're going to charge that much, these buns better be damn good.  Nope.  I ate it all though because I didn't want to waste food that was expensive. it ended up being over $40 for just three plates.  Mind you, we didn't even order other beverages.  Oh, and they charge $4 for the chips and salsa. SERIOUSLY?! Sadly, the chips and salsa were the only good dish too.  

I would rather go to Panda Express for "Chinese" or Taco Bell for "Mexican", that way we would've saved our money.
