A few tips:  DON'T get the Chiles en Nogado if you are hungry.  Literally 5 BITES of chicken, NOT a chicken breast.  That worked out to $5.00 each bite for this $20.00 entree.  Also, it would be nice if the sides had been hot or even warm when served.  The chipotle mash wash just chipotle and no other flavor.  The calabacitas was more onion than anything.  My lunch partner's bass looked great but the server tried her best to take the plate I had the fish on that my lunch partner shared since my $20 plate was so very skimpy.  As well, there must have been a rule about leaving chips on the table even though the appetizers ($10.75 for guacamole?  really?).  The cevhiche was pretty soupy with hard chunks of avocado and needed seasoning. Finally, watch your ticket closely or you will be charged for 14 drinks for the person sitting is space 1 who had 4 drinks.  This was a very disappointing experience.
