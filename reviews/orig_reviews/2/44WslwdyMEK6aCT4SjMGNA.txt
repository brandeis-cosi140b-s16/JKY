Although the food was good, we had an issue with the service.  When asked to accommodate a variation on a menu item the waitress was not willing to even try to the point of rudeness. Then between courses she placed our used silverware that were on our plates back onto the table. When we asked for clean silverware we were given an extremely snide remark by the waitress. Her rudeness ruined the ambiance of the beautiful patio dining.
