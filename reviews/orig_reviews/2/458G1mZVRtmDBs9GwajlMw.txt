I guess I'm the odd one out, but my burrito tonight was flavorless, dry and just yuck. I got chicken and the chicken was so dry and burnt. I got the pineapple salsa on the side that had like no juice in it. The coconut bark is good, reminds me of almond rocha. It's super sweet so you don't need a big piece. I won't be back.
