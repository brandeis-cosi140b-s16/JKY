Despite a reservation for our anniversary, the host was unable to allow us to sit in an open booth as it was "Reserved"?. So we were seated at an awkward table next to the door. HOWEVER the booth sat empty our entire meal. The two people at the host stand were rude!!! Server was nice. Food was pretty good...pricey. Manager never came to check on us.
