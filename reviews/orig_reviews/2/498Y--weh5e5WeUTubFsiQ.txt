ALLLLLLLLLLLLL HYPE!!!!!!!

Decent mexican, decent chinese, decent.  Thats it.  The ordering process is facking ridiculous.  All those people fawking over the jade red chicken are out of their minds.  The jade red chicken tastes like ketchup and hot sauce.  Thats the sauce.  Avoid the hype.  It is not cool to eat here no matter how bad you want it to be.  save your money, any Bertos or half bit chinese will do.  make your own fusion.
