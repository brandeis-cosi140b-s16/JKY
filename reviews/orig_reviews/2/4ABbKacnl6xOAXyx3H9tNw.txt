We were excited to try this new restaurant. We went in on a Friday night right at 7 o'clock and the place was packed! It had live music and a great Mexican theme. We thought we are in for something really good.   Unfortunately after ordering it took a full hour for us to get our appetizer. We were starving by that point. When the meal came it was less than impressive. Our total bill for two meals one salad appetizer and one beer was over $50! I can say with certainty that I wouldn't have paid $25 for that meal and that I would much rather go to even a local Mexican chain over this place!
