The service was friendly but abysmally slow. There were a lot of people working and for the size, the place was pretty empty, but they were generally disorganized. It took us over 2 hours total to have a 'quick' breakfast.

I had huevos rancheros and the tortilla was either old or overcooked, it was so hard. The beans were well flavored.  My friend had the biscuits and gravy and said they were good.

We were staying at the hotel behind the restaurant, so the location was incredibly convenient, but I wouldn't go to this restaurant again. There are too many other choices close by.
