One word!!!  Dirty!!!  I read the other reviews and thought maybe it was an off day!  OMG!!!  How hard is it to keep a place clean?  On the food side the tortillas and beans are awesome!  Rice is sub-par.  The red chili was also very tasty.  The prices are great!  This would be a much better place to eat if it were kept clean!!!  I took a friend for the first time this past weekend and boy was I embarrassed!  Won't be back there with so many other great Mexican options in the Valley!!!
