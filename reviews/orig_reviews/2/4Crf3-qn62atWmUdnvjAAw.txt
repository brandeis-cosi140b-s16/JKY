I love the food and have been to Diego Pops on multiple occasions, but today I experienced something so rude and disrespectful I don't know if I'll go back. I Have a service dog, and have had my dog on your patio many times before- but today when the hostess sat me- I was quickly and very rudely scolded by a young female manager that dogs were not allowed- I simply told her she is actually a service dog, and when I did so, I was asked so show proof- never in my life have I had to show proof of her being a service dog. I was so offended I wanted to leave. I don't know if the young women with dark hair was someone new or she just lacks manners-
But I don't think I'll be back at diego pops even tho the food is good- it isn't worth the disrespect.
