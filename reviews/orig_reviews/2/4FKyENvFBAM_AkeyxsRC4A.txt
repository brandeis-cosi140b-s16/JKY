Mediocre meal; did not have the "wow" factor I was hoping for. 

To start, the hostess attempted to seat my client and I (both in business suits and obviously on a business lunch) at the "communal" table, where she said we would probably be joined by other diners but that "it's okay, because everyone is family."  We glanced around the restaurant and noticed lots of open two seater tables, and kindly requested a private table since we were on a business lunch.  The hostess seemed a bit flustered by our request, but did let us eat at our own table after offering us the bar instead, which we declined.  

We tried the chips and salsa, queso fundido, langosta tacos (lobster), and mongolian beef lettuce.  The best part of the meal was the lobster tacos.  They were actually very tasty, although on the small side.  Everything else.... not what I expected from such a well known chef.  There's just not much to say besides it just being mediocre food.  Both of us decided it was not the memorable meal we were expecting.  With all of the dining choices at The Cosmopolitan, I will certainly try another option next time.
