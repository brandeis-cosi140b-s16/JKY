Really really surprised at the reviews here. 

I got the pulled pork sandwich, which was pretty terrible. It came out on a regular piece of toasted bread, meh. It also came with coleslaw on it, which some people may like, but it just was not good at all. 

Also, no soft drinks here, can of coke only! What?? How does a business like this survive in america? 

My girlfriend and I were both quite disappointed with both our meals, and certainly will not be returning.
