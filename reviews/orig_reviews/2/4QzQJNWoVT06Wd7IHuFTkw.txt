Let me explain why this place deserves no more than 3 stars:

They shout customer orders over a loud speaker like you are getting a wake-up call via the 1MC on a US Navy ship.  No, that is not a good thing!  Plus, it is crowded, packed, and very loud.

People seem to come here for the cheap food ($5-6 per order), but you get what you pay for.  Carolina's West personnel throw bland food in a styrofoam carton and expect you to be content with some various combinations of lettuce, beans, cheese, and tortillas.  The taste is totally bland.

Abuelos, which is just a couple miles to the north, is a much better option for Mexican food.  Don't say that I didn't warn you!!!
