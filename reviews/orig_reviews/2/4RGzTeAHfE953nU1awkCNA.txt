Just finished eating here and like every other Mexican restaurant it's very disappointing. 
Our waiter was very nice along with everyone else in the place. Friendly, courteous and it has a nice ambience and good margaritas (hence my 2 stars) 
Food was very bland. Now because I lived in Mexico I'm very picky which is why I try to avoid any Mexican restaurant because it always leads to disappointment. I had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce, nothing special and nothing I would order again. My husband had steak fajitas. The steak was tender and not too bland but still didn't care for it. I ate two bite of my enchiladas. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals tho. 

Hot bean dip was apparently very good (I don't like beans so I can't agree or disagree with this statement) the salsa was also bland along with their chips. It's complimentary though. Leaving the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry sadly.
