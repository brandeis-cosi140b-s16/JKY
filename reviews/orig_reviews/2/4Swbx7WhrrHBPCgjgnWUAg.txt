The service was ok, but I was hoping for Mexican food. I had the steak chimi, which is supposed to come covered with cheese. It was more like velveeta. The meat was not actual steak, more like a processed steak-like food. The server asked me if I wanted rice or pappas, and looked at me like I was stupid when I asked what pappas were. The chips and salsa were ok, the chips were the really thin tortilla chips like you get at chili's. Not a bad place for yuppy-style Mexican food, but if you're looking for authentic Mexican food look elsewhere.
