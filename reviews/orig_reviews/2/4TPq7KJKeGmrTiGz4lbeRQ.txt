My wife and I went the other night for dinner. This is one of her favorite places to eat but the service just failed us this time. The waitress failed to refill drinks or chips in a timely manner and our appetizer was never brought out and she did not realize until we told her when our food was brought out. The food we did get was good but the service was very disappointing.
