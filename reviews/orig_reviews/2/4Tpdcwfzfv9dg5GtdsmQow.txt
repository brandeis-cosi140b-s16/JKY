I've eaten here in the past and had wonderful experiences, and even though I know there are tourist prices on some things they hadn't be outrageous in the past. Tonight everything changed.

I took my daughter and one of her sorority sisters out to eat and celebrate the end of finals week. Looking over the menu, I decided to have a Coors Lt. draft from the bar after seeing most beers on draught were $8 and then ordered my hamburger as I wasn't in the mood for what you would normally get at a Mexican restaurant. My daughter and her friend had water to drink and we also ordered queso and chips as an appetizer.

It was an unusually cool night dining outside, but I knew they had heaters outside and didn't think twice about it. We asked if they could turn on the heaters and wouldn't you know, all the heaters around us came on except the ones directly above us. We were later given an explanation of they were shorted out. Really? Don't know about others, but it made me want to leave as quickly as possible. (Props to our server who did move us to a warmer area, but it was still lacking and the only reason this review is not a one-star review).

When my beer did arrive, it came in an unusually large hurricane glass. When the bill did come, my $8 Coors Lt draft was now $18. Our party of 3 w/ 1 alcoholic drink and 2 waters was over $90. Again, I know eating on the strip isn't going to be extra cheap, but damn that's just gouging to be gouging to make $$$.

It was the last time I will pay to eat there.
