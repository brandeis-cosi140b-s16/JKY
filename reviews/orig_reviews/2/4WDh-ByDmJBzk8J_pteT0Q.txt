Ordered the enchilada special and wasn't informed a substitution from one type of chicken to another was a $1.00 fee - per enchilada!  The rewards coupons from their website can't be honored because they are not up to speed.  The food is ok, but not great considering how much they charge for it.  

Would come in sporadically, but now will just be avoiding them altogether.  Go eat a sit down meal with free chips and salsa if you are going to pay this much.
