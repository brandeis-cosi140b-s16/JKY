We love this spot for happy hour and normally have the best service and great prices... This time Kevin was our server and he was the worst. He complained loudly about our requests for drinks or food, our request to split the check and then added gratuity. The drinks are also apparently a different price if you do not sit in the bar area?? This was never the case before but today it was. I will second guess going back there again and if we do decide to have another happy hour there we will definitely request a different server!! Bummed
