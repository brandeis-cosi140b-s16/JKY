Definitely NOT four and a half stars!!
We ordered bulgogi burrito-- it was only okay at best... Not enough meat, too much rice. Bf felt the meat was over cooked as well. 
We also ordered Korean wings-- I liked them, bf did not as much-- again he felt they were over cooked.  The fries which came with it were frozen fries cooked with no salt-- very little to recommend.
Don't think we'll be returning.
