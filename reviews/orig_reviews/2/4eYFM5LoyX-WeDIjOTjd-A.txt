I've been here enough times to say that this is a perfectly fine place to hang out. The service is great, the restaurant is actually very nicely designed, from what I've heard the cocktails are pretty delicious, and refills on chips are free. 

That said, I have never enjoyed the food. I've had a chimichanga, tamales, and a couple of different side items, all of which I felt either lacked flavor or were more money than they were worth. The cheese and chorizo side is good if you don't mind spending $9 on queso dip, but the beans, tamales, and burritos I've had have inspired a resounding "meh" in me.

Taking on the moniker of a taco house was an ambitious move in a city like Phoenix. If they called themselves "Mod Living Room with Patio, Cocktails and Chips," I would find the branding more honest.
