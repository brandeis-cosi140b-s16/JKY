Being a supporter of Locally owned and operated establishments, I love visiting all of the Upward Project restaurants.  On Saturday night, my boyfriend and I planned a date night that started at Joyride Central.  The retro/vintage d√©cor was cute, but unoriginal and clashed with the 90's alternative music that was playing (Beck, Goo-Goo Dolls, Bush, etc).  The entire staff was very attentive to our table....to a fault.  We had 8 different people come by our table within a 30 minute period.  We were interrupted so many times that we weren't able to enjoy a conversation between the two of us.  I ordered a specialty cocktail that was mediocre and so I changed my drink order to be a glass of wine.  I wasn't quite finished with my glass of wine when someone placed the bill on our table.  So much for enjoying a relaxing date night.  The food is delicious (I ordered the Enchiladas) but I'm disappointed with my dining experience.  I wish I had gone to Postino Central instead.
