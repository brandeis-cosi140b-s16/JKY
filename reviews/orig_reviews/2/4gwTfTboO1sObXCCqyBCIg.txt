Agree with others on the board.  Food is great and really cheap.  I'd even go so far as to say the taste is better than Cantina.  But we've got the same waitress twice in a row and the service is very below average to say the least.  It's a good thing we weren't in a hurry.  

Also, do NOT get the Skinny Margarita.  I am never ever the one to send food back unless there is something drastically wrong but I had to send it back.  It was by far the worst thing I ever tasted--comparable to putting artificial lemon juice with sours mix on the rocks and calling it a drink.

I'm not intentionally hating on this place.  I really do like the food and don't like to give bad reviews.  With a good waitress/waiter I think Loco Lime would be a good experience.
