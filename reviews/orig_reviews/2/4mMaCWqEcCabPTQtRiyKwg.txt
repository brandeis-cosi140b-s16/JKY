I love DB so have been curious to try Revo out.  I went there today and had a vegetarian burrito with a wheat tortilla, a sugar-free(stevia) lemonade, and a gluten free chocolate cake thinggy.  First, the food - meh - it was okay - the rice was moist and the veggies crispy - but there was absolutely no wow factor.  Good thing they put salt in the take out bag too.  If you do not absolutely love stevia - and/or licorice flavored lemonade, don't go there - I wish they would just have it unsweetend and let you add your own poison - mine would be truvia - the cake thinggy was chocolatey - and the white stuff in the middle was tasty - and it was gluten free - so for a gluten free cake, it was pretty good - but again - no wow.  But then, maybe this type of food is not intended to have "wow"?  I felt kind of like I do at True Food.  In my heart of hearts I am not really loving this experience - but I am thinking that I am doing something GOOD for my body - so, as with exercise - I hope there is some gain with pain - maybe better antioxidant levels or something - NOT weight gain.  This healthy journey ran around 15 bucks - not unreasonable for what I got.
