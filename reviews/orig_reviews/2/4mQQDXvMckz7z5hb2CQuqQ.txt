Tacos are OK. Mine are better.  And are you charging me for a roasted jalapeno? Are you serious! Come on I will go to Safeway and donate them to you. Don't be so cheap you won't go broke. Also get rid of the Blondie cashier to dreamy and tell the gringos in the back to speed it up we are hungry out here. The order is to go no for us to go and shop and come back to pick it up. Work faster America otherwise we are going across the street.
