We went here with a party of 10 on a Wednesday night. We ordered 3 sampler platters, since nobody could decide what they wanted. The wings were good, but the food that should have been warm was cold. Or warm on the outside and cold on the inside. For what you are paying, it isn't worth it for cold or lukewarm food.
