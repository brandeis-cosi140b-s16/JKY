Came in with high expectations.  What I got was average food with inflated prices in a sketchy location with tough parking unless you want to valet at the strip club.  Salsas were good not great. Chips very generic average at best.  Ordered combo fajitas chicken/steak for $26. Average sized portion both meats were average. Sides very disappointing flour tortillas were generic store bought quality. Cilantro rice lacked flavor. Beans were okay. Guacamole/pico de gallo/sour cream portion was small to say the least enough for maybe 2 small tacos and were swimming in the liquid from the pico that made the guacamole and sour cream mostly liquid and useless. These fajitas would cost $10 less for better quality at many other restaurants.
