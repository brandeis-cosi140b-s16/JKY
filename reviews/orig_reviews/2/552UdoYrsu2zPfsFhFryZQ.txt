Everyone has the reason they signed up for Yelp and Nacho Daddy is the reason for me anyways I'm more of a Trip Advisor reviewer. 

OK, here's the point. NACHO DADDY HAS CHANGED and not for the better. I would come here with 2 other friends and a child and not be able to finish the nachos and a pitcher of margaritas, however upon ordering the Tostada nachos it was gone in about 3 minutes. Gone are the days of high piled nachos. It's now as they should advertise it...as an appetizer. We asked server about the portion sizing and she stated, "They changed the plate, but not the portions." There were abundant topping with almost no chips. 

Please don't get me wrong. This isn't about flavor, tastes, or any combination thereof, but how the portions have shrunk. 

I'm not going into service in this review so I don't sound like a hater. 

Sorry Nacho Daddy!
