Emiliano's was authentic Mexican food to me when I was 16 and didn't know any better. Now, 9 years & a lot of tacos, quesadillas & fajitas later- I can tell you that this place is pretty mediocre. Sure, it's not terrible- but it's not going to blow you away. On my most recent trip, my family and I all order a margarita to start. It was good- but nothing different or special. The presentation wasn't anything different & I had no desire to order another. The chips & salsa were good- Probably my favorite item of the evening. I ordered the steak fajitas for dinner. The chicken & steak fajitas were both $14, so I figured I would go for the steak. They were good- but not great. Nothing memorable. If I want Mexican, this is the absolute last place in Southside that I am going to visit- there are more authentic & less commercial places on East Carson & their prices are a lot better as well.
