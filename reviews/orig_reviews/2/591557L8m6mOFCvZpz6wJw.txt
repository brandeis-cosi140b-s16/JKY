I feel like every time I eat here, it's always a different experience. Lately, they had an influx of new employees who take too long to prepare and don't even prepare the food right. 

Also, it takes too long for them to get through a long line. We were so bored, we talked with the strangers in front of us in line. 

It's not like they ever had super bomb food, ever, for a fast food restaurant, but I think I'll probably stop coming to this one. There are just way better locations.
