Westside Girls Need Lovin Too, Part One. 

So my Westside girls call me up and want to do happy hour apps and drinks, but in Surprise.  Arrrghh!!  After the initial shock, I hop in the Steveymobile and start looking forward to checkin out Surprise again.  It's been a while.

So 35 miles and 90 minutes later I roll up to an appetizer platter and margarita waiting, a stool cushion fluffed and the bar area hopping with suburbanite foodies in full force.

The bartender was very quick at the gun and seemingly busy or slammed.  He looked put out any time we asked him for a refill, a plate or a cold mug, almost to the point of dismissiveness.  The food wasn't much to crow about either.  The taquitos barely had any meat inside. The quesadillas were average. The guacamole was kind of bland.  It was very reminiscent of an El Torito or something.'

My biggest beef with the place -- a HAPPY hour that goes from 2 - 5 PM?  WTF is that all about??  There are hardly even any workers in Surprise who are able to benefit from this.  Should they rename this the Surprise Unified School District happy hour? Most people in Surprise don't even get home from their Downtown Phoenix jobs until 6.  Those are the most worthless happy hour times ever.

My Westside girls had never been there before (even though it's relatively new) and name-dropped several places there and in El Mirage that are better.

For Westside Girls Need Lovin Part Deux, I have forcefully suggested Glendale or Peoria.  Stay tuned.
