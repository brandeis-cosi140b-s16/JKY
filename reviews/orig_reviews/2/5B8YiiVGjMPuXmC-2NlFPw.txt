meh. I've experienced better. 

My annual trip to Vegas always includes 8:01 am trips to La Salsa for their breakfast. And by breakfast, I mean 99 cent bloody mary's. And by 99 cent bloody mary's, I mean cups of ice and vodka and watery bloody mary mix that keeps me going for another few hours before passing out around noon after the The food is nothing fantastic, but let's be serious when I am still awake at 8 am, (and by awake, I mean wastedface) I am not in the mood for 5 star dining! All I need is hot food, zero waiting time, and 99 cent bloody mary's. For the breakfast prices, the food is definitely not bad. Most of it is pretty decent, just bland. The mary's are also very bland, it's more like tomato juice and vodka. But, there is enough vodka to satisfy me, and plenty of cholula on the table to make it tasty!

Like I said, price-wise, breakfast is awesome. Under 7 bucks for just about everything, and good portions. Lunch and dinner are definitely more expensive, but not bad compared to other strip restaurants. If you're staying at Planet Hollywood, or are in the Miracle Mile shops, come here for a good breakfast deal. If you are not in the vicinity.. go somewhere else. 

But, all this being said..  I come here just about every day, on every vegas trip. :)
