My husband and I were in town for the Monster Mash at Tempe Beach Park and Had met up with some friends for drinks here. I ordered Red Bull and Vodka and would say the drinks were ok. Didn't really seem like they put much vodka in with the Red Bull. I should've just stuck with beer. 

Also, the security guy was a major douche and had superiority complex. Ugh. Our server was nice but also slow. 

Based on the reviews and photos of the food, I would've never came anyway, but like I said, we were meeting some friends who were already here. I wouldn't come back if I was ever in the area again.
