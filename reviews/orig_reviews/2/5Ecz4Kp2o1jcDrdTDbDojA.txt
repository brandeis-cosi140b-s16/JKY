Blue Adobe Grille had great reviews and I was looking forward to some classic New Mexican food.  I saw a lot of good reviews on their seafood, so we all gave it a shot. I think maybe they had a bad cook that day, but all the seafood was way overcooked.  Even the pork tacos were so overcooked, my friend gave the order back to the restaurant.  We went on a Friday nights, so its quite surprising.
