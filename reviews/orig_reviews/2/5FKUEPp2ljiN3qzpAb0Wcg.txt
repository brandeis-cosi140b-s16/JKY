I don't know what possessed me to eat here.  Maybe I thought if it was good enough for George Dubya, it would be good enough for me.  I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.

Because nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the "presidential" table for us, complete with the "hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque."  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.

I ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.

Would I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do.
