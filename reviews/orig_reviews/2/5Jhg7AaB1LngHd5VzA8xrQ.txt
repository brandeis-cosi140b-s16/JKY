Um, no.

What do you do with a beautiful old train depot? You fill it with so much color it looks like Sherwin Williams barfed in every corner. IT so 1980's, so falsely cute. I just loathe the interior.

To be fair, my chicken pablano was reasonably good and the server was steady. But the atmospherics are deigned to wow unsophisticated frat boys from the nearby U. No thanks.
