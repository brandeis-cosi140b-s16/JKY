First of all, let me say I love Chipotle. But this particular location has not been up to par. 

First of all the tortilla is always over done and hard. Secondly, they fill it so much, that at the end, they can't fold it to make the ends meet. I know that's a weird complaint; a burrito that's too big?? But it makes a complete mess. It's just less enjoyable. Mine isn't always so bad, but my husband's burrito is always out of control. Funny thing is he gets a vegetarian burrito with no meat! I think they feel sorry for this meatless burrito so they load it with all the other stuff!! 

Other than that I have no complaints...it's always fresh. It's still tastes good and the service is OK. Nothing to rave about.
