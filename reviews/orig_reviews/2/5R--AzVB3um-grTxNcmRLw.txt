The good: Fire-grilled chicken and steak, queso

The bad: everything else. The prices are higher than average for the whole "burrito assembly line" theme, and the salsa absolutely sucks, and by sucks I mean it literally made me want to vomit. The tortillas are so thick that the food just seems dry and bland. Overall pretty disappointing...
