I will confess that I did not have the Taco's which might have been my mistake. Don't bother with the Chips and Bland Salsa for 4 bucks. The Pork Green Chili Mac n Cheese  was just OK.  If it is Happy Hour and Cocktails you want then this might be your place. Just left me wanting......and feeling like it was just OK.  Nice looking place and very nice staff.
