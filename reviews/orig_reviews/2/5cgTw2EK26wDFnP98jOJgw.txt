Good tasting food I agree so it deserves better than the worst rating

Here's why I will never go there again:
Too crowded
The place is too small, I ran into several people and there is no room to walk even outside in seating area. We went there at 5:00 so only waited for 1 customer in front of me.
No air condition swamp coolers instead
Rabid flies especially outside
Seriously smokey from the cooking
Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red
When grabbing a tray to place food on it my hand came in contact with something sticky
There was so much going on in the kitchen I'm not sure what I saw but there was blood. I'm pretty sure on the floor.
My girlfriend got sick a couple hrs after eating

I have been to Tijuana 5xs and this place is just as dirty
But dirty in a bad way

The health department may send them back
