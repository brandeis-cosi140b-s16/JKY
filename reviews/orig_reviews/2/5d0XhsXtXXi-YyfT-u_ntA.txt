This place looks cool on the inside. Their chips and salsa are amazing. The coke tasted really good. I was shocked at their prices for the tacos. Almost $4 for a regular size taco. SMH. It's a ripoff. And I had the chicken enchilada which tasted like the ones  you buy from the store and heat up in the microwave. You are better off going elsewhere. I will never come back here. I honestly don't know how people can say it's great.
