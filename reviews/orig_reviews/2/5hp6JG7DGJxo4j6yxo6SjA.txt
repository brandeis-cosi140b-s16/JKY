If you want to sit on the patio at a meat-market, have we found the place.  if you are looking for good food with your beverage, it may not really be the place to go...  not horrible but nothing to go out of your way for.   It does have the "beach vibe" somewhat, but really there are much better places for this 40 yearold to go.
