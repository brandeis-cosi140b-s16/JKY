Not a bad place, but really pricey (even for an airport). I had a margarita and a shrimp taco plate with about 1/4 cup of rice and 1/4 cup of black beans. The shrimp tacos were ok, with melted cheese and a little bit of cabbage. But they definitely left me wanting something. The margarita was good, but not very strong for the price I paid. I would have probably rathered have a glass of wine or a beer. Not a bad place to have a meal, but not great either.
