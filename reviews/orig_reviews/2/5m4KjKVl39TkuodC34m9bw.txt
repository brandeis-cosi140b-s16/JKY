We should have listened to the more negative reviews here on the place.  The food was indeed greasy.  We ordered their version of chili relleno and it was the most bizarre way to make it.  One top of three pieces of inadequately spicy chilies was this gigantic eggwhite puff and the plate otherwise was coated with cheese.  The eggwhite did not really complement the chilies.  Would not order this again.   My wife's order of taco was also filled with too much cheese.  We are from Tucson, and this place is sub par compare to the Mexican restaurants we have down in the old pueblo.
