Firstly I must mention to you that my friends and I, we like trying new cuisines & flavours, we go out for food at least 4 times a month and we usually don't pay over 40 per person. I must also declare to you that we don't have strange willing on food. 

Not impressive at ALL! Cute place, its beautiful ... Food and service-not so much! They are definitely proud of their mediocre food, judging by the over inflated prices and small portions....VERY small portions for the price.

Service was on point to come take our order but Jose our server didn't offer or suggested anything from the menu...HE JUST  TOOK OUR ORDER ,,, It was fairly busy, but not that busy! This place probably falls apart when it's really crowded, I imagine. 
Jose's assistant (busser) messed up several times. I would not recommend this place...maybe for the drinks?!
