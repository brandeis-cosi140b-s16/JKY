Food here is really good! I tried their enchiladas suizas, one of the best I've had. Bacon guacamole was delicious. 

Cons: I would rate this place a 5 star however, service was horrible. We were waiting for 2 other guests and they did sit is down where we waited for 15-20 min, no one offered us any waters or a drink. Our waiter must have had a bad day. He was rude and not helpful. He brought us the wrong tacos which is ok, easy fix right? WRONG...took him another 20 min to bring ONE taco. He forgot a juice order for a baby. No apology he said, "do you still want it?" When we are leaving? Horrible service bur I am willing to give this place another try.

Hint: When someone asks a question about your menu please be courteous. Asian/Mexican is a new thing for some people.
