We have been here numerous times over the years and the food and service have always been excellent. Over the last few months, however, we have noticed a decline. Servers who had been there a long time are gone - replaced by some very incompetent ones. The food does not seem to be as fresh as it used to be. The famous corn bread is dry anymore. There always were highly visible managers wandering around but haven't seen them in a while, even when we were there on a recent Saturday night. On that visit I think the server started several hours prior to our arriving. He did not know the menu and service was painfully slow. All we wanted to do was get out of there. Our son's hamburger was not cooked as requested and the dressing on my Caesar salad was too spicy to eat. Shame on the server for not giving me a warning.

This restaurant had a lot going for it especially with it's happy hour anywhere in the restaurant and was always crowded. I hope they get things turned around before it is too late. 

Yesterday the local newspaper ran an article that this chain had filed bankruptcy.
