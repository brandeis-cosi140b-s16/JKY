The service was ok - fast and no issues - can't say the same for the people around us who had a train wreck of a server who screwed up every dish at every table.  The food was just okay as well.  I had the carne asada and my wife had the stuffed poblano.  It seemed like the food came out very very quickly but was not hot (but the plates were for some reason) made it seem like they just flopped already prepared food down on hot plates and threw it out of the kitchen.  The seasoning on the steak was nice and I really loved the charred jalapeno.  

The salsas - especially the warm salsa was very good but the chips were a bit mealy I did not like their texture.  The poblano pepper was stuffed with about 3 shrimp and the seeds and glans of the pepper were left in which is odd.  The steak was small but adequate.

Over priced for the amount of food you get.  While I didn't hate the place it struck me as someplace I can easily forget and had no real draw on me that makes me want to come back.  Not big on paying over $70 for a fast meal with average flavors.
