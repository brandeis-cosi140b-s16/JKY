We ate here for lunch with friends who were visiting from out of town last week. They had a decent (for the strip) lunch special which was various entrees for $9.95 with optional $5 margaritas.

Everyone except me opted for the special.... sadly, there were no veggie or fish options on the special menu, which meant that my food and drink came out to a whopping $29.

My shrimp tacos were pretty forgettable, I barely touched my beans and rice, and you have to pay for chips and salsa. Lame.

I'm not normally a cheapskate, I swear, but for mediocre food at lunchtime? No thanks. Instead of bang for my buck, Yolo provided a whimper.

You only live once... so go eat somewhere else.
