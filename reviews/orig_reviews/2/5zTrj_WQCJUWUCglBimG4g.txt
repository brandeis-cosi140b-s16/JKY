I've never been to a marketplace that transforms into a party grounds at night. Very very clean area, very very difficult parking lot parking on a friday night. As soon as the 'after-hours' is in effect, the place requires you to wear a wrist band for 21+. Surrounding areas has Dave & Busters across & a plethora of bars & pseudo cantina's around the marketplace. Best bet is to bar hop when finding a place to chill with your friends...this shall be explored a little later.

Please refer to that corny movie Coyote Ugly to get a true feel of the place. That is all.
