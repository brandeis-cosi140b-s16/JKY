the chile rellenos were actually ok but how the heck do you eff up rice and beans! it was bleh nothing special and definitely not worth $12 for my meal. the service was good the server was very sweet. the seating was ridiculous though it was a monday night not many people were there so i dont understand why we were squished in a middle table with both our kids. i will never be eating there again
