Man, this place is not on the strip but you wouldn't know it looking at the prices. 3 baby tacos for $16.mmmm the smell of my money leaving is fantastic. Overpriced food and mediocre service. Rice was bland and watery and chips tasted like they were out of a bag. Fajitas weren't terrible I guess, but the steak was very poor quality. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place.
