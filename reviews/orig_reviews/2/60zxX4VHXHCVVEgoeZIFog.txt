This place is a matter of taste.  I see that a lot of people really like it but i prefer more traditional mexican food.  It would be nice to find an upscale place that actually served normal food.  Seems only dive places have regular mexican food.  So, this place has 'upscale' mex food.  Even given that i wasn't that impressed.  We sat near the kitchen area and that sort of made me feel uncomfortable watching them back there.  I'm not sure i want to see people making my food...Then i noticed that a lot of food sat for a long time waiting to be served.  The food itself just wasn't what I prefer.  Odd combinations and ingredients.  If you like traditional chips and salsa, forget it here.  They give you something similar in the form of fried round tortilla and some watery sauce stuff...

If you are the Newport Beach look at me crowd, you will probably like this place.
