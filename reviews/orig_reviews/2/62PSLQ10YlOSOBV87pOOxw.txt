The struggle to find decent food and service in the #phx area was among one of my biggest struggles. The bartender was a bit brash at first and I felt rushed to make a decision on food & drink within a minute or two of sitting down. I ordered the wings and a coyote margarita. The wings were ok, pretty greasy & nothing spectacular. The margarita was good. When you arrive they give you complimentary chips and salsa. Don't get excited about it, because the chips were covered in heavy seasoning and salsa was very thick, smoky & heavy with adobo. After my appetizer and feelings about the chips and salsa, I didn't trust the place to deliver a decent meal. I had dinner elsewhere.
