First of all I just want to iterate that the food at this establishment was pretty good.  Now that that's out of the way I would like the management at this place was absolutely horrible (that's the main reason for the lower score).  I visited this restaurant on Cinco De Mayo and obviously this place was packed (that's understandable).  The day prior a friend of mine called to see if there was any specials going on during the day of the visit and they told her there was $4 Margaritas and $1 Dos Equis bottles.  Awesome.  Upon arriving I was told that this wasn't true (by the manager) in a very condescending manner and that another special (advertised on a chalk board outside of the restaurant) was not in effect either.  At first the manager didn't even believe that the special was advertised on the chalk board until a friend of mine actually showed him at which point the manager said the only special was $4 margaritas.  There were other points of misinformation presented that I won't go into but suffice to say that I won't ever go back here again and not on the account of the food (which was excellent) but the management.
