Ehhh. I've had better mexican food at a tex-mex chain in the bay area. The chille relleno was bland, the tamales were dry and bland, and the carne asada taco i had tasted a little off. It was as if the carne asada was prepared hours before, and then put in a microwave to heat when i ordered it. The chips/salsa/beans they gave was pretty good though. 

A group of about 7 of us went to this place around 12p on friday and the service was less than stellar. Our waiter was kind of a moron, and he didn't seem to understand how to split checks, or write down our orders correctly. I'll stick to robertos/faustos/amigos/etc. I won't be back.
