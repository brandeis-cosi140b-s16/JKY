Finally made it to this place.  Every time I've noticed the place, it has a good sized crowd on the patios and it looks like a good time. Kind of fell short.  The Mexican food is like a tex-mex fare which really isn't what I look for in Mexican food.  In fairness, that's my preference and there's probably quite a few people who look for this speciality of the Mexican food class so just expect that kind of menu. The ceviche was pretty good though.
