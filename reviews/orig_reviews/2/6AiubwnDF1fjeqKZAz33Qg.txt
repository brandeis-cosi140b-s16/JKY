This was our first and last time here!  Service was horrendous and food mediocre at best.  We waited for a long time to get our food and it was cold!  My daughter got chicken fingers and we asked for ranch.  Got Bleu cheese which we hate!!!!  Our soft drinks not once got refilled.  I asked for the check and waited another 15 minutes to get that.  I have never left a restaurant without tipping.... tonight I did.
