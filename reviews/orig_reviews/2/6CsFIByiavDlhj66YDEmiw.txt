Went back to give it another shot (now that we had experience ordering).  I really wanted to try the bison which was out the first time.  Now the bison is only available at lunch...huh?!?!?!! 

This time was total opposite...the food was not very good but the service was really great.  I had the potato enchilada and the chicken enchilada...pieces of the chicken were almost inedible, almost like they mixed overcooked, old chicken in with new chicken that was cooked OK.  The chicken alone ruined the whole meal.

There's a slim chance I would give it another shot, but with that chicken and now bison only at lunch...probably not.
