The patio was beautiful, but that's really the only good thing I can say about this place.  Service was painfully slow.  Chips were greasy, salsa was bland....no flavor, no heat.  The guac was completly tasteless.  I had to salt it just so I could taste it.  The margaritas were just ok.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch and our bill was $68!  I really wanted to like this place, but we will not be eating here again.
