We only went there once for a couple drinks for Happy Hour. Just in town to visit family. Probably won't  be back anytime soon, but this is my impression.

The outside area cute w beach theme *duh
Tables mixture of trad & surfboard shape & stools heavy made of metal aka HEAVY! 

The outside bar has multi-level of tvs..though some hidden under bar roof hindering viewing, but still lots of tvs. We were there opening of March Madness. 

Our waitress was great. They use expeditors...another waitress was not, I mean a Bitch to her expeditor. Of course these waitresses are probably 21-23, cute skinny, the poor expeditor was same age, super nice to his tables but not the "perfect" 10 & overweight. I was so annoyed & sad & wanted to complain but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I hope the mgmt does some training with these girls, people see things that they might not think gets seen & doesn't leave a good impression.
