So this was my first time here and I left disappointed. I had the steak fajitas as well as the chili queso. The food was good  but nothing special. The worst part about the experience was our service. We went for lunch and the place was not busy at all.  It took almost 40 minutes from the time we order until the food hit our table. We asked one of the mangers for more sauce and he  said hold on let me find your server instead of offering to get it for us. On top of that it took almost 10 to 15 minutes to get our drinks. Service killed our experience which is unfortunate. Average food, poor service
