I realized that I drive by Carlsbad only about 12 times per average workday, and haven't been here in 8 years.  That's nearly 35,040 times, give or take a few.

SO...  I decided it was time to give it another try.  

Then I realized why I hadn't been back in 8 years.  

Bland food, bland food, and bland food. 

Sorry, but it's true.  

Will probably be at least another 8 years.
