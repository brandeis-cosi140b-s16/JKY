Let me start by saying, I'm not a fan of the food here.  I grew up on authentic and traditional mexican food, Macayo's is neither.  The only reason I go here, is that it is close to our workplace and my coworkers like to go here for margaritas, chips and salsa.

I just came from the Depot Cantina location in Tempe, Arizona, where I had the worst chicken fajitas I've ever eaten.  Others at my table even commented that from the moment then saw them, they didn't look that good.  I ate about a third of it.

The chicken was barely cooked and not seasoned or marinated at all.  There were more green chile's than there was chicken, and they looked like they had just been dumped from the can.  The very few onions that were on the skillet were, in fact, still crisp -- meaning not cooked at all. 

Horrible, horrible food.

Oh, and I should add -- be careful of the seating on the patio.  There are numerous lights and wires strung about the patio, which enables the many birds in the area to "pepper" the seating and tables.
