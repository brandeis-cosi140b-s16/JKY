First time we went, we had to walk out.  We didn't get service at all.  Not even a drink order.  But since we just moved to this area, we really wanted to find a great local Mexican place so we tried it again.  

I wasn't super impressed.  Actually, I wasn't at all impressed.  It was okay food.  Okay service this time.  Their menu didn't offer the Mexican style I was hoping for.  It felt ... off to me.  Can't explain it.  They seemed to cater to either a nothing special appetite or a huge appetite, but not in between.  Does that make sense?

We did like the salsa and chips.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon though.
