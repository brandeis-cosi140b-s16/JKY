I was really sad that I didn't like this place. I had heard about it recently and their taco Tuesday. I decided to take my grandparents with me when I went. First impression walking in the door was the atmosphere was very modern. Unfortunately we were awkwardly standing in the door for a good minute trying to figure out if we seat ourselves or not. Usually there is a sign or someone who immediately says something at other places I have been too. We ordered a round of the 4 dollar margaritas which were delicious! Honestly the only reason I was able to bump up the rating. The staff was pretty friendly as well. My grandpa and I got the carne asada tacos. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to food but the carne asada tacos I got were just dry and had no flavor. The sides were just as flavorless (lentils and white rice). My grandma got the pork belly tacos. I tried them and once again overcooked with conflicting flavors. Lastly we ordered another round of margaritas that never came. I would like to say I would give taco haus another chance but I don't know what I would get knowing I tried things there were well known on the menu :(.
