Although I don't care for chains, alas it served a purpose. I was looking for something on Mill where I could meet a friend for lunch, maybe sit on the patio, and have something relatively healthy  and affordable. I knew Z'Tejas has their under 550 cal menu so that's what I went for and got the ruby trout with steamed veggies and rice pilaf. The fish was somewhat overcooked but came with a decent pesto/salsa on top. My friend ordered the seafood enchiladas off the regular menu and really liked them. 
Our server was doing his best, and did well, although he was pushing the sales pitch extra thick. He had a comeback for everything trying to upsell us on alcohol, appetizers, desserts, it was just too much. I wasn't in the mood and I found it annoying.
