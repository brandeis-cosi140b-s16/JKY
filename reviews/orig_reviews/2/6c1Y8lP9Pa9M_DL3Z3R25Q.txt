Food was ok. Beer was cold. Beware of the server says "can I get you some chips and salsa while you wait for your food". It's not free like at Mexican food restaurants, but a sneaky way for the server to get an extra charge in. Also, when it's time for your check, be sure to ask around to find your server, who is ignoring you and flirting with the hostess. Avoid this place.
