I'm shocked by how many good reviews this place get's . I have been here twice, a few  years a part and the same problems exist? The main problem is the food is not very good and the service is not any better. I am form southern California were their  is great Mexican food around every corner. There three different type's of salsa are also poor. The food here is just bastardized Mexican food . Go to Mr. Lucky's and eat there you will leave happy!
