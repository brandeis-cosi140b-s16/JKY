I have lived in Chandler for probably around eight years, and I've eaten at this restaurant countless times. Much less in the recent two years. The patio is really charming which is about the nicest thing I have to say. The inside of the restaurant is SUPER NOISY. And it seems like every time I come here to eat, the prices have gone up and the food tastes worse. 
It's really too bad because this could be a real star in the downtown Chandler scene. Instead, it's a consistent disappoinment.
