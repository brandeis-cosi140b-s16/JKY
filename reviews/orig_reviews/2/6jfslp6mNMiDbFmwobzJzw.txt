I had heard great things about Barrio Cafe so decided to try it out last night.  My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant at 9pm and were told the wait was 30 minutes. It ended up being over 45 minutes and while being shown to our table, we passed at least 3 empty tables - frustrating but what can you do?

While waiting for our table we sat at the bar (in the only two chairs that they have) and ordered a couple of margaritas. The bartender prepared them lightning fast but the taste was off and unbalanced. At $12 a pop, a big disappointment.

For an appetizer, the waiter suggested the lobster quesadillas.  The 4 quesadillas arrived on small corn tortillas - each had cheese, a sweet sauce and one bite sized piece of lobster.  A little awkward to eat and at $16, just not worth it.

For entrees, we chose the "famous" cochinita pibil (pork) and the chiles en nogada - two dishes that had gotten great Yelp reviews.  The pork tasted alright but was pretty dry - the side of jus added a little more flavor and moisture, but not enough.  This dish came with the super small taco tortillas, and when we asked for a couple extra, we were told that the kitchen was closed.  The chiles en nogada was an interesting dish, but it had so much going on that all of the flavors were muddled:  roasted poblano, chicken, walnuts, apples, apricot, red sauce, almond sauce, cilantro, pomegranate seeds, cheese...  

Two hours and $100 later, we left Barrio Cafe unsatisfied and disappointed.
