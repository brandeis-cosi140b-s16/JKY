Went to Joyride tonight with my wife.  Both of us needed a fix for churros with chocolate.  We were hoping for something similar to what we had in Madrid near Plaza Mayor and Calle Toledo about a year ago.  It was nowhere near that.  We still say what we had in Madrid was more to our liking.

The churros at Joyride in Gilbert were too sugary, and therefore too sweet
The churros were missing the cinnamon...only tasted the sugar
The chocolate was too sweet.

On our drive back home to Mesa, my wife and I discussed this, and said that what we had for churros at Joyride was nothing like like Madrid.  Perhaps if we want churros like what we had in Madrid, we shall have to return to Madrid.
