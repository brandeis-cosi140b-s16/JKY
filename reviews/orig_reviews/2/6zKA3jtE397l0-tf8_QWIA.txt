I know this is blasphemy in my hood but I didn't like Barrio Cafe.  My husband and I had been trying to make it in there for a while now but everytime we go there it's packed so we opt for something less crowded.  We finally popped in during lunch; it's pretty cozy inside.  The server was rude, anything we said he acted like he had no idea what we were talking about and never cracked a smile.  I had the pollo poblano- the sauce was lacking in flavor, chicken was dry.  For the price I was expecting something better.  I didn't even like the margarita and I've never met a drink I didn't like.  Maybe the Chingona was out?
