Nothing special.  I remember when I was at the Missionary Training Center in Utah how the guys there that were from Provo used to rave about how awesome Cafe Rio is and how much they missed it.  When I moved out here and saw Cafe Rio I was pretty excited.  I waited in the insanely long line and was rushed through the cafeteria.  It was difficult to get just what I wanted because of the rushed atmosphere.

The food was average and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about either.

Overall, I was disappointed because I wanted something more authentic.
