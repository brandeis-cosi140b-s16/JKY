To be fair, a buddy recommended this and raved over this. I had to try this - first - it's in a really iffy part of town, so for me lunch was the only time I'd go here.  Tried the fried rice, bul go gi sliders, and a bul go gi burrito. For me the attempt at fusing Mexican and Korean was not a successful one. The flavour was okay but not nearly as spectacular as my buddy thought it was.  Unfortunately,  I didn't see the appeal of mixing the two types of foods together - at least on the dishes we had.  So unless you're really craving Korean and Mexican combined, you can go elsewhere to experience good food. Place also fits the surrounding neighbourhood - aka a dive more or less (which I'm used to with other Asian places but with much much better food).
