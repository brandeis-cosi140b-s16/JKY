I really don't know what happened to this place, about a year ago it really started to go down hill, I keep going here hoping it can get back to normal but it is still in decline. The beans taste like they cracked open a can. the salsas are all watered down and not tasty. The only thing they still try on is the hand made tortillas and the guacamole. 
Sad, this place was great.
