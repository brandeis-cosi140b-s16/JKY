I went over here to try the breakfast burrito's, but it appears that they don't make you a fresh burrito every time you order. I just wanted eggs and beans and cheese, the $1.99, but they were out of eggs? They weren't actually out of eggs, they were out of the tray of eggs for the burrito. They had eggs with sausage and bologna, but I don't like those meats and they appeared to have done some serious time in the pan since opening time. I prefer places that cracxk the eggs, but I suppose too many people show up here to go that route. Ended up with the two tamale special and rice for $3.50. Tamales, which were cheese and jalapeno's, were kinda dry and average quality. Doubt they were homemade. Best part of this meal for me was the Horchata, which was definetly homemade and had great hints of vanilla and cinnamon. I will also give props to tasty green and red salsa (chile?) that you can put on food or free chips. Mexican cookies are also good there, but breakfast burros were my reason for visit and that didn't cut the mustard.
