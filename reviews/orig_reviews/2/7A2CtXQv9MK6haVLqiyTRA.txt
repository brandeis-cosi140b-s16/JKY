Good Food, Small Place for Large Groups : this place is ok.. 

The Guy at Register was very Friendly :: DO NOT pick This place 
during LUNCH Rush or you May Have to SIT outside on Patio.. 
The Food was good..  a few of my Friends from Church liked 
the Place.. Restroom is ADA Compliant, 
but The sinks should be Upgrade to auto wash..
Dining area are Metal & some Chairs may not be "Fluffy Friendly" so "big" people have issues if they Try a booth.. The Place is alil bit on Small side so Large Crowds may not Fit during Busy time..
The Foutain has 2 Teas & is Coke w 10 Varieties, NO Cherry.. 
Like all Fast food you Have to Get your Order when its Called..
The good thing is the Salsa Bar for your Chips..
