Oh wow! I came here in September last year and it was delicious and the service was great, in fact it was so good we came here twice during our stay. This time around I was excited to take my friend here. Um. Talk about regret. I asked for a margarita on the rocks, no salt. When it came it had salt- not the end of the world...but it was by far the worst margarita I've ever tasted. Barf. When I told the bartender that I wasn't pleased. Well apparently neither was she. She took it back and never brought me the beer I requested in it's place. 10 minutes later a guy asked me if I needed a drink and it finally arrived. Luckily the food was pretty good or I would have most likely thrown a tantrum.

Don't go here. Ever.
