Came for a family birthday this past weekend and were seated in the Santos room.  The decor and ambiance are nice, the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no AC, just a small electric vertical fan.  The service was mediocre .  Took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once.  Of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .   
Chips tasted stale and like old oil, salsa was ok . The nachos were sent back due to flavor of oil and ordered something different .
