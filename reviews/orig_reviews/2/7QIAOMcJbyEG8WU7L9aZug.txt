We had dinner here this evening on Cinco De Maya and we were told by the
Waiter Richard who,had absolutely no.personality that the Chef/owner would
Not,appreciate celebrating this holiday and that he was surprised that she was even open! the food,was excellent, but In the past we had Julio and Cesar as our waiters and felt that this,time we were at a fast food Mexican joint. the waiter Richard seems hyper, inattentive and very disorganized. the
Food was excellent, however, be careful when your bill is,close to 200.00
For 3 people and you get lousy service. We even had put our leftovers in the
2 containers he put in front of us. Quite shocking! you had to beg for water.
I,intend on reporting this,to the Manager and/or owner especially when you
Drive 1 hour one way from our,home! Get it,together Barrio!
