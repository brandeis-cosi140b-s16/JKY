This place has pretty good reviews and I was excited to try a new-ish place in Old Town. I thought the parking situation was going to be terrible but we got lucky finding a spot not far from the place and when we walked up there was plenty of parking in front and on the side of the building. We got seated right away and I instantly love the decor and the music. For a Sunday it wasn't packed but a good crowd was in attendance. 
They have a fairly large patio and outside bar area. We sat down and about 2 minutes passed as we perused the menu that doubled as a placemat. One of the waitress walked up and asked if anyone helped us yet and explain that she wasn't our waitress and confused to where our waitress was but she would be happy to take our drink order.  We ordered drinks and chips and salsa ($2), they came out promptly while we continued to wait for our drinks. Almost halfway into our chips and salsa another waitress out of nowhere asks if we needed drinks and we gave her our order too. She walked by 3 times after asking us and never brought us anything. Finally we got our drinks 20-ish minutes. :( This place is nice but the service is not so great. Our "waitress" was nice and friendly but we never seen our original waitress. 
The chips were a bad mix of yesterday's chips and today's chips. I didn't want to waste anymore money here on food.  In short I was disappointed. 
Prolly not coming back.
