Meh. That's what I have to say about Verde. For the price and the decor, you'd think the food you'd be getting would be far better. The bar is AWESOME, the drinks are great. The food...... is not. First of all, any mexican restaurant should provide chips and salsa, not charge 2$ for it. I got an appetizer that stated it was 'cheese and peppers served with tortillas'.. What i got was what looked like pan of melted cheese with two tiny sliced pepper slivers in the middle and cold tortillas on the side... And it was 9$!! I probably won't go back for the food, but I would definitely return to the bar.
