Came here with friends and the boyfriend. Had a large group and service was pretty good. Coming from Southern California, where one can get *amazing* Mexican food, this place was meh, average. The margaritas were at least strong. We sat "outside" which was next to the obnoxious pool and club music. Better places to eat, won't be coming back.
