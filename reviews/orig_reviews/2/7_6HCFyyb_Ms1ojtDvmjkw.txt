Once we got in, which was a 45 minute wait, the atmosphere was welcoming, but the wait to get our drinks was over shadowed by the hour and 20 minutes it took to get our food. With rough service throughout, it seemed like there was never a waiter in sight when my glass just happened to be empty. Once  we finally got our food it looked better than it tasted. Very mild flavor and chilled from obviously having it sit out before serving with the rest. 

Overall all too expensive, too long of a wait, and subpar "food."
