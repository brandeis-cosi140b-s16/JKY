This place is an all around OK all american mexican restaurant. I would not consider this traditional cuisine from Mexico at all. Everything we ordered was very bland and not seasoned AT ALL. I had the steak chimichanga, and had to salt the whole thing, including the refried beans, which had zero flavor. We had the queso fundido with chorizo as an appetizer, and it was hands down the best dish of the night, but very small in portion. The place is very overpriced for the food that you get. Both of us agreed at the end of the meal that we would've been better off at Roberto's or even Chipotle.
