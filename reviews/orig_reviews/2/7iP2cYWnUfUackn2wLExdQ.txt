style:substance ratio here is not what I prefer.  food is pretty average and overpriced - they try hard on the presentation, but it just doesn't have a ton of flavor.  guac was thoroughly mediocre, as were white bean puree.  skirt steak tacos were bad - meat just tough and flavorless.

the space is really great, but there is so much great mexican in phoenix it is hard to justify coming just for the vibe, and it feels like it shouldn't be hard for management to improve the food.
