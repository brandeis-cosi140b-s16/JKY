Saturday night was our first visit to this establishment. When we asked for chips and salsa for our table of four we were informed that there would be a charge. this is the first Mexican restaurant I've ever been in from San Francisco down to the Baja that charged for a simple basket of tortilla chips and salsa. we were shocked. That was the beginning of a very mediocre meal. the ceviche came in a tiny bowl with a few tiny shrimp. it was a very disappointing visit. with so many other excellent Mexican restaurants within a 3 mile radius we will not be going there again.
