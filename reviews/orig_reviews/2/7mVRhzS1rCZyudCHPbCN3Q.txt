Very disappointed with my last meal at this LV Wahoo... I have been a big fan of Wahoo for several years and frequent the restaurants in LA, Newport and Encinitas... This Wahoo does not maintain the standards set in SoCal... Its standards have been slipping since it opened... Their salsa is not fresh (looks like it came out of a jar)... The fish is dry... They skimp on rice and beans... Their tofu is mushy and has no flavor or texture... They charge $2 for two corn tortillas (in CA you get three for 99c)... I think they are more concerned with the bar... Selling alcohol to folks who bang away on the poker machines... Its not the cool California taco shack I love... Hate to say it but I won't be going back
