Not much to say about this place ... the ambience is hip and the service is good but unfortunately, the food is pedestrian and while there's a lot of fancy Mexican ingredient verbage on the menu, it's still pretty straight forward typical Americanized-Mexican fare.  Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tamales, combo plates etc.  I can get this kind of food in my suburban home town that tastes better and costs a lot less.  Even the highly-rated table-side guacamole was just ok ... there's just too much stuff in there.  Could all of this be smoothed over by a nice margarita?  Well, I will never know because mine was too sweet.  Overall, a disappointment.
