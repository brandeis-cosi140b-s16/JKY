Don't fall for the SUPER BURRITO OR TACO thinking your going to get more food for your buck. Instead, they fill each with so much "filler" garbage to make it look bigger! Meat, beans, cheese amounts remain the same as if you ordered a regular. Plus, CANNOT seem to completely get an order right to save their lives. Seems more often than not, something is missing from my combination dinners. I have ordered a side of supposedly "fresh" tortilla chips, and been given stale, old chips. Never mind the vagrant, homeless, beggars that meander through the restaurant, and hit you up for $ while you are trying to eat. It's too bad. I live practically right down the st., and would give them tons of business otherwise. To end on a good note, the BAKERY ROCKS! Best baklava (sp?) around! Friendly staff too!
