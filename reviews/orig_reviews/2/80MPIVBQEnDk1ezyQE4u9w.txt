Ok so this place has is pluses and minuses. To begin it is in a great location. It has an amazing view of the High Roller and the second floor has a great fireplace. They have an awesome bar and a mechanical bull. The night scene is decent for a restaraunt. 

The service however is sub par. They are slow.... Very slow. Out breakfast which composed of a scramble and burrito took 45 minutes. I can only assume or ticket was lost.  Our sever ignored is Diring out wait and did not refill our tea once. 
The scramble was good when it finally showed up, but not worth the wait. 
Lunch a few days later was better. They had a shrimp app that was very good. The taco entre was average. The steak was way over cooked and dry. 
They drinks were the highlight of the lunch. Which is to be expected I guess, after all it is a bar.
