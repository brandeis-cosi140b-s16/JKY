This place is over priced and constantly crowded with rowdy college kids trying to get OMG SO DRUNK!!! during happy  hour.  The drink specials are okay, but I personally don't think they are that good.  The "big azz" margaritas aren't spectacular or really even that big - an average margarita is probably about 12-16oz, depending on the place.  I don't want to pay $10 for shitty tequila? 

The food is average and over priced.  Their burritos are so doughy and lack the taste you can get from even Chipotle. 

From all of the big  burrito restaurants, this one needs the most work.  The decor is clever but tacky.  The servers at EVERY Mad Mex I've ever been to are rude and are just trying to get some tips out of you (which is fair, I wait tables and do the same but you can still be nice to your tables if they juts want drinks?).  The drinks are meh and the food is blah. 

Comparing this place to Kaya puts it all in perspective - but Big Burrito probably won't change anything since it brings int he college kids spending their parents money.
