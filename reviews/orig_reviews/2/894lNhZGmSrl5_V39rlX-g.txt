Overpriced and mediocre food. I am Mexican and the food was did not meet my expectations. Soup was cold and enchiladas were average at best. Service was not great which surprised me considering I was in a resort. When the bill came saw that a 20% tip was automatically added to the bill which explained why waiter didn't care. 
Needless to say I won't be coming back and I don't recommend it.
