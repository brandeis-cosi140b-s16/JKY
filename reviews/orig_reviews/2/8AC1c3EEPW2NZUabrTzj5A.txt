Dropped in on a Saturday night and ate indoors.  I understand when people say about getting a table,  but I am used to this service at Asian places.  I just flagged down the first person I saw and asked where I could sit.  There have been lots of reviews on what the restaurant looks like, so I'm going straight to the food.

We ordered the chimichangas and enchiladas.  The salsa that came with the chips was okay.  It could've used some cilantro to brighten it up.  The two entrees was nothing special.  Rice was a little dry, beans okay.  The chimi had a lot of beef in it, but the sauce was not that great.  The enchiladas were flimsy and drenched in this forgettable poblano cream sauce.

I thought the food was.. well like the rating says meh.  I wouldn't recommend anyone going there if they have a kick for Mexican food.  There are plenty of other places around that taste better.  For upscale, I'd try Spotted Donkey or Mission.  For something a little more relaxed, just take scottsdale south, and there'll be Los Sombreros on the right side.
