Mediocre at best. Everything tasted bland and precooked. I had the chicken enchiladas and my daughter had the three cheese enchiladas, and in both cases the sauces had very little flavor. Although the total bill wasn't over the top expensive, around $24 for two entrees without drinks (we had water), and they don't provide free chips and salsa--you can order them separately for $5, it was too much for the flavors (or lack of) we got. We both wished we'd just left Town Square and gone to a fast food place. It was kind of a letdown to an otherwise fun day of a movie and shopping. The decor looked like it would be a fun place, but the overall mood of the staff and customers was subdued and kind of a bummer. We won't return.
