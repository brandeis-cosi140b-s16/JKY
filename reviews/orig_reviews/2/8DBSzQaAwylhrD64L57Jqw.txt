I live in California and I have strict expectations about tacos. Barrio Queen failed to meet those expectations.

First, we were handed drink menus once we were seated. We were then told by our server that they no longer offered anything on the drink menus. Why the tease?

Their taco menu, though extensive, was overwhelming and superfluous. Our table tried some of the more exotic tacos such as the cactus and some mushroom thing. Both were next to inedible. The mushroom taco in particular was one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. The chorizo taco was good, but not $2.75-for-two-bites-good. We tried some of the other menu items and the inadequacy in flavor was only compounded by their egregious pricing.

I would not consider coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone. Go to a real taqueria instead.
