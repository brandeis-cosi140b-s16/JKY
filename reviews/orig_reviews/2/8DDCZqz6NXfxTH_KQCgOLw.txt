Casa Reyna provides a unique atmosphere for Mexican food that falls flat.

Upon entering Casa Reyna, we were quickly greeted in Spanish and escorted to a table. The basement lends itself to a dark and noisy atmosphere, a nice contrast to the hot July afternoon. The service from here petered out a bit. Despite only being moderately busy, our server seemed to have his mind elsewhere. My friend enjoyed his margarita but had a hard time getting it. I was always left with an empty water glass.

The salsa and chips appetizer is great. The salsas are diverse and extremely fresh. The chips are slightly over salted. We had the mango salsa, salsa verde, salsa, rojo, and the cilantro based house salsa. They were great. 

My entree left me disappointed. I had the carnitas tacos which were very under cooked. The meat was slimy. The refried beans were over salted to the point of being inedible. I could tell the ingredients were very fresh, which was reassuring. 

I'll go back and hope they had an off day at the grill and with the salt. This place has a ton of potential.
