This is average bland Americanized Mexican food.  I ordered cheese enchiladas with green chili sauce.  The plate arrived with an enormous amount of melted cheese on it.  I eventually found the enchiladas under all the cheese. In time I did encounter a fragment of green chili.  Overall, I felt like I could have stayed home and just put two pounds of cheese on a plate in the microwave.
