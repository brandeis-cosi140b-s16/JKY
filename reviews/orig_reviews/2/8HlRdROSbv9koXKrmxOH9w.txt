Unfortunately, this restaurant deserves the ratings that it had.  Service was spotty and the food was so-so.  Pre-meal chips were mostly stale.  Our waitress seemed frazzled and when I asked for a drink menu, she said they didn't have one because they were revamping it.  She seemed annoyed to have to explain the different kinds of margaritas available.  

Dissapointing all the way around.
