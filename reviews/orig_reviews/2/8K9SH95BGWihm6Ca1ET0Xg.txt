I was very disappointed with this place. I was so excited about the concept, but severely let down.  $5 for a COKE!!! Unreal!!  The chips and salsa was ok. a little on the pricey side.

I ate the Ten Treasure- fresh shrimp/ham/ seasonal vegetables/wide cellophane noodles/good fortune it was $17.  WOW, only 3 shrimp and 2 pieces of SMALL ham. Not impressed.

We also had the Queso Fundido melted chihuahua cheese/tequila blanco/fresh tortillas $9- not impressed with the amount of cheese I paid $9 for. 

Overall...boo, not a Vegas worthy place to eat.
