So I've come here twice, the first time was amazing but that was in 2011, it was a Saturday night so the wait was understandable, the food was amazing and the service was great, BUT I returned in March of 2013 and I will never go again. It was a long wait considering that it wasn't that busy, service was crap waitress seemed bothered at the fact that our table ordered mainly sodas and they were all flat, so we asked for something different, most of the table ended up getting water and we were still charged for the drinks. Food was alright nothing great, so my main complaint was the service. She came around twice yet the table next to us she just kept going back to. What really made me decide not to come back was the fact that we were charged gratuity even though it was only 5 of us, since when is that a big party? Never again will I go back.
