nice place, spacious, good decor. Attentive, considerate waitperson. Attractive menu - lots of choices. Complimentary chips (really good) with salsa - all of which are hot - good but spicy. Just FYI. The prices were ok, a bit high - lunch for 2 with one beer, one appetizer, tax & tip = the high side of the $40 range. There was a lot of food, enough for 3-4 more average size meals. We had the shrimp chimi app - ok although I wondered afterwards why - I should have known it would be tiny (probably canned) shrimp. Nice to find on a menu though. MH had the carne asada chimi - flavorful and large. It was ok. As for me, I really didn't like my meal size (ok, who am I kidding - it was HUGE) chicken chimichanga. I'm not an expert of Mexican food by any means but I've had this dish before. There's got to be more to it than putting bite size (not really shredded) white chicken inside - really, that's all there was, no cheese, sour cream, salsa mixed with it - it was incredibly dry. If these are your favorite, ask about this first, imo. Maybe it was just the way I got it, but I wasn't impressed. It left me with a lot of retro-prep work on the leftovers. I might go back, but I doubt it ...
