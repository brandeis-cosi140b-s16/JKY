Food is good not great but overall a good lunch. My husband got a burrito and a taco the burrito was massive lol I had three tacos and waiter asked if I wanted rice and beans I picked just beans it was good. I think the food needed a little more seasoning. horchata looked watery but it was good. They sell raspados (mex stule ice cone)  I got the mangolon it was good but too sweet .Not sure If I will be back. Its a sit down place FYI.
