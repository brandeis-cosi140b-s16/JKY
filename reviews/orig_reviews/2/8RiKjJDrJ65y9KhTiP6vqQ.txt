Three words, service, service, service and this place sucks at all three. I mean horrible. Stopped by for drinks and appetizers at the bar - only three other patrons in the whole place and it still took 15 minutes for a beer and margarita. Longer on refills. And there are 4 people just standing around. The Manager, at least that's who I think he was, lose the baseball cap and sunglasses- seriously, this isn't your living room. Owners, wake up and visit your place, this is going to go under.
