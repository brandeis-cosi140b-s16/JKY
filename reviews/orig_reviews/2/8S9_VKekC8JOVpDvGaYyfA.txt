I used to be a big fan of Pepe's Tacos over on E. Charleston. We would head over there after a night of clubbing and get some tacos to soak up the alcohol. I have tried most of their tacos and the carne asada fries and they were delish. I remmber the meat being really nice and juicy, not fatty at all. So I was excited to see that they were going to be opening another place by my house, I was looking forward to some delicious tacos! 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the tacos we ordered. We tried tacos de lengua, buche, carnitas and asada and we didn't really like them. They were not at all like I remembered them to be. The quality of the meat could've been better.

Maybe I'll return for the carne asada fries.
