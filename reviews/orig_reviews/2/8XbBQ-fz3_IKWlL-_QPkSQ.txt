Maybe Someburros was too hyped up by my co-workers, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. It was definitely not bad, but I don't understand what is so special about it.

I ordered the veggie burro, and while for the money the portions were small, it was pretty good. It came with a cup of pico de gallo that I had wished was just wrapped up inside the burro as it brought some much needed flavor. The complimentary chips were OK, and the salsa was excellent. My favorite part of my lunch was the horchata, but I do believe it was from a mix. I had a decent lunch at a good price, but I don't see myself salivating over the memory of it and craving to return. 

I'm not sure if there are actually better ingredients at play here versus Filiberto's or any number of similar local spots, and since there are places just a bit farther away, I'll probably stick to them instead. It certainly was cleaner, that's for sure.

I did notice that their speciality chicken fundido is on special every wednesday at a mere $5, and I think that might entice me to return and re-review. Maybe I just had bad luck with the menu?

Stay tuned.
