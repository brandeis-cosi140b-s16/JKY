If the review was solely about location, ambiance, and views of Vegas this would be a five star review. If the review was about quality food and value, it would be a one star review.

So we're going somewhere in between.

Let me start by saying that the views of Las Vegas from the elevated location in Henderson are amazing. Maybe some of the best you will find anywhere in town.

That's where the fun stops.

If you're looking to spend $14-$20 on entrees that are not only below average, but actually bad then this is the place for you. I've tried various entrees only to be disappointed time and time again. The chips and salsa are the best part of the meal. The rice and beans, bleh. The enchilada sauce, double bleh. Value, just an outright yuck.

I want to like this place. It seems like they have a pretty strong following throughout Vegas, but clearly the people eating here (and liking it) have never had good Mexican food. I feel sorry for them. I could find 20 restaurants in San Diego that make far better food at half the price.

Next time you're thinking of eating here do yourself a favor...don't.
