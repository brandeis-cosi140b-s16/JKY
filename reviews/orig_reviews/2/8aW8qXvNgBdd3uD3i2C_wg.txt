Ugh... what a disappointment!  
Atmosphere was a little blah in my opinion.... had a cheap feel to it.  
No lunch menu so we were force to pay dinner prices $34 including tip.
Chips were okay, but both the green and red salsas were awful!  I don't even know how to explain the flavor... no bueno!
I ordered the Chile Relleno and my girl ordered the enchilada/taco combo.  We weren't impressed with either dish.  Mediocre at best.
Everything seemed a bit over seasoned (and maybe just not seasoned well)... 

Really unfortunate because we were hoping for a good Mexican restaurant close to home :(
