The only reason this place gets two stars is because of their guacamole and cilantro rice. Otherwise-BOOOOOO!

I was seated with a table of 12 of my coworkers for a team dinner.The waiter had already served drinks to the first arrivals but when the rest of us got there it was literally about 20 minutes before he came back again. From there it was just a service nightmare. I think this guy figured that it was a party of more than 8 so his gratuity would be just automatic. After that, he phoned it in.

I asked for a veggie quesadilla-simple request-take your cheese one and add some peppers and onions. The server literally said "We won't have any veggies up any time soon other than potatoes." Most bizarre comment ever. I got an entree salad that had a few beans and tomatoes but other than that was a snooze fest.

It took about 45 minutes to get our entrees and by the time it was all said and done, the entire ordeal was nearly 3 hours long. That was from seating to the completion of the meal-and believe me, it's not because all my coworkers felt like hanging out all night.
Skip it!
