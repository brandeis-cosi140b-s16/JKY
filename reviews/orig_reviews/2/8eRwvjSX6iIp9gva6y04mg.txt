Nice outdoor patio. Fair service. Very good Margaritas if u stay away from the house margaritas. Just had the Red Snapper. Absolutely horrible! OMG. I have had so many "Pescado Enteros" before but this was just about as bad as it gets. Terrible spices. Over cooked. Just a mess. Admirable effort but please find a chef that has a clue!
