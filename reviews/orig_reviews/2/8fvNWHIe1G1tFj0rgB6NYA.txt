Los Dos was not up to par today. Green chile sauce had a strange lumpy consistency and the carne adovada was dry. The chicken in the chimichangas was tough, dry, and hard to swallow. The fire in the chile sauces was still present, but that was about all that was good. Man, even the corn chips served with the salsa were stale. What's happening? Hope this is not the start to a downward spiral for what has been such a reliably great New Mexican style restaurant for many years. Fix it guys, please.
