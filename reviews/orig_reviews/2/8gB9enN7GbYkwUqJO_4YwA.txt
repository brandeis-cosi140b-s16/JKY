I ate at Pink Taco for breakfast while staying at the Hard Rock. I ordered the "El Gringo" with wheat toast. I was horribly disappointed with the food but ranked it at two stars for friendly service and poolside scenery. 

FOOD
The bacon and eggs were fine. Nothing special. The potatoes came out cold and were under cooked (they had that crispy rawness to them). The cold potatoes were accompanied by cold, non-buttered wheat toast. And, I got cold cold butter when I asked for butter for my toast. No excuse - It's breakfast people and the restaurant wasn't even busy. 

We visited Pink Taco a second time to have drinks with friends who were eating. They had the burritos and were also underwhelmed with the food. 

SCENERY
Basically this is a great place to drink and watch people at the pool. If that's what you're looking for you're likely to be pleased.
