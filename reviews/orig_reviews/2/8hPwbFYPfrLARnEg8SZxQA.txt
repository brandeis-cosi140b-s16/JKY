Went to this place last night. It's attached to a strip club, which is a little disconcerting, but the place, once entered (through its own entrance), was fine.

It was our first time here and came on a recommendation.  Sat down and the chips and salsa was good.  I was looking forward to the meal, as usually if the salsa is good, the food is good.    In this case, they bring red and green fire roasted salsas.

I ordered the pozole.  What a disappointment: it was greasy, very salty and the chips that came with it, covered the onion and cabbage.  They didn't bring lime, so used the ones from my beer.  Tried to skim as much grease as I could into a plastic container they brought with the pozole, but it wasn't very good.  Another person ordered the milanesa torta and returned it because it was dry and over salted.  Another person in our group, ordered a shrimp bowl with brown rice, but it came with  the cilantro-llime white rice.

Won't go back.
