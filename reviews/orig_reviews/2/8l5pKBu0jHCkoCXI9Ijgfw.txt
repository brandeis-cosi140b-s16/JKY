I could go on and on but the restaurant doesn't deserve it ... here is the short and not so sweet review. 

I don't eat meat, their veggie options are an abomination. The fact that they charge $14 across the board for ALL their taco dishes (which are  4 tiny tacos) is Crazy ... how my mushroom taco is valued at the same price as the steak tacos or fish tacos is beyond me! 

And although the tacos were good, without a side of rice & beans or salad or SOMETHING I would pay at most $1.50/taco making this a $6 dish, an appetizer even! 

Their prices are way off the mark on plenty of other items ...but in the meantime Vegetarians / Vegans beware - there isn't much for us and its way overpriced!
