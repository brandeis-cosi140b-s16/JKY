Nice atmosphere. Good tequila selection. However, a "New Mexican" grill that doesn't use New Mexico chile. I'm sorry but that's just not right. There is no comparison to authentic New Mexican food when authentic ingredients are used. I was born and raised near Hatch so I know. 

The food isn't bad. It's somewhat overpriced. The staff does seem to try to hurry you thru. 

Overall a little disappointing for me. Mostly because if the big claims yet being an expensive knock-off.
