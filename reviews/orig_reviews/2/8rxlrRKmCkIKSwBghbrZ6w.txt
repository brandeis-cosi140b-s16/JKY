Ordered the Carne Asada burrito online as takeout. I have to commend them on the great phone call I received confirming my order and apologizing for their lack of having Dr Pepper. However they asked me for my second choice and couldn't remember it when I got there five minutes later to pick up my take-out order. I couldn't begin to tell you what the Carne Asada tasted like because there was so much rice in the burrito. That is pretty much all I could taste! It was absolutely ridiculous! A fair sized Burrito absolutely jampacked with so much rice that I couldn't even taste the meat. The only reason I even gave two stars was because they did include some chips to go with my burrito and some salsa which was nice of them but after charging me two dollars for a drink that was regular sized and maybe had half a drinks worth of liquid in it due to the excessive amount of ice I just can't see this as the type of value that I want to go back and spend money on for lunch.
