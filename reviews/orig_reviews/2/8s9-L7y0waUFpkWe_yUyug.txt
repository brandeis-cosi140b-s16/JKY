Hopefully this is the La Salsa next to M&M and Coke...

Right off the bat, service was lacking starting with the hostesses. I didn't expect much though considering they're primarily known for their yard long margaritas. My server approached me and he pretty much made my trip worth it. His name is Javier and he's one of the nicest servers I've ever had, in general. 

I got the Mexican Pizza and chips, salsa, and guacamole. Simple.
The chips, salsa, and guacamole were so bland. I swear they got their salsa from a can. Literally, Pace brand salsa tastes 100 times better than this stuff. 

Mexican Pizza was loaded with stuff but not anything special. I like the one at Taco Bell more. 

Dessert was a chimi-cheesecake (sp?)? Sounded good but was eh. Fried stuff is pretty hard to mess up so it wasn't terrible.

Best thing I consumed here was Coke.

The server was so nice to me though. He comped my dessert and gave me 15% off my bill. I didn't know I got a discount there (I work nearby). 

Of course, I gave him a mad tip. I was still disappointed at the terrible food.
