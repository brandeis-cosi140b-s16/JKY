I really wanted to love this place but it was not meant to be. In all honesty, I think there is just better fusion food in LA where I am from. We tried the pork belly musubi (good but would be better if the pork belly was cut into smaller pieces), the kimchi fried rice (Monta's is better), and the famous bulgogi fries. I think the fries need to be crunchier because it became soggy underneath everything. All the toppings were good but it just felt like something was missing. I would also suggest getting the kimchi on the side because that made everything soggy real quick. 

All in all, not a rave-worthy place to visit...
