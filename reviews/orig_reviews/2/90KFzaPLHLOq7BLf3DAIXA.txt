Food was not great and therefore pricy...
Drinks the same - service mediocre - did not grant the value of the Yelp offering - nice for people watching and for whatever reason still crowded.... 
I am certain you get better food and drinks somewhere else on the strip for the money you spend 
My two friends thought exactly the same...
