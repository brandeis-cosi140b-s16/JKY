Cover was $10($6 for women) to get into the place.  It was a nice set up, didn't realize you could eat there, and I don't think I would want to, it was so loud.  The attire that the bartenders and servers were wearing just seemed out of place.  Hardy meets Guns n'Roses. And the girls with the clip on bows in their hair..what's the point!  

Drinks ..not cheap and not that strong.  We went "outside" in the patio area and just got a vodka and 7up and a beer..a Coors beer, it was $14..seriously and for a Coors!  

Needless to say, I don't think Sandbar will last.
