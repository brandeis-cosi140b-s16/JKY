Okay today was just awful. Shaina?? I Felt neglected and treated differently than the other customers sitting at the same bar. It wasn't even busy for the first 30 min we were there. She seemed moody to just us, didn't offer anything else to eat or drink. Idk....very different from other times I've been there. I won't stay if she's at the bar again. Sorry.
