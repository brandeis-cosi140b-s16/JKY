Super small portions, ceviche Mixto was super bad and had an strong fish flavor. 
Chips were to greasy and have no flavor at all. Drinks were ok but food needs some more season and flavor . Service was bad only the barback was friendly . Also when you order some tacos they force you to have the same kind you cannot mix them at all .
