Lovin the bean dip! :D 

This is a nice little joint to check out if you have a big appetite. Right off the bat I can tell you the proportions are large. They'll start you off with red sauce and bean dip, which I was pleased with as the red sauce had a kick to it and it was just perfect as far as texture goes. I was more than satisfied with my order of TACOS DE PESCADO (TALAPIA/Corn Tortillas) with beans and rice. Believe me, the tacos alone will fill you up. Except the rice was not so good, bland in taste. My friend had an order of green chili enchiladas. The chicken was tender, the cheese was good, blended, and melted nicely with the dish BUT the most important part of plate- Green Sauce- was no good :( I was disappointed. Normally, green sauce is sweet and spicy- but this type of green sauce seemed sour- and ruined the enchiladas. My other friend had a red chili carne stew, that's right, I said STEW. So why did his plate come out with carne, red chilli sauce on top, ON TOP of rice? Not your traditional Mexican stew, but none the less when my friend complained, the waiters and waitress were more than happy to replace his meal. I will probably give this place another try later on because supposedly their Margaritas are pretty good :b
