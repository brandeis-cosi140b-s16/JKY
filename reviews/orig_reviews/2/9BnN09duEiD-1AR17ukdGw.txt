Nothing in my meal really stood out.  The carnitas were tender, but had absolutely no flavor and that seemed to be the theme of my meal.  Everything was rather bland and unexciting.  Service was fine, in that chain-restaurant-I'm-reading-from-a-script sort of way.
I had been told good things about these restaurants with some people claiming it was quite authentic.  When it comes to Mexican food, I have equal love for authentic and full-on cheese sauce covered American, as long as it's done well.  This wasn't either.
