Saw this on DDD and tracked it down.  Website said nothng about being closed thru March 27 - stinks that I went to the trouble of finding this place (and the location is easier to miss than you might think) only to find out that they were closed.  Looked good on TV, but it seemed a little dirty up close.  Still...wanted to give it a whirl
