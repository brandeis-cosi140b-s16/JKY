I just had lunch here with a coworker, wow not good. The portions are "sharing portions" what??? The ceviche was in a 3 oz size bowl, 6 shrimp total, the onion and tomato was chopped so small you couldn't get any out of the bowl. OH and the price is the kicker 10 bucks. My coworker had 3 chicken tacos, for 11.50,  they are on the smallest tortillas, chicken was dry and they don't double the tortilla so each one ripped before you could get a bite. I don't mind loud places but this place has the worst echo, you can't even hear the music playing. You have to pay for chips and salsa? 3 bucks for another tiny portion (definitely individual portion) I went with 2 stars just because the waitress was nice and so was the water server. DISAPPOINTED
