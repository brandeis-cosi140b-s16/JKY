WARNING:  Do not go here after 8pm!!!

I usually eat dinner around 8pm and have usually come to Chino Bandido around 830 or so.

Last week I got there around 815pm, saw a man sampling items and I wanted to try a couple.  I waited behind him at the sampling line and was repeatedly asked by the cashier if I was ready to order, I said no.  Minutes later manager Mona at the sample line told cash register "I dont know what she is waiting for?"  DUH Im behind the guy getting samples so I told her Id like a sample, she gave me a sample of the Jerk Chicken (spicy dry gross).  

I wanted to also try the machaca and carnitas but seconds after she hands me my first sample, (the man before me was offered almost everything) she asked me if I was ready to order!  She then told me "you know, we close at 9pm" while my watch said 820pm.  

It wouldnt bother me as much if this was the first time I had been there, but there are other factors:

.AGAIN it was 820pm and there was absolutely no sign anywhere saying the kitchen closed at 830pm.

.this was the 3rd time I had been there, after 8pm, and have been rushed and treated like crap.  Sorry I take a whole 5 minutes to decide what Id like to order.

FOOD (I have only tried 3 of their dishes because again I arrive 40 minutes before they close so samples are not an option)

Chinese BBQ Pork 
.Tasty some pieces are dry but the moist fatty pieces you  find are delicious.

Jade Red Chicken
.Slightly spicy version tastes like mix of orange and sweet sour chicken from Panda Express.

Quesadilla
.very cheesy and deliciously crispy.

OH and ordering is the most uncomplicated-made-complicated thing here.

2 stars since ordering and customer service is SOO ridiculously poor.  For me, while their food is good it is SO not worth going here during my dinner time because of their lack of customer service for their repeat customers. =(
