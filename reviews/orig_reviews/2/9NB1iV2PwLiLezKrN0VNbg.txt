The food was "okay". Here is why it only got 2 stars: I don't like being interrupted every single time I'm trying to answer one employee question,  by another employee (I was trying to manage two orders for myself, and a friend). There was no line, not sure why I was being hurried. It doesn't help that they understand very little English,  and was asked 5 TIMES if I wanted cheese, after telking him "one moment", as I tried to finish the first order. The other thing that upset me, was that I was not told that the 9.00 DOLLAR NACHOS did NOT include guacamole ..and was charged an additional dollar for that...even after telling them I didn't want it! Service would better better if people actually listened to the customer.
