I had super high expectations from escobars. I looked through their fb page and yelp reviews and the pictures of the food looked amazing. Sadly I was very very disappointed with the food.

Bad:
1. Food was not hot. Served to us warm as if it just been reheated.
2. Don't order the calamari. When I first took a bite I seriously thought it was a mozzarella stick. Texture was soft and Tasted like it came from a frozen box.
3. The food looked awesome but had no taste. Ordered the hanger steak.
4. The hanger steak was so chewy and hard to eat. Kinda gross.
5. The sauce that came with the steak had a weird after taste. Blah.

Good:
1. The soups were delicious!
2. Waiter was nice!
3. Drinks were okay but expensive.

I don't recommend this place and probably won't come back.
