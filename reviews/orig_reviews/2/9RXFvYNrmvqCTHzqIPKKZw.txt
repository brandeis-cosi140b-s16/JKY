The good things about this place are the location and the fact the food is decent. This restaurant is located in the Fashion Mall, right in the happening part of the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn. The enchiladas that I got were also pretty good.

The only bad things about this place are that it's pricey, and in my opinion you don't really get enough for what you're paying. I understand that the fact that it is on the strip would make it more expensive, but they could at least provide some free chips and salsa. Most other Mexican restaurants do!
