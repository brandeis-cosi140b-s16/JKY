Big Con....Cash only - ATM available but for a $3 charge. (To be fair they will take $2 off your meal to make up for it, but you still end up adding an extra $1 to your meal and honestly, it was probably the worst taco I have ever had. 

After being told their fish taco was the best I would ever have in my life I ordered one fish taco and one carne asada taco. The fish tasted like freezer fish and was literally a deep fried fish stick....and I do mean stick as in it looked like a lincon log and didn't resemble fish at all. 

Carne was bland, dry and btw.....$8.50 for two, tiny street tacos and a small drink! Not even a side of rice and beans....nothing! Far too expensive for such small portions and mediocre food.

The people were nice enough, but have major improvements to do to the menu. 
I would say they earned their 3.5 rating.
