Ok food the waiter described the restaurant as tapas style but his was just really small portions and really overpriced. Not really fusion just sold both Mexican and Chinese food.  Their chinese street sandwich was delicious but it was tiny and would not pay $9 for that. Overall the dom dom mian was ok the sweet and sour soup was not good.
