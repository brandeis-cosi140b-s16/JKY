Food tastes good, but the service is terrible!

My wife and I ate lunch here and ordered a chicken chimi a la carte and I ordered the beef and chicken enchiladas combo, which includes rice and beans.

Our food came out quickly as we were the only guests at the time. My wife's plate came with a few pieces of lettuce garnishing her plate, so I asked for more. You would have thought I asked for nuclear codes based on the look the worker gave me. He looked at me completely confused so I clarified again, "just some extra lettuce on the side".  He mumbled something about buttons and being unsure of how to help me. I ended up walking away and just giving her the extra lettuce on my plate.

My combo plate ended up being just two enchiladas, with no rice or beans. I asked where my sides were and the cashier stated she thought I only wanted a la carte. I said, "no, I wanted the combo." Again, another puzzled look from a different worker so I said forget it and went back to my table.  I can understand the mistake of missing the combo, but at least offer to make it right. 

Needless to say, with the horrid service experienced, we won't be back which is unfortunate because the food was good.
