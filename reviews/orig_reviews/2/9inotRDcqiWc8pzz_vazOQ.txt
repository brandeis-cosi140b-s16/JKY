This was on my sister's "let's try it" list. Have to admit, I perused the menu prior to coming to the restaurant. I wasn't that excited. We came during lunch, and the service was lackluster. 10-15 minutes after being seated we had no greeting from our server and one of the hostesses had to take our order. 5 minutes after that, our server appeared and said hello. 

I ordered the fish tacos, they were alright nothing to spectacular about them. I was  surprised there were no sides to the fish tacos. The food was decent, the atmosphere was ok. 

Not on my "return" list. I'd rather fly back to the Bay Area and go to Palo Alto Sol and Lulu's.
