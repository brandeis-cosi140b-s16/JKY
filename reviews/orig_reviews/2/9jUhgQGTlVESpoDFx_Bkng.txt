Four words for you: Don't. Believe. The. Hype. 

Happy hour on a Friday night seemed like a sure bet for a fun time. Guess again folks. 

Music = ear drum busting and sucky
Drinks = Margaritas overpriced and underweight
Food = Bor-ing
Service = Um, hello...is there anyone here?
Crowd = The freaks come out at night 

I'll give Loco Patron two stars for the drunken monkey antics of  the people out on the patio. At least they were entertaining.
