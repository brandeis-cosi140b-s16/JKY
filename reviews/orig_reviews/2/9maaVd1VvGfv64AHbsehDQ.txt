Went to the Cantina last night for the first time and there were highs and lows.

The good:  Arrived at 5pm and found a table on the patio to partake in our happy hour(s).  The patio is pretty nice, relaxed, first come first served, seat yourself.

The drinks were good (mojitos! margaritas!), and the guacamole and chips were great.

The "meh, 2 stars, i've experienced better":  Our server was an absentee.  I don't know what the deal was -- if it was her, the bar, being understaffed....but it took over 30 minutes for her to bring me a refill on my drink.  Almost every time. We finally had to flag down another server to ask her to bring us our checks.   

The food was ok, but the pork tacos were pretty dry.

Finally, the crowd is kind of....ugh, I don't know.  We had people come up to us asking if we were done with our table yet.  Get a life....we'll move when we move.   It was kind of like Lord of the Flies.
