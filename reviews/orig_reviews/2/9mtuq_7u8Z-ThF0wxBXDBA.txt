Note to self.  

Take Mexican off the cuisine types to have in Pittsburgh.  Nothing can ever compare to the authentic, cheap, and just plain good stuff in the Mission.  I went into the dinner & drinks with low expectations because I was excited to see friends.

The margaritas are overly sweet and syrupy, but the bartender that served them is HAUTE!

We started the dinner off with chips & guac, and the guac was definitely the blandest I've ever had missing the core elements of salt, lime, flavor.  I brought it to the waitress's attention and requested salsa to spice it up.  We incorporate the lime wedges from the margaritas and some salt, which made it edible.

For our entree, we ordered 2 rounds of tacos.  The fish was ok, batter was very flavorful, but much too heavy.  The carnitas was over cooked and dried out.  Just not good.

Service was decent, and the prices weren't bad, but I would never return.  Even for the HAUTE bartender.
