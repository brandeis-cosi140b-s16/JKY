So my husband was told by a coworker that if we're in Vegas we must check out Tacos El Gordo so we abliged. I'm sorry to say that I was not blown away by the food. In fact I was pretty shocked to find that it's a whole in the wall type of establishment in a not so nice part of town. Anyway the tacos were similarly dissapointing because I'm a carne asada lover and I did not love this carne asada. It had the taste of a backyard bbq grill, where I can taste the charcol if that makes sense?...ugh. The buche was okay the sope was overfried....the orchata was dispensed through one of those soda machines that taste nothing like orchata. I just wasnt very satisfied with my meal at all! OH the grilled onions were decent. I also didn't like the set up, it's kinda confusing. They have something that I guess is supposed to be different stations depending on what type of meat your ordering and it's not the most convenient. So if you want steak it's one station, if you want pork it's another, and another. I wasn't sure if I was supposed form a line at each or if I just slide down to the next....it's weird.
