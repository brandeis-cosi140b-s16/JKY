Tried it three times, the flavor is just not there. Go to the Mission if you want to see how great a street taco can actually taste. 

I admit the pork belly tacos had a little flavor so two stars. Very weird attitude about salsa there - i.e. they act like it is a precious commodity.

I also heard on 8/1/14 that they closed their doors.
