The chips and salsa were good.
The service is really slow. The staff are nice.
We ordered the El Molcajete (mexican fajitas), sooa de mariscas, gourmet carnitas tacos, n horchatas
The food was very salty.
The best dish was the gourmet carnitas tacos.
The rice and beans were okay.
Delicious horchata.
