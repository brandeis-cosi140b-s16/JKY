When I was finally able to go (they always close early), I was really looking forward to it, the service was very impersonal, I felt like they didn't wanted us there, maybe they wanted to close since it was already 9pm.     I saw one of the male servers continuously spank one of his female coworkers (what a chauvinistic stereotype, it's ok I can say that, I am Mexican).   The margaritas were good, the melted cheese was a bit weird it had a sweet taste to it, I got the spare ribs in green sauce, it was ok, it did come out pretty fast. I had better, go somewhere else, a place that stays open until at least 11.
