I hadn't been to Chuys in a while. Every time the wait was 45-60 minutes. No more. The place was weirdly empty even though the wait at Cowfish was more than an hour.  We were greeted by a man who said: I have no idea what to do - I'm a busboy. 

Food was ok but service was terrible. Apps and food came out at the same time. And too fast to be fresh. Our waiter was frantic and inattentive. He didn't bring water or napkins. He tried to clear the table while we were still eating. He was fast at bringing the check. He seemed like he just wanted us to get of there. He never offered coffee or dessert. The table next to us had to grab someone from the front to order dessert. 

Won't go back anytime soon - no matter how long the Cowfish wait is.
