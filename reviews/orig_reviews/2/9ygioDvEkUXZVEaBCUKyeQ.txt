Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Had the kimchi beef fried rice and barely ate any of it.  The kimchi flavor was so overpowering, I could hardly taste anything else (and it's not like I'm not used to the flavor - I'm half Asian and was raised on Asian food).  There was hardly any beef in it (trust me, I dug through the pile of rice looking for it).  That said, the portions are huge and the service was nice.  I just wish I had ordered something else.
