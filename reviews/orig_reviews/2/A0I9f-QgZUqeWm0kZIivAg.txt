Phoned in an order and it was ready and waiting at the counter when I arrived.  When I got home to unpack it I learned that I was given an order of regular nachos instead of the deluxe nachos with all the toppings and cost a few bucks more.  I was surprised that the chips did not appear to be fresh. I then tasted my enchilada and was let down, the food just really wasn't that good.  Huge let down, I was hoping to have found another go to good Mexican food place.
