I would love some "Mexican" food please!!! 

No seriously, this is was just not good. Just another fancy overpriced restaurant on the strip that serves what they think is Mexican food. 

I came here for a work lunch so alcohol was out of the question. Maybe if I had a few drinks, the food would have tasted a little better. I ordered the tortilla soup and chipotle Cesar salad. The soup itself tasted like a can of chillies blended with a can of tomatoes. I probably got about 3 table spoons of actual pieces of tortilla, chicken and beans. I couldn't even get half way before I just have up. The salad was wilted and not fresh. And I don't know about you, but I don't think Cesar dressing is supposed to be sour. A few people at my table ordered chicken enchiladas and burritos and they all agreed the chicken was a bit dry. I tried the cilantro rice and it was complete mush. The consensus at my table was that the food was just ok. Highlight of the meal was the chips and guacamole. Pretty sad I would say.
