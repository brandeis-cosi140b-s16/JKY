I went here one night with my friends and we heard advertisements about 2$ beers for guys and free drinks for girls with wristbands. We get there they physically hand us a flyer for all of the advertisements and still wouldn't give us the deal!!!! It was ridiculous, I literally had a flyer with the info in my hand! Then all the bar tenders were rude and also this place won't decide If it's a lame night club or a food/bar joint. Get real. First time and never again.the only thing good was Garrett sliger unfortunately he know longers works for the restuarnt
