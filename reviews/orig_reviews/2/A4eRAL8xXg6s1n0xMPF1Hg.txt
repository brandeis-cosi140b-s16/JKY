Terrible, pathetic service! Food it good though. It took three tries to get the guacamole that I ordered, my frozen margarita tasted like lime mixed with frozen orange juice concentrate. The replacement tastes like it has a 1/2shot in a 22oz drink. Our chips never showed up and our waitress only asked us how we were doing after we had to speak to the manager. This was close to the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. If the food wasn't so good I would have never though to come back.. Never got napkins, never got water, never got Chips, never got a buzz. But the manager assured me there was alcohol in there because they batch make it the mixes in the morning...whatever that means.
