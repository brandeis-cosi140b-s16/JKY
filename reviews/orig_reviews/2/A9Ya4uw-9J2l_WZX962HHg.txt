So, my husband ventured out last night to pick up dinner for the family.  I told him I was craving mexican and so he decided to come home with Cafe Rio.

He got one barbacoa burrito, one chicken burrito and a side order of chips (which he put some cheese sauce on).  These were the biggest burritos I have ever seen... not sure exactly what he paid for them but they weren't the best I've had.  The barbacoa was really sweet like they simmered it in sugar and the chicken was really dry.  If it wasn't for the guacamole and the salsa I put on it there was no way I could have eaten it.

It was good and maybe we will go back, but we will definetly try something else next time.
