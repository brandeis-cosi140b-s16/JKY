Loud, annoying and uncomfortable.

Perhaps, I am a Californian at heart, but the several times I was here, it was not the greatest experience.  Tex-mex food.  The menus are trying too hard to be witty.  My friend wanted to order the Area 51 burrito, but it was a joke item and was embarrassed when the server said it did not really exist.

Not a place to have a conversation, but hey come here for a couple of drinks down in the Oakland area.
