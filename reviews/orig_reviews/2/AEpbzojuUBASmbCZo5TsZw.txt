I had never heard of this place but was meeting a couple friends that were in town for a convention. The pork rinds were no better than those you purchase for .99 at the gas station and my Bombay Tonic tasted very watered down. The music was a little crazy, each song was repeated about 3 times in a row.  I ordered chicken fajitas with corn tortillas and had to wait for several minutes after everyone at my table received their orders before they remembered I had ordered corn instead of flour tortillas. Once they arrived, I was surprised on how small they were.  I was impressed with the portions though.  I was only able to eat 2 before I needed a to go box and server actually took my plate to the back to box it up and brought me a bag.  The following day I decided to eat my left overs and realized that they had stuffed my corn tortillas into a tiny circular dish and all were tore in the center so no longer were useful.  I was also surprised to find the server only boxed approximately 1/4 of my plate in the to-go box.  I think that when someone pays for an entire meal and cannot finish it, the server should give all of it to you. I was not really impressed at all.
