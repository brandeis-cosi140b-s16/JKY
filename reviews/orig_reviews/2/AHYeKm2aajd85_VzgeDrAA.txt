The only thing Kalila likes here is the VEGGIE TACOS and the rice.

The rebel special is a great deal. It's only $5 for FOUR tacos, two sides and a drink.

Not exactly sure what is in the veggie tacos, but there is definitely green and yellow bell peppers, onions and some other veggies. It's covered in a yellow sauce that takes forever to get off your fingers after eating and some black seeds (I have no idea what they are).

Kalila didn't originally like the rice, but it grew on her. It gets pretty addicting after a few bites.
The other side we had was chips and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo. All chunks. Chips were homemade.

We only come here when we want veggie tacos. Perfect for not eating meat during Lenten Fridays!
