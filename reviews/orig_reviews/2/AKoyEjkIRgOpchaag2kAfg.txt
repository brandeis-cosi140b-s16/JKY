Based on other reviews, I may have had higher expectations than I should, but this place is really not very good. Had the carne asada burrito with rice and beans. Carne asada had almost no flavor or char (appeared to be boiled? Yuck!) Which they attempted to mask with guac and pico. Beans and rice were sub par and bland as well. Meal came out in the time it took to fill my soda, which isn't a good sign. 

If you want good, quality, flavorful Mexican food look elsewhere. The only real positive is that it was fast and inexpensive. I won't be coming back.
