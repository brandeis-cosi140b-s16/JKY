Wow. What a sad situation. We came here once before and had such great service. Sadly we chose to come back today and decided to sit at the bar. 3 pm on a Saturday and there are a total of 8 people at the bar.   Service is atrocious. The woman behind the bar could not be bothered to serve the clients as she was too busy ignoring us and cleaning glassware. We ordered the guacamole at $9 a pop and had to ask repeatedly for chips. Our beer glasses were empty for 10 minutes and she finally asked if we wanted more beer. By now I only want water and my damn check. Too bad cuz I thought I found a great local place to go. Better keep looking.
