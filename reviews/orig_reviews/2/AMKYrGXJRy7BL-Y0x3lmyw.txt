The long line moved slow and when I noticed that the employees had no sense of urgency, moving at a snail's pace I understood why.  I got a salad which was okay, my husband the burrito and my son a tiny kids meal which still left him hungry. The drink station was cool but pricey.  The employees were not friendly, never said thank you or smiled.  They acted like they were doing US a favor.  

Next time we will just stick with Chipotle.
