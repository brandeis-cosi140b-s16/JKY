I can't say I have much experience with Cuban cuisine but I was very disappointing with this place after seeing all the positive reviews. Nothing was particularly good. The tortilla chips with our appetizer were those round yellow bargain shelf grocery store/school cafeteria chips, surprising to see in a nice-looking restaurant. The pork was dry and flavorless. I took most of it home and added sauce and made it taste a little better the next day.

I will say this place has a nice atmosphere and featured some live music while we were there. The service was good, too. But for me, food is 75% of the rating.
