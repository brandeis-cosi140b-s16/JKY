I had to be in the area for an evening appointment and had some time, so I looked in the area for restaurants and found the Barrio. The location was in a little rough of an area - I missed it the first time and had to go around the block. It's a couple of spots in an old dumpy strip mall and very small. The parking was deplorable. You have to go around the back to an alley, and spots are cramped and just asking for fender bumps and door scratches. The parking is probably about half the capacity - I'm not sure how they can meet the zoning rules.
  Inside the decor was nice - some interesting furniture pieces. It was very crowded - a good sign. I was lucky didn't have to wait long for a table. It seemed like a lot of folks were hanging out - I was there for more than an hour, and didn't see many tables change over.
  The menu is unique - but makes it hard to know what you're ordering. I ordered T A C O S  de  C O C H I N I T A   P I B I L - slow roasted pork - the pork was unimpressive. It was a bit mealy - like a lower quality roast. There was a decent amount - no sides. The sauce was interesting and different. I didn't really care for the flavor, but that was my taste. It was a distinctive flavor that I'm sure others would like. I had the choice of fries or a salad - which seemed odd. The salad was the highlight for me. It was a delicious blend of romaine with dried cranberries and queso. The menu was eclectic enough that I would like to try some other items.
  The service was ok. The waiter was efficient if not overly helpful. I wasn't ordering a lot or an expensive meal, so it seemed like there wasn't any interest on his part.
  The food was pricey for what it was. The quantity was pretty reasonable - I would have preferred one or two less tacos and some sides for a little variety. I might go back, but would need a compelling reason to go to that location and at that price.
