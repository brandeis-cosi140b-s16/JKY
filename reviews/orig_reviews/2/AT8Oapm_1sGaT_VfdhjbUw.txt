This place was insanely average and way overpriced. Not much more to say. 

Im tempted to keep typing just because Yelp awards longer reviews but all you need to know is in that first sentence. Go somewhere else unless you absolutely need Mexican cuisine to live. I imagine there are some good hole in the wall Mexican places a short walk away.
