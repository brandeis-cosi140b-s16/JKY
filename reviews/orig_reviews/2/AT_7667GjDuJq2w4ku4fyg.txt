This place is nothing to get too excited about. I had the steak taco and the flavor was just ok.  I have to say, the service here wowed me more than the food. I placed the order online (super easy) and it was ready exactly when I requested. Overall, I'll probably stick to Chipotle for a quick  Mexican fix.
