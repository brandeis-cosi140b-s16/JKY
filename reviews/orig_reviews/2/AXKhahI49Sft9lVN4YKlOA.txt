This place isn't all that. Meh! I tried the asada, chorizo and pastor. Ive had better, way better. I think having to stand in the different lines is stupid. Why can't you just order what you want and they get it for you? The taquero in the pastor line was very rude and a bit of a bonehead. Dont think I'll ever come back here again. Not worth the drive from the strip. Go somewhere else!
