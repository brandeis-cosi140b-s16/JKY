My boyfriend and I found ourselves at this restaurant by chance. The atmosphere was lively and a very good guitarist played among the tables. The building is older, but interesting. I liked the layout, with the pond in middle and kids feeding the ducks. Service was friendly and average.

Based on recommendations found here, I ordered the pollo fundido and was not disappointed. It was very good.

After all of this, are you wondering why the two-star review? It comes down to one thing. SALSA. It's not hard to make a simple, pleasant salsa. One can be a self-declared talent-less cook and still manage to produce a palatable salsa. With my salsa-addicted boyfriend and our history of always polishing off the salsa and chips provided with the meal, we left our table with three salsas remaining.

One was a tomatillo salsa.  It was probably the best of the three,...after adding a substantial amount of salt to it. (We were told the secret ingredient of this was iceberg lettuce.)

The second salsa had a weird underlying flavor to it, almost like paprika. It was just funky. (The secret ingredient of this concoction was dried pepper, which probably explains the smokey flavor it had.)

The third salsa was more like a mushy tomato sauce. It would be best paired with mozzarella sticks.  (This salsa, the house salsa, was made with canned tomatoes and garlic. That's it. Seriously?) 

For a Mexican restaurant that puts out good food, salsa of this poor quality is inexcusable and a little shocking.
