I love Mexican food, and I wanted to like Las Velas so much, but in the end I'm just underwhelmed.  I've been there twice (once pre and once post fire) and my experiences were almost the same.  Food is average and slightly disappointing.  It just didn't seem like there was any creativity or special about any of their dishes.  

Bottom line, I'm still looking for the great Mexican Restaurant in Pittsburgh.
