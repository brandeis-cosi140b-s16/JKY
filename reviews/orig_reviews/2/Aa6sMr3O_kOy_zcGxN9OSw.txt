If you are in the mood for fresh delicious Mexican food and great service run the other way!!!! If you are in the mood for store bought stale tortillas, margaritas full
Of sugary sour mix and messy service this is your place! It's overpriced and the equivalent of airport food. My party and I were so disappointed. A few dishes we ordered never even made it to the table. The service matches the food quality. It's scary. This place is bad bad bad.
