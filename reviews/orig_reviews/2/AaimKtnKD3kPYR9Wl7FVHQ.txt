I gave this place 2 stars here's why service WAS HORRIBLE. It was our first time here and I can say I'm not impressed. Our waiter was not personable at all. He didn't great us with a smile or even tell us his name. I felt like he was miserable and did not want to be here. We also felt very rushed when ordering. We asked about the chile because there is a "caution"on the menu pertaining to how hot it is. All he said was "what ever you prefer" didn't even mention the taste or how spicy they were.... Once we order we never saw him again. He walked by us Numerous times never asked us how anything was or even if we needed anything (which we did) We had to ask two other servers for drinks and our check. The place was nice very different decor. Just a bunch of random pictures all over and stuff. We sat in the bar area so I can't speak for the dinning area. The food was good but I wasn't blown away by it. The portions are huge here. Which is something I don't really like personally. I feel like it's just a waste of food (and also part of the reason why Americans are so obese. Definitely no reason for any place to give huge portion sizes... Sorry about my personal note hehe) it's also very dark in this place when I walked out side I was blinded by the sun like. (Bugs life: "don't look into the light!!!"). The orange juice was my favorite part about this place. It was great fresh squeezed! Anyways we won't be going back to this place.
