Ok this is not impressive, while the food is ok the service is horrible, this is Sunday night and the restaurant is busy, took 25 min just to get seated.

Looking around there is not enough service staff, couple of waitresses actually hustling and trying but a few others just strolling around with any sense of urgency.

As the food got to the table you are just over the whole thing, now again the food is not bad but over priced which is ok certainly that's not the first place but with expensive food comes great service to me and that is just not the case.

Not worth going here.
