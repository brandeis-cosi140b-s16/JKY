I have been driving by this place for a year.  I love dives and authentic Mexican food.  I was terribly disappointed.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and a taco.  The burrito was big and had great value.  However, it was dry and the steak was tough and chewy.  The taco was not good value for $1.95.  It was no no bigger or better than the  69 cent basic taco that you get at fast food places.  Sorry yelpers but my review does not agree with the majority.
