The outdoor area is seat yourself. I did and waited forever for a greeting and a glass of water. I ordered the chicken and cheese burrito and then ordered the cheese dip with chips. Needless to say, they both left much to be desired. Nothing was fresh about this meal. The cheese dip was flavorless and the burrito was something I make at home-- mine is better. The beans were crusty and dry and the chicken inside the burrito tasted like it was out of a can. Service was slow even though they were not packed and there were no specials offered at any point. The cheese dip and chips cost $10.50. It was very disappointing. Will not return.
