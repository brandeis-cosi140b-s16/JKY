I have lived in Phoenix/ Scottsdale for 33 years. This used to be avoid restaurant but the last two visits have been disappointing. This week not only did the 2 of us wait over an hour to get our food, but the food is only marginal. Very basic, bland flavor on the chimichanga, but soggy, how can you ruin a quesadilla ? This one was over cooked and the cheese was hard. I guess this is my last visit. I know that Nando's is out in the East valley and a drive but their food is so superior. 

I noticed that this has become a snowbird hang out. I guess they do not know good Mexican food. 

The chips and salsa...pass on that, stale chips and no flavor salsa.
