i drove from avondale expecting something worthy of such a long drive. salsa bar was very good. the chips were nothing above normal as was the food. the worst part of it all is while i was midway thru a taco a bug scattered across my plate. when i went to go pay i mentioned this to the waitress which only shrugged and took my bill. didnt apologize or even seem remotely interested in my complaint. i wasnt expecting a free meal by any means but a sign of concern was expected.
