Okaaay, so my fiance really wanted to go here for dinner last night, but I was weary, sounded really greasy. So I talked him into something else, then  again today, pleeeease, Chino Tori? Fine, I gave in. 

I'll give this to Chino, it's an original idea. Mexican, Jamaican and Chinese fusion, but it's not executed well at all. Like someone said before, the whole ordering process, especially for first timers needs to somehow be streamlined, it's ridiculous, like they need a help desk or something. But part of the initiation is you get to taste test before ordering, so I guess that is good.  The location is waaaay back in this weird building, and weird weird, not weird good. There is also way too much space inside, gives it a very cafeteria feel. 

Now to the food...the jerk chicken Chris ordered was pretty good, as was his sweet n sour chicken and rice. My lunch on the other hand was a disaster, so I ate half of his. I ordered the emerald chicken, then I get the choice of being served over rice or in a quesidilla, I chose the dilla. Well, that was the wrong choice. See the pic I posted, my quesidilla was glistening!! We could not eat it. It was in a pool of grease. Gross.

So Chino, I have some ideas for ya. Get it together, this is a cool concept, but learn how to make your food consistently good, maybe toasting the quesidillas instead of frying? Hire a professional to look at your menu and give suggestions for prep. Second, the ordering system needs attention, it's confusing. Thirdly, the space is weird and desolate, some interior changes would be a good thing.
