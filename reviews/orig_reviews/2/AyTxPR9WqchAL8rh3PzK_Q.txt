Let me start of saying why they only get 2 stars. Nothing to do with the taste of the food but for the face that they can never get my order right. Never!! Each time I get the fish taco but don't want the slaw. I even point to the picture and show them which one I want and every time I get it served with the slaw. The food is great but they just can't get the order right.
