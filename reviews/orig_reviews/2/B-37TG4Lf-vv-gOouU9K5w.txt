Good Mexican food for people who like mediocre Mexican food. 

This place smells so freaking good! Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great. 

I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table. 

Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba. This is me dropping stars because of superior, accessible places in the same area at the same price point. 

At the end, I washed it all down with a freshly-made horchata...but halfway through, I was dealing with coarse granules of sugar! Gross! 

I'm in no hurry to come back.
