Building is pretty, an old church, but unhappy with the experience.  They were out of the only item on the menu my husband wanted to eat.  When asked about whether the Asian pork happy hour taco specials were greasy, were told no, but they are deep fried! Didn't have much taste and the pork was hard and chewy. The server said you could get the corn side for $1.50 when you ordered 3 tacos, but guess it didn't count on the happy hour tacos (which he clarified after the fact - when the bill came) Had to order 3 tacos off regular menu to get that price, so we ended up with 9, plus the 3 coffee bean braised beef.. Slow on refill of salsa, beer, and  water refills near end of meal.  Wasn't asked about a dessert.  We were celebrating a birthday and no mention. Won't be back.  Was so looking forward to it!
