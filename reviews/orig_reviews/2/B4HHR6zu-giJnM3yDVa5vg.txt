Not good mexican food...authentic? Please! I had the mole enchilada...it was okay. Chips and salsa.....meh...weak salsa. It is pricey....and it really shouldn't be for the portion you get! 
The only good thing? The service was excellent but they just need fire the chef and get a good mexican crew back there.
