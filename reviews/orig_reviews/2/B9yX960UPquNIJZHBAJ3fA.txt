Bakersfield has fantastic food and ambiance but the waitstaff is clearly not well trained. On two occasions this has been our experience. The host did not want to seat us at a table that was high chair friendly because he told us those were reserved for large groups. It was 2:00 in the afternoon and there was no one in the restaurant, all the tables were open. After finally being able to sit at the table we asked for we had a very rude waitress. With all of the great places to eat in Charlotte I would go somewhere else.
