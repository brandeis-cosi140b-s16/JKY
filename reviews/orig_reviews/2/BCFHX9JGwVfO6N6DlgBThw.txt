Is there a secret door I don't know about? My expectations were way to high I guess. Definitely won't make a special trip back over and probably wouldn't stop back by even if I was hungry and close. Pickled red onions in a burrito doesn't constitute next level Mexican cuisine. I think the high rating is for environmental authenticity.
