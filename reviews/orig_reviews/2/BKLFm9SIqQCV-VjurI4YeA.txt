Tonight i went to El hefe for tacos. That turned into me using the bathroom. Which turned into me using the air hand dryer and having to touch the bathroom door handle in order to exit. I attempted to speak with the general manager to at least ask for paper towel to be put in the ladies restroom. The security guard then decided to butt in and say "theres toilet paper, cant you use that?" I emphasized that that isn't the point. 

The general manager not only ignored my request but also rolled his eyes as if what i was requesting was going to come out of his paycheck. I have eaten and patronized EL Hefe several times. But i probably wont be back.
