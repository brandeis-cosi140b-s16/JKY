We came here after seeing the place on Triple D, and after hearing a few great reviews from some friends.  I tried what most yelpers seemed to be recommending.. the jade chicken quesidilla, and the jerk chicken rice.  The food to me tasted like what I would get if I were to mix taco bell and panda express together.  Not bad enough to not eat, but nothing I'll ever need again.  I think in theory the idea works, but the quality of the ingredients seemed to be lacking.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day or at a bad time, but we most likely won't be going back any time soon, especially with so many better options in the valley.
