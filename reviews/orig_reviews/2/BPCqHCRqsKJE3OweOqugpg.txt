I used to love this place but  this time I was very disappointed. The grilled vegetable platter  was just O.K. and way overpriced. The complimentary cornbread that is a big hit was not baked although it was 4:30 in the afternoon. I was hoping to eat it with the veggie platter. .
The waiter offered to put it in a box when it was ready for us to take with us which was thoughtful but we were going to a play and couldn't have taken it even if we wanted to. Worst part of all is the cornbread tasted "flat". and came with some spread which was not butter. I asked for butter and got a huge dish of margarine.
Ended up leaving half the cornbread and ALL the margarine
My husband had a tasteless tortilla soup. The margherita was good as was the guacamole. A bowl of soup, veggie platter, margherita and guacamole cost $32.
