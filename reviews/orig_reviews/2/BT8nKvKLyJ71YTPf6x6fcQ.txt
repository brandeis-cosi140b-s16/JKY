Being a local that frequents the Linq, I've walked by here a lot, but tonight was the first time I've been in. A friend just moved to town and wanted tacos so I thought it would be the perfect time to try it. 

I understand it's Saturday night, but this place is not a club (although people were dancing as there's a DJ), and the music was so unbelievably loud. We didn't want to sit outside because it's so hot so we just had to deal with it.  If you want a place you can sit and eat and have a conversation, this is not it. 

The service was good, but the food was pretty disappointing. My friend said his steak tacos were good, but my steak burrito was abysmal. The food came out really fast (which worries me), and mine wasn't exactly hot. The steak, which was sparse, had quite a bit of fat, and the quality of it as a whole was lacking. And you can't order just a side of guacamole, at least I didn't see it under 'sides'. 

I agree with the other reviewers that the bull riding is incredibly entertaining, as it is anywhere, so there's that. 

Kinda wish I had just taken him to Roberto's haha
