Don't understand the rave reviews at least not for the fusion fish tacos. They are pretty bland with no pop for a place that has Mexico and Korean flavors. Anyway the toppings were fresh which is good and their salsas were good too.  I just expected more taste in the fish and batter.  Waitress was friendly and I appreciate that.
