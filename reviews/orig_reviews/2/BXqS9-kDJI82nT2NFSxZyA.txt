We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit. 

After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs. 

Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)
