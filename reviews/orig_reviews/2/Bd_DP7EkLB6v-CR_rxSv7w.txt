I'm totally bummed to have to give such a low rating.  The guy working the counter was so friendly (extra star for him) & I had really high hopes.  I was craving tacos so my husband & I decided to try this place, we've passed it going to Dutch Bro's often & had been wanting to visit.  I ordered 1 chicken taco & 1 steak taco, he ordered 1 pork & 1 steak.  It was almost $15 for our order, which I'd usually be more than happy to pay for good tacos but not for this size & the quality of these.  The meat was so dry in my husbands pork tacos that he couldn't even eat it, the steak tacos we both got were okay, meat was dried out, decent flavor but it was just coated in guacamole, that's all we were really getting in each bite.  Chicken taco was my absolute least favorite, no flavor at all & once again, super dry, I couldn't finish it. 

I don't know if it was just an off night or what but I'm sad to say I don't think we will be coming back to find out.
