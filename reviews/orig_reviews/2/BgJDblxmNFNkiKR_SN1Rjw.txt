Flavor was delicious. Salsas are spicy. .. which i love. The two star rating is simply for value. 12 bucks for fajitas. It comes with the sizzling skillet of bell peppers onions and steak. Served with... tortillas. No lettuce or pico de gallo, no cheese, no guac, no sour cream. No rice or beans served with the burritos. (8 bucks). The burrito was the same as the fajitas but they put cabbage in with it. Compare the value to a place like fajitas off the i17.. you dont get much for the buck here. Would like to have seen more ingredients in the burrito but the add ons were ridiculous. A buck for cheese per person. Etc.. by the time you add in all the standard stuff you end up with about 12 bucks of food but get charged 18. But i will go back for happy hour some time.. half price appetizers... which is about what it should be priced at. I wanna give them more stars but the plates need some work and bulk. Chips in the basket were stale but the salsa was great.
