I know a lot of people really love this place but....I just don't get the hype.

The food is ok - I should say the meat they give you is tasty but they give you so little and 3/4 of it is the rice.  Come on!  If you are going to charge me almost $10 can you spare a bit more meat??   The jerk rice was plain tasting.  I had to add hot sauce to get a kick and the teryaki chicken was....Terrible.  I mean I could have had better at Panda and I HATE Panda!

I just can't see myself going back there for black beans, ok rice and a tablespoon of meat.
