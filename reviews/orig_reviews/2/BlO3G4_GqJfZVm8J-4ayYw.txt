I needed to grab a quick snack while I was waiting to check in at the Cosmo, so I stopped by here.  I was tempted to grab dim sum, but seeing how overpriced it is tuned me out.  Instead, I grabbed the only sandwich on the menu.  However, it ended up being a small bun compared to the price-to-quantity ratio I had expected.  Though since this is Vegas, I probably should have lowered my standards even lower.

I admire the creativity, but this is really a tourist trap, if that hasn't been said enough already.
