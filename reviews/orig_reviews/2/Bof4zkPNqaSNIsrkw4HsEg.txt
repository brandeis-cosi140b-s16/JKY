We've been long-time fans of brat haus and decided to give the new taco haus a try today for lunch. Not super packed for a Friday and easily found a nice seat on the patio. The ambiance is nice (and who doesn't like sitting outside in February). We had two servers come up to us and I think there was some confusion, but no harm done in making sure we were all set. 

My husband and I ordered the chips and salsa as a small appetizer and both felt it could have come with more chips (small cereal bowl size) for the amount of salsa verde we received (two cups). The salsa was pretty sour to both of us and not spicy. 

We both ordered a couple of street tacos for lunch. I don't think I could say I had one that was a favorite, or very memorable. The shrimp was ok, the pork belly was bland, the carne asada was probably the best out of them but nothing to write home about. 

I would say that taco haus doesn't quite compete when compared to other local taco establishments. It was a good spot close to work and I might stop in for a Taco Tuesday happy hour (for the deals alone), but I won't seek it out again any time soon.
