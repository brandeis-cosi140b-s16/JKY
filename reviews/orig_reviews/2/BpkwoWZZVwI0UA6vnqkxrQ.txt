I live close to this place and I love burritos, so I thought this place could be a Wonderful match. Instead, I'm a more die hard qdoba guy than ever. These burritos were sub par, the prices were a bit much, and service was poor. I am a big supporter of local businesses but I won't support mediocrity. I'll pay more for quality, not to stick it to the man.
