I've really put off reviewing Cafe Rio because I used to love this place. It used to be SO good. Then something happened. I've given it so many chances, thinking THIS time it will be good again. Nope. Every time I get the pork salad now, the tortilla is stale. The pork has a different flavor every time I go. The last time I went (this week) it was so spicy I stopped eating it. I'm sad to say It's just not good anymore. I give up!
