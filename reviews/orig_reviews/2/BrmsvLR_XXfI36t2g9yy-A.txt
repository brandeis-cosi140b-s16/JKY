The food is delicious but there are not a lot of choices for vegetarians. I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was tasty but TINY (it looked like a big flauta) and came with a couple waffle fries. For $6 that was a rip off. I also had the elote (they called it "eskites?") Which was pretty authentic but I wouldn't order it again, too much mayo. The decor *is* nice, and I guess that's what you pay for. The service was TERRIBLE. We walked up to the counter where one women was counting the drawer and the other woman watched and weren't even acknowledged by either of them as we stood and waited in front of them. After a while I greeted them and then the one watching politely told me they'd be with is in a minute. I get it if they are training or something but it happened again when we wanted to order desert. A new cashier just stood there pressing buttons on the register for almost 2 whole minutes. The service staff are in no hurry to help you. The old fashioned ice cream was heavenly and I would go back for desert (only).
