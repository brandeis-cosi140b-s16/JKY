Our taxi driver recommended this place on our way into Vegas to go to for a first night out. Pretty sub par food. We got there in time for the happy hour but apparently it only applied to drinks; which was buy one get one free for those big slushee drinks. Bad idea - way too sweet! Also, at happy hour you don't really get a server you just go to the bar and have to wait until a bartender is available to order anything.

We were sitting right by the doors to go to the outdoor seating and our table had a wobbly leg so we almost spilled our drinks multiple times. We were right around the corner from the bathroom and feet away from a girl who decided to puke her guts out since she couldn't make it all the way to the bathrooms. Just the whole experience was a bummer.
