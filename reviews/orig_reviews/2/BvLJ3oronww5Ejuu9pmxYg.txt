I read all of the reviews here and although most were not favorable, we decided to give it a go. We are regulars at the Mesa location, love it and will keep going. The food here was good, but the service at the Ahwatukee location is dreadful. Nice hostess, very accomodating. Margarita order was incorrect for both rounds. We ordered the stronger ones and did not receive those on either round. Not a big deal. They apologized both times. Received food, no utensils or napkins. We sat there and looked at our food for quite awhile. This should not happen, ever. Very difficult getting water here. The sauces are hot, water requests should not be difficult to fulfill. The other locations give you a pitcher of water, this place has decided against that. We waited forever to place our order. We finally flagged down the waitress who got our waiter. It is just really bad service, non existent. They are all friendly enough, just not accomodating. 
The staff here really needs to go to a different location and see how to take care of guests. The food was fine, but a dining experience is more than food. Do not deliver food without utensils. If drink orders are incorrect and you acknowledge that, offer to correct them. Keep water full. Check on guests after they receive food, do not dissapear. Staff your restaurant a bit heavier on Saturday night.
