i came here with my family for my sisters birthday. hate to say it, but the service was horrible! With a party of 8 or more horrible customer service should not be allowed a gratuity option. The food was okay, i've had way better mexican food! 
Scenery was nice we ate outside, but it took forever to just get our food. We asked our server if she can take a family picture for us, but said no she was to busy. As I watched her she was just hanging out at the bar just talking and laughing with co workers. 

I would not recommend going here for birthday dinners, scottsdale has way better mexican food in the city.
