With so many Mexican restaurants in this area, how can Macayo's stay in business?  This was our first time here and only because Babbo's had a 30 minute wait.  Instead of waiting, the 4 of us tried Macayo's.  Flavorless salsa to begin with.  My chicken fajita was undersized, not sizzling and so bland.  Certainly not worth $14!  Others had carnitas (overcooked), combo meals and nachos and all were underwhelming. The service was fine but we won't be coming back.
