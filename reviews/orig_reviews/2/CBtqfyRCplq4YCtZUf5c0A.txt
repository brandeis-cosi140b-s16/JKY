Saw this place had weekend Happy Hour so we were excited to finally try it out as huge lovers of Mexican food. 

Sat at the bar, but the service was very slow.  Also, they had a DJ playing loud annoying club music and I'm sorry, but that is definitely not what I want to hear on a Sunday afternoon at a Mexican restaurant in a casino off the strip. 

We ordered chips, salsa, and traditional guacamole and everything was just so bland and lacking in flavor. The mushroom, shrimp, and fish tacos were just okay. I've definitely had much better elsewhere. 

The only reason this place gets two stars is because the margaritas were good. Unfortunately not enough to get us to return.
