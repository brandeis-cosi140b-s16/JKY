Went here after seeing a show at planet hollywood and the atmosphere is upbeat with music and people but the food is just ok. We ordered carnitas tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken enchiladas, lobster enchiladas and as an appetizer we got the rolled chicken taocs. For all 4 of us we weren't impressed with anything but it wasn't terrible either.
