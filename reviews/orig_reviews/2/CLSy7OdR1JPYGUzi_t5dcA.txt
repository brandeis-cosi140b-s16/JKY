My friends and I strolled into this restaurant because the patio seemed to be the only happening spot in the entire village.  There was a man playing live music inside which could be heard outside, it was the perfect setting for a relaxing evening. 

I ordered a carne asada burrito.  My carne asada was a generous portion served with a side of beans and rice.  The carne seemed more like ground beef and the taste was a little bland.  My boyfriend ordered the chimichanga and was also "just so" with his choice.  The general consensus from everyone around the table was that the food was not horrible but definitely not something to write home about.  From the 6 dishes we ordered, it seems as if the chicken fajitas were the best choice.

The margaritas were watered down and the other alcoholic drinks weren't very strong, especially for the price that was paid.  Definitely don't go in expecting to get your buzz on, unless of course you order straight shots, then maybe you can be on a good one.  

Our waiter Omar was really nice, he gets 5 stars if I could just rate on staff alone.  But this is for overall experience.

Next time I am in town, I will probably skip this place and will try something else out, or maybe I would stop in for a shot of tequila, but otherwise, I'd skip the food!
