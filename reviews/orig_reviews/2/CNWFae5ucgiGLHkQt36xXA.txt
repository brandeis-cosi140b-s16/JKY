I created a Yelp ID just to write this review. In the past the Taqueria has been one our favorite places for something better than fast food. Unfortunately, the level of service has been on a general decline over the past year or so, culminating in the following experience two weeks ago. (I waited a couple of weeks to post since I sent an email about my experience, but received not reply.)

We called in our order. It took 20 minutes of repeated dialing to finally get through, only to be put on hold for another 5 minutes. We placed our order and were told it would be ready in 25 minutes. We arrived in exactly 25 minutes, only to stand in line for another 10 minutes. (One person on the cash register, line to the door, no express line for call ahead.) By the time we received our order, the food was cold.
