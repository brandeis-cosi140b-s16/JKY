Went for happy hour that ended at 6??? The place was cute, had good music. I had an blood orange margarita and a prickly pear margarita... They both tasted the same, super sweet, nothing special. I was charged 12.00 each for them during happy hour because I requested Casa Noble tequila which may or may or have been used, which the waitress advise me of the up charge. The way the menu is set up, I thought it was the price of margarita.  I also ordered two tacos- carne asada and the chicken and nothing special, both a little salty. I guess they think that's what peeps want then they are drinking.
