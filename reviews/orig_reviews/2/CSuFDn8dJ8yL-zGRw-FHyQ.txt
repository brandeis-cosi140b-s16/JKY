It was good. Tacos were great for bar food and easy to eat with our group, to share anyways. Staff was stuffy management wasn't very polite. Not what you would expect for a hotel that has had four restaurants in the same place.  Vegas hospitality goes a long way, they should learn it. Well for everyone in the party thought overall food was good, presentation was horrible, drinks were great, and staff needs happy pill or a rainbow farting unicorn. ...haha. they do offer to go. So grab tacos and go to the center bar in the hotel and have dinner. Better company
