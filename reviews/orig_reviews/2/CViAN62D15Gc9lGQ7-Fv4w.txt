I had read the great reviews of this restaurant and, because I have a condo in Baja and love their fish tacos, I traveled cross town to it.  The location is great as it is in a great urban neighborhood called NoDa.  However I was greatly disappointed in the tacos.  Everyone raved about the tavaroo ones but pineapple on it just did not work for me  I also had the blackened mahi, which was better but the cilantro crema was too mild.  The salsa served with drinks was bland and dry with corn and tomatoes.  Garbanzos in the side dish??  I believe in creative cuisine but the food just was so far off from its Baja theme and was too bland for my taste.  Margarita menu interesting and varied with a great selection of tequilas.  Service was excellent.
