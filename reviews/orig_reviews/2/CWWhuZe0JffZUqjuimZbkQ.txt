Disappointing. Walked in around 2pm for a late lunch and drinks on a Saturday. No one was working the bar. The food was ok. Not great. I thought it was expensive too compared to other Mexican places in the area. And an extra $1.50 for using a credit card? Probably won't come back. And never got my drink.
