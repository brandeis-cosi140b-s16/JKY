This is a good restaurant but the staff are extremely lazy and cold except for 2 ladies that work there if you plan to go there you'll be waiting for at least 10 mins before they acknowledge your there to be seated when the place is almost empty the food is burnt and over cooked  I will say they have good beans I will not go back because they have lazy cooks that cut corners and they don't seem to care plus the noise is so loud from the bar you can't even have a conversation with your friend or family
