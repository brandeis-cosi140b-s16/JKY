Really wanted to like this place - close by, locally owned and tacos seemed like a win-win-win.

I liked the menu concept. Service was good. I really liked the chips and guac (though no chips unless you buy salsa or guac is bizarre). My veggie taco was good, but the others were not. The chicken taco was extremely bland. Pork wasn't much better - the pineapple salsa was good but there were way too much (bland) pork and not nearly enough of anything else.

I may go back for drinks and apps only - but not for dinner.
