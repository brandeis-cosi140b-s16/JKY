Ok. The food was fine. 
However the wait staff sucks! The guy we got stuck with had a serious problem with what he seemed to want as a language barrier.  And had attitude when we had to ask him to slow down and repeat what he said. When I asked for another beverage he walked away. So I went to the dar to self service, and...wow! Actually got good service. I hate to give a bad review, but the table staff completely sucked.
