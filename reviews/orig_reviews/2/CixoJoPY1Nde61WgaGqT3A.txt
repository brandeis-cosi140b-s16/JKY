If I really had to, I guess I will come back to Cabo Wabo. But given this is Vegas, Thank You because there are better places around. 

To start off, we ask to be seated by the heater and where did we get seated... not near the heater. Uhhh, did you not hear us?!  It was a cold Saturday night so when we saw open space by the heater, we decided to scoot our table ourselves. 

I ordered the mushroom fajitas plate- I wouldn't recommend it. Partly my fault because after ordering it I realized how delicious can mushroom fajitas be?! And partly because the mushrooms were flavorless. It was not marinated and grilled that well. 

If I'm ever back, I'll head straight to the bar instead.!
