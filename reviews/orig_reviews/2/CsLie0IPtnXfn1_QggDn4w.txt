I was NOT impressed! The food is EXPENSIVE  for what it is and is isnt that great. The service was awesome. Valet service, and pretty young girls opening the door for me. I noticed there were only women in the working the bar area except for one man in the bar. This seems a little sexist but to each his own. I was told that this place is tex mex but they dont have a fajita plate. Instead there is plenty of TUNA options? And scallops for $21?? Thats outragous. I have friends in Texas, n when im there to visit, i like to have a chicken fried steak or fajitas if we go into a tex mex or mexican restaurant. Neither of which is on the menu. And the rice was over cooked or maybe it had been sitting for a while. Not fresh for sure. I gave this place 2 stars just for service alone
