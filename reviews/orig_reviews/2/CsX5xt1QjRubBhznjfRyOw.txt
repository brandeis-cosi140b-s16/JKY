Just settled in our hotel at Ballys and we wanted a bite to eat at 1am and found this place next to a night club. It was fun watching all the interesting people party next door.

The wait staff was very attentive and our food came in approx 15 minutes.

I ordered the fish tacos and it was three little tortillas and the fish was marinated in some kind of red sauce/spices. They were topped with a little salsa, cilantro, and a dollop of sour cream. It was just okay...I was really starving and just wolfed it all down.

My wife had the adobo marinated pork chiliquilis with two easy over eggs. She said it was okay and I tasted her dish and I agreed with her. 

Overall it was just an okay meal, the food lacked flavor, but again the wait staff was great.

Sorry, but I will not be coming here anytime soon.
