I seen they had good reviews and was in the area. Gave it a shot!
Honestly wasn't impressed from the get-go!
2 employees from the back saw us walk in and didn't acknowledge us at all until a very sweet girl helped us out. The poor girl didn't know what she was doing at all.
From the way she put the toppings on my nachos to the way she wrapped my husbands burrito, all was very sloppy.
The food wasn't bad but could've been better!
There was a selection of salsas to choose from, but it was upsetting to find out that they all tasted like a high fructose corn syrup that should be on a snow cone!
It would've been better if they had more options with real ingredients as a salsa! Or at least some Sriracha...
