I didn't have high hopes for this place considering it's location, but if there's a vegan taco to be had, I'm going to try it. I had some sort of seitan taco and a veggie burrito combo. The taco was boring, served with just seitan, no vegetable to dress it up. The flavors were OK, but I've had way more exciting tacos. The burrito was big. That's about all you could say about it. It had stuff in it, but nothing very interesting. I was super hungry, so it was satisfying enough. The server will ask you if you want chips and salsa, say yes. It's $3 and the green is pretty good. Red was meh. The food aside, the wait staff seemed to have some serious issues. Everyone that worked there seemed to have been hired that afternoon. It was chaotic and an unnecessary amount of people were on the (tiny, tiny) dining room floor all at once. The girl "in charge" seemed to be about an inch away from a full blown panic attack, and there were only 6 tables. It was a bit stressful to watch.

Just a warning - If you find reggae music just as unbearable as I do, be prepared. You will hear it here, obviously. I think this place has potential. They need to tweak some menu items, hire a competent waitstaff and purchase furniture that is more than 5 inches off the ground (seriously it feels like you are on the floor). Basically, if this place was another restaurant completely, it would be good. 

It's BYOB though! And cheap! You park on the street and apparently you should make reservations on the weekends.
