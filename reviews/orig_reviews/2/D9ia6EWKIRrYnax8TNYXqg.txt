It is the ONLY place in concourse C that looked halfway decent... and that's about the best thing that can be said of it. The food was okay, the portion reasonable (smaller than I'd have expected at a Mexican place, but frankly that is probably a good thing), prices not too bad. 

Of course, there is no metal silverware and the service is a step up from the TSA, but not exactly great.

And while the beer and non-alcholoic drinks were a bit expensive, they DID offer me a $4 shot to go with my beer. So they've got that going for them...
