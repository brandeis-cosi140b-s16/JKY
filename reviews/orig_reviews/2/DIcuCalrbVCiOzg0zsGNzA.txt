Found the atmosphere cold and corporate. The food was mediocre at best, ordered the chicken fajita chimichanga, which was no doubt precooked frozen chicken, the sauce and veggies in the chimichanga were also reheated, extremely bland, and the food came out in literally well under 5 minutes, there is no way any meal could be prepared fresh that fast.  

Ordered a local ale on tap and the "pint" came in a ridiculously large stemmed glass, probably the most inappropriate way to drink an ale I've ever experienced.

What's with the touch screen terminal at every table? Whoever came up with this idea ought to be fired. 

Leaving 2 stars as the server was actually very good.
