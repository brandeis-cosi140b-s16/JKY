I stopped there by accident since it was passed my lunch time and I was hungry driving around.

The place is appealing since it's a low key hole in the wall. The employees were friendly and in general in seems like a cool joint.

I ordered 2 steak tacos and 1 pibil pork. Horchata to drink.

The horchata was no bueno. Too sweet and it tastes like almond. I mean, it's half decent if they call it something else but if you've tried horchata this would disappoint you. 

The tacos were bland. Period. The tortilla was cold. Nothing close to the real thing.

The salsas were tasty though.

Parking is also an issue.

Cheers
