Definitely go to the one on Cactus ! I love the food here. We drove for 30 mins to get the best Mexican food ever! The Mohave location has no air conditioner, rude employees and will not give you a box to take your food home. I asked if I could pay for a box and then received one. They started cleaning before they closed. They turned off the soda machines and took the salsa. I went to the register to see if I could buy more salsa and they said they did not have anymore. Highly unlikely.  I was really disappointed. I will be back to Carolina"s  but never to this location.
