My friend kept hyping up this place, telling me that there was a potent drink called a little stick that tasted like a big stick.  The closest thing they had to that was their margarita and it tasted nothing like a big stick =(

The chile relleno I had was close to inedible.  I just don't know what they were doing when they stuffed it full of dry overcooked chicken, apricots, raisins and whatnot.  There was barely any cheese in there, I was hoping for a cheesy chicken gooey delicious explosion in my mouth.  It clearly did not happen =(

My companions got the diablo pasta and that was good but it was really just fetticine in cream sauce.

Definitely a waste of a foodie trip =(
