Things have changed so much here in the past two years. We used to order takeout from here at least once a week and would stop and eat-in occasionally. Many times bringing our out of town guests along. There was a point sometime after going to the bigger location, everything began to dropoff. When picking up food, there is no designated hostess or place to set up shop and many times it was several minutes before you could get someone's attention. We would be told 20 mins for pickup and the food would be ready nearly an hour later. The quality of the food has gone down as well, just as the price has gone up. I hate to write a negative review, but I get sad and frustrated that we can no longer get the food and service we used to enjoy so regularly. It's just not worth the hassle anymore. It's not even on our list anymore.
