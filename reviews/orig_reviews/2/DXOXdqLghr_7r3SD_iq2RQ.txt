Probably should be one star. 

Store bought chips and tortillas. 

Scrawny meatless overpriced tacos devoid of any real flavor and the carne tasted gamey. 

Ordered beans, didn't get them but they didn't charge either oh well.  

No rice?!?  I'm befuddled by this especially as it is billed as a home style Mexican. I've never been to a Latin American home (pick a country) that didn't have a pot of rice. Plus rice is cheap, easy to make and filling (and might have made it easier that's I ate three skimpy tacos and I'm still hungry) 

Corn - flavorless!  Plus you've GOT to grill that corn to have it right.  Nasty.  

But the Horchata is good.
