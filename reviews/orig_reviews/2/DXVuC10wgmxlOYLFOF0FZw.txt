I'm from the sf bay area but born and raised in AZ. Just got back from a visit which included dinner here. My brother loves it. We had a great time and the server was delightful but. Can't count me in as a fan though. First, the prices are ridiculous, even by bay area standards. Entrees are $12-$28. Yes, the tableside guac was yummy but $10.75 for one avocado plus some fixings??? The waitress raved about the mole and I ordered the enchiladas mole. Their mole goes way too heavy on the chocolate-kind of a hershey's syrup on an enchilada effect. It was plenty of food with the side veggies but $18.00 for 2 enchiladas and some veggies?? Hmmm... The margarita on the rocks was delicious. with a $1.00 upgrade to a better tequila. Sorry Phoenix. This place is overrated.
