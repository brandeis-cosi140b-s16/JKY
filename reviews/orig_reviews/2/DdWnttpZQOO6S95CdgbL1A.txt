The server was nice but the service was extremely slow. The restaurant was not overly crowded. We waited over an hour for our food. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm. I ordered the Barrio pollo burrito.  It was good but not warm enough. I wouldn't go back due to the service. The food was just not worth the wait.
