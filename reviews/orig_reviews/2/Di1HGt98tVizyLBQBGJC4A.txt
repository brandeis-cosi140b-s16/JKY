Stopped in yesterday for lunch.  1st time there.  Chips and salsa fantastic but thats where the postives stopped.  Proabably the worst chicken fajitas I have ever had.  Chicken tasted parboiled.  Very, very bland.  My lunch guest ordered a chicken tostada and had the same complaint.  Service was a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 as well.
