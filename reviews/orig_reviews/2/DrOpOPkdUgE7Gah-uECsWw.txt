Nice decor. Service was good with decent cocktails. The food was terrible. I have never had to pay for chips and salsa in a Mexican restaurant. The food was bland and tasteless,  covered in sauces in an attempt for flavor. Honestly the worst tasting Mexican food I have ever eaten in Las Vegas. As a local I feel sorry for tourists that get stuck here.
