I seriously don't understand what people think is so great about this place.  Maybe because it's been around forever and they're the kind of people that won't ever branch out and try something new.  This place was okay back in the day but has suffered a serious decline.  PEOPLE!  We live close to the border.  There are plenty of excellent, authentic Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Macayos is to Mexican as Olive Garden is to Italian: a bland, Americanized, chain restaurant version of international food.

The food is nothing special.  When asked what ingredients were in the salsa a waiter responded, "I don't know, the salsa comes from a can."  I can never say that I've had great service here.  One waitress in the bar broke my friend's older "Senor Bob" margarita glass, didn't apologize and just gave him a new one.  When he pointed out that the new ones are much smaller her response was, "You get the same amount of tequila in both."  Which is not true and leads to another point.  The margaritas here have become downright horrible.  I watched the bartender fill margarita glasses with a pre-made pitcher of watered down sweet and sour mix lightly spiked with cheap tequila.

It's sad that I can't even force myself to come here, given that it's walking distance from my house and they have a nice patio on the lake.  But after many worsening experiences I have given up on this place and won't return.
