Worst Mexican food I can remember having.  Everything tasted like it came from a can.  Wife and I came here a few months ago for lunch and we both were horribly disappointed.  The verde sauce tastes like the stuff that comes in a can in the Mexican food section of the supermarket.  Margaritas tasted old and tired -- Tasted like the sour mix came from a can or powder.  Nothing fresh and all terribly bland.  View was pretty good, but didn't compensate for the awful food.  Waitstaff did some corny Mariachi birthday thing for a table nearby.  I felt bad for both the staff and the birthday table.  Serving staff did try pretty hard though.  If it wasn't for the decent service (in spite of the corny Mariachi routine) we'd have given it one star.

It's not like we got sick or anything, but it was so bland and canned tasting that I can honestly say I've had better Mexican food from a TV dinner out of the frozen food section of the supermarket.

We couldn't believe that this place got voted "Best Mexican Food in Vegas" or some such thing.  What a disappointment.
