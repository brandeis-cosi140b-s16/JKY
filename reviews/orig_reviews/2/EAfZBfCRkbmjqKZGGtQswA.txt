This place gets 2 stars because the building itself is trippy and cool--check out the blue window skylights in a Gaudi esque configuration--and the super fresh salsa. My lunch, on the other hand, was super lackluster (a la carte spinach enchilada and chile relleno). But I'll go back, just for margaritas, kick ass salsa, and a building that sets a cool mood.
