Tourist trap.  Looks good but overall disappointing.  The tequila was great once we finally got it!  Food was mediocre and service was just plain bad!  
Do yourself a favor - skip the Cantina and brave the heat to Margaritaville at the Flamingo were you will be well served in a fun environment with great food and drinks!
