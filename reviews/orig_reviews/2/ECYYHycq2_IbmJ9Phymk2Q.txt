I hate to put a Lindo's down since I am a HUGE fan of all the other locations. But This one.. ehhh not the same.

I was excited when I found out a couple months ago that they opened a location in Henderson so everyone is the area could enjoy such awesome Mexican food, but when it was my turn to try this one out I wasn't so happy.

First off the building use to be a Italian restaurant so it doesn't have the same feeling as the other locations. I like to feel like I'm in Mexico while eating good Mexican food, there is like no atmosphere here. Yes there are great views but it's kinda hard to enjoy when you're back to back with everyone around you. The tables are so jammed in this place I was so uncomfortable. 

Next up the orders were so butchered and the service was not the usual standard I am use to at the other Lindo locations. The table side guac never came, there was like no tequila in the margaritas even when we order a double, and the changes to the orders weren't there.  The server was cocky and didn't really help us out when we weren't happy.

I know it was a busy Saturday night but there are some things I don't think are going to change because of the layout of the restaurant. Just not the same. I will stick to the West Flamingo and Desert Inn locations.
