Beware....Cantina has a new owner and new menu and it's not great.  Sigh.  My husband and I used to looove Cantina; my husband would have eaten there every day if he could.  

We visited this week and found out they had a new menu.  Nothing sounded amazing.  I ordered nachos that were only so so (how can nachos only be so so?).  In addition, the service was not as good as it used to be but our waitress could have just been having a bad day.

If you've eaten at Cantina prior to July 2012 and loved it, reset your expectations so you aren't as let down as we were.  

(side note, pacos tacos is still owned FS Food Group and has the same menu; phew)
