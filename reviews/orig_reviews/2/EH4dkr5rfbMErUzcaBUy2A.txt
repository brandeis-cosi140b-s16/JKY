Stopped by for an early lunch today at 11:15. Nobody at the hostess station and it was several minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there. Our server didn't indicate there were any lunch specials nor ask if we had any questions. Once our order was placed the food arrived quite quickly which would have been fine had the food been prepared fresh. My wife ordered enchiladas which were barely warm in the middle so they obviously were pre-made and reheated. My machaca burro was fine. Ice tea was never refilled and, we weren't asked if we wanted dessert. I don't know if it was an off day for them but I'll probably not find out since one bad experience is all I'm willing to invest.
