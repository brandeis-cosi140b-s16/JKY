This restaurant proudly displays their A rating (as of 9/30/14).  It's a strip mall location north of the 101. They accept all the major credit cards including American Express according to the sticker next to the door. 

You walk up and order from a lengthy menu on the left and then find a table for yourself. There are lots of TVs if you want to keep up on the game while you lunch. 

Pros:  reasonably priced combos with rice and beans, free refills (serve yourself), salsa bar and free chips. It also appears to be quite clean. 

Cons:  the food is not good. Beef tacos were bland at best and greasy. The fries in the kids meal taste as though their frying oil is rancid. The rice that comes with the combo is dry and flavorless as were the beans. The fish tacos were okay, if a little heavy on the tartar sauce. 

This was a bit if a drive for us, so it's unlikely we will ever make the drive to come back.
