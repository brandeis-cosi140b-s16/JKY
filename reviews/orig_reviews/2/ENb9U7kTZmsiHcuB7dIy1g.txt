Just ate here for lunch today to give it one last try.  

We always get bean tostadas as they are our favorites, but the last 3 times we have been here there have been almost no beans on the tostada.  

Today while I was waiting for the order to be done, I was watching the guy make the bean tostada... he put a nice portion on the tostada, then he proceeded to scrape all the beans off back into the tray!  Are you kidding?  I watched this happen over 10 times for each bean tostada!   So instead of actually having beans on the tostada, it is just maybe a millimeter of bean juice and the rest has been recycled on to the next meal!

Beans are cheap!  If I had a choice, I would pay more to have a tostada that actually had beans on it!

My kids butter tortilla had more beans, which is sad as there is only butter on that item.
