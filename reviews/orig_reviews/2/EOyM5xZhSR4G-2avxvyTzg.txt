For some reason EC Uno falls far short of EC Dos in terms of food quality. Dos must have a superior kitchen staff?

Anyway, food was dry and far less flavorful than the meals we regularly get at EC Dos. Only been here once, so it could have been a bad night in the kitchen. Regardless, the food was disappointing enough to warrant never returning.  We'll stick with EC Dos, where the food is consistently great and has never disappointed us.

P.S. Pond is nice, but duck poop smell isn't...
