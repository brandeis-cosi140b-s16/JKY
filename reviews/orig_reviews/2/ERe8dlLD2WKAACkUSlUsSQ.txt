I give Blanco 2 stars not because of the food, but because of the experience.  I have been there at least 4 times and have had mediocre service.  Why do I return?  Well, I love the White House Margarita, the chips and guac are wonderful.  But all of the teens in their super short cotton tennis dresses are lacking what it takes to make a dining experience receive 5 stars.   Most of my not so good experiences have been on the patio....it's as if they forgot I exist, until after they finish their chitter chatter amongst themselves.   I keep going back b/c I want Blanco to succeed, but one day, I will just give up if things stay marginal!
