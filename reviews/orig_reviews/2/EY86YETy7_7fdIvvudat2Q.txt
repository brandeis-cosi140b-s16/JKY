After reading all these great reviews, I'm wondering if maybe I (and my husband) just ordered the wrong thing, because we thought this place kind of sucked. The chips and salsa were very good and they give you four different types of salsa. The ambiance was cool. However, the food took FOREVER (like, 45 minutes at lunchtime) to come out. This wouldn't be so bad if the food was slap-yo-mama-in-the-face good, but to our disappointment, there will be no slapping our mamas in the face after eating at Gallo Blanco. The carne asada tacos were pretty crappy. The meat was fatty, tough and bland. My husband got the pork torta and he said it was just 'ok'. Sorry, wanted to like this place, but it's not gonna happen.
