First of all we LOVE barrio cafe and barrio queen in Phoenix and Scottsdale. If we had to pick a last meal it would be their guacamole, pork tacos and posole. This is why we were soooooo excited to see barrio at the airport. Very sadly it did not measure up at all :(
The posole soup did not have hominy and radishes like at the other restaurants, it seriously seemed like they just threw pork in some broth. We also ordered the pork tacos and all of the pork was very fatty, I couldn't even eat it. I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
