I have to say, I really do like the food at El Palacio, but after numerous trips with awful service, I'll no longer be going back.

Although, I think the service varies depending on who your server is. We've been (un)lucky enough to have the same male server in the bar area every time we've gone and he's the absolute worst!  It took about 10 minutes for him to even ask us what we wanted to drink and then dissapeared for quite awhile.  He was even nice enough to hand two of us a very hot plate, right out of the broiler.  Then he just dissapeared completely, never asking if we were ok, needed drinks, or were ready for the check. We ended up asking the busser for some boxes.

So suffice it to say, this is our last trip to El Palacio, despite how good their food can be some times.
