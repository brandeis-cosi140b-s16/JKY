I am not sure what the hype is all about, but this place was not very good. We were seated at one of the tiniest tables with no room for the silverware or plates of food. I dropped my silverware a few times during our dinner. They were closing pretty soon so they could have easily given us a bigger table since it wasn't occupied all night.

The chips and salsa were very good. The elote was really good. The guacamole was fresh and delicious. I will give this place two stars for those reasons. 

However, the tacos that are actually mini tacos that are priced the same as regular sized tacos were awful. They were filled with dried meat and completely lacked flavor or spices. It was as if someone blindfolded the chef and told him to grab three ingredients and throw it in a taco and put it on the menu. The duck taco is literally fatty duck meat, and fatty pumpkin seeds. Throw something fresh on there to cut the fat of the duck off! All the tacos tasted the same. They were all equally bland. I would have been much happier going to Chipotle, sadly. 

The service was also subpar. The waitress had poor time management skills when we were waiting for our credit card back and she spent 20+ minutes returning it. It literally takes two seconds to put a check on a table. I understand if you get caught up in stuff, but come on! I also let the manager know about our awful dining experience, and he told me that he would call me back. That was a month ago. And here I am writing this review because this is what happens when management doesn't take care of the issue at that moment. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for tacos. If you're looking for drinks and appetizers, go for it.
