Well that was disappointing.

I live around the corner and since this place consistently has a line and people eating outside, I thought it must be good. Unfortunately, I also looked past my instinct to avoid any place with "best _______________ in town" on a sign out front.

I ordered the "pastor" tacos for quick bite and a XL carne asada burrito for some now, some later.

I'll start with the al pastor tacos... mediocre doesn't even begin to describe them. The corn tortillas were steamed and a bit undercooked, the pork was salty at best. I don't know why nobody can get it right here and insists that al pastor is just adobada on a vertical spit. Twenty-five million chilangos called and they're angry with you. I suppose I should have known better, ordering a DF dish from a Sinaloan-owned restaurant, but they could have at least succeeded with the onions and cilantro and a thin slice of warm pineapple. Like I said, not even mediocre.

Then there's the burrito... the reason I begrudgingly gifted America's two stars instead of one. They at least tried. The meat appeared to be arrachera (skirt steak) that had been over-marinated and lost its texture. It's really a shame when a place say they have CARNE ASADA and don't cook over an open flame.

Salsas were lifeless and they charge for chips. And as someone else pointed out... YOU CHARGE FOR JALAPENOS??? Come on now... I shop at Food City for my mexican produce and you're just being "codo" when it comes to this.

My advice: skip America's and head over to Villa la Parrilla next to Charlie's on Camelback. 

My wife and I (Coahuila Mexico and Northern California) agreed that its the only Mexican food we've had in town yet that was any good.
