This review is for the nightclub portion of Coconuts.

The entire layout of this place is super annoying and difficult to navigate. The quality of the people there wasn't as high as I was hoping for either, not to mention the music was total crap. If you want a nightclub, probably go check out one of the million casino night clubs on the strip.
