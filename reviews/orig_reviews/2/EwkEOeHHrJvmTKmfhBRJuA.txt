The bar is high in Arizona for Mexican cuisine, and Abuelos, you may or may not have a shot in Alaska.

This is a corporate chain, which makes it difficult to execute the details and freshness that makes Mexican my favorite. Always on the search for a good chicken fajita (or lobster, but that's another Yelp entirely) should not be a tall order. Give me limes and guacamole and I'm a happy camper. The chicken here is consistently dry whenever I visit Abuelos and bland. A friend we came with ordered a grilled chicken dish that came out fried, though the menu specified grilled. No bueno, mis amigos.

Check out Los Olivos. It's a few miles away, but the food and the donkey are well worth the journey.
