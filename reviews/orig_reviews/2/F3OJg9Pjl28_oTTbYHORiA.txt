Alright kids...here's the deal.  I'm a pretty big fan of Chipotle.  I grub on it in Tucson whenever I get the urge and this was my first shot at one in phx.  After watching one of my SGTs chow down on a burrito from "El Pollo Loco" I was JONESIN for a huge, badass burrito...gotta have me some Chipotle.  I just COULDN'T get it outta my head...

That's where I went wrong.  Sad to say, at this location, the burrito I received fell far short of my Chipotle Standard (oh yes, Ally has a Chipotle Standard...she is a silly monkey).  My rice was WAY undercooked, the guy behind the counter was rushing EVERYONE (update, dude, the line isn't that long...you can wait for ppl to tell the girl if they want rice on their burrito before you start the Inquisition focused on "sour cream?", "cheese?") and, although I know the portions are typically too large, my burrito was puny...puny, that is, by the Ally Chipotle Standard.  

Most people would prolly see this as a blessing in disguise.  "Ally, your fat ass shouldn't be grubbin on a massive burrito"...I know, I say it to myself all the time.  But, here is the deal.  I LOVE my fat ass.  And my fat ass is a good American...I fucking paid for it, gimme what i WANT!  I had plans for the remains of the burrito I SHOULD have gotten.  I was gonna eat it til I got full and then sat around with the remains, watching Rome and slowly nibbling it into annihilation even tho I would be WAY too full after consuming it.  This was my plan.  Eh, I coulda even saved it for lunch if I had wanted...but who am I kidding...it's totally not as good the second day.

Point of the story, CHIPOTLE rocks, but this location...eh, not so much.
