Went here with my nephew who was in from out of town because I'd had fun here before. We had a two drinks each, shared some chips & salsa, and 3 street tacos. Walked out of there spending nearly $70 on a very small lunch. The chips come with 3 different salsas, but they are not free like other Mexican restaurants, The tacos are decent, but overall, this place is a little pricey. 

I don't think the bartender smiled once, although she was nice enough to tell my nephew that old town Scottsdale is the place to hang out. THAT kind of explains the non-existant smile on the pretty little blonde's face the entire time. Probably won't go back here again unless it's HH, because they do have their house margaritas for half-price ($5).
