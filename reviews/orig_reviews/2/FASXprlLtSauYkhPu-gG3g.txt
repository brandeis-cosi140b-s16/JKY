We stopped by Loco Patron for lunch & overall it was just an "ok" experience. It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away & our waitress came to get our drink & food orders promptly. I got the chicken taco with extra rice for my meal. There wasn't much flavor to the tacos nor the rice. My friend had the shrimp tacos & he said they were really good. Perhaps I should've ordered those. I think they have $1 tacos on Tuesdays for happy hour which might make them worth it.
