My wife and I love Tee Pee's, it's nothing AMAZING, but it's always good.  Unfortunately, we won't be visiting this establishment anymore.

We had some friends from out of the country and our their last night we wanted to take them to an inexpensive place with authentic Mexican food.  

Our waiter came by and we ordered "4 margaritas please!"
He replied, "want to get a pitcher of the GOOOD margaritas?!"
Unified, we replied, "YES!"

Well, two "GOOOD" pitchers later and we were drunk and ready for the check.  Albeit, the margaritas were really good, but they were not $42 per pitcher good!  Our drink total was $84 and definitely not worth it.  When we asked about the price our waiter said that they offered regular pitchers for $18 or the top shelf (or "GOOOOD") margaritas for $42.  We felt deceived and it put a huge damper on our last night with our friends.
