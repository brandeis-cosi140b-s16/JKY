A sad day for me, to say the least.  For a solid decade I've considered Chevy's to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat.  Yeah, I'm a white dude who likes the white-washed mexican...so what? its delicious!  The chips and salsa are epic!  So I'm down in Vegas visiting some friends and I suggest we hit up Chevy's for lunch, so we hit up the ONLY Chevy's around which is down at the mall in Henderson across from Sunset Station.  We walk in with 3 adults and 2 kids, both 2 years old.  So of course, they take us off the beaten path and stick us in the back corner so as not to disturb anybody....which is fine and dandy, EXCEPT WHEN THEY FORGET ABOUT YOU!   First round of drinks and chips/salsa was pushing 10 minutes from being seated.  I order an apple juice for my daughter and they're all out.  I then ask for a chocolate milk instead and...you guessed it...they're all out!  My wife asks for a side of lemons for her ice-water.  First the server says they're out, then changes his mind and says they have lemons but no limes.  Well, they never came.  Fast forward about another 45 minutes. Mind you, we've had ZERO drink refills at this point.  Out comes my plate of Chicken Fajitas...that's it.  So we're sitting and waiting another 5 or so minutes and ask where the rest of the food is.  The server apologized and said the flautas took the longest, hence the delay in delivery.  Since when does deep fried food take longer?  Well, I've finally decided I had enough and spoke to the manager.  She was super nice and ended up comping half of our bill and surrounding us with great service for the small remainder of our stay.  She even made it a point to have the server bring out lemons, so of course, he brought a side of limes.  I thought they were out of limes?  When all was said and done, it took nearly 2 hrs to eat here when it wasn't busy AND with 2 fussy toddlers.  This is easily the worst Chevy's experience I've ever had.  I'll stick to the ones in CA!!
