I was very disappointed, not in the quality of food, but in the service I received at Hussong's. Friends of mine and I went for lunch on Veteran's Day this year, and our waiter, Elio was terrible. He started off the experience with enthusiasm, but that quickly dwindled after we placed our order. I had ordered the Taquitos on the appetizer section of the menu. After we placed our order, I noticed that there was a little fold out promotional piece on the table that advertised breakfast burritos. I quickly waved down our waiter and asked him to change it out because the burrito was only $2 more but included a lot more food. It was then the Elio got really awkward. His body language and facial expressions showed he was very annoyed at me for wanting to change my order. He even said something along the lines of, "Well, umm, they're already making it. But I guess I can go see if I can cancel it. It's just going to take a lot longer." When I told him it was fine if it took longer, he again stressed that the cooks were already making it. 

Our food came out quickly and it was great! But Elio, I'm assuming because of the order cancellation, avoided us the rest of the time we were there. At one point, he came over to ask if everything was going OK, but he was already walking away as we spoke our answers. 

Overall, the service was just terrible and even though the food was tasty, the experience was ruined due to our bad waiter. We won't be going back.
