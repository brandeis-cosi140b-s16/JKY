Came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago. I had high expectations but it was just a regular taco shop. In fact I think I like Roberto's better. Maybe it was what I had. I had the al pastor burrito, I wish I could say more but it just wasn't exceptional or enough for me to remember in detail how to describe it. It was smaller than what was expected for the $10+ I paid for the burrito and a drink, it came with a couple and by that I mean maybe 5 or 7 chips on the side. The habanero salsa had a good kick and flavor, that may have been the best part and that they had fresh brewed ice tea. Maybe I should just expect to pay that much since it is in the "new" area of downtown? Maybe I am just spoiled and expect authentic mexican food at a reasonable price... either way it just did nothing for me.
