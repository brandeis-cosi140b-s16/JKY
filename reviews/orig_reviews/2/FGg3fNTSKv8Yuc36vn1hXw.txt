Good food. Bad service.
When you're dealing with a lunch rush, passing out food that's piling up on the counter is more important than wiping down drink dispensers or picking up straw wrappers from the utensils counter. Yet that's what I've seen them do. Also, when passing out food, it's important to pass out the oldest food first, especially when the oldest orders have been sitting for several minutes waiting to go out and people out for lunch are in a hurry. The staff just always seems kind of disinterested in taking orders and distributing food with any kind of urgency whatsoever.
