So, I've read the other reviews on the Restaurant.  I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that didn't "love it".

If you don't have reservations and show up promptly...they turn you away.  I watched it happen twice.   I'm in another area of service Industry...and I don't believe in turning anyone away for any reason.

First Impression....decor was nice...not too over the top...but still had that Epicenter feel.

Great menu with lots of variety.   I ordered shrimp...it came out COLD.  So I sent it back...and then guy who brought it back to me said "Now hurry and eat it before it gets cold again".... I was appalled.    It's not my fault that my food was sitting in the window too long before it hit the table.   
After the "re-cook"  it was fine....I enjoyed my meal.

Service was lacking....between the bouncer guy at the door of a restaurant and the slacker that was waiting on us...I'm surprised that we made it to our next venue in time.  Our waiter maybe came over 2 times the entire time.... I just thought he was on a perpetual smoke break someplace.  Waitstaff can definitely be a little more attentive.

I probably will not go back due to the price:service/quality ratio.  It wasn't awful...but it was FAR FROM STELLAR.
