Went to dinner with some friends, we were celebrating a friends presence , she had moved out of the valley almost 2 years ago, we were a party of 8.  

This was my 1st time to Los Olivos and I was kind of excited to try them out. Unfortunately sometimes being me requires you to attend more than one party in a day, so I just came from another party where I had already filled up on some food, so I wasn't very hungry, but wanted to join my friends in the fun!

I was about ten minutes late, asked the hostess were my friends were seated at, and was told, oh just look around till you find them, we have a few parties here tonight.  I thought well isn't that nice I get to roam in a place I don't know very well. But turns out I didn't have to go far, I found them in the 2nd room.

I sat down, and was browsing the menu, our server came to me and said what are you drinking and looked a little perturbed that I joined this table. I just told her water. I wasn't the last one to the party, my other friend showed up 5 mins after me, and she got the same chilly attitude from the server. And with a big party like ours, it didn't really matter how bad the service was, because the tip was already added to our bill. 

Everyone placed there order, I wound up ordering Deep Fried Ice Cream, since I was already a meal ahead of everyone. While waiting for our food, I was munching on the chips and salsa, now I'm not a fan of the salsas, the "hotter" one was way to seedy for me. I like hot salsa, but I don't like feeing like I'm eating sunflower seeds. And the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus any peppers and runny. I mixed the 2 together, and that didn't really help either, so eating chips and salsa wasn't working for me.

Now the deep fried ice cream that was perfect! The sweet taste of honey, the crispy outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day!

I really wanted to like Los Olivos, maybe I'll go to the other location and give them another try.
