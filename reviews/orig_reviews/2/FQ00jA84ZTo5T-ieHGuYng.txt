I used to come here every Friday night when it was located on East Blvd. It was honestly one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Their guacamole, chopped salad, blood orange margarita, ahhhh.... The good 'ol days.

I have visited the new Park Road location about 5 times and I don't think I will ever go back again after receiving such awful service. I overlooked it at first because I loved it too much. But it becomes hard to ignore when you can barely get your server's attention all night.

This week, we visited Cantina and paid almost $10 for guacamole, which we really enjoy there, and the waitress didn't bring us chips for 20 minutes. How annoying. The food also does not seem fresh or as high quality as it used to be- especially for the price. On one date night, we placed our order and the waiter brought out our food in less than five minutes- like it had just been heated up in the microwave! Yuck.

I am very disappointed in the direction that Cantina has gone, and I am so sad to say that I will not be visiting again. If you are considering Cantina, I would encourage you to search a little harder to find another great Mexican place with better service and quality :)
