We were comped $40 dollars to this restaurant so we figured we would try it out.

I ordered steak nachos and my husband ordered the fajita combo with the steak, chicken, and shrimp. The chips and salsa before the meal were okay. The chips tasted like they came straight out of a bag and the salsa was just mediocre. My nachos were okay. The cheese they use was amazing, the jalapenos were good, but everything else was gross. The steak was so bland, it literally had no flavor at all.
My husband's fajitas were the same way. The rice was very bland but the veggies that came with the fajitas were very good. 

This place is just stupid overpriced. My husband's fajitas were so tiny and my nachos weren't all that big. With the two meals, a soda for me and a beer for my husband, the bill came out to be around $45. Staff wasn't very friendly either.
