As I live only a few blocks away from here and I love Mexican food, I watched with eager anticipation as they renovated this space, filled it with tables and chairs, announced that they were hiring, and then... finally! They opened! The decor is very attractive and the food is good, but the service is horrendous.  I mean, it's truly just plain bad.  And unapologetically so.  While there as a party of four, they admitted that they forgot to seat us and left us lingering at the bar for about 45 minutes, even though we had a reservation, and then once seated, didn't bring us water and chips for another 10 minutes.  It took another ten or so for someone to take our drink orders, and so on and so forth.  Our server didn't bring a second order of chips until we asked four times and then forgot the salsa, which he never brought even though we reminded him.  It wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't taken so so long to get served our food.  We just started flagging down anyone we saw to ask them to get our waiter's attention. It also took some major pleading to get drink refills, get our check, and pay our bill. A really frustrating and loooong dining experience.  Even though the food is good (and the grilled corn is super good) I won't be going back until I read that service has markedly increased.  Please please, Verde owner and manager, read the reviews of your diners and fix this problem! I don't want to see you fail.  And please turn up the heat! Your restaurant is freezing!
