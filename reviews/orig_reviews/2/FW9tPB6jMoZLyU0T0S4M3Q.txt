I am here a lot for shows as part of work and we've tried Cocina twice now for burritos before the concerts. I heard they rock. The pork one is just ok. That's not my problem, though. My problem is the first time they forgot my friend's quesadilla. Then they forgot it again.  It was an hour before she got it, and we were all done with everything. They comped her but seriously, it's cheese and tortilla.

This week (Wednesday night) I gave Cocina another shot. Two of us this time. I ordered the pork no onions and it had onions. The waitress sent it back and then (after awhile) the cook brought out a chicken no onion. He immediately realized it was wrong again. By this time the opening band started and I had to get in there to cover the show. Finally the waitress brought me my burrito inside of Crescent an hour after I ordered. By now I had a few beers and wasn't hungry. It wasn't good either. 

Kitty the waitress seems cool and claims it's not her fault. First time said it was the kitchen. Second time said there were new changes in the kitchen. I don't want  excuses, I want great service.
