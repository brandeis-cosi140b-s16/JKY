I thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed the chips and the three salsas that come to the table when you sit down from mild to hot.  

I was not impressed with the food.  I ordered steak fajitas and my friend a burrito. We were both not very happy with the food.  I think they used steakums for the fajitas and my friend just said her burritos were ehhh.
