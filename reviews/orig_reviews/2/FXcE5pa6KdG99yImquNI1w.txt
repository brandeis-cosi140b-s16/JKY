Their food is ok, nothing spectacular but not bad either. It fills you up and tastes good, like most mexican food. What I have a problem with is their business practice. I've order to-go 4 times now. On all four occasions they've tried to hold back on food that you pay for. Coincidence?...I think not!

The first time they didn't provide a taco we had paid for. Everyone can make a mistake so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The second time they tried to do it again but I double checked and caught them so they had to give it to me before I left. The third time I checked all the tacos (which were correct) but noticed that they didn't give us the guacamole we had paid for. Today they tried to do the same thing with the chunky salsa but I caught them again so I got it before I left.

Granted that all these items vary from 0.75 - 2.50 it's not too big of a deal but if they do this to a majority of orders they'll make a lot of extra money in a very unethical way.

Like I said, their food is ok but make sure you double check EVERYTHING because they WILL try to stiff you on a few bucks if they can.
