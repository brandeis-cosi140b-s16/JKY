Cantina 1511 receives only 2 stars from me.  It's not just the food.  The food is decent.  For me, it's the price.  I think Cantina 1511 is ridiculously expensive, given the quality of the food!  Again, the food isn't bad though.  It's just average.

Let me give you an example.  I went there to eat with my wife and two kids.  The kids are under 10 years old.  We ordered some guacamole for appetizer, I had a beer, my wife had a mixed drink, the kids had lemonade.  One of the kids had one taco, the other had the quesadilla appetizer for dinner.  My wife and I each had a regular entree.  The bill was $71!  I can think of a lot of better meals we all could have had for $71!

This is the second time I have been to Cantina 1511.  Friends of mine seem to really like the place.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back.
