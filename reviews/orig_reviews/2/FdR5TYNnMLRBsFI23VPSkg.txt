Do yourself a favor and avoid this place! Extremely disappointed with the food.  I'm mexican and a local here in Vegas so I know whats up, LOL!  

$15 for 5 tacos and a bottle of coke?!

First, the tacos are pricey for how tiny they are and with how little flavor.  Literally didn't taste like anything!  I honestly just felt like I was putting stuff in my mouth.

Second, they charge a 50 cent credit/debit card fee. Not sure why they need to do this as their entire menu is already over priced.

Third, there was literally a sign in every direction telling me how to live my life. There was a sign for the extra charge, a sign insisting on cash, a sign telling you to watch how much salsa you take, etc. literally a sign for a bunch of unnecessary stuff, I didn't feel welcome!

Most importantly the food was just bleh. You're better off going to another taco shop!
