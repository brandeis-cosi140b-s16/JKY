2 stars....and barely. Por que... Por que

I had no idea this place was associated with Cuidad which is better. But this place is a major let down. Food is very average. I had the poblano enchiladas... kinda of dry... nothing special. Other people at my table had similar uninspired food.  The location is poor, down a convention center hallway away from the action and the people watching. The patio overlooks the pool but during the summer it is hot as balls... and that kinda of defeats the purpose. The rest of the inside decor is blah

The real problem with this place is it is an absolute terrible value. Not the worst Mexican food but priced like a fine dining establishment with average food and decor. El Torito Mexican food a chain is just as good if not better. They also charge for WATER! What! 

Overall I really hated this place, but cant give it one star because the food is average.
