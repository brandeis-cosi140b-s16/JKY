A friend had warned me this place was bad, but I was excited to it because I love Mexican food and try to support locally owned businesses, and really- how can you mess up nachos? Well, they did. Bland, tasteless, and wtf is that cheese syrup? It reminded me of velveeta but not as good! At the end of the meal, I was hit by a case if burning indigestion so bad, I had to sprint to the nearby Walgreens. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because my guava margarita was pretty good.
