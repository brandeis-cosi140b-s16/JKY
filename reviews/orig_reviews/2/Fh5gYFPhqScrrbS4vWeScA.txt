I have friends who love this place, but it's really just bland and overpriced. $13 for a small burrito, taco, and drink is way too much for what it is. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's within walking distance of where I work, so if I'm really craving this style of food, it's not a horrible choice.
