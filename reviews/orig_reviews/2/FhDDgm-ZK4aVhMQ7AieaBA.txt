This place is not worth paying for, especially during Labor Day Weekend.  They charged $30 for guys and $20 for ladies.  We should've left to gamble, for real!  My friends and I went into the bar and just hung out on the dance floor and danced the night away, kind of.  My friend got so wasted she started letting the things out she inhaled ahaha.  Funny thing was no one saw her let it all out!  Either that or they didn't care.  It was hilarious.  We just kept going on the floor, and I got approached by some guys.  Sorry guys, I don't dance with strangers, whether you're cute or not.

If the place was cheaper entry, I'd give this place a maybe a 3 star.  Crowd were whatever looking people that night, too.

Fun times everywhere we go...
