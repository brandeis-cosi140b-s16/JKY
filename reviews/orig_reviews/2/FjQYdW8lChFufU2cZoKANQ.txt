I stopped in for drinks one night and was captivated by the incredible smells.  Naturally I returned a night later and ordered the special, mahi mahi with pineapple salsa, some fancy GCP potato that sounded delish and veggies. Oh, there was salad too but it was as dreadful as the food so I forgot. Salt salt and more salt!!!! The fish was flavorless and so so dry, the potatoes and veggie were pure salt. So sad. Two stars for great service.
