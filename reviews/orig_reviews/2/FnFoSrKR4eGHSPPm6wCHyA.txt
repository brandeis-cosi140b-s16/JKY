I was there on a Friday. Not too crowed. Enjoyed the atmosphere but nothing special. I had the lobster tacos starter. It was OK. Not bad but not great. When you try to make mexican food too fancy, you miss the boat. Its albout fresh ingredients and decent portions. The margaritas were a little sour and had to ask them to sweeten it just a tad. Excellent wait staff.
