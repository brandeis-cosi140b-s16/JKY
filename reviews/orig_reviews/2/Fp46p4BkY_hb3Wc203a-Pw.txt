This place needs a wake up call. The service is very sloppy. I had a reservation at 6:30 with family. The table was good and ready but we didn't get a server to ask us what we wanted til 40 min later. Let alone we didn't start eating til a whole hour later. The food is good but not worth the hassle. Plus it's really loud in there so we had to huddle together to even have a conversation.
