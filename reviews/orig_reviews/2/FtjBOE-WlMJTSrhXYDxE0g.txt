I dropped in here 3-4 years ago and had some nice tacos.  Although good, I guess they weren't spectacular enough to bring me back.  I got takeout for 6 people Sunday (this place open later than the superior Burrito Co.).  This was not a good experience, but I perhaps will give them another try some day.

I arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order.  They are busy.  There was just a single funnel line and I had to stand at the end behind numerous people placing their orders, rather than walk up for the phone order I expected to be ready.  Over 10 minutes later I got to the front -- order not ready and I hear a shout to the kitchen to get the phone order ready.  I pay and wait.  At least another 10 minutes pass and I am motioned back to the counter.  Looking at my notes, I see a couple of identical burrito orders and I have the foresight to ask if there are two of those in the bags.  The woman checks -- there is one.  She shouts back to the kitchen to get another one ready and apologizes.  I resume waiting.  When she calls me back she says all is ready and she threw in something else for my wait.  My destination is 5 minutes from this location.  I drive back to my wating guests.  When the food is all laid out, there is an order of 3 tacos (mine) also missing.  The beans are all cold.  I also had ordered a chile relleno with beans only.  It is good, but not enough, and it's got rice.  

I'm sure everyone has had their takeout order messed up.  That's 3 strikes on the same order, though.  Since I didn't get any tacos this time, which is what seems to be the signature item here, I can't comment on those, but the chile relleno, cold beans, and taste I got of a burrito, were merely good.  Maybe I'll drop in again within the next 3 years.
