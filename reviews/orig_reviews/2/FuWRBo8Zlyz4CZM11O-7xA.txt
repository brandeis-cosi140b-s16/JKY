We sat outside on the patio. I had tacos - pork and carne asada. Well,  the pork tacos were uber-sweet tasting - too much pineapple or something in the sauce. The Tuna my dining companion had was "good" according to him. Overall, service was just okay. The restaurant was about 1/2 fulled for lunch, but the staff seemed completely stressed out, not cheerful, and unorganized - refilling of drinks and water glasses took forever. Food wise, it was generally good, but somewhat overpriced for the portion size and food temperature could have been hotter - "hot food HOT - chilled foods COLD" is the oldest rule in restaurants. Well, the. Guacamole is delicious, but (as was mentioned by other Yelpers) chips do not come with it - you must MAKE SURE to ask for the damn chips. Weird. Anyhow, the restaurant's dining areas are lovely, but the hotel staff (the bartender in the lobby area bar was rather cold - no smile, not friendly in the least, obviously we weren't "hip"  enough to be treated politely) and the pre-lunch cocktail we had was greatly lacking in alcohol content. We walked around the pool area after lunch and were asked if we were guest of the hotel by a security person (?). We explained no, we were restaurant guests and were just "checking out" the hotel - and were clearly given the "evil eye" - so we left. Very strange vibe overall - perhaps we were older and less "hip" then their target demographics. Oh well.
