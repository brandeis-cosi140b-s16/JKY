I walked in and waited as the sign on a cut out asked, not sure where to get my take out order...  An older man with greying hair, trudged up to me glaring. No smile, no greeting, no identification as to if he even worked there. He just glared as he slowed in front of me. That's when I said I had an order for pick up. Still glaring, he pointed to the back end of the bar. He does work there as I saw him pass to the back while I paid. But Wow! Deduct two stars... 

I walked towards the back end of the bar and immediately heard and felt the stickiness of the floor. Something was not cleaned up properly, perhaps the mop was used and just spread the stickiness around? I tried maneuvering around, but there was no getting around it. Deduct a star...

The young bartender? Bus boy? Smiled and greeted me, I told him I have a pick up. He said my name, verified my order and showed me my ticket/cost $17.50. I paid and signed, he wished me well. Add a star...

The chips and salsa were the highlights. They came with both a red AND green salsa! Green was my favorite, and spicy. Red was spicier but still tasty. The blue corn tamale was smothered in sauce, so was it really blue corn? Couldn't have been able to tell you under the sauce and melted cheese. The red beef burrito, enchilada style can feed two easily. I ended up pulling out the beef and eating the flour tortilla and sauce. Tamale and burrito, Egh.. Deduct a star... Chips and salsa shouldn't be the only highlight.

Will I be back? Maybe for that green salsa, perhaps a different menu item? But then again, perhaps not.
