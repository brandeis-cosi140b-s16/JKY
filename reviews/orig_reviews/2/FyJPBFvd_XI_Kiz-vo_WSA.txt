We stayed at the Aston on my girlfriend's Groupon, and it came with two free appetizers and two free drinks from Sonrisa.

We stopped in after a wine walk around the marina, so it was probably one of their busier nights. The waiters and waitress (we had any one of three at a given time) were great - friendly, quick to take orders, quick to bring drinks, and staggered delivery of apps and entrees. Unfortunately, great service cannot save bad food.

First of all, the free appetizers we ordered were taquitos - two beef, two chicken. Guacamole is an appetizer unto itself. We each ordered enchilada combo plates, and the enchiladas left much to be desired. They were very bland, and there's no salt and pepper on the table. The Mexican rice and beans were very plain - could've spiced'em up with tomato in the rice and salt in both. We agreed that the cheese was the highlight of the meal.

The house margarita was decent, and the Sonrisa margarita was good. Maybe I should've ordered 5-6, so that I didn't care how bad the food was by the time I ate. We regretted not going for another restaurant option in the area.
