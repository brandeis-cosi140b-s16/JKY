I frequent Chipotles A LOT, but this one has really pissed me off. We asked for an order of carnitas soft tacos and crispy steak tacos. The woman behind the counter was confused by the "soft tacos portion" and then when she understood asked if we wanted corn or flour. We said flour. So we got ended up with one order of carnitas soft tacos with flour, and an order of steak soft tacos with corn. Wait, what?! Not what we asked for. It took three corrections and by the time I got my food home I realized, it actually needed four corrections. She left out the lettuce. Pretty sure we asked for it three times. Won't be back to this one unless I really need to... Hate ordering from a counter and making demands like a drill sergeant. Makes me feel bitchy.
