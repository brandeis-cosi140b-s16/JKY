I've read numerous reviews this Nevada Wahoos is not what you'd get in California. I don't know about that. I've never had Wahoos in California before, but all I can say is that place is sub-par. 

The ambiance is basically totally generic. There are lots of snowboarding and skate stickers pasted all over the place. I'm not sure what that means. Do snowboarders and skaters know what really good Mexican food is? Is that supposed to sway me or be cool? I've frequented really dumpy skater restaurants/bars before, but they were much worse, but in a good way (which gets points in my book because they're actually good). I've frequented really dumpy Mexican restaurants before and they were ALL good.

I usually give a place two chances (unless I love it) before I dump on it, but this place is pretty mediocre. 

You basically order at a fast food window, sit down at a table, then a guy brings the food out to you. Which he did. The first time my friend ordered a burrito and told them no cheese (like four times - he hates cheese because he's an idiot in my opinion - but he hates cheese). I ordered basically the same thing with cheese with sour cream. They never game me my sour cream and gave my friend cheese on his burrito. When i bit into my burrito, like 4 ounces of mystery liquid came out of it. Gross. 

The second time I came to this place a friend of mine bit into a chicken taco and was about to throw up. I'm not sure it was the food though. It's pretty bad, but not enough to throw up. He's probably just a drama queen. 

My second time I ordered a burrito without any vegetables and it was just okay. Nothing I'd come back for.

In my opinion, if you're really lazy and want to eat something good there are like a hundred other places down the street. However, the bar looked decent and probably had some NCAA basketball games going. That's about it.
