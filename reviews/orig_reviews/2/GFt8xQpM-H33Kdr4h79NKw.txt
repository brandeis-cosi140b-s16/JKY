Terrible food and drinks. Cool restaurant layout. Service staff and managers were attentive. 

It was packed for First Friday, which was opening night. Bad decision. The manager who stopped by admitted he had not yet tasted the food or drinks. One more indicator of why everything was so poorly executed.

The craft beer selection is unfamiliar but mediocre. The mixed drinks were all made in batches, according to staff, and tasted watered down. All were terrible.    
                                                     
The appetizer menu has 3 chips & dip options including salsa, guacamole and queso. The chips were chewy, as if they were either not cooked enough or they were stale. The salsa, queso and guacamole were all lacking in flavor. The queso looked and tasted like potato soup.

They have 5 tacos on the menu. The carne asada and carnitas were very dry and flavorless. Temperature was between luke warm and cold. The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.

Service staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal. They asked us to come back and we will. I will gladly update this review if food quality improves. I hope it does.
