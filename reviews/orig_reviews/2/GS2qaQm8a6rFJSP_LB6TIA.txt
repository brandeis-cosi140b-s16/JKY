I was hungry for some dinner and was on this side of town so I thought I would give this place a try. The dining area is very colorful and spacious.The kitchen is open so you can see the food being prepared when you order it. The highlight was seeing the tortillas being made and cooked right in front of me. So fresh and airy. 
My problem was not with the kitchen or the food being prepared but with the employees. They seemed overly sweaty and their shirts were very dirty.. Then there was the cashier whose black shirt was covered in white hair- I am an animal owner so I would bet my money that it was her cats or dogs hair. After seeing that, I had lost my appetite. 
I ate my 2 salmon tacos with sides of rice and beans. My food was tasty, fresh, and filling, but it was hard to enjoy.
