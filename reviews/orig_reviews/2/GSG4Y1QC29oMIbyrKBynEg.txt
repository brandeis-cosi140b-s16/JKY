$7 for a 2oz container of guac with chips. Don't ask the rude bartender for a water refill he will tell you to get it yourself.  Guess he thinks there is no tip in getting a customer a refill on water when the servers are really busy.

Food was good but don't be in a hurry.  There was not enough staff on duty to meet demand.
