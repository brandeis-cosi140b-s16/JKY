After the review in the local newspaper and rave reviews online for this restaurant my husband and I tried this restaurant over the weekend. My husband liked it more than I did. He would go back, I wouldn't eat at this restaurant again. Service was slow and the waiter barely spoke to us. The chips placed on our table when we arrived came right out of a Frito Lay bag, were cold and the basket was only half full - no seconds on chips until you ask for them. We were sat at a small table for two against the wall facing the bathroom doors when there few patrons in the restaurant and tables for 4 were available with views out the large windows to the back of the property. The food was only so-so with no garnish on the plate. I've had better take-out food. Prices were cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.  La Hacienda is just a few blocks north, go there and you'll have a better experience.
