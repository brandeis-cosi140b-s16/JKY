Ugh, stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips. That's weak. My wife whose gluten intolerant, asked for corn tortillas since it's a taco place and the waitress said all they had was flour tortillas. I ordered the special which had green peppers in the tacos. Since I'm not a fan of green peppers I requested the special w/ out the peppers.  Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the "chef" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a "pre-mix". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse! Once I heard that I knew I'd never eat here again. The food was decent but I'm not going back again.
