Okay. Very expensive. I know it's an airport bit I'm not sure the guacamole even was an entire avocado. It didn't help that they served it in a huge bowl making it seem even smaller. It was good but it's has avocado so it should be good. It wasn't anything special. They were out of my first choice beer, out of queso cheese so we couldn't get nachos (though they did give us free chips and salsa), and then ran out of chips!!! The food was okay. Nothing special. Oh well it's an airport.
