I never like when a place is slow during dinner time. At 6:45, the place should have had more people. Clue #1. The people working were incredibly friendly. They were all young, so I was impressed. BUT....the food was not impressive. I had the taco salad and the chicken was dry and tasteless. My husband had a machaca burrito and there was so much tortilla, and hardly any filling. Very disappointing. We came here for a school's fundraiser so I'm not too upset, but definitely won't be back.
