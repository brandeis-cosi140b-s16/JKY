I was SO EXCITED TO GO HERE!!!
What a total disappointment. 

The band playing in the dining room was SO LOUD we asked to move our table to a remote part of the dining room, just so we could speak to each other with out screaming. 

The food came, and I LOVE Mexican food, I love Mexican style seafood even more, I seriously love it! But everything was bland, needed spice, we were a flurry of salting, peppering, squeezing limes, dabbing hot sauces, ketchup. ANYTHING to give this flavorless food some flavor. We sent stuff back, barely ate what we ordered. SO SAD!
And it was not cheap!

Won't be back.
