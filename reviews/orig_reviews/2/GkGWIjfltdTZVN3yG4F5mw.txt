Holy wow. Why are they so mean here? What did I do? 

I swear I thought the bartender was gonna punch me when I asked about happy hour and what was on special. I would normally have made some kind of smart ass remark or been a jerk back to this guy but I was so caught off guard by his level of rudeness I just kind of sat there in shock.

The margarita I finally got, which he pawned off on a different, somewhat friendlier bartender was pretty damn good, maybe the best I had in Vegas. Unfortunately it just wasnt worth being treated like I had slapped the bartenders child to get.

Why are all the employees at TI so unhappy?????
