Gross food. Bad service. The servers always seem friendly at the beginning and then two hours later when your food hasn't come your realize that you've been had once again by the 'charm' of Macayo's. My friends used to always meet up here my freshman year in college and it always sounded fun but after eating the very low quality food...we all regretted the decision the next morning. 

Steer clear!
