Not that impressed. I was told to go here by friends and family but we must of had an off day. Our waiter was too busy covering what looked like the entire restaurant.  I think this is why our food took so long and it's my guess that it sat for a while before it actually made it over to our table.  By the time our food made it to the table I was hoping for the flavors to make up for the service but I was unimpressed. Not sure if I'll come back, maybe for happy hour to give it one more chance.
