I have been to different locations and this location is always the worst. The food Arriba serves is good but if you modify anything they will get it wrong. The service here is incredibly bad (I have worked for at least a dozen restaurants) from the hostess, servers, bartenders to the managers. The service is so slow and I never see anyone hustle. The queso fundio and fajita quesadilla (hot!) are great.
