Odd. Strange. Weird. Abnormal. Disorientingly bonkers. That is how I would describe this Jose Andres' concocted "fusion" restaurant menu-melding both Mexican and Chinese fare.

There's actually TWO sides to the menu, Mexican and Chinese. This is not a fusion restaurant in the sense that the dishes are an amalgamation of both cultures and flavors, this is actually TWO cuisines co-existing on the same restaurant menu.

We came here for a dinner, pre-clubbing in Vegas. The location at Cosmopolitan is nice, easy to access (2nd floor pavilion near Marquee night club). We had a big party of 10 and made a reservation, were seated within 15 minutes of our arrival. We had a few energetic waiters/servers and they explained the concept and threw out suggestions.  We all deiced to order and share...so people began ordering...Mexican tacos, guacamole, tuna ceviche, empanadas...and Chinese pot stickers, 20-veggie fried rice (my choice), cold noodles, etc.

We ordered a LOT of food. I think I tried everything, and you know what...NOTHING stood out...NOTHING was "oh my god good" and it was surprisingly bland, surprisingly meh, and surprisingly not all that filling. It just didn't do it for me.

Weird concept, bland food, confused and concerned taste buds and tummy, HUGE bill (like $600 huge), and we all didn't feel like we ordered and ate $600 worth of food and drink.  It was suffice to say...a MISS...and we should have gone to some other concept place like Mesa Grill, etc if we had really thought of it...only nice thing was proximity to our first club of the night...this was not what I have heard and experienced from Jose Andres' and we all left very disappointed.
