Got the wrong meal twice. Asked to talk to the GM who was just as douchey as our waiter. Food was good, when we FINALLY got the right dish. Won't go back. Prefer friendly service. Just because you work for a Fox restaurant, doesn't make you ant cooler than someone working for Applebee's. You are still a server working for tips. I hope you enjoyed our $2. Get over yourself.
