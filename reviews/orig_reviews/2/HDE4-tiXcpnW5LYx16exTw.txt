It is difficult to judge a location based upon one meal. I should give them more credit, but the machaca burrito that I had was he worst I have ever tasted. Not much more to add other than friendly help. The burrito was flat and disgusting. Nothing stood out but the dry chicken. Every machaca burrito I've ever had was beef,  shredded beef, and just full of wonderful flavor. Not this place. Suggest you try something else on the menu and give them credit where it is deserved.
