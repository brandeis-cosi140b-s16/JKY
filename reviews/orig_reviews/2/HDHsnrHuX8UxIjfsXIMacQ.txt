I absolutely love this restaurant and frequent it at least once a month. It is painful for me to report that our last two visits have been horrible. The first, we arrived around 8:45 as we always do. The host said that the kitchen is closing soon insinuating that we were to late to be served. Grudgingly we were seating and, upon settling, had a great meal. The second, we showed up at 8:30 and were told that they were closed to prepare for tomorrow. Their stated hours are 9 pm close. I am so disappointed because we love this place. I am willing to give them one more shot. Hopefully they will go back to the warm service that we were accustomed too. It is sad to see that others have made similar comments.
