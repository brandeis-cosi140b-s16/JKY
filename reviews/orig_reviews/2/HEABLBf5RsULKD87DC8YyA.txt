Bottom Line: The food was not the best, the service was non-existant.

Los Dos was recommended to me by multiple friends, so of course, I had to give it a try.  We ordered the green chile with pork that was on special as well as the chimi.  Neither of these items were anything special.  The pork was quite fatty and did not appeal to me for this reason primarily, but in addition, the rice and beans lacked a distinct flavor putting them at the bottom of their categories.  The chimi was better, but the meat didn't have the expected strong flavor.

The salsa was actually pretty good, but the chips were stale and thick which really hampers a good salsa experience!

Finally, the service was terrible.  First, no one at the door.  Finally, we found someone at ended up being told to seat ourselves.  Then, no server ever came for drinks or food until someone came and asked us if we still needed to be helped.  The proceeded to go and find the right person, give up 5 minutes later and then came back to take our order.  Then we waited another 5 minutes for drinks and salsa.  Never received a refill on either of them.  To top it off, then we never got a bill.  I actually got up to look for someone and finally found someone to help get us checked out.
