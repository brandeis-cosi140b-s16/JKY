Disappointing. Tortilla chips extremely salty. Main course (fajitas) brought out at same time as appetizer, and meat was not sizzling at all. Tortillas were just like ones in the supermarket; nothing better. Waiter was kind and took appetizer off our bill. Won't be returning..food too disappointing.
