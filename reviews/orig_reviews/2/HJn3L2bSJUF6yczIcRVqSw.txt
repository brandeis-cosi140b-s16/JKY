I hate to be a jerk, but I am not a fan. When I think Mexican food I envision spicy food that makes my nose run and bold flavors that dance along my tongue...unfortunately my dreams were crushed at Tia Rosa. So, with that said. If you have super bland taste (which there is nothing wrong with that), or love sweet sugary syrup on your tacos, then this is the place for you. If not, stay away.
