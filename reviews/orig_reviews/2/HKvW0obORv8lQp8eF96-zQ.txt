I am a Nacho fan, love em.  Was so excited to see a NACHO restaurant.  For me that's like a little piece of heaven on earth.  The staff was awesome, our waiter was very helpful and very kind with my kiddos.  The food well that was another story.  Normally a ton of stuff on nachos is great, here there is too much stuff.  The nachos were a nasty soggy mess about halfway through the meal.  The meat was non existent,  the cheese was a gloppy gloop.  My husband and I left half our plates after digging through with forks trying to find something edible.  The kids nachos were a plate of harden cheese with a few pieces of chicken on top.  Over all a pretty disappointing visit.  Can't say we'll be rushing back.
