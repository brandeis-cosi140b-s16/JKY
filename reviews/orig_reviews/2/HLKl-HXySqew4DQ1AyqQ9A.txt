This place has some great curb appeal... Being a Mexican resturant you would think the drinks would be outstanding it's just the opposite a sugar pre made mess.. Mango jalapeño I can't even explain it.. Didn't even taste like either and the garnish was a lime... Should have been a jalapeño 
The waitress was amazing super nice And kept checking on us which made the experience better knowing they know how to pick the staff  this just need to be filtered into the kitchen and bar
The food was ok just seemed pre packed frozen food :(
