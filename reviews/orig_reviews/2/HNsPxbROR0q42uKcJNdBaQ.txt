The 35 minute wait ended up being over an hour. Thankfully the areas surrounding the restaurant were entertaining enough to keep me occupied. The corn salsa was so bland that I felt the need to add a pinch of salt to each bite to experience some flavor before I gave up on it completely. 

My family ordered three different dishes 
1. Beer battered fish tacos had way to much batter. We could barley tell there was even fish in it
2. Chicken quesadillas were nothing more than mediocre. Chicken was very dry  
3. BBQ Mahi Tacos were decent. The slaw on top was a bit overpowering but overall, it was the best out of the three dishes. 

Maybe my expectations of tacos is different being from Texas, but I had heard such good things about this place that I set the bar high in my head. If I were to come back here, it would be for the environment, not so much the food.
