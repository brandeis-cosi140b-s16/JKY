I was in Charlotte for a conference, and always noticed how busy Vida looked when I passed by. We decided to try it for our last night in town. We ordered the guacamole, which was not the best I have had, but was pretty decent. We also had margaritas, which were nothing to write home about. My main course, the shrimp and crab enchiladas with a side of roasted corn and plantain/black bean mash, was delicious! 

Had it only been for the food, I would probably rate Vida 3 or 4 stars. However, the service was horrible! The food took FOREVER to arrive. The chips and salsa took about 15 minutes after the server finally told us they were being brought out. The guacamole, which we ordered at the same time, took another 20 minutes or so to arrive. Drinks for some reason took at least 10 or 15 minutes to come out. The waitress made comments about our wait time but never once apologized or tried to offer something to make it better. She blamed it on the restaurant being new. "We've only been open for 2 weeks so things are a little backed up." Regardless of who's fault it was. hers or the kitchen's, she didn't try to rectify the situation. Even when getting the check, we asked for two separate checks and because the manager took $2 off 4 out of our 5 drinks, it took her three times to get our check divided correctly (food on one, drinks on the other should not be that difficult!)

All in all, decent-good food, bad service. Hopefully the other servers are better!
