This is for the La Salsa Cantina location in Planet Hollywood Casino Miracle Mile shops.

I had breakfast and tried the $3.95 breakfast special, it came with eggs, bacon, and potatoes, the portion size was small, I am glad I had one biscuit with gravy on the side.  The coffee was strong and hot, the service was good since the place was not very busy, it was about 8am on a Saturday.

The only drawback I saw was the hostess that seats people could have been more on the ball, there were people waiting to be seated and she was nowhere in site, since the place was not busy at all, I could see her being more courteous and helpful.  Our server was very nice and helpful though.

For the price I paid, the total bill for two people was less that $20.00, I would maybe look around more next time if I was to try any of the other places in the Miracle Mile shops area that serve breakfast.
