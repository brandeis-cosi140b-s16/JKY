I use to love this place, great view, pretty good food, lively atmosphere until one of their waiters stole my debit card information. I was dining with my family and once he returned the bill, my card was missing and magically appeared 5 minutes later after questioning him what happened to my card? While I was driving home I happened to check my account to be safe and sure enough within 20 minutes there was an online purchase. I called management at restaurant they never returned my call. This isn't the first time the waiter has done this because the phone number attached to the transaction my bank could not even trace, they seemed to use an online coupon store with over 20,000 vendors and nearly impossible to find the exact one. My advice: food isn't that great and if you want the view, pay cash!
