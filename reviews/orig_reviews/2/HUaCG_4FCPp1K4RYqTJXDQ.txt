Barrio Queen was a huge disappointment. DO NOT get the tacos. They were so small the table laughed when they brought it - we thought it was a joke, looked smaller than an appetizer. They had numerous items on the menu that were not available and the waiter was pretty rude. With all the good restaurants in the area, dont waste your time or money at Barrio Queen.
