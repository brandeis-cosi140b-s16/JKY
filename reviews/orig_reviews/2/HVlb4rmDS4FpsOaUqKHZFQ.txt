5 star for friendly service & beautiful decor. Cute date spot. Too bad food was disappointing. Everything was bland & over cooked. Nothing was seasoned. Tamales were old??? Just tasted like boiled pork that sat in water too long. Not the place to go for Mexican food but nice to hang out for snacks. Chips were fresh & grilled prawns wrapped in bacon was yummy.
