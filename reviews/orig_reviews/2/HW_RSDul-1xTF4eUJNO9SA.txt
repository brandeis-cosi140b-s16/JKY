The chips and salsa were super good, but the rest of the food -- a variety of tacos -- were just ok. They SOUNDED as if they would be amazing, but they lacked taste. It is a very nice looking restaurant and in the summer it would be great to sit outside and eat here and have a few drinks. I would order something different though.
