ok. i love macayo's, i always have. the food is pretty darn consistent and when i'm going to a chain restaurant, that is what i expect and actually what i want. as per usual, the food was exactly what i had anticipated.  i would have loved to give a 4 or 5 star review on the food, but that's not what this review is really about. THIS is a service review. 

Matthew and i went to dinner with my parents last night (Sunday) around 645 and Paul was our server. now, i don't know if he was new or one of those older, jaded servers who think they know everything. sometimes they're hard to tell apart. this guy seemed like he didn't want us or anyone else to be there, like he had better things to be doing than his JOB. if you don't like people, DO NOT BE A SERVER. seriously.  had to ask for refills two separate times after near empty drinks (1" left in glass) sat for 10 minutes, had to ask for more chips twice, and he dropped Matthew's plate on the way out of the kitchen and said "did you hear that crash? that was your taco, they're making you another one." which took another 10 minutes. oh and my favorite...my dad ordered shrimp fajitas.  the food comes (minus Matthew's) and what kind of fajitas do we receive? beef. i said to my dad, "didn't you order SHRIMP fajitas?" he replied that he did in fact do so and stated such to the server. Paul said that was incorrect, that he wrote down beef. my dad said that wasn't what he ordered and that he would indeed like shrimp. so i don't know how you get beef from shrimp, or even steak from shrimp. yes, they're all monosyllabic. but they've got differing vowel sounds and one of those words starts with a different letter even!

he was totally rude and when i go back (it's inevitable, i like their generic food occasionally) i will specifically request to not sit in Paul's section.
