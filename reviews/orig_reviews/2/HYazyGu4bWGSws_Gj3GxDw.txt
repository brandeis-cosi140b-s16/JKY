First time I have been here. I am all about customer service and I was disappointed. The lady behind the counter acted as though I was bothering her while I ordered my food to go. My husband and I can't have cheese on basically anything. So I ordered a bean and cheese burrito for my son- he can have cheese and I ordered a taco combo and she asked "what type of meat?!" In a tone I give my husband when I am bothered... We'll excuse me... I didn't know there were options. Geez. Mind you I had my 10 month old daughter with me which might have been why that lady seemed bothered because my daughter was babbling while I was ordering. I ordered a fish taco and a drink. I waited and it didn't take long to get my food. So I went into the car strapped my daughter in and then realized she didn't give me my drink. I walked in again and waited for her to even acknowledge me and I told her I didn't get my drink. She even seemed bothered by that. Fish taco and carne asada tacos were smaller than expected. Food was ok... Not the best I have had. I would have given another star if the customer service was better.
