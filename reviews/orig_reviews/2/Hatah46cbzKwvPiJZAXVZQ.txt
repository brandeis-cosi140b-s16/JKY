terrrrrrrrrrrrrrible service. i was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and when my drink did come, it was horrendous! it was some hibiscus concoction, but hibiscus has flavor and this had none. and the prices are nothing to sneeze at, especially for pittsburgh.

the patio is quite cute, but the bench arrangements make it impossible to add more seating to your table. and the benches are horribly uncomfortable, even when you're not squished 3 to a bench.

but omigod this place has such potential! their exterior is one of the most alluring i've ever seen. get it together, round corner cantina!
