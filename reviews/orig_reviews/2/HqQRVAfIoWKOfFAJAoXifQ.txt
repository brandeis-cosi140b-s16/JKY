A friend told me this was the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas so we went for lunch. If this is the best i feel sorry for Las Vegas. The tasteless chips, bean dip and hot salsa were awful. The Fideo soup was a watery mess. My combo contained a dry tasteless tamale, an ok beef taco and a watery burrito.  Super Mex hands down has better Mexican food and more reasonable prices.
