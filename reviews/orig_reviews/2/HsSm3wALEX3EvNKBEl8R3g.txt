I would love to love this place, support my local economy and all that Jazz but I just can't. The staff is always extremely friendly and I love the beach shack in the middle of Phoenix. Problem is, the food just isn't very good. The only thing more bland than the carne asada is the chicken. I've had mexican food in Minnesota and I'm pretty sure it had more character than this local gem. Sorry Two Hippies, you have a solid concept going but your menu needs a serious overhaul.
