Oooooo FAIL.  Ok so its late and you're thinking "man I want some food...hey that place is open...lets check it out".   We were the only people there to eat...others were there chatting up the bartender and gaming.    Guys... How in a place with only 2 customers do you serve cold... Not luke-warm but cold tacos?   Chicken nachos were pretty good, but cold tacos?  Hey I get it its late, but either you're open for business or you're not.   sorry guys
