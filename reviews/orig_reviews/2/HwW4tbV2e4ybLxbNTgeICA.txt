Last night we had yet another terrible encounter with the head hostess/manager (older woman).  She is sooo rude to customers if you don't fit into her little box of rules.  There has got to be a better way to be polite and enforce policies!  We tried to sit on the front patio where we always sit (bc we try to avoid her at all costs) and she wouldn't let us.  She said no one could serve us out there, meanwhile 2 other tables were out front eating food and having drinks. 

I tried to have a bridesmaid party there one night, couldn't make reservations, and couldn't be seated until everyone was there.  We were planning on being there a few hours to chat and drink and it didn't matter.  She wanted us to know our friends food order that was going to be late to the party or we couldn't be seated.  Again I just avoided her and us girls sat in the bar and were served by the bar tender.  

She's so rude that you instantly just want to leave the restaurant and find somewhere else to go.  This location is losing business bc of this woman, I've left multiple times and so has a friend of mine that has the same opinion of her.  Maybe they are ok with treating customers rudely just so they can get as many people in and out of the door as possible but there has to be a better way.
