Service was excellent. They kept checking on us to make sure our drinks were never empty and to make sure the bean dip and chips were replenished. With that being said, I wish I could say the same for the food and comfort. I'm not sure why there are sooo many great reviews on the food here. Maybe I am spoiled from being raised in a Hispanic family and having authentic food? but then again, they are supposed to have "authentic" food. My 5 yr old wanted a chicken taco. She loves chicken. I saw her taking the chicken out, and I asked her what was wrong? she said she does not like it. Seeing that this little girl is a meat lover, we found that odd, so my wife tried the chicken and spit it out. She even showed me how it looked. It looked old and like it was microwaved. It was terrible and tasted like poultry without seasoning. My wife and I had the Carne Asada Torta, it was edible but it was nothing to make us return. The steak could have had more flavor The fideo soup had NO flavor at all. None of us finished it. The bean dip was just okay. The rice, I will admit was good. It was the best thing we had there.  Seating is very uncomfortable for a family of 5. They sat is in an area next to the door. There was a wall but it had a decorative window opening in which all the cold air kept coming in, every time the door was opened it did not close because it would get stuck. Our food was freezing cold in a matter of minutes and my kids had to eat with their coat on. ( it is December). Needless to say, we will NOT be returning to Michoacan. We will stick to Leticias.
