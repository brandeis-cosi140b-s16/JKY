$4.50 for a corona?! C'mon! That is ridiculous. For just $2 more I can buy 6 of them. Also, their margaritas aren't anything special. I ordered a chambord margarita with patron tequila and it was just meh. It was really sweet and they use that pre-made margarita mix. If you're going to charge $9 for a margarita at least use the quality margarita mix or make your own.
