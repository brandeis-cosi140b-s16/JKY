La Comida's comida is not fantastic and its service is far below that. 

Went here with a few friends on a Tuesday night. It wasn't busy but we had trouble being served. It took forever to get someone around to help us. Chips and salsa were empty for a while before we were served new ones. We waited and looked around for our server when we wanted to order. He just hung around in the back. The place wasn't busy either.

The food wasn't anything to write home about. It should be more memorable. I just remember the rice being bland. This is partly due to the blood orange margaritas. Those are delicious without being too sweet. If you want to enjoy yourself, get a pitcher of that. 

Overall, it's a very underwhelming experience where the service takes it down a notch. They lack any enthusiasm. They don't even pretend to care that you are there. It's all going through the motions. With plenty of places that offer better Mexican food (and some even downtown like El Sombrero), this place should definitely place more emphasis on their service.
