This is definitely a place you have to try for yourself, if you're are into or require the following: 

a) greasy food
b) an option to fast food
c) high calories
d) a good hangover food

If your'e into healthy eating, then this is probably not the place for your.  The food was alright, but I felt so guilty and had to add extra time to my workout just to balance things out.  I didn't even eat a quarter of my Kimchi fried rice (it was SUPER greasy, heavy and just probably exceeded over 1000 calories).  The pork lettuce wraps were yummy, but again, that guilt feeling took over and I only had one.  

If you could careless about the caloric intake and greasy foods, this is a better option than say Jack n' the Box or Panda Express and especially Taco Bell; but in my opinion it's comparable.

Try it for yourself; I did and don't think I'll be back, but at least I tried it.  

My fortune cookie was hilarious though, it read:

"Over prepare, then go with the flow" [in bed].  haha!
