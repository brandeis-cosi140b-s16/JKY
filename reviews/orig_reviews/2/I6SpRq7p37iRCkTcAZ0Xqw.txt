I've visited Ricardo's so many times and it's always been very good. However, today the experience was less than what I expected and unfortunately I brought a guest who was visibly not impressed. Food was mediocre with very dry chicken in both entrees and salsa was bland. Iced tea was weak. Service has always been very good and this trip was no exception which is why I give this site 2 stars instead of 1.  I'll give it another chance but not right away.
