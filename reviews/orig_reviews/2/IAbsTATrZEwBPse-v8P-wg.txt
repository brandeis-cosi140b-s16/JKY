This is for the Z Tejas on Bethany Home Rd and 16th street in Phoenix. 

Waiter was rude, glasses, red hair and goatee. We tried to ask questions about the menu and he was acting annoyed and a little pompous. My girlfriend asked for an appetizer after we told him our drink order. He said "ok" turned around and walked off before we could say anything else. He was acting annoyed and irritated.  He came back and put our drinks down, we said thank you, he curtly said "You're welcome" and walked off before we could say anything. 10 minutes later he walked by our table with a dirty plate and my GF had to say "Excuse me" three times to get him to stop. My GF asked about the size of the quasadilla we ordered, he said "It is four slices. You will see it when comes out" and walked off. Apparently this guy likes things to go in the order he wants and if you mess with the order of things he feels he us being bossed around or put out. OCD and rude. We walked out and won't be back. Hope he enjoyed our quasadilla.
