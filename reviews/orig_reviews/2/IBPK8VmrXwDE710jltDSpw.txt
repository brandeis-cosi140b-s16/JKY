The bathroom was funny. The urinals were labeled with beer names. The wall said something about beer recycling. So I was under the impression that when you use the urinal, that is what you are allegedly drinking if you order draft beer. I think that is what was meant by the signs. One urinal said "Heineken" and one said "Corona". I thought that was an alright joke. So I guess don't buy drafts there. Because it is urine. There were three urinals lined up with no partition, one urinal was off to the side with a wooden wall. It had a sign that said "Shy Guy". That cracked me up. There was 25 cent beers of schwag Miller High Life, well worth it. Good time because of the dude I was with, otherwise, this place is lame as all hell.
