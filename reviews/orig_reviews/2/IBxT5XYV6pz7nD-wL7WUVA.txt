I've been here many times but unfortunately my last experience was not what I call a good one. I ordered the chicken and corn enchiladas and became incredibly sick. All symptoms pointed to mild food poisoning and I felt horrible for 3 days straight. Just because of this one experience I will most likely not be returning, mainly due to the fear factor of getting sick again. Vida Cantina, I recommend to start hiring chefs that know how to handle food properly because this is unacceptable. I truly hope no one else shared a similar experience.
