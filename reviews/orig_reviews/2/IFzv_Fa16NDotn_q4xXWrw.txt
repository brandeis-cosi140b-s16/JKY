Nice patio, and interesting salsa with the chips while you wait for your meal, but I can't believe what we got for $70: Four $7 margaritas that had no trace of alcohol and three forgettable tacos. Plus we were charged extra for a side of rice ... Rice and beans are standard sides in Tex-Mex and don't cost extra. That's the way it should be.
