A three star means I would try it again, but I can't say that I would. Mavericks has a rustic bar atmosphere with lots of TVs. Service was fine. The menu was very interesting and I chose the chicken tacos and fried avocado tacos (neat idea). I also had the white queso. 

The queso was basically just cheese. It seems they could spunk it up with jalape√±os or something. The tacos were ok, but they were served lukewarm. Even the black beans I chose for a side were not hot.  

My friend said they had been there before and liked it, but I wouldn't risk taking a friend or meeting someone for a lunch appointment.
