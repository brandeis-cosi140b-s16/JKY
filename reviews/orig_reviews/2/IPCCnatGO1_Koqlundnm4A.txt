I'm here from Houston working at uncc for research...after nearly a month of no mexican food, I brought my parents here since they made the 18 hour trip to see me....after seating ourselves...our waitress spoke to us in spanish. Spanish??? really? I rolled it off even though it was quite annoying. The chips and salsa came...the chips were decent enough-nothing to rave about but the salsa tasted like ragu meets some cilantro and onions. It was terrible. I ordered enchiladas which weren't awful my father dined on the mole which had the same sauce as my enchiladas....bland at best. the only thing that made my enchiladas worth it was the queso fresco that topped it. The beans were more of a blob...nothing special- the rice was fairly decent. Everything on my plate lacked seasoning. My mother had no complaints about her meal but she's nicer than I am. The waitstaff was nice...they are a bit lax but coming from Houston I kind of expected it...after my remarks about the salsa they promptly brought us different salsa which fit more of my expectations. Overall it was ok...nothing special not good enough for 4 stars...maybe I showed up on the wrong day...or maybe I'm just used to better mexican food.
