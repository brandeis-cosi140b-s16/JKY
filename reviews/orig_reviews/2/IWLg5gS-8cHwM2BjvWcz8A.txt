I think this restaurant's day has come and gone.  My margarita was cold. Yes, that is all I can say about it. It was served in a small wine glass filled to the brim with ice.  A very small amount of average margarita mix. The salsa they initially brought us was bland. Really the whole meal lacked flavor. The service was okay, although our waiter forgot our guacamole. He brought it after we asked for it again. It ended up being the best thing about our dinner. Overall this place needs to kick it up a notch.
