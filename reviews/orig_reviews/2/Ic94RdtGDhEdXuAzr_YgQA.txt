We had a reservation made one month in advance, called to confirm day of as it was a larger party. When we arrived there was a party taking the only larger table and we had to wait 1/2 hour before sitting. 
Once the bill came, it cost $210 for 3 pitchers of margaritas, what??? Should have ordered 3 amazing bottles of wine anywhere else for that price. Heads up management, pitchers traditionally are what you order to save money!
My food was decent (shrimp tacos) but other people complained about dry beef etc.
Disappointing to make a reservation for no reason, inexcusable!!
