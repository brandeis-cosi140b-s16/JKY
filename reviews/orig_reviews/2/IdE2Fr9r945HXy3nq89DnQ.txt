I went here with very high hopes, given the good reviews on here.  But I came away thinking that it is unlikely I will ever go back.

Service - the cashier was not friendly and got confused over me telling her that I wanted a crispy taco.  She thought I was asking for all of the ingredients to be fried to a crispy texture.  Really?

Food - I have been looking for a great shredded beef taco, and this is definitely not the place.  Cheap hard taco shells that are not cooked to order (think Taco Bell) - no wonder she had no idea of what a crispy taco is.  The meat essentially had no flavor at all.

This was my first time going to this place, so, in fairness, maybe they have better tasting food on the menu.  But I came to a place called Los Taquitos, looking for a great tasting taco.  I left very disappointed, and without any desire to return.  I guess my quest for the perfect taco will just have to continue.
