They need to work out the kinks, that's for sure.  Diablo's?  Pray to the devil that you get your food warm and you can see it.

1.  The lighting was SO low up top that they had to turn on the disco lights which were then blaring in our eyes.
2.  Food came out COLD.  No joke.  We had four plates of tacos and all were cold.  The fajitas were sizzling though.
3.  Salsa is excellent.  So good, I asked for a refill.  Um, ok, they charged me $6 for salsa refill.  EXCUSE ME?  
4. Drinks were extra strong, but they should be for $10.  And they didn't have Ketel One.  That was a $10 Stoli.
5. Waitress was very sweet and trying really really hard.
6.  Bartenders downstairs (the girls) were absolutely clueless and it took two of them to figure out how to run a credit card--while 5 of us were still waiting to get served.  Thankfully the guy bartender was on the ball and stepped up to the plate.  He also flashed "Blue Steel."  That bartender deserves 5 stars.
7.  I finally complained at the end about the cold food and why were they charging me $6 for salsa when the food they brought out was sub par?  So the manager took off the salsa charge and the $8 chip charge as well.

Besides all that, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I think the downstairs was better.  The hostesses that I encountered were very nice and inquired about our party, what was it for, making small talk.  Overall though, like I said, they need to iron out the kinks.
