I had great expectations for Barrio Queen but the second I walked in with my date the hostess (short blonde hair and thin) never gave a hint of a smile, what a turn off.  Felt like I was a burden more than a welcome guest.  Place was not busy as we were there around 9PM but sat at our table wondering when the chips and water would arrive.  After 5 minutes we left with no intention of really going back as there are too many other choices on that strip to choose from.
I only hope the owner is reading this.  As a business owner first impressions are with the host or hostess then the service.  What a shame as this is not the only business to behave lack luster, such as Peterson's Ice Cream which get's my next review.
