Fun entrance and nice decor.  Took a client to lunch and it was almost impossible to hear her speak above the music.  Note to self:  Don't bring anyone you want to talk to. The server noticed that we couldn't hear each other and offered to turn the music down.  It's one thing to create an environment, but just loud music for lunch doesn't cut it.  Food was good, but  $12.00 tacos seems a bit pricey.  Needs help on making the food live up to the prices.
