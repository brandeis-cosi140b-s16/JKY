At one point in time, this was our go to place for great, authentic Mexican food. But, the last few times we've gone, our experience was not so good. The portions have become smaller, the prices higher. See, the problem is the plate is the same size it has always been. And at one time your plate was served to you full. Now the plate is only 1/2 full. We just went last night. Ordered the same two entrees we just about always order. One being the fish tacos, which have always been my favorite. But this time the fish had a funny smell & taste and the rice & beans were pretty much non existent. This place has become the Denny's of Mexican food. And it's all very bland. Sad. We really miss the way it used to be.
