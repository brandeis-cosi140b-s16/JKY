The only thing giving this place 2 stars in my book instead of 1 is that the service was actually pretty good - we were seated promptly, were well attended to, and our server was friendly.

The food was god-awful!  A friend and I weren't all that hungry, but figured we should eat something before heading to the strip for the night.  I had to try the chili con queso since it is one of my weaknesses.  This was one of the worst I've had.  Not only was it velveeta-esque, it really didn't have any kick to it at all.  I added healthy amounts of a couple of different hot sauces on the table and it still was barely edible.  I also had the chicken tortilla soup.  Weirdest tortilla soup I've ever had.  Once again not very spicy, and the "broth" was like a thick barbeque-sauce.  And, the most plentiful ingredient in my soup - corn!  What little chicken was in there was tasty.  I hunted it out and left the rest.  My friend got a couple of the street tacos and wasn't thrilled.  He actually commented that we should have gone to Roberto's (which I guess is a fast food Mexican place - I'm not from the area).

To top it all off, it's supposed to be a sports bar and the TV we were sat next to was on the fritz, with the color and picture going out at regular intervals.

My advice, skip this place and find somewhere else.  Maybe Roberto's?
