Let me begin by saying that I'm a big Border Grill fan. I go to the Santa Monica location all the time and it's pretty good.  The prices at the Las Vegas location are really high, but understand because of being inside the hotel. That said, the food was awful. I ordered the Ensenada fish tacos and they were tasteless. Tortillas were cold. The rice was cold. And it took over 30 min to get served. My opinion, not worth the price.
