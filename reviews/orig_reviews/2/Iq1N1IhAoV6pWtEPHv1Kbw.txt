This is an update from my last review of 5 stars May 2012. The chicken enchildadas and tamales was tasteless. The refried beans were watered down; apparent in its appearance substantiated by its taste. The chicken mole was also lacking in flavor. We won't be returning; especially since there are so many other better restaurants with new ones cropping up continuously.
