I feel a little guilty giving only a 2 star rating, especially since I tend to be so generous with the stars. Border Grill wasn't terrible, but it was incredibly unspectacular in a city that has a lot of fun places to eat at every corner.

One of my girlfriends loves Mexican food and will basically choose anything resembling it. So when we booked a stay at THEhotel, she was really eager to try Border Grill.

We had lunch and opted to sit outdoors. We nibbled on some guac along with the complimentary chips and salsa. She ordered a bloody mary and a mix of 3 tacos (I can't remember exactly which ones), while I had a glass of white sangria and the turkey tostada salad. 

I ordered my salad sans cilantro, and when it arrived, it was absolutely filled with the evil green stuff. I realize this is a common ingredient in Mexican food, but restaurants have always been kind in accommodating my request. It had already taken a very long time for the food to come, so I was a little disappointed. The waitress owned up to the mistake and took the blame for it, though, which I did appreciate. The salad itself, even corrected, was just okay. The drinks were also fine. Service was pleasant but slow and not exceptional.

Overall, I did not hate my experience, but I wouldn't recommend Border Grill nor would I return.
