The concept is nice: you take hawaiian barbecue (delicious) and then you combine it with mexican food (also delicious). The result, however, is subpar. Everything is so savory, but the meat is too sweet? I've tried this place at least twice because I'm desperate to like it, but it's just not jiving with me.


 The fact that there is a drive thru and always a good groupon deal is hella sweet, but eh. I think it's time to move on.
