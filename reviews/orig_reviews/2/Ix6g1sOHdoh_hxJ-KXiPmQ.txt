I just came from one of the worst Southpark dining experiences I've ever had. Actually when I heard that Chuy's was coming to town I was a little surprised; when you think Southpark, Chuy's isn't exactly what I would have in mind. Don't get me wrong, the food was good (Maverick's is better) - service was as well as could be expected given the crowd and how patrons were stuffed into dining rooms like sardines; Chuy's is reminiscent of the restaurant at South of the Border off interstate 95...I swear I was looking for Pedro! This restaurant is definitely geared towards the minivan generation...cheap eats! But don't let the inexpensive menu fool you...it comes at a price. My ears are still ringing from the noise level; kids running around unsupervised and harried servers trying to navigate around kids and overcrowded dining rooms. Given the history of this location (at least four other restaurants have come and gone) I hope that cheap, loud dining will survive in Southpark...if not, I pity the next restaurant that has to redecorate.
