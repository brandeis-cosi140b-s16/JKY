Not a fan.  We tried the pomegranate guacamole, pad Thai, sea bass and ahi tuna taco's. The pad Thai was good but very sweet. Too sweet for my liking. The ahi tacos were good but nothing special. The guac was quite good according to others in my party.  I was unable to eat it.  In the menu it states dried fruit added... This included kiwi and I'm allergic.  And lastly the sea bass.... Very sweet glaze on it...too sweet again.  Also it was terribly fishy.  Unfortunately sumo...I don't think we will be returning. Service was excellent, presentation of food was excellent and establishment was very clean.
