The ratings by other Yelpers was accurate .. YELPERS! Food is expensive and average ... $15 Marg with Don Julio... $4.00 taco's ( small ) and stuffed chili with chicken was$19.00 , ... best item was the fresh of the guacamole& chips.. -- probably be back for Happy Hour sometime but will pass on dinner or lunch ..  2 for dinner and 2 drinks each and the bill was 90.00... Oh we'll..
