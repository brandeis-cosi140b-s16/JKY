I don't care much for their menu, but the carne asada (steak) quesadilla I ended up ordering was HUGE and very tasty!  The waitress was attentive.  The leftovers were great.  Oh, and parking here was surprisingly
easy in their lot (no need to go to the overflow across the street).

However, I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise "music" that was painful.  The restaurant was also packed, so people were yelling OVER the yelling "music" which made me want to just leave, which I would have if I wasn't with my mother (who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some
of the horrendous experience).  I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair, and not feel like a night club!  If this was management-approved music, and not some employee's iPod plugged in to the sound system, I disagree with their "mood/environment" choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door.
