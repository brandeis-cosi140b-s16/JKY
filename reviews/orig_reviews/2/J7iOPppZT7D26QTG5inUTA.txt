Just okay...now.

Ponchos used to be so much better than my experience today. This was actually my first time dining inside the restaurant instead of take-out. It was no doubt really cool to see the presidential room dedicated to Bill Clinton, but the food today in no way represented that prestige.

As usual with any Mexican restaurant, we got chips and salsa.Unfortunately, the salsa lacked the flavor that I remembered it having. For lunch, I got the Borracho Burro and got to try a tamale and chicken enchilada. The enchilada was okay, but the tamale flat out sucked today. It was pretty flavorless and didn't feel like it was made with any heart. My burrito was alright, but it didn't have any umph to it flavor wise... I could order the same thing at a lot of different restaurants in the valley...it was mediocre.

Today was a sad day because my visit today made it just that much harder to drive out to South Phoenix to dine here. It's not just the distance anymore, but it's due to a lack of desire for Poncho's renowned dishes. 

I hope whatever happened here turns around, but I'm not the only one who feels this way, and that's a shame.
