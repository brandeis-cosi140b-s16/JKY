For a restaurant that has nacho in the name, I plan on trying some great nachos. I came with two friends around 8pm, we ordered the tostada nachos and for 13$ I expected more. The plan was to share the nachos and get more food but the nachos were so underwhelming we ended the meal there. I like nachos with layers and a substantial amount of cheese. These however were the typical bar nachos, small pile of chips, small amount of cheese, tons of beans etc. It is not that difficult to layer chips, cheese, more  chips, more cheese and then toppings. 

Mediocre food aside, I was feeling some coffee as I noticed the espresso machine. I asked the waitress what coffee drinks were really good, she said one and then just stood there. I'm a former barista so if I ask about your coffee I want to hear if you know what you're talking about. What's so great about the lion coffee they serve? I'll never know since I'm not planning on going back. 

Working in a restaurant I know you can get busy and forget things. However, I don't like to ask for a check and have you forget because a friend comes in and you're talking to them at the bar. After asking another employee for the check, our waitress came running over and said "sorry love!".. Gave us the check and knowing we would probably need change took off yet again. It should not take 10+ minutes to pay for food especially when there are only 2 other small tables. 

Two stars because this is a cool looking space, very warm and interesting decor. It was not an experience I want to repeat unless the nachos improve .
