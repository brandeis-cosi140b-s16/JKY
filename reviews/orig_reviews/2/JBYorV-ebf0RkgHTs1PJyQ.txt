Carlos 'n Charlie's is located inside of the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. It's your Americanized Mexican food establishment. The food isn't authentic Mexican food at all, but the taste isn't that horrible. So why the 2 stars? The portions are too small, the price is too high and the service isn't the best. 

At first our waiter was pretty chill, but after taking our order we didn't see too much of him after. I guess the only good thing was that he gave us a margarita for free since he made a mistake. 

Food:
I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice. Everything was seasoned pretty well, but I wish it had more of a kick to it. Also, I honestly could have probably ate 2-3 plates since the portion really wasn't that large...

Overall, I'm glad I tried Carlos 'n Charlie's one time, but I most likely won't be back. I'd rather spend $20+ on a meal that will actually fill me up.
