I was excited to see a Wahoo's open in Vegas as I have been to a couple in California.  After ordering and finding a seat, I examined the receipt and noticed that I was overcharged.  I brought the error to the attention of the cashier who seemed a bit confused.  She brought over a bartender who was friendly and said he would take care of it.  Soon after, the food arrived and it was just ok.  After eating, I waited and waited, but nobody came over.  In fact, while delivering food to another table, she seemed to avoid looking in my direction.  I eventually had to go back over to her and ask if someone was going to take care of refunding my money.  She said she would find someone.  Finally, some other guy came out of the back and took care of it.  

In the end, I did get my money back, but I am annoyed that I had to ask again for my refund.  It is an uncomfortable situation and someone should have taken care of it the first time.
