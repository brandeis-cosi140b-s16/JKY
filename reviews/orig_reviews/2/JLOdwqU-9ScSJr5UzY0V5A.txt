As a native Arizonan and Mexican food lover I don't dig this place at all. I mean, it looks great and has nice patios but the food and prices are lame. Our waiter couldn't answer questions about the food. Simple questions, even. The rice is the blandest Mexican rice I've had and the beans are overwhelmed by an artificial bacon and liquid smoke flavor. The chips were passable but the red salsa was impotent and the green sauce tastes like it's half sugar. I had a pork burro, and the meat was of good quality but flavorless not to mention they put the same bad-tasting beans into the burro too, which was not mentioned on the menu. And $8 for a 10" cheese crisp? C'mon. In this town, you don't have to drive far to get good Mexican food at a good price but you will have to drive past this place. Sorry.
