This busy restaurant is tucked on the second floor above the Diamond Market. There's a single door between Diamond Market and the Oyster House for access. Las Velas is located in the old Market Street Ale House space. Luckily, they have the door clearly labelled and a sidewalk sign.

Las Velas was pretty busy on a Wednesday afternoon, but I'm not sure why.

I placed a take out order and when I arrived, everyone seemed confused as to where my order was.  I was asked a few times, "Who did you speak to?"  As if I remember, or should have to remember, who took my order.  They didn't take my name or number during the process, and this was less than efficient.

I don't mind a little confusion if the food is great --- but it wasn't.  I ordered the Chorizo Enchiladas, and they were tiny, not stuffed, dry, and just nothing to write home about.  The refried beans were soupy.  The rice clearly overcooked and dried out.

I saw other dishes that they brought out that looked good ---- but I can only rate on the food I was given, and it doesn't rate that high.

Take the energy you would have spent climbing the long Las Velas stairway, and head towards Gateway Center on Liberty for Cuzamil.  Or take a much longer walk to Vicky's Mexican Kitchen on Smithfield near Blvd of Allies for better Mexican.
