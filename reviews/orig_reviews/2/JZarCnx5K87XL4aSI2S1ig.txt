Taco y taco I've  heard a lot  about  this  place some  good  and  some bad. But I  like to make  my own  judgment. The service  was on point. The tacos were kinda  of mediocre the salsa bar was nice. The restaurant  was clean. But I was there for the tacos. Which like I said  b4 are kinda  blah, the meat had no seasonings which is  why  I'm giving  them  2 stars. Would I be back  yes after a couple of  beers and there was nothing  else  open.
