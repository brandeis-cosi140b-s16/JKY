I actually thought the food was OK and had the service been ok, I would have given this three stars.  However, the service was just short of horrendous.   The server disappeared for long periods of time, then came back and forgot multiple items we had asked for.   We felt like we were putting him out just asking for refills.   I would say there is a systemic issue with this place.  It is crying out for some basic server training and management.
