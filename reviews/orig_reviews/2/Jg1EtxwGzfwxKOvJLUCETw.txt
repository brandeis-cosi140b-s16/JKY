Server (Julianna) was friendly and took good care of us (party of 10)..... We mainly had drinks but she did a good job keeping tabs!

But... The place itself needs to be remodeled. It's a dump. I always thought it was closed based on outside apperances. But inside is really outdated, restrooms are small and stingy looking. The place smells odd..... & it's dark. A friend ordered something, I tried a bite and was NOT impressed. 

Definately won't go back unless dragged by friends like today.
