Well, the food is good, but comes in kiddie sized portions. I ordered the lunch tacos for $8.50 and I am pretty sure my 3 year old son would still be hungry afterwards (unlike an entree from chipotle which would feed him for three days at a lower cost). Not saying the food is bad, but I definitely will never go to this restaurant again given all the better alternatives in the area. Seriously, it's good, but a giant rip off when it comes to their child like portions.  Yeah, this restaurant definitely irritated me in multiple ways, adios.
