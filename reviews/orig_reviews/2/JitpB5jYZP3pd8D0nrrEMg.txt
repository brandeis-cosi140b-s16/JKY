Underwhelming experience. I ordered the steak burrito that came with a weird tasting avocado sour cream, yuck! The beans in the burrito were so overpowering I couldn't taste any of the other ingredients, I couldn't even eat the whole thing. On a positive note the service and environment was great. If asked if I would be a repeat customer, I don't think I would come back to Pink Taco.
