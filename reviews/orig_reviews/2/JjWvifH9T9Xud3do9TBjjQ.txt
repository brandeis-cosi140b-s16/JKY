I went here a year ago with a date and we both got sick, Hershey highway kinda sick. So I had the opportunity to go again and I'm glad to say neither of us got sick this go around. We went for an early dinner late lunch 3pm, just thought I should mention that since maybe they weren't into the full cooking swing yet. I ordered the chicken fajitas and she ordered cheese enchiladas. It smelled great with the peppers and onions. Unfortunately the chicken had no seasoning, it was as if they just bought the chicken from Albertsons and grilled it with no spices. The beans tasted like Rosaritas straight out of the can. The cheese enchiladas Were hard on the tortilla edges. So we both agreed not to go there again. We could of cooked that same meal with more flavor for less. Just my opinion. I know others like this place but its just not for us.
