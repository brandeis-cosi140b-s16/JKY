Had a short break for work, so I decided while I'm in the Container Park I'll give this place a shot. Didn't have much time so I called ahead and placed an order for the Al Pastor Burrito. I arrived at Pinches Tacos 30-40 minutes later to find out my order was never made. Very disappointing. My food was ready about 10 minutes later. The burrito was decent sized, and came with a side order of tortilla chips. I think the situation warranted a free beer, but I was too hungry to complain. The burrito was pretty good! Definitely gets the job done while you're visiting the park. Prices are average, and the menu had a big selection. However, if you're looking for the best burritos in town, I highly recommend Cardenas.
