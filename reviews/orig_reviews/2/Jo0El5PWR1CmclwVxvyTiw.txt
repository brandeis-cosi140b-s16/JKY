Far less stellar than their claims of offering the best thing from Mexico since salma Hayek. Both fish tacos (grilled and fried) were unappealing. The steak, dry. The service was not friendly or welcoming even from the management. All of the salsas are small at $2.50 each (enough for just two people at best) and none of them are spicy according to our server. The three tacos on the plate at $11.50 a plate felt like a ripoff because they were so tiny. The side of rice and beans had no Mexican flavors whatsoever and were very bland. Sorry, we won't be back. And if anyone would have asked us how our meal was at any point through our meal, they very well could have won our business back by showing some care and concern. But they didn't, so we are good, we'll make Mexican food at home.
