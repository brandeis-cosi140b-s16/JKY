I was skeptical to eat here after I saw desserts garnished with maraschino cherries and many of the dishes garnished with chips.

There location is right next door to a strip club so I think they may have recruited some of their employees. 

As soon as we were seated the chips were brought out. I like a Mexican restaurant where they bring out the chips before you have to ask. The chips were a mix of blue and yellow. I found this very tacky especially because they claim to be an "upscale" Mexican restaurant. I was not thrilled with any of the salsas, in particular the yellow one which had no flavor only heat. I ordered the albondigas soup, lettuce wraps, and steak & shrimp fajita platter. The broth of the soup was subtly seasoned but the vegetables in the soup were cut sloppily, and the meatball was dry and flavorless. Accompanying the soup was a pile of chips, why would I need more chips when you give unlimited baskets of chips? The lettuce wraps were difficult to eat because the guacamole was on the bottom making the lettuce wrap bottom heavy. Guacamole tasted like mashed up avocados with no type of seasoning. The fajita platter looked like a typical fajita platter. The guacamole was flavorless and the sour cream was so runny that I doubt it's homemade. Steak was well cooked albeit salty and the shrimp were jumbo in size but not deveined. And once again, the black beans were garnished with a chip. 

I can't see why this is considered an upscale Mexican restaurant except for the decor.
