I was intrigued by the idea of Chinese/Mexican fusion but unfortunately in a combination of poor service and incomplete menu descriptions, my visit was less than stellar.

We ordered the $12 guac which was pretty much like guac anywhere they make it fresh, so the price was a bit crazy.  The house-made tortillas were fine, but not mouthwatering buttery softness like when I make them which is weird cause I just use Maseca...

The shrimp mojo was the best item we ordered though I thought the shrimp had a very strong aftertaste.  The combo of sweet garlic, poblano, and onion was good though

The spring rolls were fried so in my world that would be an eggroll. Either way the veggie mixture inside was less than average in taste.  The flavor is indescribable except that I would not ever order them again.

The refried beans with cheese and crema (less than a spoonful) came out looking like a turd on a plate.  Even the waiter laughed when we looked  at it.  They were not worth 7 bucks but it was average.

And finally the Glass noodle dish.  I ordered it to be my main course.  It was cold, which was nowhere in the description, which was a disappointment to me because the restaurant itself was freaking Antarctica.  Besides the initial disappointment, the flavor was not great, salty and over-bearing sauce drowned the veggies. 

The portions are very small as well.

The waiters kept bringing food to our table that wasn't ours and then looking at us like we were crazy when we explained we didn't order anything like that (mostly it was tacos and later a soup\...wtf?) 
Also the food came out like sushi, one plate at a time in completely random order. It was weird. I usually do not take stars away for service, but in this case the service was so disorganized and bizarre, I felt I must.
