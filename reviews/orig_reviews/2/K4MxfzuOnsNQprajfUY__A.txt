Went here from a recommendation from a friend for good Mexican food with spice and great margarita's. Unfortunately we were not impressed with the customers service, the margarita or the price. The food was actually good, not great. 

We were a group of 6 and when each went up to pay, the bill seemed high so after some had already paid, one person asked about the bill and was told the tip was included. I looked at my bill and the tip section was blank even though she included it and did not mention it. 

I recommend trying another place before going here. Maybe another Los Dos Molinos.
