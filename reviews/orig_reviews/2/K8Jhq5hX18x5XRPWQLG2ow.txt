Being a true Mexican I must say Tacos El Gordo are not the best tacos, they are a-ok, they put very little meat in your tacos, nothing to die for, only good thing is the tortillas are "home" made, however I truly dislike the way they have you order your tacos, so annoying and incondiserate, this is not the place you want to stop by after work to pick up a "to go" order, you'll be there quite some time and by the time you get home w/dinner all your tacos will be ice cold, as you have to make different lines to order different types of meat, they need to restructure their ordering layout or take all your friends w/you and make them all stand in the different lines lol no but really its stupid, this is why I dont go unless I have 2/3 people w/me. Los Tacos are by far way better and w/lots of meat and you only need to make one line.
