Darn it, not for me. Since the weather is starting to get warmer, an afternoon on a patio was what I needed. Remembering that Vida has a lovely patio, especially for people watching, my husband and I went there for lunch. 

Knowing we wanted to spend a leisurely time, I thought we'd snack on their delicious guacamole to start. I remembered from my first visit that if you sign up online for their membership program, you get the guac for free. Signed up then and there, showed my server, server asked the manager, manager said, "No." I guess when their sign says that you can experience the benefits "immediately" that means something different. Something about a number...I got a confirmation email, but no number. After my initial visit, one of their PR staff called me to figure out what went wrong, we played phone tag, but they never followed through. As you can see, this restaurant is not a good stop for me...bummer.

I will say, the server we had this time around was very attentive and friendly and the hostesses were very nice too. However, the food was still mediocre. I don't know if even the patio or getting a number for the free guac can bring me back...
