I have given this place a try 3 times and just don't care for it. I love Mexican food but just because it's Mexican food doesn't mean the quality of the food should be bad. I have been to 7 Mexican restaurants in Charlotte and this place is just to greasy for my liking. Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself. It's not expensive and before taking my review of any review into consideration,  I recommend trying everywhere at least once before making a final decision.
