Went to lunch there yesterday. With restaurant half full they couldn't seat is for 25 min. While we waited we had a couple $7.50 coors lights. After being seated prices were high, but typical for Vegas strip. It took another 15 min for the server to take our drink order, then another 20 min to take our food order(Drinks were empty by then). My wife and I shared fajitas. Food was small portioned and warm at best. Had to wait 20 min for tortillas. 

I don't mind paying inflated prices for the experience of eating on the strip, but make me feel like I'm getting some value  for my money. Awful service, poor food, and high prices. If that's what you are looking for to Senior Frogs in TI.
