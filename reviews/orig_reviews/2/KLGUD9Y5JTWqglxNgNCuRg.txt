I want to give this restaurant 2.5 stars but that is not an option.  I figure that a 3 out of 5 is a place I would return to, and unfortunately, this will not make the cut.  I wanted it to be good, as it is very near where I will be moving to, and I wanted a nice close-in Mexican restaurant.  Will try and be brief:

1.  Hostess friendly, seated promptly (Sunday around 7:00 PM)
2.  Waiter quickly brought chips, salsa, and beans to table.  This was a positive, as that is my expectation at Mex restaurants.  Salsa was good, beans were lukewarm and very firm like they had been sitting drying out for a while.  Chips were just "ok" at best.  Couldn't quite tell if they had been fried up there that day or not.  I want HOT chips that have just been salted and evidence they had just come out of a fryer less than 10-15 min prior.
3.  Food, kinda bland.  I got a combo plate, chicken "crispy" taco (soggy by the time it got to me as it laying on wet lettuce), an average cheese enchilada, and average rice and beans.
4.  The "cadillac" margarita definitely had tequila in it, which I was impressed by, but I thought it was a fairly small glass and not real flavorful with real lime juice, etc.

So . . . will I return?  Very doubtful.  Lindo Michoachan pretty much sets the standard for food/service/presentation in Vegas, and JC gets a 4 on a 10 LM scale.  Again, regrettable as I wanted this to be a go to place for local Mex.

Revision 1/6/2015
The owners have reached out to me by my comments and are very concerned I did not have a first rate experience.  I am encouraged by that and they urge us to give them another try (which I will do).  That is quite positive right there, that they are monitoring Yelp and respond to reviewers.  Also, I didn't mention that we ordered some guacamole dip and it was VERY good and VERY fresh (I think they mixed it up just as we ordered it!
