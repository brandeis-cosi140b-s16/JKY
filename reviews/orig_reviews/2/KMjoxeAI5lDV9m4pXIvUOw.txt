Was excited to try this place for a late lunch the other day.  Owner and staff were very welcoming.  Ordered a fish taco, carne asada burrito and fresh raspberry lemonade.  While waiting, roamed around the outside ... seating area could be laid out better.  Order took only a few minutes and my name was called for pick up.  Was suprised at the weight of the taco and burrito  ... felt substantial.  Tried the fish taco first.  It smelled and tasted fishy (not in a good way).  Very poorly seasoned fish cooked in dish water.  The (flour) taco was loaded with a tasteless mash of beans, lettuce, rice, none of which were very appealing.  Looking forward to the carne asada burrito, I was almost equally disappointed.  Almost no meat, and what there was of it tasted like old  pot roast that had been steamed into a tasteless mush.  Again, the burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, but nothing was properly flavored.  The  tortilla itself tasted old and didn't hold together well, allowing most of the innards to fall out ... you know, when you've let them sit out on the counter for too long.  Ended up throwing away 1/2 of the taco and burrito ... something I rarely do.  The fresh lemonade tasted like koolaid with slush.  Definitely not worth the $3 price.  Food prices are cheap, portions large, but quality and taste are not lacking.  Two thumbs down!  If you want a cheap Mexican fix that tastes good, try La Salsita on Indian School and 32nd Street.  Great carne asada and slow cooked pork.
