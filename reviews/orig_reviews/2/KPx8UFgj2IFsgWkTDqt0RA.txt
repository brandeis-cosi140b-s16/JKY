I'd give my first (and likely only) experience at Cabo Fish taco 2.5 stars. I want to give it more based on the location, vibe, and service, but the food simply isn't very good.

First off, the chips, salsa, and queso. The chips were stale, the corn salsa was nothing more than underripe tomato chunks and corn (no seasoning whatsoever), and the queso was quite clearly microwaved velveeta. Not a good start. 

For entrees, we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos. Both were one-note and heavy-handed on the sauces. Requested tuna medium rare, but received overcooked tuna. Way too much wasabi on the tuna--not too spicy, it just overpowered every other flavor. Bbq sauce was incredibly sweet and drowned out the flavor of fresh, well prepared mahi. Rice and beans on the side were flavorless. 

Maybe this is what constitutes a good restaurant in Charlotte. I certainly hope not.
