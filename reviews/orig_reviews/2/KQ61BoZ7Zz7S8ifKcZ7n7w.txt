Not awful, but this place doesn't compare well with all the other nearby Mexican places.

I was a little surprised that there were no chicken or fish options.
So, I ordered the Taco Tijuana with pork.

The tortillas were small and greasy. The meat was fine, but not very much of it. The accompaniments were good.

I realize that Tijuana-style street tacos are mean to be just a couple of bites to eat on the run. Still, I would have liked more food for the price;
...and a few more meat and/or vegetable options.

The service was fine.
