I just recently moved to LV. I am looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant. I found this one and I must say I was a bit disappointed. 

My husband and I ordered the nachos, gordita, & fish tacos. The only thing we loved was the nachos. The gordita had such a horrible taste. Fish tacos were okay per my husband. If I do come back here it will be only for the nachos nothing else sadly.
