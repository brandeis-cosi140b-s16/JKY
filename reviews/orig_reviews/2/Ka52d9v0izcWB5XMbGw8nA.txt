One star for the chips, one star for the ambiance...that's it! 

Met some friends here for dinner after hearing about how great this place was. Totally disappointed with my margarita and my food. Margarita tasted like sugar water with tequila. Ordered chicken tacos, beans and rice. Chicken looked and tasted like dark meat. Not impressed. 

Like I mentioned, the chips were pretty good. 

My advice:
Spend about $10 more and get a meal 100 times better at The Mission.
