Not really that good. Wish I wrote the review then because I remember there were quite  a few things I wanted to say but lucky for them I waited on review and food was just not good enough that I remember how we vowed not to ever return.  Both hubby and I not impressed and not coming back.  I would suggest you start reading your reviews and get a new cook or try some new recipes because your food no longer works and I would like you to be successful because I love Mexican food and I want more places to go.
