The decor is fun BUT, the place is extremely noisy.  The food was average and that's being kind.  I tried 3 different dishes (shrimp baja taco and chicken taco&chalupa off the lite menu) and I was not impressed with any of them.   I don't know what all the fuss is about this place.  I would not go back.
