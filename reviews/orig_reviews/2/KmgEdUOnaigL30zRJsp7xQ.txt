Came here with high expectations for a good taco and good margarita.  NOPE.  Tacos are tiny with super thick tortillas to stuff your stomach with the cheapest ingredient and then charge you ridiculous prices for it.  Funny T-shirts, but save your money and tummy room.  Your best bet is an off beat taco place like the one in O' Sheas casino. But you wont listen.  You will go and eat the food and say, "yea, that review was right".  And now you have 80-100 bucks less in your pocket.  Over $65 for two by the way.  Im not cheap, i just want at least a LITTLE quality for that price.
