Searching for decent Mexican food in Charlotte is like looking for Big Foot.  Just when you think you spotted him, he disappears.  

Phat's is a burrito "get it and go" type place.  Not an authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'll get the major downer out of the way first, their chips and guacamole is pretty disappointing.  I've had better chips from Tostitos.  As a matter of fact, I think they were tricolor Tostitos.  The burritos are fair.  Not good or great - fair.  

They "almost" have a dining room but that's beside the point.  If the food warranted it, I would come here every week.  It's a decent neighborhood spot that I will probably try again if I'm in the area but there's absolutely no reason to go out of my way to trek here on a regular basis.  I really don't understand five stars for a mediocre burrito and brown guacamole.  But if you come here with low expectations you just might like it.
