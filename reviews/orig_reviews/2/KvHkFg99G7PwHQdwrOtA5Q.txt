Brought my dad to El Zocalo on a Saturday to celebrate his 50th birthday with about 5 other people. The waiter we had was very short and rude with us, and looked extremely annoyed to be serving that night. (I guess he figured with the 20% gratuity already included, he didn't have to fake nice for a tip). The food was very overpriced for how mediocre and bland it was, don't let the gourmet looking photos on their website fool you.  The only thing that makes up for the lame meal experience is the entertainment after 10pm. The restaurant turns into a bar/club type atmosphere, with great music for those who like to dance, and plenty of hilarious off-rhythm drunks for those who like to people watch. They really need to either build another bar, or hire another couple of  bartenders though. I felt really bad for the two guys swarmed with pushy people at the one very crowded bar in the place. All in all, I'd say save your money and eat better at a taco truck on your way there for a fun night of dancing.
