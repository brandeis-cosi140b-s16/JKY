"Good." This place is good. Not great, but good. The food is prepared by people who clearly know what they're doing. It's not spectacular, it's not innovative, but it's tasty, and ... good. The margaritas -- the one I had anyway -- were tasty and fresh.

But everything is badly, BADLY overpriced.

This isn't fine Mexican dining in Paradise Valley ... it's friggin' Chandler. If I'm paying $13 for a single margarita it better be prepared right there at my table, or served by a Mariachi band, or something. Like I said, it was good ... but not THAT good. 

Same goes with the food. And order of shrimp enchiladas got me two normal-size enchiladas, rice (bleh) and tasty black beans .... and it was all good. But for $17 it should have been spectacular.

There's a lot of really great Mexican food to be found around Phoenix. This place just isn't worth it.
