This is my third time staying at the South Point, but my first time eating at Baja Miguel's.  I was here with my family (wife and two kids), and the food was decent...except for my daughter's Taco Salad "with Chicken."  It was ice cold and there was no chicken.  It was so bad that I asked for it to be removed from our bill, and said we would order dessert to make up for that.  The waiter never removed it from my bill, said he couldn't do it, and had to ask the manager.

The manager was perhaps the WORST manager I've ever dealt with.  She acknowledged the issues with the food but said she would only take half off.  I went back and and forth with her politely, and she only refunded the entire amount after the waiter voluntarily went back to her AGAIN.  I literally saw her walk by our table SHAKING HER HEAD.  I guess "how dare a guest not like the food" was something she never dealt with before.

This experience soured me enough to never go back to this restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll stay at the South Point again.

If you don't have issues with your food, it's okay.  If you do, don't expect to be treated fairly.
