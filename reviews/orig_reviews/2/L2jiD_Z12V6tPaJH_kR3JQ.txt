I don't live here and came with family.  I have been here several years ago but didn't remember the food.

I am eating a healthier diet and the fam assumed this Mexican was like our normal place.  Not so.  We eat at a local place and have Baja style tacos for $2.50 ea and an amazing shrimp ceviche tostada for $3.50.  We can feed a family of 4 for about the same price as ONE entree here.

My a la carte taco was in a fried shell.  I have never had that before and I eat Mexican at least once a week.  Also $5.50 ea!  Robbery.

Anyways, I wouldn't go back.
