This is one of my least favorite mexican places. The food was just not up to par. I believe it was very over priced. It the prices were lower then maybe I would have left happy, but this was not the case. My friend also ordered a margarita for 14 bucks and it was also not very good. There are definitely better places to go for mexican food.
