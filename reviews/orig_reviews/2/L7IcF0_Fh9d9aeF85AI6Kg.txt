If there was a bar with an 'end of the world' theme...this place would be it. From the mosquito infested pool in the front to the booster seats available on demand...this place gets a fail for atmosphere. Perhaps it's to get you drinking faster and longer.  I went here with a friend for happy hour because it was convenient and any place with Rada is an ok place to be... sadly. I just couldn't get past the doomsday decor and the lack of meatless things. I'll stick to snobbsdale's location
