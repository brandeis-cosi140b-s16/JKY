Decor: Dark and depressing. The photos on their website are pre-remodel, so expect  none of the fun colors and atmosphere.

Service: Really slow...I don't care if you spend an hour making my first appetizer, you have to get a drink in my hand right away, especially on a Friday night. It was only about 3/4 full in there so they have no excuse.

Food: We ordered a bunch of small plates and they ranged from very tasty tuna ceviche to steak tacos that were so tough, you could barely bite through them. The pork belly "large plate" was dry and way overpriced at $20. The portions are outrageously tiny there; they make the Mission's portions seem like Claim Jumper.

My overall impression of this place is that the "Iron Chef" made a really interesting menu, but then has not been back in the restaurant to ensure things are being executed properly by the staff.

Take Distrito and strip away all the pretension, then add great service and amazing food, and you're left with the Mission...so just go there!
