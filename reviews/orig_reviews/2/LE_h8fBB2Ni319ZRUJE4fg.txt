If i could rate the food and service separate, the food would be 4 1/2 stars and the service 1 star. When we moved to the area, I was so excited to be fairly close to a someburros cause I love the food. The first time we visited, the girl at the register barely acknowledged our presence, let alone looked up at us, as we ordered. When we pointed it out to the manager on duty he apologized, and we were treated better.  However, the young lady was upset and glared at us our entire meal. In the end we wrote it off as a one time, bad day. 
The second time we came, they got my order wrong and when I had the nerve to ask for it to be corrected, I was greeted with annoyance.  Once again I pointed this out to the manager on duty and he apologized profusely.  This time we walked away with a gift card. 
The next time we came in, I of course used the gift card and the manager recognized me. I can assume that is why that visit went off without a hitch.  
However, this time proved to be the breaking point. My birthday was a week ago. I tell you this because I got an email from them today regarding their new birthday special. Since my birthday was a week ago I assumed it was one of the regular emails were they were offering me a free entree because it was my birthday and it was just late. However, as we learned from the  rude manager on duty, we read it wrong, and it was only an informational email,  and therefore we would not be getting any discount.
At no point, did the manager apologize for the misunderstanding or try to hide her irritation that I did misunderstand.  Customer service is a huge part of my eating out experience.  It's why i don't eat at fast food restaurants often.  
As I told the manger, there are plenty of  places to get good Mexican food  around there, so we won't be going to Someburros again anytime soon.
