Honestly, I was a bit disappointed with this place.

I'd heard it was fantastic and when I arrived there was a long line of people waiting to get their order in...it must be good, right?

I tried 3 tacos: Red Beef, Cactus with Cheese, Bean with Cheese.  The Red Beef was probably the best one, but still not that great...it had some bite and the beef was tender, but it still could have been seasoned better.  The cactus wasn't very good - it really wasn't seasoned and so it didn't have any flavor...at least the cactus wasn't overcooked.  The bean and cheese was probably my least favorite since it really didn't taste like anything.  I even tried one of their "Magic Brownies" (this one with cream cheese) and that wasn't very good either - it tasted like it had been wrapped in plastic and absorbed all those chemically plastic flavors...maybe it was older brownie?

All the tacos arrived wrapped and they look kind of awkward and wet (because of the steam) and definitely messy when you try to eat them.

Just overall, not very good...I'm sure there are a ton of places in Phoenix that have better, more flavorful food.
