They accommodated our very large group when chillis wouldn't, they were decent with refills of drinks and chips for such a large group (almost 20). There was over a 50 minute time spread between the first meal served to our group and the last. But the reason for 2 stars was the extremely meager portion sizes. My 2 enchilada meal for $11 consisted of 2 hot dog size enchiladas, and beans with rice. Literally pennies worth of food. You can easily get twice the food elsewhere for half the money. The personnel at the store were nice though.
