Wanted to go to Burger Bar but too long of a wait so went to Hussongs for lunch and had a completely different experience than my first visit. Service was POOR. It wasn't much busier than my first visit. The server mentioned their computers were having problems. During the time we were there I saw what looked like the manager helping take orders and another gentleman who was wearing street clothes start bringing guests chips/salsa. I was bummed. Took awhile to get our check and then wait longer for someone to run the card. After we left and were just a few feet away from the restaurant a gentleman asked us if we had just ate at Hussongs and how it was. We answered "it was OK but the service was slow". I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. I don't think I will be back anytime soon.
