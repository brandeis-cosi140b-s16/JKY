I was shocked at how packed this place was on a Tuesday night. Maybe because it is Fat Tuesday and the Mexican-esque bar was celebrating Mardi Gras? Whatever, just a reason to party and the bar to make money I guess. But. I was not impressed. Nope. We were here for Happy Hour, which I didn't think was that great, although the $2 Taco Tuesday deal was pretty sweet. Unfortunately, that's all the tacos were worth, no way I'd pay full price. Plus, the service was terribly lousy. Our server was very impersonal. I suppose if you want to come here to only drink and dance on a Saturday night that'd be cool, but not if you want to just meet up after work with some friends. Whatevs.
