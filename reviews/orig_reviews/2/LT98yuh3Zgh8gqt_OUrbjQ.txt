Dined in. Spacious eating room. Where to stand in line to begin was not decipherable without staff direction. Samples of different
meats are available. Barbacoa and Carne Asada tacos were flavorful and generous on meat portions. Dining area and service stations were clean. 
NO prices given for drinks, ANY side dishes OR extras. Not even printed on provided hand menu or lit wall menus. A mystery until meal(s) rung up!
