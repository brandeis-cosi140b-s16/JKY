Wait staff is good, friendly and fairly speedy.

The food, however...GAH.  There aren't many places to eat in Terminal C so I'm assuming that's why they're still in business.  How do you mess up guacamole?  Cardboard-like chips.

I've been meaning to write this review for years and now that you can from my phone, they thoroughly deserve a two star rating.
