Not a good place for a quick weekday lunch.

I had heard good things about Paz from my coworkers who went to Paz as a large group a couple weeks ago. Sad to say, today's visit did not live up to the expectation they set.

My group of 5 people ordered the appetizer trio (queso, guac and beans), chicken flautas and a total of 5 tacos. About 30 minutes into our wait, I was told that the papas taco I'd ordered was no longer available. I said I'd be happy with 2 of the Nopalito tacos.

After 45 minutes we had received nothing - not even the appetizer which I would have expected to come out fairly quickly. We finally received (almost everything) about 5 minutes later. My 2 nopalito tacos were still not ready and I received 1 of the 2 after another 5 minute wait. My second nopalito taco was delivered 5 minutes later. The second taco included several pieces of steak I had not ordered.

When I informed the waitress, she took both of my tacos back and I again waited for about 10 minutes before I got 2 fresh new tacos. By this time, I was pretty uninterested in eating them. I did have one, which was alright but not great, and took the other home to enjoy another time.

In all, the food was only okay and the service was extremely slow. The kitchen and wait staff seemed unable to handle the lunch rush. Disappointing to say the least, I think I'll take my dollars elsewhere in the future.

P.S. the wall of moss out front is cute but strange. I did my part and gave it some water. Like the interaction. Would have been more fun if I had left with a positive experience.
