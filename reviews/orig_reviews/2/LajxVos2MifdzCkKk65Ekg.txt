This bar has so much potential, but fails to capitalize! I ordered a margarita which was probably the worst tasting margarita I've ever tasted. I then had to wait for close to 20 minutes as bartenders walked by and ignored me before I finally was able to exchange my drink for a beer- which by the way I was charged the full price of the margarita ($8) because the bartenders were too lazy to fix my order. Oh and I didn't even get an apology and the bartender seemed burdened that I was asking for a replacement. The crowed was a odd bunch off people and I could tell that most of them were not from Desert Ridge but probably from the west side. A lot of older douchey guys who think their still 19. It's a total Affliction bar. People reading this will know what I'm talking about.
