Okay so my husband and I were craving nachos. We ordered the steak nanchos to split. The order was huge and tasted decent. I think they should have been since they costed $18! Anyway, the beer was way over price and do not have a huge selection on draft. One Miller Light beer was freakin $8!?!?!? WTF!?!?
