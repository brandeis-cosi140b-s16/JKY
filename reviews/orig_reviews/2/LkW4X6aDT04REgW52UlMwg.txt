Hey, it's airport food and you get to sit down to eat it rather than having to wait in a line with badly behaved children and adults for crappy food. So they earn a star just for having table service available. They earn another star because the waitress I had was very nice and food came out quickly. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and they were decent. Not super flavorful, but they were hot and clearly made to order which is a plus. If I were comparing this to other airport food options rather than reviewing it on it's own merits, I'd probably give it four stars, but I definitely wouldn't choose to come here if it were a restaurant in my neighborhood.
