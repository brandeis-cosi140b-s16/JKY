Food was good, service was ok. Beware however that a "pitcher" of house margarita is in fact, a carafe- and more importantly is TWENTY EIGHT FREAKING DOLLARS. Friends and I were there on Saturday. My friend ordered us a pitcher of margaritas- granted, she did not have a menu when she ordered it but $28? If it was $28 I would at least expect something bigger than a carafe! I'll put a picture of said pitcher in the photos...
