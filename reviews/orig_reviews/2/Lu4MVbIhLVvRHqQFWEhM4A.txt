This place is ok if you are so starving you don't care what you eat. The chips and salsa are great, but everything else is pretty bland. I am a fan of tamales and I would definitely not order it again. They do make some pretty good chicken tacos, but you only receive 2 small tacos and its about $12... no thanks! I would prefer Taco Bell over Mi Amigos. The staff is very nice and the service is good, too bad the food does not match.
