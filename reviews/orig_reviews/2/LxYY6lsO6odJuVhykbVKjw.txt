I'm really puzzled by all the good reviews...the food was about a 2 or 3 on a scale of 1-10. Party of four, nobody was happy. Everything overcooked, really cheap ingredients (chicken, shrimp), the mole sauce was runny and watery, the soup had zero flavor! I will say that whoever is making the salsa should be promoted to head chef. That was only thing that was good. Run of the mill Margaritas, just some mix and very little cheap tequila. It's a shame because everybody was nice. Really disappointing. Cannot for the LIFE of me understand all the food channel references...will not return for sure. Was tempted to give it a 1.
