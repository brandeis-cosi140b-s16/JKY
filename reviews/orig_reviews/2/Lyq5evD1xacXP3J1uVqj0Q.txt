I'd heard so many good things about this place and was really expecting a great meal, but it didn't happen. We got there early on a Saturday(5:30)- which was good because the place filled up fast. That was the only thing that happened fast there. 

We only got one menu that four of us had to share and after about 20 minutes had our drink orders taken. I had a sangria, which was ok, but tasted mostly like grape kool-aid. We got chips and salsa-which was depleted in 5 minutes between four of us. We asked for more and got it only after we asked again.  

Three of us got the chicken enchiladas and we all agreed that they were ok, not quite good, and far from great. JD had the special- a chorizo pizza. It was really salty and greasy but the crust was kind of crispy, surprisingly. We got another round of drinks and ordered sopapillas to go. This took forever! I didn't eat mine, but heard that they were worth the wait later. I seriously doubt it. Not planning a return trip here.
