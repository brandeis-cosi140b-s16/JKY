Food was great, unfortunately the service was pretty terrible. Our server never introduced himself, greeted us with "can I get you a drink?" Pace of service was very slow, which we understand that he might be busy, but it wouldn't hurt to smile and be kind to us. So if that's the experience you want, come eat at Valle Luna Phoenix!
