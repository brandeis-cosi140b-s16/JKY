This wasn't bad, but far from the best Mexican food that I have had.

You will note that when you drive in, the place is called the Dona Maria Center. This is because the center is owned by the good folks that founded the restaurant. There in lies the problem.

The restaurant was so successful, that it forgot its roots. 

I ordered a special Tamale, Chile Relano, and Shredded Beef Taco. I ordered Ala carte, so as to get what I want and skip the rice and beans.

The Tamale was good, Chile Relano was fair, and Shredded Beef Taco, maybe a cut above Del Taco, but lacked authenticity. Agree with my fellow reviewer that chips and salsa were not really good.

Mira V. is right that Service was slow, and once again, I think we were paying for the owner's real estate investment. 

I lived nearby for ten years before I tried this place. Now I know why, and no return visit. 

Overpriced, very Gringo. Find a hole in the wall. Save money and get a better meal.
