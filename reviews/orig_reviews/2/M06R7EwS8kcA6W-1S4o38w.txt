I ordered the tinga quesadilla: not impressed at all!!! Avoid this! Just order regular drinks.
I do not recommend the Chelada drinks either! It tasted like watery beer. In the beginning they served the beer and they didn't tell us that they were out of  tecate beers, so they decided to serve the Chelada (that goes with tecate beer) with dos Equis. I noticed when the bartender was serving the beer and asked her, then she had to agree with me. Sneaky bartender!!!! Check your drinks specially if you order the good ones!
