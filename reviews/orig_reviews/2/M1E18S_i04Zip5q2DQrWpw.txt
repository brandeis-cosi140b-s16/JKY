The location is great. The service.... not so much. My sister and I went on a weekday night and it was not busy at all. We ordered our drinks and then our food. We had two other people meeting us there but did not tell them because we wanted to eat right away. Once the other two showed up (guys) she was back to our table to help. She was very attentive with them and they even got their food before we did. I never got a refill on my tea and my one of the guys never got the drink he actually ordered. She ordered a vodka and cran and she brought him out a beer. She apologized and offered it to him on her and she would go grab his drink.... she never did. My sister ordered a queso dip and asked for more chips.... the chips never came until we asked another server. The food was good the location is nice the seating is great but the service isn't tremendious. I would go back, just hopefully get a different server.
