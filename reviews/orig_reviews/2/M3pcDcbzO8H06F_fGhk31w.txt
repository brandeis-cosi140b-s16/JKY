There were six of us who went just after the lunch crowd was over.  My first impression is that the place could use a good scrubbing.  Also, the girl taking our order at the counter had zero personality.
I ordered menudo which was some of the best that I have had.  My husband and I also ordered the tamale platter.  We both ordered beef tamales.  We each got one beef, one corn.  They were just okay.  I am glad that all of our orders came out in styrofoam "to go" containers even though we were eating there, because I saw everyone getting their orders of cheap, flimsy paper plates that ended up being soggy.  One couple ordered tostadas.  There was more lettuce than beans or cheese.
I can tell you that I will never go back.  The food is definitely not authentic.
