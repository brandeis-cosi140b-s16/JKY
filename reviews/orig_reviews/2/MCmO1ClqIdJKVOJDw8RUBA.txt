Waited 20 minutes for our table on a Friday night, no problem. The service was fine, it was the food that makes me give a 2 stars. The Tortilla soup was the best thing we ordered. I had the carne asada tacos, the meat was dried out, lacked the onions and cilantro that these tacos should have, plus they were at room temperature. As well were my rice & beans, and the beans were very bland. My fianc√© ordered the fajitas, the meat was hot, but the tortillas were stale and the rice & beans were room temperature as well.
