Here last night using a Groupon. It was for $50. We had one appetizer and a couple margaritas, two entr√©es and our bill was over $100 easy for the Groupon.  And if the food has been all is good or outstanding me I could have stomached the price. But the truth was the food was average at best probably overpriced. There were very few people in the restaurant and yes the service was incredibly slow and not overly friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to my friends.
