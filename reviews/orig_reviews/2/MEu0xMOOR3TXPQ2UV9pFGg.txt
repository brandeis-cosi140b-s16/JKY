The food at On the Border is always wonderful. I just wish the service here was better. The waitress we had couldn't give 2 cents if we were there or not. We felt like we were an inconvenience to her. The rest of the crew just kept gathering up in a corner chatting away while we were waiting on refills and more food. After timing her, we had to wait 15 minutes on more water. Oh and let's not forget...their forks were SO dirty. Do they actually clean anything here? After a couple of drinks and tacos, we decided not to order anymore and leave. It's a pity. We'd love to come here more often, but the service makes my husband and I choose elsewhere. I really recommend the management to step it up or I see this place either getting shut down or the whole team get fired.
