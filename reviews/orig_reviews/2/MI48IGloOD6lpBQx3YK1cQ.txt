I have heard about this place a lot and how great it is.  Unfortunately, not only my expectations weren't met, I would rather eat Mexican food at Chipotle than here.  :(
The people were Fake friendly, looking to say, get your food and get the """ out of my face.  Food was mediocre, nothing to brag about. Since they cook everything right in front of you, so the cleanliness is a top priority. I wouldn't go again, not all it was raved about to be.
