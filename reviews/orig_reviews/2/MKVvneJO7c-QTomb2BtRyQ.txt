Not too attentive with their guests. Waiting to get our check forever?! Food was average. Some items on the menu you would think would be worth the amount of food you are spending on but $15 for teeny tiny tacos ?! Cmon. Over all it's a Relaxed atmosphere. Wouldn't come here again though . Thanks for the experience .
