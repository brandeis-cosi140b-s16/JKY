It's quick, it's open late, it's convenient. But ultimately, the place is soulless. No original dishes, no authenticity to the flavors. It's a food factory and if that and a tart drink are what you crave you'll be satisfied. But satisfied to me is the baseline for keeping a restaurant open and a far cry from making it a thing of quality. Also, they're batting a thousand on putting avocados on my girlfriends tacos even though she's allergic and 86's it every time.
