Not sure what the allure is with this place. Maybe because it's in Scottsdale?? We happened to be in the area on a Friday evening so decided to give Jalapeno Inferno a try. There was already a line forming so we took that as a good sign. A couple of seats opened up at the outside bar so we escaped putting our name on a list. The bartender was friendly, but perfunctory. We studied the menu while we waited for our drinks munched on chips. The salsa was very flavorful, and the chips were part corn- part flour. Maybe I'm just a purist, but really?? Chips made from flour tortillas? Ick! I guess that's how they utilize stale flour tortillas, and the snowbirds probably like 'em. I hate rummaging through the basket to get the corn tortilla chips!

For the entrees we decided on the Tomatillo Chicken Enchiladas and Baja Fish Tacos. Both dishes were mediocre. The tacos were short on fish. The enchiladas had an after-hot, which I liked, but they really weren't anything to write home about.
Glad we tried the place. I can't think of why we'd go back when there are so many really good Mexican restaurants in town.
