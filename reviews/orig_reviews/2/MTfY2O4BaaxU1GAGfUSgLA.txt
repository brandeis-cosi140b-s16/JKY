First off this restaurant is located next to conference rooms and not so close to the other restaurants. We visited on a Thursday evening and it was dead in the dining room while the bar was full of loud conference attendees. The food is fine, overpriced like much of the restaurants in Vegas, but not outrageous. The problem was the service, the wait staff was just not bothered, even the manager hung out in the bar area. It took forever to get menus and after our meat almost 15 minutes to get the check, which was ridiculous considering there was only three tables and two servers. We won't be back.
