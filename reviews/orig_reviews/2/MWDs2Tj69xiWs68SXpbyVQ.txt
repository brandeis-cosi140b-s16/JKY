Meal:  
(1) Carnitas Johnny taco on soft white corn tortilla
(1) Tacos al pastor on soft white corn tortilla
Charro beans
Mexican vegetable rice
(2) Top shelf margaritas
Tortilla chips with red and green salsas

The charro beans and vegetable rice were so salty there were not edible.  You can get better carnitas at any regular Mexican restaurant with authentic dishes.  The al pastor taco was the best dish I had, and I would recommend that if you visit.  The margaritas were large and properly balanced and worth the $10.  Chips and salsa were solid.

Decor / Ambiance: fairly typical colorful Mexican restaurant dining room with a more upscale bar/lounge area with leather chairs, dark wood tables, etc.  The "private" group dining room surrounded by glass walls at entrance was oddly situated.  

Service:
Waitress was probably a B+, except when I asked for the Mexico City street-style corn, the she said "they were out the last time she checked a couple of days ago."  OK....

Overall:
Cantina 1511 undoubtedly has great local press along with positive Yelp reviews and a very promising menu.  Unfortunately, the food quality was just not there.  Overall, Cantina 1511 feels like a chain version of an "authentic" Mexican restaurant.
