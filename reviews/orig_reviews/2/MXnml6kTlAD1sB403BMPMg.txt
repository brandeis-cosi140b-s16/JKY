I am from the Southern California area. I used to eat at Wahoo's ALL the time when I was there. I grew up next to the original location in Costa Mesa.

I was really excited to see one open right down the street from where I live - Rainbow/215.

The format is different here in Vegas. It's 24hrs and it's a gaming bar as well. I work in the industry, so I stop there about 11:30 pm (after work) for a beer and the famous fish tacos :)

They are going to have to step up their game if I'm going to keep coming, because the service is lousy and getting worse. They are distracted with no sense of urgency and no focus on serving ... Simply put, I am one of the easiest people on earth to serve, and consistently one of the MOST generous patrons where ever I go. 

No one in this town at that level seems to give a shit about serving anyone but their friends ... I'm way more generous than they are ...
