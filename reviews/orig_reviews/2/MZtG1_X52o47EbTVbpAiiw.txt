We had to wait around 20 minutes for a table in the bar area which was no big deal.  The hostess says, "We have a reservation here in about an hour and a half.  Do you think you could be out of here by then?"  My first mistake was to reply yes.  It made me and my guests feel like we were just another party to be moved along as quickly as possible.  I let it go and we sat to enjoy the nice evening.  

After about 20 minutes I was getting upset that a waiter/waitress hadn't even said anything to us, especially since they were trying to "move us along".  I had to go up to the hostess and let her know that no one had even acknowledged us.  Finally the waitress came over and took our order.  The rest of the meal wasn't much better as the waitress rarely checked on us and took forever to bring our pitcher of margaritas.  

We ordered the chicken nachos to share and they didn't come with much chicken.  Most of the plate was chips.  These nachos are $17 so I would expect that there would be more cheese and chicken.

Overall it was a really bad dinner experience, I will not be returning.  On a positive note, at least Vegas has plenty of other places to dine.
