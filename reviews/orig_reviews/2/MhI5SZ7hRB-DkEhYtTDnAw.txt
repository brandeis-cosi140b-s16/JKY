I had to use my flashlight in order to see the menu!  That should've been my first sign.  I ordered the wet bean burrito with pork green chile.  First of all, the inside of the burrito was filled with sour cream, a few scrap of lettuce and tomatoes.  Beans are a cheap staple and they must've thought I said 'no beans'.  The green chile had no pork.  Honestly, I should've sent my food back!  I had to pour the runny bean dip they serve prior to ordering on top of what ended up being a wet sour cream burrito!  tNext, my husband ordered carne asada taco's.  The corn tortilla's were not grilled.  They were cold - straight out of the package!  My $10 margarita tasted like pre-mix.
