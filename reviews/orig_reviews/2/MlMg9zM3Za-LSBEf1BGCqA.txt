Went here after the Whitesnake concert. We ordered the chicken taquitos for an appetizer and they were good.  I ordered the street tacos, al pastor. Can't go wrong with street tacos right? My boyfriend ordered the chicken Milanese. Both our plates were bland as could be! My tacos had a pineapple salsa which was the only tasty thing on my taco. The meat had no taste to it whatsoever!! No seasonings. It was completely unflavorful! I didn't even eat all 3 tacos. My boyfriends chicken was covered with a bunch of leaves. Maybe to try and hide how bad the chicken lacked in flavoring? Maybe it was a bad night. I don't know. But for $58, worst meal I've had in Vegas.  My stomach is still paying the price for it this morning. I gave 2 stars cuz the chicken taquitos at least we're good!
