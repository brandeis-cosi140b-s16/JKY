Papi Chulo's seems to have sorted out some of its issues since it was first reviewed. Our service was good (even in spite of being a packed house), and the menu offered a reasonable selection of both a la carte and meal options.

But it definitely ain't perfect.

The first issue is one of image. Papi Chulo's doesn't seem to be entirely sure what it wants to be. The decoration is homey and elegant. The hostess and the (I'm assuming) owner are dressed up. The rest of the front-of-house staff is dressed like it's a coed Hooters, though, with the ladies in cutoff booty shorts and most of the men in Hawaiian shirts. 

The second--and perhaps bigger--issue is the food. It's not bad, it gives the appearance of freshness, and the meat is cooked well. But as has been mentioned, it trends toward blandness. Most of the food arrives from the kitchen unseasoned and without sauce. Not quite what you'd expect from a joint advertising Mexican and Sonoran specialties. The fresh salsas are decent and add something, but there's a whole lot of flavor missing that you can only get before or during the cooking process.

I was more than a little confused/amused by being served raw onions and peppers. Warm tortillas, hot cooked meat, melty cotija... and stone-cold raw and crispy veggies. Can't say I've ever had that experience before. Can't say I want to have it again.

Our visit was topped off by our server having an emotional breakdown and subsequently either sobbing or being ultra-bitchy with you. Yaaaay.

All in all, there are better places in Old Town to get hit on by drunk girls. Papi Chulo's has the ingredients to make something better, but I'm not sure they've got the recipe.
