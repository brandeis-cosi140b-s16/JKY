Came here expectations of a nice meal.  Started with the tortilla of the day, tonight if memory serves me, it was potatoe.  It was good.  Then ordered chips and salsa; we've had better.  For the main meal my husband had the pork chop, I ordered the Chicken Margharita...what a mistake I made!  It tasted like what you would think was boiled rubber!  No flavor, tough as shoe leather I couldn't eat it.  I gave some to my husband and he promptly cut his pork chop and gave me that to eat.  What bothered me the most is the waitress saw I didn't eat the chicken with exception of a bite or two and didn't bother to ask me about it to learn what my view was on that dish.  I would have politely told her that dish should be taken off the menu!  The pork chop was good, but not great.  Overall...it was a lousy dining experience and we won't bother to come back and will tell our friends of our negative experience.  The positive thing....the outdoor setting is lovely..now if they could just fix the menu.
