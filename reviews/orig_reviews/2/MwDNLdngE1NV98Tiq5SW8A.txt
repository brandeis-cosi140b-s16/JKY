This place is not at all like the one on Central Ave, which we have loved for years. We were greeted by one dude, brought drinks by another and waited on by a third, none had much personality and seemed bored to be there. The kick ass margaritas were more like pat on the ass, weak with a mix that tasted vaguely like Sauza mix watered down with some fresh lime squeezed in. We had to order an extra shot to give them some life. The cheese crisp was so-so, I think it was a Mission tortilla, definitely not handmade. The enchaladas had a pepper next to them denoting spicy, but they were not spicy at all, and the chicken was over shredded. The carnitas was flavorless and greasy. Too bad because the south location is such a hike, but we will be headed there next time.
