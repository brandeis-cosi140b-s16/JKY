Judging from all the recent positive reviews, I think we went on the wrong night or something.  The food wasn't anywhere near 4 stars...not even near 3.  The server was rushed, and didn't really come back to check on us until the end.  The food was just okay but definitely NOT worth the $$.  I can go down the street to Super Mex and eat off their $5 menu and it's 100 times better.  I paid $8 for nachos - with no meat.  They skimped on the chips and they put this bland red sauce on it that made the chips soggy by the time it reached the table.  There was like a tablespoon of sour cream, guacamole and pico de gallo.  I could barely find the cheese and beans.  My boyfriend got a combo plate and he said it was just okay.  We both agreed for the price we could eat at a Robertos and have better quality and pay less.  I would NOT recommend this place and I don't understand how it has 4 stars....unless we just went on an off night.
