I had been wanting to try this place out and they happened to do a Groupon on 12-22-10, which I purchased. Sunday is one of my dinner nights so I went with my fiance and our 19 month old out to Tempe.  

When we arrived they said there would be a short wait, which was not a problem. The hostest then informed us that they only have one high chair and it was in use. Bummer...we had to go elsewhere.
