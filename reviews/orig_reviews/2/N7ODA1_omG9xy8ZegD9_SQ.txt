Like approaching the gorgeous woman across the bar, only to learn she smells like body odor and Doritos.

Like buying the vacation package that looked perfect online, just to find your "luxury cruise" is really a mattress on the floor of a fishing barge. 

Like buying a car off Craigslist, driving it 2 blocks and having all four wheels fall off.

Such is Yayo Taco, looking mighty good up front and turning out to be something completely different in the end. Do you know how excited I was to hear they had a slew of vegetarian/vegan tacos? I guess no, you wouldn't know how excited I was so I'll tell you: SUPER FUCKING EXCITED. We went here on purpose a few miles from our hotel just to rock their veggie tacos. Multiple tofu options, from BBQ to veggie and tofu, different sauces... promising stuff. They looked amazing on paper and when they got in front of me on the plate I almost freaked out they looked so good. I was buzzed, 'tis Vegas after all, and when I saw that sexy plate'o'tacos I got ready to regulate. Booze and tacos man, best there is.

So I took a bite. And another bite. One more bite just to confirm, and yea, totally boring. Waaaaay boring. Ultra-mega-super-compound-massive boring. Hopefully I made that clear enough, BORING. So I ate all three of my tacos, each one different, each one differently boring. Finding food boring when you're drunk is hard to do which makes me even more sad.

Maybe the meat ones are the shit, I dunno, but I can 100% vouch that the vegan options are not. One extra star because the lady working the counter was sweet and also simply for having some vegetarian/vegan items in the first place. They were healthy and had very fresh ingredients, just a damn shame the tacos had no flavor. *sigh*
