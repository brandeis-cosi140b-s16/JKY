Disappointment probably best sums it up.

Last time I dropped in, they were still fairly wet behind the ears and working out the kinks, which happens in nearly any business. No one is perfect to start. Unfortunately a few months later wasn't really much better.

I don't want to lag on so I'll bullet point it

* 30min wait time turned in 1hr and 30mins
* guacamole was bland and unexciting
* pastor tacos fell apart when picked up 
* server was good but a little pushy 
* cocktails were loaded with to much alcohol and spoilt the drink (usually a good thing but it's dinner not a bender)
* meat in the tacos was cold

I had high hopes but once again came away disappointed. Maybe I've said it before but it's Mexican food, 12 tacos and guac was $61 and at that price point maybe you'd expect service and food quality to be a bit better.

Coming back: No
