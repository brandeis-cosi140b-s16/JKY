My husband and I went there last night for a date. The music was very loud. I'm good with music, but I would like to be able to talk to my date across the table. 

The service was acceptable. I have nothing to complain about or praise. 

The food was not worth the price. We didn't even finish most of our plates. I love the tapas style and trying multiple dishes. The pork belly was the only good part of the meal. We also had the guacamole with pomegranates and street corn which were alright. The pad Thai, ahi tacos, and the roll we had (had mango salsa on it) were not very good.  

I will not be hurrying back to SumoMaya.
