Avoid this place if you are in a rush. We were looking for a quick bite before the show at Bally's so we popped into the Tequila Bar. We only orderd a couple of hamburgers. They were cooked to order, but you could tell the beef was not fresh and had no seasoning. The fries were stale. The service was beyond slow. I have never had a good meal at any restaurant at Bally's and do not care to give them another chance.
