I came here the other week with my friend. She had a coupon; I think it was $25 off a $35 check or something. We've scoped this place out before while walking around Luxor and have been waiting to try it because it looks pretty cool with all the lighting and such and it's right in the middle of the upstairs walking area in Luxor. 

We were seated somewhere in the back which was nice, dark, and secluded. Our waiter was some annoying guy. I think it was just the way he looked and talked that annoyed me though, it wasn't exactly the service lol. He took our drink and appetizer orders and brought us our complimentary chips and dips which were mediocre. I prefer Coke rather than Pepsi but they only had Pepsi so that's what I got. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler to share. Bleh, it wasn't really good at all. Pretty bland and plain; I probably could've made something similar using Del Taco food. The presentation kinda sucked too, as you can tell by the picture.  We also ordered the Taco Trio to share. I liked that it came with black beans since I like black beans more than pinto. I only tried the chicken taco and I remember it being pretty good. 

After our entr√©e we ordered the Fried Ice Cream for dessert. I've definitely had better fried ice cream elsewhere, but this was alright. We didn't finish it though. 

That was the highlight of my experience there was the free booth pictures. We went to use their photo booth which said $3, but once we got into the booth it just told us to sit and smile, then after taking 6 pictures, it printed it and that was it, FREE.

I probably won't come back here again unless I'm in Luxor and want to take some free pictures.
