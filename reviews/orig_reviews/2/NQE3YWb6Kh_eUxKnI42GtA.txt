The service was HORRIBLE.  We were seated right away and waited for the waitress for about 30 minutes before she even asked for our drink order.  About 20 minutes later we got drinks and needless to say another 20 before she came back to take our order.  She really looked like she was lost.  She took everyones order except mine so I asked her if it was o.k. for me to order something??  So annoying!!  Then when I asked her for a to go box for leftovers she brought me a plastic cup!!!  WTF??  I will NEVER eat there again.  I will however stop at the window outside to get a margarita because those weren't too bad!!  Oh...and did I mention how F'n expensive it was??  $16 for a 2 taco combo and the beans tasted like Rosarita canned beans!!  YUCK!!
