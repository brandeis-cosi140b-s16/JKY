Yeah, maybe I'm too spoiled. It was good and fresh, and clean, but I want even my local taquerias to have some character and some sort of ambiance, even if it's divy. The food wasn't amazing, but I'd eat here in a pinch, without a complaint. Maybe a whine, pretentious and mewling, but not a full on complaint. 

Yelp in LV isn't like in the bay area or the northwest. Peops are so happy to not be lambasted and bombarded by the commercialization around the strip, that anything prepared by actual people instead of employees filling a role seems amazing. My first inclination was that this was a great find - a cheap 4 star joint. Upon returning home though, I realized that this place wouldn't really work if there was anything better around. 

Las Vegas has cool people living there - so friendly! So earnest! -  they deserve cool spots that are local, delicious, and inspired.
