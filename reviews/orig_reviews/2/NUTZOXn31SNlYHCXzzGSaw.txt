I really dislike Macayo's but my mom loves it and her birthday is about the only reason we step foot in this place anymore. Considering how dead it was at 6:30, I'm guessing I'm not the only one who's not a fan. It's really no surprise the Decatur location closed and with so many good eats around this one, I'm willing to bet they're hurting too.

Every time I come here, the food just seems to get worse and worse. The chips are usually decent but this time around they were cold and stale. My wife ordered tortilla soup and a fajita quesadilla and I decided on the Baja chimi. If you look at the photo, you can see how greasy the soup was and her fajita was even worse...she picked up a piece and it was completely soaked. Luckily she had already filled up on stale chips and TCT so she didn't have to eat much. The Baja chimi was ok but the tortilla also tasted stale and to say the shredded beef lacks flavor is putting it lightly. 

If you're in the mood for Mexican food, don't waste your time with Macayo's. There are much better places in town, many of which are the same price or even cheaper! The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is they made a pretty decent margarita and our waitress this time around was very friendly. The food is barely worth one star and until the next birthday, I won't be coming back!
