Over the last year or two I've given them several chances since there's a lot to like about this place.  The Pub area is nice, they have a great outside seating area, they have a great location, and they have chips and salsa at the bar, that's awesome. But would really gives them a poor review is the bar staff, not all of them, but I'm not going to keep track of who's working and when.  Sitting at the bar or in the pub as servers pass you by before you even order the first round then sitting with empty glasses or waiting forever to order dinner, even had someone forget to return my debit card.  I wanted to like this place but I got burned a few too many times.
