This is a modern Mexican bistro. There are no traditional tacky sombreros on the walls, that make an atmosphere of Mexico. Here you can have upscale bistro type Mexican food, not bad food, but not the best in town either. The area is not large, so this place is not good for large groups. 
I had the Sandia Citron (citrus salad). It comes with goat cheese, pepitas, greens and watermelon. I also had a traditional combo, but didn't like it. The meat was subpar, the sauces were decent. 
There is loud music playing inside and sometimes it is hard to hear each other and it's a little pricier than other Mexican restaurants. Service is poor and not satisfying... 
Overall, there are better Mexican restaurants in Vegas with true Mexican atmosphere.
