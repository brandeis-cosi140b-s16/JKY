Invited by friends to go here for dinner on a Sat night and read all the Yelp reviews beforehand to try to get an idea of what food to order (most of the reviews don't really talk about any good/bad particular dishes).  The place looks old and outdated, especially for a hotel type restaurant.  We were seated out on a back side patio which was fine until BIG winged bugs arrived after we ate.  Anyway, the frozen margaritas were good and I ordered the Street Tacos, which were okay but the beef in them could not have been cooked anymore as it was tough and not very tasty.  Chips and salsa are pretty good.  Our group of 7 all ordered different things and no one had had rave reviews or bad comments about their dishes. We ordered flan, fried ice cream and sopapias (sp?) for dessert, which were all polished off.  I live in the Valley and given the multitudes of very good to great Mexican places we have, I don't need to return to Aunt's.
