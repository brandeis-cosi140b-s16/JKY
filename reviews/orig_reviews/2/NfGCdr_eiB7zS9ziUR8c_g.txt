Overpriced, below-average food.  There are dozens of much better mexican food places in town - try one one of them instead.  I had chicken enchiladas (how can you screw that up?) - the chicken was in cubes on the outside of a cheese enchilada.  Basically tasteless, careless preparation of a classic dish.  And beans & rice were an additional charge - good grief!
I will say that $2.50 drafts of Dos XX Amber on a Sunday afternoon was nice - they got that part right!
