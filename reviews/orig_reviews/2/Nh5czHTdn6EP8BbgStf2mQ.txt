We came as a party of four without a reservation. We had about a twenty minute wait, no big deal so we sat at the bar. I Decided on a mojito that was great. Cheers to the bartender. 

We were sat at our table in the outdoor dining area. There was live music playing below our seating area that was great. This was the end of our positive experiences here.

The service was lackluster, not terrible, just nothing special. Any drinks ordered seemed to take some time before coming to the table. Everyone ordered a different meal from the menu. 

The food was nothing to write home about. Our appetizers came out timely, some melted cheese & chips. Then came entr√©e. It was $30 for three small tacos that were not very impressive. Finally, the desert. A very bland banana cream pie. 

I'd give this place another shot. There were some other choices on the menu I'd like to try some time.
