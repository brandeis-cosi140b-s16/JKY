Two bartenders working - a vapid female in too-tight pants and a tall drink of water named JP. 

I ordered a strawberry margarita - my brother a regular margarita. Both no salt. She clarified with us - not once, but twice - about whether we wanted salt. No salt? No salt. No salt? Yes - no salt. Thanks. 

Female "bartender" brings me a daiquiri. One sip and I realize the mistake. She breezes past again and I say, "I'm sorry - but I'd like a margarita. This is a daiquiri." She looks at me, dumb-eyed (like a horrible lead character in some M. Night Shamalamdingdong movie).

"Ummm?" She says, rudely. "Okay?" 

I clarify. "I ordered a strawberry margarita." Begrudgingly, bartender lady takes back the glass and brings the proper drink.

20 minutes later - our glasses empty - she eyes the landscape and says, "...You want 'nother round?" 

"Yes please. Strawberry margaritas, please - no salt."

It was like a shitty version of Groundhogs Day, my friends. We had to play the "No Salt" song-and-dance game again and she miraculously brings me another daiquiri. Are you kidding me?!

The best part about this bar was JP - who, upon realization that his partner in crime was an utter NOOB - brought me a strawberry margarita sans salt. 

Lo and behold - miracle upon miracles - he only asked once. 

Imagine that.
