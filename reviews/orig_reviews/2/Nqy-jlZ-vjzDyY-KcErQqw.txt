Came here for lunch because my lunch date wanted Mexican and it was by both our offices.  They had a $4.99 special of a chicken enchilada with a side of beans and rice.  What a smokin' deal, right?  Unfortunately, the enchilada was horrible.  It was tasteless, old and completely falling apart.  I picked at it and ended up with about 4 bites.  The chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal.  I definitely got what I paid for. Never again.
