GREAT food. AWFUL service. 

They almost always never have certain meats like barbacoa. And when you get disappointed when they're lacking it, the staff makes you feel like it's YOUR fault for not having it. They are very unapologetic. Unfriendly staff, but great food. Also, I went tonight and they didn't have lids to fit their cups! What's with that? Don't waste your time and money here - go to the one by 215 and Eastern, it's not that far away and everything is better there.
