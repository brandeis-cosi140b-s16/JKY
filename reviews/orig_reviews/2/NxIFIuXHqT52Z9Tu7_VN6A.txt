Skip this place. Looking around, I would guess they must be just making it.  The service is lacking. They seem understaffed. The chips and salsa were good. The chicken fundido was average.  I guess it's the empty glasses that sit unfilled, and the mediocre margaritas that earn the 2 stars. The soda was flat, and most of the plates in my party are less than half eaten.  I'm sure at some point they had a good reputation but the current service and level of food is below average.
