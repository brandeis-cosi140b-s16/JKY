I'm between a 2 and 3 for Cantina. It has it's definite pluses and I do like spending time here, but there are a lot of downsides. 

Pros:
The margaritas/bloody marys are delicious (and there is an expansive tequila selection), the amazing patio is reason alone to come here on a warm evening, its a great setup for groups, and I've heard wonderful things about the karaoke.

Cons:
The service here is awful. Now, I've been a cocktail server so I'm usually pretty understanding about service issues...I'm willing to give Cantina staff the benefit of the doubt that they're just chronically understaffed and not that the servers are doing a poor job. But it really shouldn't take that long to put in a drink order and, unless its a busy night, making customers get their own water (from a warm jug in the back) isn't exactly a nice touch. Also, the food here is pretty terrible. Possibly some of the worst "Mexican" I've had in the city. Finally, while the outdoor area is nice, the back room in the indoor area is kind of depressing. Very poorly lit and bare (and not in a cool, dark dive bar way).

In spite of this review, I will probably keep coming here. It's not my favorite place in the world but it does fit the bill when I'm looking for a margarita on a summer evening, particularly if I'm with a large group. I just wished the rest of the experience lived up to the awesomeness of that outdoor patio.
