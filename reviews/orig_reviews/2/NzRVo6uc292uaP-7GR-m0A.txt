Sadly, we had a really bad experience. Our guacamole had a really strange texture and unpleasant taste and the tacos were hardly even mediocre. The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for.
