I know this may be unpopular opinion, but I just never really liked Chino. The combo of the ingredients never sat well with me. I can never stomach it! I don't think I should have to mentally prepare myself to eat somewhere! Perhaps separately, the Chinese and Mexican food would do good, but for the price, I'm still not a fan.
