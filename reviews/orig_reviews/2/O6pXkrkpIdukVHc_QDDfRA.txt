Being an airline crew member, I end up in the same cities at the same nearby restaurants over and over.  And this place is no exception.  I LOVE the cheese enchiladas...with both red and green sauce. No complaints about the food.  My service (Alicia) was okay, but not great And I watched while other tables had terrible service.  One man at another table actually had to get up and go and find his waitress.  The waitstaff is cute young girls.  They stand around their ordering computer screen and bullshit.  They cuss.  They flip their hair.  They talk girly stuff.  But they seldom pay attention to their tables.  And they pay ZERO attention to the not-so-good-looking young Hispanic guy bussing and cleaning their tables for them.....he spoke to me, and I spoke to him.  They do, however, pay a lot of attention to the big muscle boys working behind the bar.  So, yeah, food is fine.  Service feels weird.  Girly.  Young.  Inexperienced.  Shallow.
