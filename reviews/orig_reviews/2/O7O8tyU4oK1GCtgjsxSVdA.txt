I wanted to try this after seeing all the great reviews. So , today I headed over.  It smelled funny when I walked in. Nothing is labeled and no one bothered to explain the menu. I ended ordering something I didn't want because there was no explanation of the menu items and no one working spoke English well enough to have a conversation with.

FYI- if you go here go with someone who understands the menu to guide you.

I was a little worried that I made a huge mistake, but despite not ordering correctly, the food was very good.  It gets two stars for poor service and lack of product labeling.  I'm not psychic if you don't label the menu and the salsa how am I to know what's spicy and what's not.

 I ordered meat lovers tacos-FYI no choice of meat with that. When I tried to ask about making a selection the service person looked at me like I was a stupid gringa.
Next; Chips and salsa but if you want a mild salsa you have to play go fish nothing is labeled.

I am not inclined to visit this place again.
