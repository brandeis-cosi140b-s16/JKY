Overpriced, but you're on the Strip so get over it.  They refuse to take reservations even for large groups -- First come, first served.  If you show up with a yard-long drink from elsewhere, you'll be asked to chug it or leave it at the door before entering.  You need to come here for food or the nightclub to justify the high prices -- Don't come here just for drinks.

Watch out when the waiter offers to bring you chips and salsa -- They're $4 each and they'll bring you "enough for the table" and then you're stuck paying $12 before you even get your menu.

The food was good and the service was OK, but the high prices and sneaky chips leave me feeling just meh about the whole place.
