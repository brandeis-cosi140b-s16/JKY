A disappointment. Ridiculously slow service - had to ask for everything twice. Jalape√±o poppers were not good. 2 people in our group had carnitas burritos and said they weren't very good. I had the Carne asada fajitas and they were good but it wasn't worth going back. Everything was also very over-priced.
