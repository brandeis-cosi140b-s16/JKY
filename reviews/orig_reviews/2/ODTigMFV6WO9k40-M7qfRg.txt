This restaurant was recommended to us by Orr concierge. I have never been in the new plaza called Linq (between Quad and Flamingo) and it is a great little inlet with shops and restaurants. 

The decor was modern, unique light fixtures, and loud music. We were seated in the bar after a 5 minute wait (on a Friday night, not bad!) and had very comfortable high seats, which I liked.

The food was reasonably priced, but lacking in flavor all around. I had tacos, which were very bland, and my husband had enchiladas, which he did not even finish. The food was forgettable, the service was slow, and the drinks were overpriced (as they are all over the Strip). Out server did bring out a complementary birthday flan for my sister with candles and all 

I wouldn't come back here.
