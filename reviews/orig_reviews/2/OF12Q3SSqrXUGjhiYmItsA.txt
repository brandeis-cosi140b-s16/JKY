The margaritas are great and the servers nice, but  food was not so great.  Overpriced ($15 for mini tacos.) 

The tortilla that comes around your taco is the size of a donut and the meat was tough and flavorless. Definatly needed extra seasoning, as did the rice. 

The guacomole was okay- to much cilantro for my tastes, but the hot sauce was good. 

Wouldn't go back, even if it was free.
