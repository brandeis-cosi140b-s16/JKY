Let me start with the positive, cheap beer (for airports). It was about $5 for a craft 16oz beer, everywhere else is about $9 bucks. 

The food on the other hand was pretty gross. I got the burrito bowl and it was dry and 95% rice with a few pieces of chicken and a very small amount of sour cream and guac. Been stuck in the airport for much longer than I expected and I decided to try this because of the reasonably priced beer. Next door is the paradise bread (panara bread for socal folks) go there for food, way better food and better prices.
