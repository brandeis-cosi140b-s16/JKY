Good customer service but the food...not so good.
I can't even believe that this little cafeteria style taco shop has a 4 star yelp rating.
I can only assume that coming from a city so close to the Mexican border, that my Mexican food expectations are above average.  I ordered three different tacos with a side of rice and beans. Both the chicken and pork were dry and the only flavor from the steak came from the salsa I poured on it. The corn tortillas did seem fresh and they have a nice selection of salsa's to pick from but a girl cannot survive through a hangover with salsa and corn tortillas alone. 

One good thing though...just as I'd decided not to take another bite of my food and a homeless guy came up and asked if he could have it. I hope he enjoyed it.
