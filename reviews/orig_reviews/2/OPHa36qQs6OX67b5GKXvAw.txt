Honestly the only reason we come to this caf√© Rio is because it happens to be on this side of town... the service is poor...whenever I make my order on the telephone they are rude or leave me on hold for 5 to 10 minutes I end up hanging up and calling them back and then they will answer the phone! not to mention they always and I mean ALWAYS get my order wrong even though I repeat myself 2 to 3 times! Very frustrating. The restaurant is self is okay the usual long lines but besides that the food is pretty good. The only reason they get two stars is because the food is good. :\
