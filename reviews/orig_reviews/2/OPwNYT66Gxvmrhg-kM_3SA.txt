Third time is NOT the charm. Before starting a shopping spree, my best friend & I dropped in for some sustenance. We sat in the bar so we could partake in the happy hour menu (smaller portions, 4-7p, served in the bar only). This was after the hostess was nowhere to be found. Our waitress took my friend's margarita order, walked a couple yards to the bar then brought the wrong flavor. Then we ordered "2 chicken quesadillas & 2 chicken street tacos". Easy! Yet, somehow, we didn't get everything we ordered. Strike 2. Strike 3? Did I see our waitress roll her eyes!? Quite frankly, we should have eaten at the Chipotle inside the Fashion Show Mall. Their food, service & guacamole are much better.
