To be quite honest and simple, Gardunos made me miss home.  Not because if reminded me of home in any way, but because at home I could get a real Mexican meal for half the cost and 3 times the service.  Bland is not a descriptive enough word to describe the food, and the server was nowhere to be found really until a bus woman would get her attention to get us more drinks.

I gave this place 2 stars because the bartender had a heavy hand in pouring jack and cokes.
