I heard good things so I took my team for lunch yesterday, unfortunately I was not impressed. 3 at best because of the homemade tortillas and green chile.. The fish tacos were overcooked? dry and bland. An unusually long wait for the food. The server was ok, hostess not the happiest person. I wouldn't go back.
