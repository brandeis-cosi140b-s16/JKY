I wanted to love this place so much. It's around the corner from my place and was super excited to hear of its opening. Went in today right at 5. It was hard to miss all of the employees in the restaurant,  and equally hard to miss how messy the salsa bar and drink station were. Surely one of the employees could wipe the counters?  The best thing I ordered was a side of beans. Beans. My turkey mole taco was ok. But the pastor taco had no flavor. Both tacos needed salt. I'm so sad that the food wasn't better. Not sure if I will try again.
