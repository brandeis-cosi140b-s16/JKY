In short a casual bar and grill with a beach theme and enough TV's to entertain people during sporting events. 

The food on the menu is standard middle class Mexican food, from fish tacos to civiches. Most come here for the drinks and order once they are hungry. There is a $5 never ending bucket of chips and salsa.

The outdoor bar is sounded by sand covered floor so don't wear your nice shoes. There a cabanas for the VIP's and a indoors in case the weather turns sour.  

If you are looking for the place to be bar (2010) in the West chandler / Tempe / awatukee area this may be it for you as long as you like laid back non pretentious atmospheres.
