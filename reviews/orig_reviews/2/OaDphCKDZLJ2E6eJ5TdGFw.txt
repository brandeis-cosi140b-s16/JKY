Rurus is a miss for me. I've been there three times now and each time keeps getting worse. We sat on the patio all three times and have had terrible service. We've had waiters disappear, forget orders and drinks, and bring out wrong orders. The trio was meh - the salsa was way to spicy, the queso water, and the quac bland. I've had several tacos which were also sub par. This past time I had the chicken fajitas and had the most measly piece chicken served on a plate. For the prices of the drinks and food I would expect more.

If you want good tacos and margaritas, head to Bakersfield.
