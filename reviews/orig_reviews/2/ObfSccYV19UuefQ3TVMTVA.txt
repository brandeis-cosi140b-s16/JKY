I've been here a few times now.  The pork tacos are greasy and the chicken tacos are usually cold and dry.  I would recommend the steak tacos and the croquetas. I haven't liked any of the salsas so I stopped ordering the combo meals.  They changed their loyalty program when I was two tacos away from a free one.  They said they could transfer it but instead of a punch card I would have to use their iPad mini.  It was a bummer.  I don't want to touch anything public during flu season.  The 'bertos across the street is better.  I think I will stick to it from now on.
