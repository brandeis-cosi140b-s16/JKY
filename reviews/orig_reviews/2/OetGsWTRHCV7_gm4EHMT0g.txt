I so wanted to l ike this place, a lot of money and time went into transforming the former Satisfied Frog.  First of all, $6.25 for a small glass of mediocre wine is way to expensive for this neighborhood, when I get get a significantly better and larger glass or wine at just about every ohter local establishment.  I know they are trying to be authentic Sonoran food, but the packaged tortilla chips served with the salsa is hard to overlook.  Not a great first impression, but I hope they make it--very nice staff.  I think they just need to get their prices a bit more in line with what the neighborhood offers.
