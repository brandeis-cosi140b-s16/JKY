I don't understand the excitement about this place. Went for lunch and tried the chicken tostada. It was ok. 
They do have fresh tortillas that are cooked in front of you so that was nice. I had the tostada sans tortilla so cannot comment on how it tastes but it looked good.
The cafe itself is cute and busy but I may not go back!
