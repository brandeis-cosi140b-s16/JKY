Not impressed. Host was not hospitable at all... Almost walked out then but our crew was hungry.  Tables were sticky and so were the menus. Also the menus had advertisements for 4th of July specials.... In November. Wonder if they would have honored them?  Anyway on to the service... Nothing great, nothing to complain about.  The food however was less than mediocre. Had to send my husbands meal back because they forgot to put half of it on the plate??  Weird. None of us had anything worth writing home about.  Won't be going back any time soon.
