I was expecting this place to be amazing after hearing people rave about this place.  Maybe the other locations are better.  Service was horrible.  Waiter was rude when we asked if they had a children's menu.  Very obvious that they are frequently asked this question.  One would think it wouldnt be too difficult to come up with one.  We sat outside and the cement bench with no back was horribly uncomfortable.  Salsa was below average as well as food.  I ordered tacos and the tortilla was soaked in some type of grease which dripped off as I ate it.  I absolutley LOVE Mexican food.  My in laws are from Mexico and we have authentic Mexican food whenever possible, this place is a poor excuse for Mexican food.  Hopefully it has improved since we have been there.
