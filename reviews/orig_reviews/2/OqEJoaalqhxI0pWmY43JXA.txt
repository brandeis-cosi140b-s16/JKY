This is one of the few options near our apartment (other than pizza and Chinese) that will deliver to us. We have ordered from them three times, and I still have not been impressed. The rice is not seasoned and it should be because the majority of the burrito is rice. They are very sparing with the beans and the chicken. 

Last time we ordered from them (estimated wait time of 30-40 minutes) the driver called 50 minutes after placing our order to say he couldn't find the address in his GPS and was still at the restaurant. When he finally did arrive the cheese fries we had ordered were cold and the queso was congealed.
