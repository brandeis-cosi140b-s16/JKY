Went here for the first time. Not impressed. Decor is kinda cool, but food is not that great. It's a basic bean and cheese kind of Mexican place. We ordered guac and sour cream as well ( which we paid extra for) and never got it. The kids chair didn't have a working buckle and they gave my kiddo a heavy glass plate. Unfortunately, we won't be going back here.
