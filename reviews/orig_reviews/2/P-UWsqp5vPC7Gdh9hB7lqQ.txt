So atmosphere was decent and guacamole was tasty. However not a large portion for $9.  We got tacos. The shrimp was ok but it said crispy (not really), liked the short rib but the fish one was gross and award winning bbq pork was just ok. 

The crab and shrimp ceviche was the most disappointing though. It looked so fresh. However tasting the crab; something seemed off. When we asked the waitress she said "oh yeah it's imitation crab". Wtf so disgusting.

The only thing going for this place for us were the chips,  salsa and decent guacamole. Otherwise nothing great.  Really quite disappointed. Especially after an amazing experience at another taco place the night before (joyride tacos in Gilbert).
