Took the kids here lastnight for dinner.  I woke up, that is a good sign.  I am bummed to see that in 2 years we were away, this place really took a dive.  The prices went up, thequality of the food went down and got smaller, the service was awful,  our order was all jacked up.  I could go on and on. Just because my son and I ask for no sauce doesn't mean we don't want the sour cream.  The shit was dry and we had to power down our food with soda shots like we were on Fear Factor.  No refills... Chips sucked. Ok, thats right I was trying to stop the "compliment" train. 

We used to love coming here, now we will add it to the don't eat at list with Carrapas.  Even our server looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Sad thing is, I remember him from when we used to dine here all of the time.  Poor guy used to be so chipper and happy.  Place sucked the life right out of him.

My one complaint is about paying.  I used to be a server, I know how this works.  All I had on me was a $100.  Dinner came to roughly $40.00.  All large bills when he gave me change.  Yes, I know they aren't a bank.  And I did not take off stars because of this gripe.  But just because I pay like a high roller doesnt mean I am one, and I am not going to over tip because all of the sudden once you saw my loot you thought you could save the last 90 minutes of torture we endured.  A $5 and 5 ones would have been nice. There was NO way I was about to spot a $20! 

When a customer sits at your station why don't you treat them like a friend, not a bastard step child and maybe, just maybe I would have spotted you a few extra bones for making the most of the crappy night.
