I live in the neighborhood and I love checking out new restaurants, so I gave this one a shot a few months ago. I had high hopes as it was a beautiful restaurant and was very busy, but I ordered to go and was very disappointed. The food was bland and while I was waiting for my food to come out I witnessed something completely unacceptable. One of the kitchen staff came out and asked one of the take-out staff IF I HAD TIPPED while I was in sight and earshot!!! I am glad I did tip, who knows what would've been done to my food otherwise. Working in a service based facility, I know very well that this is common conversation among colleagues, but this should never be discussed in the presence of a guest. 
Because of the staff's tackiness and underwhelming flavor of the food, I will not return.
I only gave two stars because the facility is beautiful and their salsa wasn't bad.
