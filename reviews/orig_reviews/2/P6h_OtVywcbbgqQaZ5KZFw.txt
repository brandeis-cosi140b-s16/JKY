I don't like to say this, especially because Charlotte is in need of good new restaurants, but it wasn't good. For starters, you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa. Not free, not $1, but $5!  Then their house margarita is $9.50. The tacos don't come with sides, no rice, no beans, nothing. You have to pay for sides. So without even getting into the flavor of the food, it's pretty clear they are nickle and diming the customers. 

That being said, I have no problem paying (or even overpaying) for good food. Unfortunately the food wasn't great. The carne asada tacos didn't have much flavor, neither did the pork carnitas tacos. Didn't even seem like they seasoned or marinated them.  Really underwhelming. The crispy chicken taco was solid. The $9.50 house margarita was average. And the $5 chips and salsa were good, but not worth the money.  On the plus side, the patio is fantastic. 

Overall there are better, and certainly much more affordable, options for Mexican food in Meyers Park and the surrounding areas.
