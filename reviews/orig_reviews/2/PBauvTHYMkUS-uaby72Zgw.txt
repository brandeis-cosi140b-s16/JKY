Waaaaay overhyped!!! It's slow, pricey, and the food is just average. There is also zero ambience, but I knew that from the reviews so I didn't care. A lot of these things can be overlooked if the food was the bomb, but it wasn't anything special. Part of it has to do w/ the crappy and confusing menu, so I didn't get what I wanted.

The menu is confusing and the cashier didn't really explain things well either. My food took 30 minutes to get and that was after waiting in line for 10-15 minutes in their non-air-conditioned building. The food was good but average and quite a lot of excess tortilla compared to the amount of filling, and the sauce was quite salty. What was $11 here would be $8 everywhere else so I don't know how they get away with charging so much given their location and building.
