The key here is there salsa bar, which like Baja Fresh, is all-you-can-serve-yourself. It's not bad overall, and the margaritas here are strong and tasty, according to my fellow drinkers. They don't have spots necessarily for food & watching the TVs over across at the 24/7, those are drinking only spots? Odd.

The mixed appetizers dish is massive, and the four sauces (bean, spicy, guac, and salsa) dish is good, too, but it almost feels like a Chili's implanted into the Palms. Not necessarily the best of motivations to go here other than the drinks.

A bit dark, but a place where you can grab chips, salsa, and drinks without too much trouble.
