Tried to get me to sign up for the spam card.  When I asked if they'd send texts etc initially I was lead to believe I could opt out of that.  She explained it as an "electronic lunch card" then I asked why they needed my number.  The food isn't bad but for the trouble I much prefer Chipotle.  I was told they wouldn't honor my accumulated punches;  Which would have been the next visit.  #lasttimeieatthere
