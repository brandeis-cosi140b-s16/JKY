The prices here are really high for what you get & poor service. $9 for a 6 ounce margarita, my friend's was so salty we had to send it back. The bartender had difficulty promoting & describing the drinks off the margarita menu.

Once we got seated at a table, the server stopped by to greet us so we ordered waters and a sprite, she said she was gonna go bus a table and come back for our drink order. Mind you no one was waiting at the door for a table.

Next my friends wanted charro beans with their fish, the were out, so they settled for the black beans. A few minutes later the waitress came by to say the walk in fridge has a latch problem and was left open last night and the black beans are not tasting right, so she recommended the rice. After that we all look at each other and said " I wonder what else was bad in the cooler, I don't think she should have told us that".

My friend got a steak burro for $9 and it was go small with nothing else, she only ate half & said it was only ok. I bet you can get a better burro at Chipolte.

My other friends had swami in foil, customarily the waitress should open it for you but she didn't. My friends really enjoyed the fish.

This place needs some work on service, quality and value for your money.
