Have not gone to Macayo's in a long time so thought I would try it out on Valentines day. It was one of the only places I could make a reservation and get seated early in the night.  The reasons I had stopped going here all the time still seem to be apparent.  The server was nice but not very personable at all.  Just going through the motions.  Was never offered more chips and fresh salsa..or another beer. ordered a salad to share.  Not even halfway through our salad the main courses showed up. Not very happy with that. The food is very bland tasting. I used to think Arribas was mediocre, this was a step down from that. The brava sauce and the salsa with the chips was very watery and bland. No flavor. I think something was wrong with the sour cream on the side we shared because we both had unsettled stomachs later in the night.  Everyone working their seemed to be in a state of mind of rather being somewhere else.  Over heard personal conversations, the hostess stand was a gossip station. I still tipped the waitress well because it is not necessarily her fault she was trained to just go through the motions. And when you ask someone if they would like their burrito enchilada style, pls mention there is a charge for that. Our waitress made it sound more like an offer. Sticking with Manuel's from now on
