I should've stopped at the salsa, which was strangely sweet. We tried two or three different flavors of salsa and it was like someone poured sugar in it. We went with our Canadian friends who loved it, although Canada is not a beacon for authentic Mexican food. My girlfriend and I were disappointed in the flavors of our food. While not inedible it was unauthentic. Definitely a "Meh, I've experience better."

For those with a mild and bland palette this may be for you, but it didn't appeal to me whatsoever.
