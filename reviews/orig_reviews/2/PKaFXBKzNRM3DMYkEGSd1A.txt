What a beautiful place to sit and watch people and the bright lights of Vegas along the strip! Unfortunately the food was awful. Enchiladas verdes was too sweet, the chicken was tasteless, the rice was dry and flavorless, pinto beans had an "off" taste, and the asiago cheese smelled and tasted bad.  The salsa had a bitter and dark taste and the queso seemed to be a bit runny and tasted like stale beer.  I also felt like there was a phone signal jammer nearby used so that we could not use our phones and they could turn over the table. The waitresses took our check and our drinks and napkins and we weren't quiet finished wiping our hands. There are a lot of better places close by.
