Dear Yelpers you have led me astray... This place was no where near as great as everyone said it would be and for the money I spent I was expecting great Cuban food. I had the loma saltado and it was supposed to come with papas and to my amazement there weren't any, not to mention the food to me was bland and I could not taste not smell any garlic and where is the cilantro? I've had my share of Cuban and Puerto Rican food and I must say I was not impressed not even a little..... It will be a long time before I return.
