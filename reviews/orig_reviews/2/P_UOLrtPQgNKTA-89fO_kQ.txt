Oh dear Diablo Cantina...
No more specialty cocktails for you. If the Sinful Vixen was just a taste of what your bartenders have up and created I think I should have a whack at altering your recipes. I will say this though their cocktails might be bad but the chips and salsa is delicious and well the bartenders aren't too shabby themselves.
