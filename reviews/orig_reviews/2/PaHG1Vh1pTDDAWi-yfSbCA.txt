First visit - last visit.  I spent the last 40 years in NM and find the AZ version of Mexican food to be very bland.  The salsa is very watery, the food is dry, the chips were blah.  But what will keep us from going back is the $6.25 charge for a tiny glass of what they called 'sangria'.  It was white wine with ice and diced fruit in a small wine glass.  Could not have contained more than 2 ounces of wine.  We were never offered a drink menu so we were ordering blind.  My husband and I were astonished.  I mentioned the problem to the hostess as we were leaving and she said.....nothing.  Not one word.  We had a better meal last week at Rubios at about 1/2 the cost - including a great glass of sangria.
