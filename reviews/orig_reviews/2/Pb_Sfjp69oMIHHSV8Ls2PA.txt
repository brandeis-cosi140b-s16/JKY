I am sorry but this was so disappointing.  The Wife and I went here for an early dinner during restaurant week.  Here were there good things:

1. The tequila - Don Eduardo Anejo
2. The Flan

.............and that is it

The bad:

1. Guacamole     4/10     (bland)
2. Frozen margarita       1/10     (tasted like cleaning solvent)
3. Steak fajitas     3/10     (cold and tough)
4. Made table side guac and the waited 10 mins for chips.. hmmm

There are a lot of good reviews here so I would suggest you give it a try and see for yourself.  I will not be giving it a second chance.  I might head back there for the bar and the atmosphere in the epicenter.
