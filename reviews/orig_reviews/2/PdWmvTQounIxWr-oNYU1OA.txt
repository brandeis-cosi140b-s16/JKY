Well, I accompanied my friend here a weeks ago because his friend had a special happy hour thing going on. 

So in order to receive the happy hour promotional benefits, you had to wear a wrists band based on the person your representing. So I'm thinking, "Going to get good beer and liquor at good prices!", nope. All they did was lower their ridiculous prices down to regular bar prices. Furthermore, not only do they not have any special exotic drinks, but they didn't even have a special house drink nor any drink specials. Not impressed. Also the happy hour wrist band prevents you from having to pay the $10 entrance fee.  *rolls eyes*

It had a club/restaurant/sports bar atmosphere. Weird combination to say the least but it smelled good. And the waitresses in tight short black shorts were pleasing to the eyes I guess. I guess my main complaint about this place is, it doesnt seem like a place where I am willing to follow their strict dress requirements just so I can have a basic bar experience. If you must go, make sure you have a happy hour promotional thing going on. I personally will just go to the yard house or margaritaville. Or maybe just to johnny rockets or something. West gate has way better selections.
