Maybe I came on an off day, but my food at Habanero's was bleh.  I mean, it was edible, but lacked flavor.  I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos and might as well had just boiled shrimp with a little blackened color.  I have friends who love this place, but based on this experience I have no inclination to go back and give it a second go.
