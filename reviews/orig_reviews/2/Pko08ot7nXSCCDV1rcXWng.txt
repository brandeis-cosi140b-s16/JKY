Pricey for mediocre food.  The service our group of 6 had was pretty reasonable.

My biggest gripe about this place is that you have to PAY for chips and salsa.  It's not cheap either.  In addition, we got the guacamole.  We were so excited to get a bowl full of guac only to realize the bottom of it was a bunch of crushed chips so that [as our waitress explained] you don't drag your fingers through the guac.  Uh...whatever.

All of us ordered burritos.  I got the veggie burrito although I'm not vegetarian.  It was mostly filled with sauteed onions with a bell pepper here and there.  Overall, not the biggest fan of the food.

Of course with any restaurant along the strip, it wasn't cheap ($9 for a small burrito).  I will admit the salsa and hot sauce were amazing but such a rip off.  This is a fun place to drink but when you drink you want snacks...so just expect to shell out a pretty penny or 100.  [haha?]
