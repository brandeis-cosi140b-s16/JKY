so this is 2 star reviewed for the second time in a row. we had a former arizonan in town for the week and she really wanted to go to the Old Town Tortilla Factory so we headed there after a hike up Piestewa.

i can't figure out why my first experience here was so good, but so bad since then. tonight, our service was well below mediocre. we had to wait, and wait, and wait for everything....menu's, the tortilla's, our food, our drinks, our water, the check, etc. 

my wife's salad had cold, overcooked shrimp. our other dinner guest ate only half his carne dish. he even commented that while the margarita's were good, if they put any alcohol in them. 

i love the patio here. i think it's so charming. but 2 times in a row of sub par service and lackluster food pretty much does it for me.
