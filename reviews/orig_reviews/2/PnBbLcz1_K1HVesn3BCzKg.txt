The guacamole is definitely packaged - tastes exactly like Wholly Guacamole brand... Not impressed. Service wasn't much better. Food? Very below average... After many years of using yelp, this is actually the first yelp review I have ever written. That's how strongly I disagree with the current rating that this place has. (And compared to what my friend and boyfriend had to say about the entire experience, I'm being pretty nice.)
