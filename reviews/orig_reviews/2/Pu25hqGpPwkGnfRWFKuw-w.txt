Food tastes good but they consistently run out of vegi options. Tonight, they are out of mushroom tacos... But wait, they are also out of beans (this a Mexican restaurant, right?) so a bean & cheese burrito is out of the question as well.  Last time, it was a breakfast debacle where they didn't have beans so no vegi options either.  The only thing available was covered in cheese. The few times they have had food, it was tasty. I would give a 3/5 for food but a 1/5 for selection.
