Went here today and got the pork burrito. The burrito was mostly beans and rice and hardly any pork. My burrito was really bland and had no flavor except for a little sweet bite of pineapple every once in awhile. If I am going to spend 7 dollars on a burrito I will go up the street to Chipotle, at least that has flavor. I got their Brushfire salsa which has a flavor I don't care for (kind of plastic flavor). The girl taking the order was really nice and the fact they just opened I gave them 2 stars. I know sometimes it takes a little while to find your footing. Hopefully they will invest in some seasoning or at best some salt.
