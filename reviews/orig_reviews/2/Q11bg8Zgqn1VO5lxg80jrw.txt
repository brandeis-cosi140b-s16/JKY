There was no wait to get inside the restaurant. That should have been a sign that it was not very good. I got the chicken tacos and they were bland, dry, cold, and the tortillas were hard. I couldn't even finish the meal. I'm still inside debating wether to complain or not before I leave. 1 person had a good meal, that's what the 2 stars are for. Don't go here!!
