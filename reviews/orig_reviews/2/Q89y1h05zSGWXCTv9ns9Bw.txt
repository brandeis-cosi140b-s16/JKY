In my (probably not so popular or nice) opinion, I think this place is a pox on the spirit of walnut street in shadyside. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Long are the days of the couple of relatively quiet dive bars in shadyside and enjoying a nice stroll home at night. This place is like a loud club with a patio: loud music, loud (and drunk) college or post college graduates stuck in their old Greek life days, cigarette butts paved over the sidewalk in front. Further, the food and drinks here aren't event particularly good. I understand that this is some peoples' scene, but it's not really mine.
