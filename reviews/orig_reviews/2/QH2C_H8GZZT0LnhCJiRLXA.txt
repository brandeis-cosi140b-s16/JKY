There are only two stars to give to this place, one for the location and patio view, and the other for the decor of the restaraunt.  The salsa was great too, but I'm out of stars.

I and another guest at the table ordered a steak and chicken taco combination, there were three of us total. Our food came out in minutes!!  WOW!  I read another reviewer here with the same experience, littlerally a minute or two after they ordered it, and for that gave it 4 stars.  Let me clue you in!  This Vegas magic performance is not a good thing. Chicken and Steak take time to cook!!!  I can tell you, from the taste, that this was not cooked to order.....  NOR was it cooked anytime in the past hour prior to eating it.  I'm suprised I didn't donate my food to thier bathroom afterwards, it was so gross I didn't finish it.  The waitress never came back to ask us how our food was, nor did anyone for that matter.  **Ramsey alert, I think this place is a canidate for Kitchen Nightmares!!

If you want a cool patio view and a drink of some sort, this is your spot, otherwise, RUN, not WALK, somewhere else.  Overpriced microwave food can be had elsewhere!
