I had lunch at SOL with a coworker last week. It was ok. The staff was very friendly and overall service was perfectly acceptable. The vibe of the restaurant is very trendy and upscale.
They start you off with chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips were weird and tasted burnt almost, but the salsa and bean dip were good enough to cover that funky taste.
I had the Eggplant Torta and my coworker had the Carne Asada tacos. My sandwich was good, I would order it again as long as the grease level went down a notch. The side salad was boring as all get out. The $11 price tag seemed reasonable since it was a large portion.  My poor coworker...$15 for 3 tiny dried up tacos that didn't even taste decent. He was really unhappy with his meal. 
We had high hopes for SOL, unfortunately it just didn't measure up. Bummer.
