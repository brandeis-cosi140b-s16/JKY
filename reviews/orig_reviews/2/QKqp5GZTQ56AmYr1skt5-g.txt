First of all, staff is obnoxious - cashier was nice but the lady calling the numbers and expediting the food was RUDE. Atmosphere is loud and chaotic; however, it was a Friday night. I had 3 item combo and not impressed with my food. My son had a carne  asada  burrito- the meat was bland and chewy-it was not edible- he took 2 notes and we threw it away. Because it was chaotic- I decided not complain but just ordered a bean and cheese burrito- it took well over 15min to get it. My daughter had a 2 item combo-enchilada and taco- she liked it. I would give the food a 2.5 and service and atmosphere 1
