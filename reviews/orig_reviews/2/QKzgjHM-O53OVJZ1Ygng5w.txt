We ate here for lunch this week while in Vegas.  I was inspired to go here by the great reviews but we have had much better here in Atlanta.  The ordering process was so disorganized.  You go in and the cooks ask you what you want.  Then, you have to go to the cashier in a separate area and tell her what you ordered.  The people behind the counter forgot a couple of things we asked for. We ordered steak quesadillas and an assortment of tacos. The meat itself was good.  However, I could not taste any cheese in the quesadillas.  Also, you have to ask for salsa instead of it being included in the salsa bar most mexican fast food places have.  The salsas also were not very good.  No heat and lacked flavor.  Almost any mexican will tell you that it's the salsas that make or break a taco. Also, the cooks were openly cursing which is not good when you have kids with you.
