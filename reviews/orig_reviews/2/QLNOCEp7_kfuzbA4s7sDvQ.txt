For years I've listened to co-workers tell me how great this place is. The Yelp reviews spoke well for the place too. Where this comes from I'll never know.

This weekend we went to Pedro's for the first time and I was super excited. I love Mexican food, Americanized or not. I was extremely disappointed in this place.

Chips and salsa are a staple of any Mexican restaurant and they've got them here. Good sign I thought. I put some on a chip and crunched it in my mouth and was immediately disappointed. I don't know what the deal was with it but it was not good. My wife thought canned, I disagreed but whatever it was, it was sweet. Sweet salsa is no good in my book.

I was skeptical at this point and we got our menus and looked them over while trying to modify the salsa to our liking. I think their food is a little pricey compared to a lot of places in town which made me even more skeptical. The waitress came and I ordered a standard staple which they called "the business man's plate" consisting of rice, beans, an enchilada and a taco.

The food comes and my skepticism grows even further as my entire plate is covered in shredded cheese. Listen, I'm a semi-fat guy and I love cheese as much as anyone else but when you're using that much cheese you're trying to mask something. I look at the taco and it looks like a pre-made taco shell, like something you'd get at the grocery store but maybe a little more light and thin. I was surprised to find the taco shell wasn't too bad and the beef inside was pretty good as well. The enchilada on the other hand was crappy at best. The sauce? Not so good and the tortilla seemed undercooked. It just wasn't right. I didn't really try the beans as that's not my thing but my wife said they were sweet like the salsa. I should note the chips even seemed kind of sweet but that may have been the salsa too. The rice was the saving grace of the meal, I did indeed enjoy the rice but that's it.

When we left I called my mother in-law to see if she'd ever eaten there and she said she thought it all gross as everything was sweet. I was happy to hear this as it confirmed I wasn't the only one who thought so.

If I were ever in the area (not often) and jonesing for rice (pretty sure that's never happened in my life) I might consider stopping in for a pint of it to go. Otherwise I'm more than happy to never set foot in this place again.

How this place has a 4 star average and so many awards hanging on their wall is beyond me.

Don't believe the hype.
