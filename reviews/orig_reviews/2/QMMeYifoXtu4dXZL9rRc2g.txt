Our visit to Sylvia's La Canasta Mexican Restaurant was, in a word, sub-optimal. We'd seen the place for a couple years and never dropped in but decided the beautiful spring weather was our opportunity to try the nearby patio.

Nothing about the visit was a disaster but, as others have mentioned, the service was painfully slow. This meant long periods without water refills, which made the only-adequate food even less impressive. By the end of the visit we just wanted our check and to be on our way -- naturally, this transaction took 10+ minutes. 

I don't know if I'll go back. Seeing that my experience seems to be the standard (for some time now), I think I'll keep exploring the valley.
