I was born really close to the Mexican border so when I heard this was the best Mexican place in town, naturally I had to act fast.

It's located centrally which is pretty nice - not in the best neighborhood, but easy access to the freeway.

I should've known that this place was going to be a disaster from they're chips and salsa. One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. 

When our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre. The beans were too salty, and the meat was under-seasoned. 

Prices are reasonable for a sit down joint, but you can honestly get better food a Roberto's. Skip this one!
