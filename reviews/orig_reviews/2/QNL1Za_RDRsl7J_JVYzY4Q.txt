Blah .... that is the main flavor of the food we all experienced and we all had different dishes.  The salsa was the only thing on the table with any true flavor noted. We honestly have not been here before but my son was excited to try it as the place seems to be busy on First Fridays. As noted in other reviews, the service is ok - but they seemed eager for us to finish and leave - which wasn't relaxing. 

Well, now we know and we honestly will not be back - too many other places with great food.
