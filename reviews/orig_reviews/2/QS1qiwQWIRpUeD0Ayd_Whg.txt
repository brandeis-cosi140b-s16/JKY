This place is hit or miss, when they're on it's pretty good and when they're not it's a disaster; unfortunately they have more misses than hits. What bites is that you lose your butt in their casino, which is 99.9 percent of the time at Silverton, so you tuck tail and wander around looking for where you want to eat and you find yourself walking into Mi Casa. All the while hoping that with the rest of your hard earned cash, that you have left over from your child's college fund, you can get yourself a decent meal with great service and once again you're sorely disappointed. Most of the time the food is a mixture of bad, be it cold or bland or not enough of one or too much of another. Every time I go into the Silverton I have to stretch because it gets harder and harder as I get older to grab my ankles. I would avoid gambling and eating here, at least at this restaurant and just stick to the decent cheap rooms and Bass Pro Shop!
