It was just kinda dull all the way around.

The service was so-so. The food was so-so.

We ordered cheese and jalape√±o dip. It was as watery as soup and no sabor. It was sent back. The waiter didn't seem surprised when I handed it back to him.  
We all ordered combo plates. BF got 2 enchiladas with green sauce, they brought him red sauce. It was corrected quickly. Mom got the taco place and I had the flautas. Nothing stood out. 
I think the prices are too high for the quality and quantity you are given. 
The one thing that irked me was that they charged me $3 for a little cup of chili sauce, and I mean little. I asked them if they had spicy salsa cuz the stuff they served with the chips had no kick. So the waiter brought me a little cup of chili sauce. This isn't something I would be charged for in Los Angeles so it didn't even cross my mind to ask. I was surprised when I saw the $2.99 on the check, but I did ask for it so....... Lesson learned. 
The best part about this place was the outdoor seating.
