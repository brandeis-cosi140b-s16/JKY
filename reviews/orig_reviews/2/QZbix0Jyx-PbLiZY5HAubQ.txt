Lunch on a slow day BUT I ordered a Dos XXs lager on tap. (Sarcasm alert) I didn't realize my order was so complicated. The first beer was a bottle. The second was Dos XXs Amber on tap and the final was Dos XX lager on tap. Third times the charm I guess. Not comin back. If you decide to come here I hope you have a better experience.... ordering a beer.
