Passing through Phoenix airport and ordered a vegetarian bowl.  It cost more than $8 and I left a tip.  Opened the bowl to find about 1/3 cup of rice and 1/3 cup of black beans, plus a sprinkle of fajitas and a tablespoon of sour cream and tablespoon of guacamole.  In other words, it was very, very little food for the price I paid.  Also it was quite greasy and over-salted.  

Airport food, sigh.
