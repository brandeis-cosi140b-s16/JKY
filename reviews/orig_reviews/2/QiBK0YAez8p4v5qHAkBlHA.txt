Not good...tables were not clean, waiter was scattered and they charged me $6.00 for a margarita that was worth $2.00.  I have driven past it numerous times and the outside makes you want to go in - but looks are not always as they seem.  Save your time and money - There are to many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix that are better.  We wont be back.

On a good note - the food was pretty good.  But, there is something wrong with the energy of this place.
