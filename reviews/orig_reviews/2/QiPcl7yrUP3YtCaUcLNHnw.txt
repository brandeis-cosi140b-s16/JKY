After my initial experience here, the most immediate question in my mind is how well capitalized are their investors?

To the uninitiated Gadzooks appears to have been created to be as much a Chipotlé spinoff as possible.  From the hip, industrial design of the interior to the simplified menu options.  They've also borrowed Chipotlé's basic "build your own"  menu format.  Except rather than burritos - it's enchiladas... And as an afterthought soup.  

While Chipotlé's menu is easy and intuitive, Gadzooks offers a 7 step choose your own adventure book accessed only by reading the most awkwardly placed chalkboard in restaurantdom.   The enchilada was bland.  The service seemed to be working awfully hard for so few guests.  The atmosphere was stylish but cramped.  

I think these guys set out with a good idea, let's hope they have the capital to fix their fundamentals and get back on track.
