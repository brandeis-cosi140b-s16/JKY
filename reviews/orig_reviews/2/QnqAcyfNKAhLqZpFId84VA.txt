Hit or miss. The last time we went here, we walked out. Food is alright, nothing special. Some servers take pride in their work, but the most recent had an attitude. We downed the chips and salsa waiting for our meal and as we were drinking margaritas wanted to continue to nibble. We asked for more. This was strange as they customarily bring new before you are out... They refused to bring more and basically ignored us. They were not out of chips as they continued to bring them to new tables being sat. I went to the bar to inquire again and was told they would be right out. 5 minutes passed and then we were told our food was almost ready so we didn't need more. What!?! We paid for our margaritas and promptly exited the building.
