Oh you want chips and salsa?  You have to pay for it....REALLY, a Mexican restaurant, at a local casino and chips and salsa are not free?  Oh, you want rice and beans with your meal?  You have to pay extra for that too!  All taco plates come with 4 tacos (small tacos), you cannot mix and match, all have to be the same (all chicken, all beef, all pork, etc.)  Rubios has better fish tacos.  Spending $80.00 for 2 on a Mexican meal, and a couple alcohol drinks for 2 at a local spot, is absurd!  Service was just ok.  They say they are from New York and Chicago, people expect to pay these absurd prices there, so go back to NY and Chicago and continue to rip off those people!
