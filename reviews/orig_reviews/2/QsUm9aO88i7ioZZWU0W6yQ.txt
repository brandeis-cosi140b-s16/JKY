I went here earlier today. Not all bad. The food was decent, but service was pretty slow. Prices were pretty reasonable, around $20 for two people. It was louder than I expected for being early (around 7), there was constantly two different songs playing and everyone trying to talk over it. That didn't bother me quite as much as how many children were here. Kids 15 and under with their parents. It just didn't seem appropriate. Anyhow, I will definitely try coming back at night sometime to get a better feel for the place.
