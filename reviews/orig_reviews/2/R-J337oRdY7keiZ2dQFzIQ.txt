Meh. Went here last week with a few friends.. a couple things were really good.. others were a total miss.. We ordered the 

Watermelon Marg- good but not worth 12 bucks 
Pomegranate Guac- Awesome!
Pork belly roll- So-so very salty 
Softshell crab roll - bland mostly rice
Ahi Tacos-  Good but mini- think half the size a street taco 
Duck Confit Rice- Salty hardly any duck
Eggplant- Really good 

All and all it was so-so, super cool d√©cor, fun atmosphere. But a little gimmicky.
