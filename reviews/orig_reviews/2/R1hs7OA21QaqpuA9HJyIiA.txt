Mad Mex Oakland, how I want to love you...I want to love you so bad. In previous reviews of Big Burrito restaurants, I noted that the group could do no wrong. Estaba equivocado--disappointment, thy name is Mad Mex.

I don't want this review to be completely negative, though. The margaritas are awesome. The beer list is sweet. They were one of the few places to sport a keg of the Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout last year. Coming in, sitting at the bar (if you can get a seat), getting an appetizer, and having a good ol' fashioned college night on margaritas blurs together some of my favorite memories of Oakland.

Every time I make an attempt to eat a substantial meal there, though, I'm reminded again and again as to why I don't go back for years.

This review is nearly five years in the making. That's almost five years of consistently poor service, mediocre food, and minor mistakes--I've gone through everything from a take-out order being filled incorrectly to being charged for drinks I never received to waiting a long time for a meal (no biggie) only to get the wrong meal (it happens) only to receive the right meal with incorrect options (sour cream instead of guac, what was asked to be on the side wasn't there, etc.).

There have been up-sides to it, though--servers waiting ten or fifteen minutes to put in our order because we want to take advantage of Happy Hour; usually, as long as it isn't too busy, you can hold a nice small conversation with the servers or bartenders; the ice cream burrito is pretty tasty...but, the downsides are all too common, and nothing has changed in the five years that it took to reach these two stars. The gobble-rito seems like a good reason to try again, and I'm sure in another two months, I'll find myself asking, "Why don't I go back to Mad Mex?", once again completely forgetting the experiences I've had.

I am so sorry.
