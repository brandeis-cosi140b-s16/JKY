Sorry to be the one to do this, but the rating for today is low.  I know this establishment has only been open 2 days, but there were some major downfalls in today's experience.

To start, the fish taco was awesome!  So were the side dishes.
The shrimp taco was not so awesome.  In fact, I'm tempted to go get a bottle of Pepto just in case.  I'm pretty sure the shrimp was not cooked all the way through.

I would have still given them 4 stars if the service was on top of things.  They were very friendly, and we beat the lunch-crowd rush, so it was not busy at all when we arrived.  My colleague ordered his bowl and they showed up with an extra burrito.  After explaining to the waiter that he did not order that, they said they would go "take care of it", but nobody returned with a refund or credit, and by the time we left, there were 20 people in line.  That was an expensive lunch for him.  I ordered the special with 2 fish tacos and asked for an additional shrimp taco.  I got one of each.  I was fine with it because the special comes with a heaping plate of beans and rice, but the guy at the counter even repeated the order to me.  He must have been having some malfunctions with his terminal.

More positives include the nice job they did on the layout.  The previous Rockin' Baja Lobster layout was not very well thought through.  Now the bar area is completely separate from the restaurant.  Great for the lunch crowd to just pop in or to take the kids for dinner, without hearing the bar crowd or dealing with smoke.

I expect to revise this review at a later visit.  For now....work out the processes Wahoos.  I'll be back.
