Watched the Fiesta Bowl Parade today. Decided to stop at America's Taco Shop on the way home for a quick bite. Have to say that I was disappointed. The food had almost no flavor. The Carne Asada tasted like lime juice and the Al Pastor taco was overpowered by the mango.

I have definitely had better.
