PLEASE READ FIRST
Now this is my experience why I'm giving it such a low score, and the dish I ordered. 


So I'm just gonna get to the point. DONT ORDER THE FAJITAS! Literally was not worth $21. The bell peppers and the potatoes felt like they were from a frozen bag. Felt so bland and just plain grade F  food. On top of that they gave me what appeared to be a salsa bowl with rice and beans together. Like wtf?! You can't be serious. Now I'm a big dude and that little salsa bowl of rice and beans wasn't even close to filling up a toddler. The tortillas were even more of a big joke. Felt like paper. They should feel a disgrace to call them self a "real" Mexican food. I swear to any god I can find those tortillas at any dollar store. The chicken on the other hand was pretty good. Not disappointed at all with that. I do recommend the house steak however. I came with other friends and saw them with the steak and it looked like an amazing dish. Waaaay better than what I ordered and cheaper too. Over all don't get there fajitas.
