Oh, Joyride, I really want to like you but I just can't. Maybe I ordered the wrong things. I opted to get the the tamales because they come with the house rice and veggies instead of having to pay extra for sides with the tacos. The tamales were just okay, kind of expensive for what you get, and I have to say I really missed having a side of beans built into the meal with the rice. However, the "white magic" sauce is fantastic. A star for that alone! Maybe other Mexican food places have spoiled me but seriously how much more expensive would it be to included some beans with the meal?? I also got the Jamaica...I mean, Hibiscus drink and it was by far way too sweet. Which was shocking for me because I love sugary sweet things and it was just too much. So much so I didn't even want dessert. I've never said that before. I always want dessert. The house salsa is okay. Not bad but again not great and same goes for the chips. Definitely not what they should be using to draw people into the place. I will say the staff is super friendly and attentive. Maybe too much so. At least 5 different people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. It made me wonder exactly who was our server if everyone is checking on us. Nice but odd. Anyway, I promise to try you one more time for the tacos. Fingers crossed it'll be better.
