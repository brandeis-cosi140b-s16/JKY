Pretty bad. I went here around 9pm on a Wednesday, and it was pretty empty. The speakers were extremely loud for an almost-empty dining room...my group could barely talk to each other! The food was pretty bad too...the flour tortilla and beef of my taco were extremely dry...it was painful to eat. Cabo Wabo gets the two stars for service though--our waiter was attentive, and although the place was empty, the DJs put up a good front trying to recruit passersby for karaoke.
