Colleague and I were immediately seated for lunch as we decided to try this new, classy looking Mexican restaurant in Epicenter. Food was not bad - I have had better Mexican food elsewhere (Texas & other restaurants in Charlotte), but Uptown Charlotte has been missing a Mexican restaurant and this probably attempts to fill that void.

What ruined the experience was our waiter who probably had a hyperactivity syndrome. We quickly got tired of the "how's everything?" and "can I get you something else?" which he fired away at us every couple minutes when we were trying to hold a conversation and eat in peace. And umm, odds of me agreeing that I'm done are high when you place your hand on my plate, take it half way across the table and ask me if I'm done! We were only there about 40 minutes and we didn't see a long queue at the door either, so were quite confused at the attempt to quickly get through the diners.

Overall - decent food +ADHD waiter = 2 stars. I'll have to try their tequila next time.
