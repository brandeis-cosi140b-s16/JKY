I came here for my first and likely only time.  I really liked the atmosphere and the location.  It looks like a fun place to stop in and have drinks at the bar with friends.  It was half-off apps during happy hour and we ordered chips and queso.  Some chips were completely bland while others were buried in chili powder.  The queso was good.

The carnitas tacos were pretty underwhelming.  They weren't horrible just "meh" and not something I'll order again.  The rice was bland as well.  The beans looked gross.  I thought the food was overpriced for what you're getting.

As far as the drinks go, I was disappointed with the beer selection.  It falls well short of Mad Mex.  The liquor selection did look good, however, in addition to their "Yinzerita" that I didn't try.

Finally, the service sucked.  Our waitress paid virtually no attention to our table.  When she did rarely stop by she would only give short one-word answers when we tried to get any sort of information out of her.  A friend and I ordered a beer that was listed as a special for the day.  We later got our checks and the waitress informed us that it was not a special, despite it being listed on the drink menu as such (also on the website as a special).

I really have no reason to eat here again but I wouldn't mind hanging out at the bar with friends.
