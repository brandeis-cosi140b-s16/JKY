That moment when the food and the stars don't match up. For me fusion is Kogi, because it's literally two different types of food coming together: synergy. This place is more like segregation, the food just doesn't mix well. It's quite literally Mexican food and Korean food, served like a layer cake, none of it is combined in any culinary way. The burrito I got was dry, it was just bulgogi and lettuce in a wrapped, me choking with every bite on the way down. I won't continue, it just didn't do the job of fusing. Best part of that meal was my Mexican coke, which was what I got when I ordered a Mexican pepsi.
