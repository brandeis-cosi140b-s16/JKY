The burger was pretty good- the service was disappointing. Our waitress looked like a vegas dancer but had the attitude of a grumpy old bar maid. Tables are packed like sardines and the R&R music is great but a little too loud....the burger was tasty...the iced tea was cold:) The fries were meh...not very fresh & nothing to write home about.
