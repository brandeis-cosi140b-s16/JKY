As a taco master back in la, I can confidently judge tacos.

I was hungry and wanted a quick fix so I popped by this joint.  It was interesting how different meats had different lines. I settled on El lengua taco and cabeza and carne asada fries. I was disappointed by the flavors. Everything tasted smokey, as if it needed a grill change.

Also, it's quite pricey for the tacos compared to la tacos. Overall, I'll skip tacos in vegas.
