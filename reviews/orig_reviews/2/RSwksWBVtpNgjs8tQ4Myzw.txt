Unpleasant last few experiences at GB recently specifically with the hostess.  Open bar at kitchen, yet they won't let anyone sit there.  Same situation on last 3 visits.

Some situation between kitchen, servers, customers?  

Walked out this time in favor of LGO. Hope this gets resolved because the food generally rocks.
