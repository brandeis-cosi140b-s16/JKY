I love Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying Cafe Rio so when we had an opportunity to go there I jumped on it.  The decor is great and the store was very clean.  Unfortunately that is all the good there is to report.  The line was Disneyland long with stanchions and everything , there was no menu to look at while ordering food, and then I was given $17 in change...all in singles.  Overall the food was expensive and mediocre at best, with limited options.  The beans were too salty.  I don't plan on going back...
