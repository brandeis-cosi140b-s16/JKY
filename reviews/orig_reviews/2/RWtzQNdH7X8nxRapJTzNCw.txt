Well where should I start. The service was horrible, it took them 20 minutes to ask if we wanted water. Then another 15 minutes for them to give us the chips that come with the table. We asked for the guacamole and chips and it never came leaving us with another 30 minutes or so waiting without an appetizer. The four of us order steak burritos which were good so that's why I gave them two stars. My overall experience was not good here and I will never go back to this restaurant. There are many wonderful places out there.
