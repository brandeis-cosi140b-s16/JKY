Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Went here to celebrate my sisters birthday to only find that the service was slower than ever! Not only that, they actually looked bored! Two stars because I liked the steak taco. But I was so disappointed. They had no menu options whatsoever as well. If you are looking for a family night out, this is not your place. Will not be returning.
