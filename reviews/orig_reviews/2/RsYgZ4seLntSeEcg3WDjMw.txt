Honestly love their food but don't understand why they never can keep an "A" health rating? It used to be a "C" and now is a "B" not sure if the kitchen is unsanitary but I won't be eating there until their rating is back to an "A". EW! Also found a rubber band with hair on it in my Fresca sauce.. This location needs some TLC.
