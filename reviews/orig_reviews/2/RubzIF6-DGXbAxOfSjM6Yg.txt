Ugh. We expected mexican and got gloppy guac. and really Greasy, gross food. The overly cheery wait staff did not help make our experience any better...and after leaving 3/4 of our food uneaten and congealing. My guest had a margarita that was so so. The iced tea was good, fresh brewed. Very disappointed.
