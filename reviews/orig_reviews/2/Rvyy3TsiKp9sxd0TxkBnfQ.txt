This place has beckoned to my wife and me ever since we moved here two years ago, so we figured "what the heck."  Bad choice.  I ordered the house Margarita, it tasted like.... well I can't even properly describe the strange flavor, but it certainly did not taste as a Margarita should, and at $8 and change I expect better.  THANK GOODNESS I didn't order the large (yard) size.  As an appetizer we had the Poblano cheese dip, came with lots of chips, but was luke-warm and if not for the healthy injection of hot sauce we provided, would have been completely bland.  For an entree we shared a large burrito with grilled chicken, or at least it was supposed to have chicken.  I was lucky to find two small pieces of chicken in my half, my wife's experience was similar.  And when delivered to our table, our waitress warned us the plate was hot.  It was, but the burrito was not!  What the *uck??  The waitress was polite and attentive, but the food/drink at this place is sub-par.  Don't.
