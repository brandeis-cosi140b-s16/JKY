I also really wanted to like this place.  Completely empty at happy hour on a Wednesday should have been my clue not to park my car.  But I did, and ordered two happy hour appetizers and a draft.  Which I later found out was $6!!!!  The quesadilla was bland, deli ham with white cheese and mild peppers. $4 so we didn't have high expectations. The guacamole was also bland, and served with.... wait for it.... Chip crumbs!!!  Oh, but they were also bagged chip crumbs, because there is no fryer here!!!  Ugh!!!  The waitress acknowledged we needed some whole chips, but never brought them.  We smeared the guac on the quesadilla and ate it with the warm salsa.  Still bland. 

Happy hour appetizers are your opportunity to shine! Offer your guests a sample of your best and maybe they will order from the menu! No way,  given what we tried here, would we order from the menu. Thank goodness I didn't order a second $6 happy hour beer!!!  

Management:  your competition is SandBar, and  Valle Luna nearby. Both offer significant value in happy hour food and drinks, at 50% off and a $6 beer is 32 ounces, not 12.  Sorry Lenero, we won't be back.
