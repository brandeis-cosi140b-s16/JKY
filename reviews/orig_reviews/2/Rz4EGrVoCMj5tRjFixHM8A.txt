I sat at the bar.  It was kinda crowded.  I was alone.  The girl behind the bar said, "I'll be with you in a second honey" to me and then proceeded to forget about me.  It was rather crowded however...    I finally ordered a Corona and the chicken tacos.  The food came about 5 minutes after I ordered it.  It was hot but I wasn't too impressed with it.  It was rather bland.  I ended up pouring salsa from the chips and salsa on the tacos so they'd have some flavor.  
Anyway, it took longer to get some service than to get my food.  I'm not sure if that's good or bad.  The food is good if you like Mexican stuff but don't want it to be spicy.  I'd heard about this place before which is why I didn't get up and walk away when I got no service from the bartender.  I think it would have been better if I'd have gone to Cozymel's up the road.....
