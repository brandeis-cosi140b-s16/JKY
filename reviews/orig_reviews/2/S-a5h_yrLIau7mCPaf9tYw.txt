I came here because of the high Yelp ratings.  Boy, they were wrong.  Chi Chi's is better than this place.  Located in the NY NY casino, this small place looked like another food counter place.  There was no food counter, but should have been.  Although slightly better than Taco Bell, there was nothing special about this place.  The meal was so so.  Service was slow and unhelpful as well.  Maybe I came here on an off night.  Doesn't matter, because I ain't coming back.
