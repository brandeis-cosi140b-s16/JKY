I was very disappointed by my last 2 visits here. On one visit I was served cold beans and rice, like from the fridge cold. It took almost 20 minutes to get new beans and rice, and they were still barely warm. No apology, no nothing.

Went again to get my favorite chicken mole tacos, and they were barely warm. My husband had their marinated shredded pork in a burrito and got sick after taking the first bite. This must be an acquired taste, it was gross, really gross. Then I found what looked like a gray slimy booger in my rice. When I pointed it out to the server he took my plate away and came back saying it was an onion!! No way was that an onion, or even a close relative of an onion. No apology, no asking if i want something else, he just came over, slammed the bill down and said we didn't charge you for your food, so don't worry about it, and walked away. 

I know mistakes happen, but own up to it, and at least TRY to make the customer feel good about the situation.
