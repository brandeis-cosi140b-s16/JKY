I had lunch there on February 13, 2010 and was left extremely dissapointing.

I have watched the Two Hot Tamales cook for almost 15 years.  When I heard they had a restaurant at the Mandalay Bay, I was excited to finally taste their food.  My reservation was made 1 month ahead.

When I arrived there I was not impressed by the restaurant, however I was there for the food, so my husband and I ordered the queso fundillo, I had the enchiladas poblanas and my husband had the carnitas, plus we each had a beer.   we thought it was a bit pricey, however a few months ago we went to Fronteras Grill in Chicago, the restaurant that belongs to Rick Bayless and there we spent over $140 for the 2 of us and it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  So when I saw the similar prices, I was excited.  When we got the queso fundido, I must say it was just ok.  Then we received our entrees.  What a dissapointment.  My enchiladas were bland, small for the $20 price tag, no side dishes, just 3 very skinny enchiladas.  My husband's $23 carnitas were ordinary, again no side dishes, just the meat with 1 flour tortilla.  My husband said to me, now we don't have to visit Ciudad, their LA restaurant, this food sucks.  This restaurant is not in the same level as Fronteras Grill in Chicago, or even Bobby Flay.  I can honestly say, very dissapointing 2 hot tamales, you dropped the ball and you lost a 15 year fan.  I even have their cookbooks, what a dissapointment.  For those of you looking for somewhere good to eat in Vegas, there are so many great restaurant, including Fleur de Lys, also located at the Mandalay Bay, don't waste a great meal opportunity here.
