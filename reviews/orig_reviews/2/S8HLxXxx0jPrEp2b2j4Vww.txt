So I too have been patiently waiting for this place to open, as I drive by it daily on my way to and from work. I have also been CRAVING Mexican food, and enchiladas and soup were top on my list to indulge in! I understand that this was their 2nd day open, and I also agree that staff was extremely friendly and informational, the owners brother was even there helping out!

On to the food - I order for myself and another person, we got the short rib, pork verde and cheese enchilada. Mine was topped with guacamole, his with the tomatilla salsa. As for the enchiladas themselves, they smelled amazing, but the taste was far from it! There was little to no flavor from the meat. I was charged an additional $1 for the guacamole (that I wasn't told about), but the guacamole was delicious. My friend said the tomatilla salsa was the best part of his order. We also got some chicken tortilla soup... again, nothing special! :( It was nothing to write home about!

Overall, I am very disappointed with the food and had extremely high expectations and was let down!!!
