El Pollo Supremo is a pint-sized version of "El Pollo Loco" with fewer food choices and the inability to accept credit/debit cards. Ultimately, whether you choose the corporate fast food giant or this little hole-in-the-wall, the food, the taste and the price are all about the same.

All in all, the food here is just "ok".  In Southern California, I grew up eating this style of food regularly and El Pollo Supremo, while offering a familiarity I appreciate with its simple beans-meat-tortilla approach, is absolutely nothing special.  

I've had both the Chicken (pollo asado) and Beef (carne asada) dishes here.  Occasionally, the chicken arrives overcooked and dry.  The steak has been consistently pleasant and is quite tasty, moreso on its own than when mixed with the other ingredients.  The beans are always plain and the watery salsa certainly isn't anything to write home about, but it all works in that way that simple, decent "comfort" food should.  

As for price, it's certainly not as "cheap" as some make it seem, but it won't break the bank, either.  Figure $10-$12 per person and everyone's belly will leave happy.  The best value is to grab a few friends and split a couple items.  If you've got a picky date, this is the perfect place to take them, because they'll only have to make one decision...chicken or beef!

Please note that there is really nothing "wrong" with El Pollo Supremo.  However, there is nothing particularly outstanding about it, either.  

The 5-star and "100%" ratings across the internet review boards are certainly more than it deserves.  People in Phoenix seem to have a skewed idea of what "good" Mexican food is and have a habit of glorifying mediocrity whenever possible.  This place received a "Best of Phoenix" award for 2011...that just proves my point!  Since we're just tossing acclamations out there, I'll give El Pollo Supremo the "Best of Mediocre" for 2012.  Now on to the next joint...
