It is really hard to give this place a grade. I came in with high expectation. It is really cool- I love the decoration; no sign outside, kind of weird, (FYI it is between Luci and a hardware store) but you may feel it is exclusive. Our waiter is cool and friendly. We had Guac and chips and it was decent.

The reason I'm giving a two-star is that the famous carne adovada was way too salty. So salty that I felt it was killing me. And we waited for like 30 minutes for it, after I told the waiter that we were heading to the airport soon. I trust all the good reviews here on yelp, and I love the ambiance in Dick's Hideaway, but I believe that a good restaurant should be consistent and considerate to its guests to live up to the standard.
