We stumbled upon Canyon Cafe because it was extremely convenient- located across from my hotel in the Arizona Center.  Because of that, and the fact that they have a wonderful large outdoor patio (perfect in March), we wound up here two nights in a row, even though we found the food, drinks, and service mediocre.  Group decision, not a personal preference to return.

First thing, both nights, the service was Extremely Slow.  It's annoying when multiple servers/bussers walk by without even a 'someone will be right with you'.  On our second visit, the hostess actually stopped to ask us if anyone had been over after 15 minutes sitting at our table without any wait staff talking to us.  We must have looked irked.

Secondly, they limit you to 2 margaritas, so they should be fantastic, but we all found them to be incredibly inconsistent in taste and alcohol strength.  Out of the 4 margaritas I personally had over two nights; 1 was Fantastic, one was overly strong, 1 tasted like a virgin, and 1 was just okay.

As for the actual food, the chips they serve with the chips and salsa were an interesting and cool mix of yellow and blue corn tortilla, sweet potato (my fav), wonton (second fav), and flour tortillas with a dry seasoning (next fav).  The salsa was meh, but the untraditional chips didn't even need it.  This was the best part of the meal.

I had the chicken fajitas night 1.  The chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it.  The accouterments were just standard.  I ordered the steak/shrimp fajitas night 2.  The steak was very good but the shrimp was tasteless.

All in all, I cannot see why I would ever return to this restaurant.
