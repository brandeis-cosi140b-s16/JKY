This is the site of closed Firefly, so decent looking place. Decent mexican food, nothing original, and nice bartender. But the waitress service was terrible. Had to ask for glass of water 3 times.  Got the 2-person fajitas. It came with decent amount of fajitas, but only 6 tortillas. Again, this is a 2 person share. Asked for more tortillas 3 times, and then told they aren't allowed to give more tortillas. Are you kidding me? Tortillas are a penny a piece, if that. What are these people thinking?  First mexican place I have ever heard of that limits tortillas. Big judgement error guys. Save a penny, lost a local customer. Forever.
