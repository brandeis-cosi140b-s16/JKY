I don't know why I've repeatedly gone back to this place over the years. The ambience is nice, and it's a cute place to bring out-of-town guests to wile away an afternoon. But the food is nothing to write home about -- Los Mesquites down the street is much better -- and far too expensive for quality that is comparable to what you can get at Filiberto's at 2 AM for 1/4 the price. Our last visit clinched my decision not to return when we had the most obnoxious waiter on earth. He spent the entire time he waited on us talking about how he was majorly hung over and explaining in detail how on his last shift he belittled his customers. The only thing more inappropriate would have been for him to compliment my boobs, which come to think of it would've probably been better. Oh, and by the way, one night I drove past here at around 10:00 before the front gate was shut and saw a bobcat moseying out the front door and across the street to Frontier Town - probably looking or a beer after chowing a duck.
