The Sandbar is a fun place to go for drinks and to watch a game, but the food here is some of the worst food in the area, especially their Mexican food. The red sauce taste like sloppy joe sauce, I can not eat it. Not a fluke, I have tried the food several times, it is horrible.  Service is fine, Margaritas are very sweet.and weak.  I would recommend another place if you are eating.
