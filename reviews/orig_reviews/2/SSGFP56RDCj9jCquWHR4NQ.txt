The place was average at best. If I'm on the south side I'm not looking for a gourmet taco. Taste wise, I'd rather have a dollar taco from the salon. They only have about 8 drink option and wouldn't make a loaded corona even though they had the ingredients. Wait staff seemed clueless and the bartenders wouldn't change the channel even though there was no on else there. I had to order the Moscow mile which took me an hour to drink and upset my stomach. Lastly the owner just stares at you it's very creepy...I won't be going back if I have any say in it.
