I would call this place, 'Mi Patio, the Gringo-Mexican Restaurant'. I say that, first off, because of the high ratings this place received - out of the 25+ people eating here there was not one Mexican sitting down for food - not even at the bar. My waiter wasn't even Mexican... He was a white guy. I'm white, too, but I live in San Diego and I'm 20 miles from Mexico, and I eat bomb Mexican food for a hobby.  My Chimichanga was weak (I know its Tex-Mex haha). I was disappointed by the softness, and the lack of anything but shredded meat (the quality of the meat was good) despite my add-ons. My company felt the same about theirs.  I really hate to give this place two stars because the service was soooo GOOD and it's a place with some character. I never had an empty glass of drink or bowl of their 'milder than rice' red salsa. I just can't give it a 3 looking at all these 5s, 'cause that's the story of how I got duped.
