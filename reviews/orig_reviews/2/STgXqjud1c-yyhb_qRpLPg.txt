Vida is what I would consider 'All form, less substance'.  Heres why...

Pros
1. Great location at the Epicentre; one of the hottest spots in all of the city
2. Well dressed, very attractive host staff
3. Excellent interior decorations, wood flooring, and table settings
4. Well trained , courteous wait staff 

Cons
1. Premium price for average quality ingredients
2. No plating whatsoever 
3. Generally poor menu selection.  A lot of noise with the most basic items being their best dishes (such as the fajitas)

The tableside guac I found to be a bit lacking but that may be due to the fact that everyone was hyping it so much.  To me, I would eat the guac from Cantina 1511 everyday , but this stuff did not hit the mark.  If you want a real recipe of what I do at home (and probably closer to what Cantina does) message me and I'll be happy to share it with you.

I did enjoy the service and ambiance, but only went its supporting great food does it compel me to come back again.  I am at the point now where I would not actively suggest this to friends, but I would join a group if they had decided to go.  If you do decide to make the trip to uptown, I would recommend something basic as the tacos or fajitas; skip the carnitas and barbacoa at least the first time.  Hope you have a better time than me!
