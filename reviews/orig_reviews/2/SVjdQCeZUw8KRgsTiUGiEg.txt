Disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place, had been perusing the menu onlne prior to coming and was excited to try.  I know going in this wasn't your typical Mexican restaurant and that was part of the appeal for me.

Unfortunately, despite having creative and great sounding items on the menu, the execution was just poor.  

I had the poblano pepper stuffed with mushrooms and goat cheese, wrapped in puff pastry.  I also opted to add the mix of scallops, crab and shrimp for a $5 upcharge.  Sounds great right?  Not so.  First of all, this dish was clearly made ahead of time (perhaps days) then reheated.  Puff pastry should puff and be crisp right?  This was flat and soggy.  The mushroom filling was OK but with no hint of goat cheese.  The extra seafood topping was not worth the price.  Yes you got a ton of scallops (bay scallops, not sea scallops), but the sauce was beyond bland, except for hte fishy taste of some of the scallops (again, made ahead and reheated I think).

My husband got the conchinita pibil which was better, but again, clearly reheated.  How do you dry out pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaf?  It was dry, and again quite bland to us.  The bread and tampanade was OK, but not great.

Unlike some of hte other reviews, our service was actally quite good.  Prompt and attentive.

It was a bit pricy, and if the dishes had been executed better, fresher and with more flavor I wouldn't have minded the price.  However, based off this experience, I doubt I'll give it a second shot - unless I get stuck at the airport, then I may try that location.
