It took me a while to find this place. When they called it a hideaway, they weren't kidding. I parked right outside, and I ended up walking around to Luci's Healthy Market Place and the Koller True Value Hardware store before I found out it was right in between both of them. There's an unmarked door that's open.

When you walk in, you're in the hallway between the bar and the dining area. No one paid attention to me, even when a bartender walked right by to deliver food. I ended up walking over to the dining area and stood around until a server noticed me and said I could sit anywhere.

Decor is interesting. Dusty wine racks filled with wine everywhere. The tables are very large, especially the one with the TV. It seats about 10 people, so you'll have other people sitting at the table where you're dining.

Potatoes were good. Beans were okay. Pork was all right. Medium done beef wasn't that great. Poached eggs were okay. Jalepeno hollandaise was all right.

Server was friendly. He said he was from CA and moved to Phoenix 6 years ago, but he still likes it a lot more back in CA.
