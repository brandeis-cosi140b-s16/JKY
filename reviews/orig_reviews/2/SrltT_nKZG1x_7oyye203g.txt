I came here with one of my friends who lives in Vegas. We had gotten a free drink ticket or something from someone in the casino/ strip.I didn't even know about this place and it's got an interesting vibe, like a Halloween-themed cantina. In any case, we went in the afternoon and hit the happy hour. 

Sat at the bar, ordered the appetizer platter and some drinks. Food was ok, nothing really special. The drinks were also just ok. They also have a siren/ flashing light thing going during happy hour and it turns off when it's over, which is pretty nifty to know (then you don't need to bother to ask about happy hour).
