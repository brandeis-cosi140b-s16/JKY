My husband and I ordered the 
-Shrimp and Crab Stacked Enchiladas ----$19.95
-Taco Sampler -----$13.95
-Pastel de Tres Leches (dessert)----$6.95
The waitress was very friendly, she really did a good job of making us feel at home. She told us the Shrimp Enchiladas is their specialty so I ordered it. To be honest, it was average. The shrimp was over cooked and hard. The dessert was very good, taco plate is very tasty. Restaurant is very beautiful. I would go back again, but maybe I won't order the house specialty.

Update: The night after I wrote this review, I woke up at 2am with an upset stomach. Then I had diarrhea. It was the signature dish (Shrimp and Crab Stacked Enchiladas) from Agave that did it, because I had not eaten anything after I left the restaurant. I also only drank water in the restaurant. When I got the food, I did felt the food was VERY hot in the middle so I think they made batches of the shrimp and crab and microwaved it to make the dish. DO NOT order this when you go there. My husband had the Tacos and he was fine. I now change from a 3 to 2 star.
