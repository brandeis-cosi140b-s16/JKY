Compared to other Mexican/Southwest restaurants we've been to in Scottsdale, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and even Tucumcari, this one rates 2 stars at best. The guacamole was not very flavorful, the rice was cooked nicely but lacked taste, and the "refried" beans were not. They were, rather, more akin to a moderately thick bean soup - put them on a plate and they ran over the whole plate. My burrito was OK - the meat was tasty, but it was assembled more like a wrap with all ingredients starkly separate so it was difficult to get all ingredients in a single bite. My wife's al Pastor tacos weren't particularly flavorful and the pineapple was actually sour. Even the chips served with the guacamole were thick, tough, and saltless (if that's a word). I would not go back, and, if you've read any of my other reviews, if incredibly uncommon.
