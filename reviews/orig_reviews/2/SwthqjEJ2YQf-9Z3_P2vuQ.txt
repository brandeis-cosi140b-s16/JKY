We have been going to Garcia's for years and have never been disappointed. Well tonight I was. Took server 10 mins to get our drink order we of course ordered our food at the sometime as drinks. When the food came out it was cold my order was wrong they offered to fix it but I was not looking to wait any longer to eat. When I picked up my taco it was so soggy it fell apart .My husbands food was cold also we just don't beleive in wasting food Never did see our waitress but the chip and salsa lady was on top of her job. It was not that busy so I just couldn't understand what the problem was. Garcia's is one of my favorite places and we travel about 30 miles to go. I won't be going back for awhile. : (
