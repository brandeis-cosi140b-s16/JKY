Pretty much the Pittsburgh interpretation of Tex-Mex. This pretty much entails terrible salsa, blue margarita salt. Not nearly as loud as the Oakland one, and a better bar. They had mole burritos so that was good. 

If you want Tex-Mex, go elsewhere. If you want to drink here with friends, well that's ok I guess. This and Steel Cactus are pretty much the same thing.
