I've been here a few times and the service is horrible every time. They last time I went was for my birthday a month ago and I went there with some friends after dinner with my family.  I ordered wine and the bartender acted as if I ordered some foreign drink that she had never heard of. She was like "ugh I guess I can check and see if we have some". I know that wine may not be a typically ordered drink there but that's what I had been drinking previously before at dinner and didn't want to mix alcohol and go to vodka or whiskey. She was just super rude and made me feel like it was absolutely ridiculous that I ordered a glass of wine.
