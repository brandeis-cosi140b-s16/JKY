First impression... all I need to say is Snottsdale hostesses! I showed up at Blanco on a Tuesday night at 5:40 with 10 girls.  The patio and the dining room were half empty and the hostess said she needed a few minutes to get set up, understandable.   After about 15 minutes another hostess came over to ask us what we needed.  Meanwhile people are walking in and getting sat immediately.   Then we see a server pushing some tables together on the patio and setting up the table for 10 people.  Five more minutes go by and we were more than annoyed, so we decided to seat ourselves at that table.   Once we got seated, our server was friendly and attentive. 
Average food, average drinks... I ordered a pomegranate and grapefruit margarita, the juice was supposed to be fresh squeezed, but I it tasted like pure sugar.   I ordered a taco salad with no meat and it was so drenched in dressing that I couldn't even eat the lettuce.   Two girls who ordered a different salad and actually sent theirs back for the same reason.   The other meals that came out to the table looked much better, so maybe I just made bad menu selections.
