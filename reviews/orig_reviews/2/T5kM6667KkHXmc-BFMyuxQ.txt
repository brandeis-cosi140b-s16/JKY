Went in on a Monday night for dinner after work when I didn't feel like cooking.  They have a lot of burritos, and health conscious options.   Food is okay but you'll know exactly which farm your food came from at Gallo Blanco downtown AND get more for your money!  

Disappointing that I couldn't get a cold Mexican beer with lime to have with my dinner.  They do have a variety of fresh squeezed lemonade, that along with the decor makes me want to classify this as a "lunch only" place.  I'm likely to try it again for lunch, but I'll scratch it off my list as a casual dinner option.
