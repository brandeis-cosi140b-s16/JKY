I work right down the street from La Tolteca so many of my co-workers visit here regularly. I finally visited...

FOOD
The menu has a great variety and is pretty inexpensive. However, my burrito kinda started to taste funny as I finished it up- almost like cleaning solution--- I didn't get sick so I'm not sure what that taste was. 
I like the bakery and the sweets selection and the salsa is pretty good. 

OTHER
We also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees. The catered food was a lot better than my burrito. 
 
I will give La Tolteca another chance...
