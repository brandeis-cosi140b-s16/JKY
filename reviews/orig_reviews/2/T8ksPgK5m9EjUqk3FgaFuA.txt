The way I like to make my first judgement about Mexican food is the guacamole. This guacamole was terrible. It was so acidic that  it sizzled on your tongue. Salsas were flavorless as was the rice and beans. I ordered chicken tacos which were fair at best. Chicken was not seasoned and a little dry. We shares a bowl of tortilla soup which tasted so smokey, you couldn't taste anything else. Service was decent for a casual place. Wouldn't come back again
