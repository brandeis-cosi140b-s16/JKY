ok...not that good, not horrible.   First I had no cash and got charged $1.50 to use my Visa debit card so my 'lunch special' that was $6.99 ended up being $13 with a drink.
Portions were small,  bean were a bit watery.  Had two carne asada tacos, not much flavor and the steak was cut in to big chunks, not normal for Carne Asada from my experience.  Tortillas seemed store bought and fell apart while eating.  There you have a honest review.  will add a pic.
