Chef Garces has created some fun and inspirational dishes on the menu. Such a shame that the overall ambience and lack of service delivery ruin the overall experience. 

When we arrived and came down the stairs one of the greeters was texting on her phone and the other had her back to us and was drinking a cup of tea. They looked at me only after I started the conversation. They only spoke to each other and one deftly walked us to a table with no additional interaction. 

The server was friendly enough and professional. However; his timing was a bit off and he was not very visible (I may not have noticed this had I not been annoyed by the initial greeting). 

Food was decent. Octopus was a standout. The chicken tacos had good texture and a bit of spice. Chilango chop salad was refreshing. That said, the salmon ceviche way too sweet and salty at the same time. The flavor and texture of the fish were gone.

Overall I saw no reason to go back. There are several other similar style restaurants in town that do both food and service better. Even the dining room was a bit bland and lacked inspiration.
