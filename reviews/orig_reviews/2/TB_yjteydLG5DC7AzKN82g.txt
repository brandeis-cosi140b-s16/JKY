My friend and I were coming back from a business trip and had a 2 hour layover in the Vegas airport. We decided to grab some dinner. Service was a little weird. I ordered a quesadilla to share with my friend and a burrito for my entree. The waiter looks at me and ask you gonna eat all that?  I wanted to say on second thought No. We are leaving. Should have as he food was not very good either. Next time I need something to eat in the Vegas airport I won't be going there.
