The original place use to be fiesta and chips and we loved it, it has since been taken over by new owners. The two stars are for the servers. Omar was my server and he was very attentive and nice, and there was another young man that was helpful as well. The thing that kinda bothered me was when we came in it was slow so all the servers were just standing around and it made me uncomfortable because I felt like they kept staring. The menu is much more expensive. My son loved the nachos from the previous owners so we decided to give theirs a shot, and I got two fish tacos. The tacos were about the same price but half the portion size, and I was super disappointed with the fish. It was tilapia but had a super fishy taste. I ended up taking it out and putting the meat from my sons nachos and putting it in my tacos. Wasn't super wowed.
