I find it funny that people are calling this "cheap" and "authentic".  The only way anyone could say that is if they're natives of California, where a $3 taco or $7 burrito is considered "cheap" and mixing average rice and beans into a burrito is considered "authentic". 

It's not bad, by any means.  The food is hot and reminds me of that California beach-style mexican that you can get in San Diego.  I guess maybe I'm just not that sort of beaner, as I personally feel the Sonoran or New Mexican styles are just better tasting.  

Regardless, someone mentioned being embarrassed that the multiple entrances confused them.  Don't feel bad, buddy.  I walked all around the building feeling like a jackass because i wasn't sure where to go.  And then I go in and realize you have to order at some awkwardly placed cash register, and it's cash only, and that's already a few marks off.  Then when the food was lackluster, I decided that Guedo's (aptly named, this is the kind of place that just screams "COME SEE ME, TOURISTS!") just isn't my bag, baby.

The only thing that really saved this place from certain craphole-status is their outside patio/bar.  It's a nice looking place and when the weather starts getting right in the Phoenix area (basically any time except the hottest parts of summer) it'd be a nice place to get toasted and try to hit on pasty out-of-towners wandering over from the San Marcos resort.
