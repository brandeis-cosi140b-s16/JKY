Food was decent - sort-of. Got the good-looking el pastor quesadilla (yelp pics made it look irresistible). Unfortunately, it was SOOOO greasy! Orange grease running everywhere, and while it was cut in half, the second half was, like, too much of the same thing. Probably better to share - was just too much grease. Had a hard time getting a spot of their red hot sauce (there is no salsa bar). Girl behind the counter kept pointing to the bottle of Tapatio. I said, "No, don't you have some homemade red sauce?" She said, "Red Sauce?" and pointed again at Tapatio. Sheesh. Finally after five times, she got it. Ohhh, red sauce. Oy, it wasn't worth the fight. Roberto's is so much better.  

The most annoying part was there were so many flies in the joint - was fighting them off the entire meal. Then some crazy yelling-screaming-rap tune came on, of course, insanely loud, and I was just like, ok, this is totally sucking right now. I guess other people complained 'bout the music because after a few minutes, the manager killed it.

Los Tacos, done. Can cross it off the list now, doubt I'll be back. Flies...grease... ick.
