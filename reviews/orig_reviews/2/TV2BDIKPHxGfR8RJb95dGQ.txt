My husband still wanted to try this place after all, so we finally gave it another try this weekend. We get there around 3pm on Saturday (so there would be no excuse about closing early again). We were the only ones there so we chose the seat to the left in front of the window since it is so small inside and dark. We are served by a polite server and we ordered the GC cornbread($10) for an appetizer. It was good but I did not like the chunks of fat with the pork. 

Next our meals came and my husband had the chile relleno($12) which he said was delicious, he felt that the price was a little too much for what it was though. I had the cubano sandwich. It was okay, I think that it could have been at least served on a normal roll instead of a hotdog bun type roll because it seems a bit much to be asking for 10$ for such a small sandwich. The sweet potato fries were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were sweet and crispy and cut thick. 

Next we ordered the churros ($7) and the key lime pie($7), no tres leche cake :( The key lime was pretty good but the strawberry sauce made it a little too sweet. The churros were dry and a little too hard, not happy with those. All in all our bill came to 50$ and that's only for 2 people so yeah, not a cheap place even though by the looks of it you would think it would be. 

We left our parking ticket in the car so they were nice enough to stamp our receipt and the parking attendant accepted it so we didn't get stuck paying for parking like last time. I have to say that I will not be going back to this place though, too out of the way for food that just isn't that good and is too over priced for what it is.
