We used to go to Valle Luna years ago because it was the best and had the best bean dip and chips.  The greeters were wonderful, felt like it was going to be a wonderful reunion.  Then no bean dip with the chips...okay we ordered it.  Not the same bean dip, runny and not tasty.  The service was less than ok. The food was not what we had before.

 Our waitress did not even visit our side of the restaurant, other servers in the area practically had to be tripped to be asked to have our server come by.  The manager came and got our drink order.  Wrong beer, and no waitress in sight.  Will have to savor the memory of years gone by.  Won't be going out of our way to eat there again. Have much better places close to us.  Very sad.
