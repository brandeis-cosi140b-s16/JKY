Sad to say I was disappointed in China Poblano. I'm a huge fan of anything Jose Andres does, but this place fell far short of my expectations. The concept is fine, and the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. The braised pork street sandwich tasted EXACTLY like their steamed buns with bbq pork. In fact, half the menu tasted the same. If you're in Vegas for a weekend, I'd skip this place. The decor is nice, and I enjoyed their "Tea for two" cocktail served in a teapot, but the food was a let down in comparison to other restaurants in the same niche.
