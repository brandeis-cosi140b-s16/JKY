It might just be that we didn't order the right stuff or that they have Americanized too much.  My short impression is that the food was bland and pretty dull.  My wife ordered the Tacitos and while these are usually bland by design, it's the dipping sauce that gives them life and the Avacado sauce was disappointing as an over whipped Avacado.  My daughter at the age of two is an incredible fan of Mexican Rice and Beans and she wouldn't touch them here, she only ate the chips and salsa, which admittingly and disappointingly was the high-life of the mean.  I had the most order Pollo Fundido, the chicken (while all white meat) was extremely bland, the only thing that saved this dish was the jalapeno cheese sauce on top.  It actually had life and would make a great Con Queso dip in it's own rights.  I would like to see the meat livened up with a little jalapeno and salsa.  Show me the food I would see when visiting friends having a Fiesta, I know it's there, let it out and show your full potential as a Mexican resturant.
