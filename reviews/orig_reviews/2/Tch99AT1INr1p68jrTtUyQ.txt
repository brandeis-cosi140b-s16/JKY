Three weeks after their opening we arrived for lunch. When the rancid smell of oil trap issues greeted us in the parking lot I was concerned! This issue is a problem at two other Henderson establishments! I'm tempted to not even go in. Once it was explained to me that the problem is grease container and not sewer issues I felt better however it does assault the senses regardless of the source! 

The menu is unique, and as other diners have mentioned ingredients fresh. Rice is very good, beans... Not so much , i like more pork flavor in my pintos. Next time I will pass on the sides! 

Carnitas Tacos and Were delicious! The heated plate tends to cause the corn tortillas to sweat and stick making holding a ripped tortilla a bit of a challenge! 

The Mexican egg rolls were the only items my partner and I shared.  We credit these for the case of urgent discomfort we each had shortly after leaving. 

To find a Cuban sandwich on the menu delighted my partner. Fries were a treat with extra effort to set them a cut above average lunch side dish. 

Loved the interior.  Obviously there are issues to address. But in time I hope to return.... Great heads up from other diners that burritos have beans in them.
