After such a great first experience, I returned to a lesser experience.  I certainly didn't care for my dry and flavorless chicken enchilada's.  Also, I had vowed to return to finally try the much discussed table side guacamole-also, a disappointment.  It needed salt and more kick.  The consistency was not great, I don't think it was mixed very well....which I know because I watched it happen.

In a cruel twist of fate, this restaurant also serves one of the most mouthwatering desserts I have ever had.  I still dream about the warm fried cinnamon sugar churros with ice cold vanilla ice cream and warm caramel sauce drizzled all over the plate.  I vow to make hose happen in my own kitchen...please god, make it happen!
