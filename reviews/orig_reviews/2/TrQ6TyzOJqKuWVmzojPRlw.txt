Meh. I'm a big believer in setting expectations. What happened to under promise and over deliver. Checked in and told 45 minute wait for a party of three. Ok, it's Saturday. Ended up waiting over an hour, the staff seemed unorganized. I checked back with hostess after the forty five, told "setting you up right now", nope. Another young lady asks if we've checked in and says she'll check the status and be right back- goes to hostess station and just stands there smiling.??? 80 minutes. But we heard it was good and were determined to try it.
Finally seated and wait staff is very helpful. Glad it was Restraunt Week as the regular price if $14+ for some street tacos is a bit much. Disappointing that an order must all be same style as that means you're stuck with one version.  The promotion allowed us to try multiple items without breaking the bank.  Carne and chicken tacos were good, they forgot our mahi mahi tacos until we asked for them when the waiter came to take our dessert order. As a non-flan fan I have to say the flan was super tasty.  Overall I go back to meh, I don't think I'll be giving it another try. Wish the burger place was still here- so hard to get a good hamburger in this town without hitting a GR place on the Strip.
