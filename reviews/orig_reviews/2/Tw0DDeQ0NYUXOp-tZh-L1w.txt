This place didn't live up to the hype. Went here for lunch on a Saturday. 
Positives: 
1. Outdoor seating is great. 
2. Cocktails are fresh
3. Waiters and Waitresses are attentive. 

Negatives:
1. We waited close to 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it.
2. My margarita was way overpriced ($13)
3. I ordered the Kale salad with chicken. The salad was extremely salty. 
4. My lunch date order the taco trio. We were told they were "street" sized, however the  tortillas were approximately 2.5 inches in diameter. It looked like an appetizer. 

Save your money and go somewhere else!
