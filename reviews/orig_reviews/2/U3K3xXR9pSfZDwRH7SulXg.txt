Went here the other day with the family, I had heard their food is great. I have got to quit listening to these folks!!! This place blows!! The food is very bland the chili sauce is more than mild. The tacos which I had were cold and tasteless, the enchilada sauce was more like mole sauce?? did not expect that. Beans were okay but that was about it oh I almost forgot the chorizo was pretty good other than that the folks who give this high marks obviously have never had real Mexican food.
