Quite possibly the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had. Not only was it gross, but they charge extra for bacon and cheese. So for $15, you get a greasy tortilla filled with scrambled eggs, bacon and cheese product. Oh, and a gracious helping of sour cream on top. Bleh!

Service was fine - my waiter was perfectly pleasant. But the prices and quality were pretty offensive.

Maybe I'd come back for a margarita or chips and salsa? Def not for breakfast!
