Cluttered and rushed atmosphere. Paid almost 100 dollars for small portions of which i didn't finish not because I wasn't hungry BTW. Ordered some weird cheese dish that tasted like burnt processed cheese. Some weird taco with gold flakes on it. Unflavored noodles of which you had to dip in a sauce and pork buns.Everything was dripping with grease or butter or some sort of oil. 

I actually lost weight by eating here. All you fancy folks can have your fancy meals and pay your fancy prices. Personally I'd rather be a glutton at 1/5th the price with similar tasting food and have leftovers to spare.
