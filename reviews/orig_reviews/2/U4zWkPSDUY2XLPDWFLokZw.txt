I live near El Torito and I have given it a chance again last night with my daughter. I've been here about 3-4 times. And each time the food is not impressive at all. I am really confused how anyone could rate it 5 stars. Very very dry chicken every visit. Food defiantly does not taste homemade at all. It's edible, but not fresh. 

The only reason I like this place is it's small mom and pop type feel...the people who work there are super nice, service is always pleasant. However, food is just not enough for me to go back again, unfortunately. Our stomachs were not feeling good after this either.
