I had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery. I received a free delivery coupon from Delicious Deliveries so we used it for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in my zip code so we settled on Macayo's. 

We started out with the green corn tamale bites. I didn't care for them but my hubby seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis. The flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good. 

Total with tip & free delivery was about $50. We won't be ordering here again...I'm pretty much just done with the whole food delivery service thing after 2 expensive, not so great meals.
