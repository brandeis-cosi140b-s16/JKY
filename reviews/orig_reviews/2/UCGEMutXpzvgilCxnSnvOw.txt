I love Cuban food, so when I saw the groupon deal I bought it quick.  The seating in this place is horrible.  Too many tables and they seat you practically on top of the people next to you.  The server and patron behind me kept bumping into my chair.  I finally got up and moved to the other side of the table.  The whole restaurant was pretty empty, maybe 10% full but they sat us next to a party of 10 so we couldn't even hear each other speak.  I kept feeling myself lean in to hear my boyfriend even though we were seated right next to each other.  

The server dropped off our mediocre food and that was the last time we saw him until we were finished.  So, no refills on our drinks plus the extra ketchup we asked for at the beginning didn't come until we were finished.  The food was okay, nothing special.  I've had Cuban food all over, including Miami and Little Havana.  This place is WAY OVERPRICED for average food.  I also can't believe that the Palomilla Empanizada was $16 and doesn't come with maduros - that's an extra $4 BUT it does come with a little salad with no dressing - just about 5 pieces of lettuce, tomatoes and onion. 

I think the biggest disappointment of the night was the seating and that the entrees don't come with maduros...hello - I've NEVER eaten at a Cuban restaurant that doesn't include maduros with the entree.  An extra $4 for a half a plantain - give me a break!

I think the true rating should be 1 1/2 but that's not an option.  The food was average so it deserves a 2 but everything else deserves a 1.
