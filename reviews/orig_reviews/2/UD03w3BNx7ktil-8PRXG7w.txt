Just went to moreno's for a dinner date with my wife. We come here a few times a year when my wife  is craving it. Every time we come here though there is always something wrong. Today they got my order wrong and I had to send it back and start my wait all over, then when I got my burrito it was at least 90% rice which is supposed to be in it based off of what the description is but definitely not what I was expecting. Will be avoiding the burritos here from now on whenever we decide to eat here if we ever come back.
