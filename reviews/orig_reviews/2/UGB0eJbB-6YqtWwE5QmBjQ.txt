It is mediocre at its finest.

Our server, Julius, was not cut out to be working with customers.  He reminded me of Kel Mitchell, from Nickelodeon's Kenan & Kel show.  Except, picture Kel, experiencing the terrors of tripping on pot.

Julius seemed way out of it, and exuded the enthusiasm of Ben Stein's character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

My wife asked to taste the chile verde, and he brought us diced green chiles.  They blew our heads off!

The food was just food.  Nothing special.  I wont be back.
