Eh...I have been here a lot of times over the last couple years and I don't so much care for it....The crowd here is usually  "iffy" and the food is...your basic type of bar food.....the place gets even worse after the sun goes down....

The only time I come here is other people are meeting here...I never suggest it...so many other places that are much better!
