This joint is super cute. Fun ambiance and decor. The service was A-OK, and the food was meh. 

I ordered a 2 tamale combo. The menu description led me to believe the tamales would have a sauce. They didn't, and they desperately needed it. They were dry. 

I may go again to try a different dish but was not impressed with the food on my initial visit. 

In addition, harassment by scary downtown people in the parking lot makes frequenting this place less than likely.
