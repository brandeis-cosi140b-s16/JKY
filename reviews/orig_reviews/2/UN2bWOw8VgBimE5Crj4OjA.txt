I was going to call this place a bad rip off of Richardson's and chastize it for being so, until the owner told me she used to work for him and "proudly stole" some of his concepts. Whatever, I don't care as long as your food is good. 

Ordered the Carne Adovada... bland, dry, and boring. Other diners at the table had similar sentiments about their food. Chips and salsa shared at the table was more what I'd expect to find in New York City. No spice, no flavor, and runny as all get out. I guess I should expect all of this lack of flavor and spice, as this place is obviously appealing to tourists who aren't used to our spices. This was further proved by the goofy bats all over, the fake caves, and the awful service which is so typical of a tourist trap.

TOURIST TRAP. Avoid if you're a local. If you're from the Midwest or East Coast, you'll find it charming.
