Walking in at first was somewhat empty thinking "oh how lucky don't have to wait". Reasons why I will never go back....1. Blond lady up front no customer service, no greeting just what can I get you. My rice was pretty much thrown into the bowl, I asked what there shrimp looked like was given an attitude. 2. Barbacoa so sweet i tasted more of the sauce than the meat. 3. Screaming for food while speaking under her breath "fuck I always have to repeat myself" really I can hear you. 4. The lady prepares my food with the wrong lettuce as I'm paying I brought up it's be wrong one, she says with the rudest voice "you could of told her while she was preparing your food" really ? I responded "if it's that big of a deal then I will take it". Nope grabbed it and threw it in the trash. Stating "now we have to make a new one". Just shocked on how they don't see that they indeed need are customers elsewhere and if they receive poor treatment they would not appreciate it much....I will give someone else my business who has a different belief on customer service, never here again.
