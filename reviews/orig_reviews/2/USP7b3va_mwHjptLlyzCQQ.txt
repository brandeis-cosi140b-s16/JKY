Went to Nandos and was exited because it was a newer mexican restaurant super close to home..and was super disappointed.  The basic chips and salsa they serve at the table were fine, and the drinks were actually really good. I would definitely try some of their frozen margaritas if you do decide to go here. I ordered a chimichanga and was really disappointed...I think the only ingredients in it were steak, onions, and peppers...which actually sounds more like a cheesesteak than a chimichanga. It was also very salty, and I did not enjoy it too much.  In fact, it was one of the worst chimichangas I have ever tasted and usually I am excited when going to a mexican restaurant because I love mexican food. I have yet to go back and try it again...maybe a possible second visit will be better.
