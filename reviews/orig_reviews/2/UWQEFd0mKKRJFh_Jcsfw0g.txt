The service was good.

The place was clean and nicely decorated, except it was freezing in there when we went.

I did not like how "Addiction" is glamorized, or made funny, or cute on the menu. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is, and for which target group.

Besides the sopapillas and the salsa, I was not excited about the food.
