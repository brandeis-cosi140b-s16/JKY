A friend & I went for lunch yesterday we did not have any alcohol and our bill was $32, We had the chips & salsa two lunch entrees and an order of guacamole. ,  The chips were good and the service was also good.  The seating/ chairs are uncomfortable back breakers.  I love Mexican food & was looking forward to the opening of this restaurant. . $32 for lunch in the strip??? I will stick to the outside taco stand.
