I truly appreciate the history and architecture of this place; the ambience and staff were pleasant. The chips and HOT salsa are delicious! I know this restaurant is well known for great food but I must have chosen poorly today. The fish tacos just were not very flavorful. They are cooked in butter rather than fried which is a bonus in my book...but that means any sauces must have extra depth and oomph to bring out the flavor of the fish. I will definitely return here and hopefully make a better choice next time.
