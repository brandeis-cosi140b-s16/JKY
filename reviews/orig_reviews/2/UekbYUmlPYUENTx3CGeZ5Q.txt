So far, the ONLY thing I like about this place is the Cochata. Its a coffee, horchata mix - delicious!

The salsa leaves something to be desired. Its more lime than actual salsa...and salsa isn't blended into a thin pulp. They ask if I want spicy or not, of course spicy, but it had no spice to it whatsoever. I've had the carne asada and the pastor burrito, both are lacking in flavor. To little meat and way to much tortilla. Nothing else inside.

The service is...meh. No smiles, or greetings. Just a "Can I take your order?"

The parking isn't the greatest. You get 1 handicap, and 3 spaces - 1 of which is taken by the America's Taco shop van. The rest I guess is shared with the Antique store next door.

The only reason and the only thing I come here for is the Cochata, at just under 4 bucks, its a large iced drink and worth it. After trying the food here twice and both times disappointed, I don't bother with anything else.
