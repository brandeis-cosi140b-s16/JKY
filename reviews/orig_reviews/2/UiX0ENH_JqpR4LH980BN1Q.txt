Went here yesterday for lunch for the first time, sat at the bar. I ordered enchilada with optional shrimp which was $4 extra. And asked for chips & salsa right after the order. I was looking forward to the shrimp enchilada since it was $4 extra for the shrimps. When I got the food it had 3 shrimps on top of the 3 enchilada rows, bit disappointing but still good. I assumed the shrimps would be inside the enchilada but I should have asked. But was still waiting for the chips. Well they finally came out when I was pretty much done with my food. For the service and $20 dish? There are other places I can go for good mexican place on the same street that Ive been happier with.
