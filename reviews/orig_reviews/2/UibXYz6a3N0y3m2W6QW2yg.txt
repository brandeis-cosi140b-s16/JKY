Reading the other reviews, I think we must have been here on a very off day for Yolos. There were 7 of us, all ready for a late (2pm) lunch. There were 2 other tables with customers when we were there-each with only 2 people at them. I say this because our service was terrible. Terrible. It took several minutes to get a table ready for us, because the hostess was so careful about getting the napkins and menus placed "just so" on our table. We were there for 1.5 hours total, and had time for only 1 drink because of the poor service. We were thinking that perhaps we were on a "hidden camera" show because we truly felt ignored. The worst thing, however, was a long hair found in one of my group's dish. I know it does happen, and was thankful it wasn't my dish! Having complained about service, I must say that the food was quite good. Sadly, the service really pulled the star rating way down. Again, having read the other reviews, I think we had to have been there on an off-day.
