My boyfriend and I are Mexican/ tex-met food fanatics, and I'm a sous chef, so we've been to quite a few places around Charlotte. Vida was not impressive. Service was good. Drinks were weak with flavor and alcohol, and the food was out too quick for it to be fresh. The corn was gummy and sticky from sitting around for a long time after it was cooked. The guacamole was overpriced for the amount that was given- looked like one and a half avocados for $9. My boyfriend had the shrimp and jalape√±o bacon tacos, which he said were alright, and I had the chicken poblano burrito. Overall, everything was just alright. Nothing we would tell our foodie friends about. We won't be going back. Paco's taco's & tequila beats these guys to the moon and back any day!
