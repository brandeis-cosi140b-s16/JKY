Meh describes it perfectly from our experience. Went there for lunch today and don't have a whole lot good to say about the experience although nothing terrible either... The service, like the food, was just mediocre and lackluster.
First off the A/C was set to about 65 and I like it cold but BRRR!!! Chips & salsa came and I'm not a big fan of the burnt flavor Roberto's salsa that they serve. Wifey got the taco salad and said it was OK but definitely not as good as Viva Mercado's or Garduno's. I got the steak fajitas and they were a big disappointment. Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat. The guac and the flour tortillas were very good and were definitely made fresh, yum!
After all that I'm afraid we won't be going back as there are much better options in the Valley.
