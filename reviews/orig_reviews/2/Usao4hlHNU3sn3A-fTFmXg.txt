We really wanted to like this restaurant. It's close to where we live and has a far better than average menu. But, as the saying goes, the menu is not the meal. 

We were disappointed right away: the chips were thick, tough and tasteless. The salsa looked beautiful, but had almost no flavor. The guacamole was only fair (the avocado was mostly tasteless but we didn't downcheck them for that; avocados vary a lot). Everything looked fresh, but had little flavor. (How do you remove the flavor from cilantro and the heat from jalapenos?)

Normally I would go for the carnitas, but with pibil, al pastor and pollo mole on the menu, I was torn. I went for the mole even though I assumed that the butterflied chicken breast it was served on would likely be overcooked (it was); the mole itself was better than most, however. The beans and rice were decent, though under-seasoned and not as flavorful as we would have liked. 

The carne asada enchiladas were only fair. The meat was chewy and lacking in flavor. It's served with beans (decent) and vegetables (which we tasted and left uneaten).

Service was unremarkable, probably because the kitchen was soooo slow (on a Sunday afternoon and not particularly busy). Sadly, we won't be back.
