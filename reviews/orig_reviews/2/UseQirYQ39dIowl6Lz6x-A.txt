Nice authentic feeling environment with a very large menu. I am not sure if i had a bad day but  the service and food were not very good. Tried this restaurant based on Yelp and another persons suggestion. But after eating here it was disappointing. I ate the fajitas and my friend had the Carne asada. Nothing seemed to be very fresh and the vegetables were overcooked. I wasn't expecting to be this disappointed but it really was not what I expected. Overall not great and will not be trying to return anytime soon. Sorry but that is the truth.
