I don't get it , you have to make an appointment to get a drink , The bartenders (3) make you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you and just stand around looking dis interested .
The service downstairs is better ,but the food is blaaa and very slow from the kitchen .
Now the worst part , the price , its ridiculous $35/40 for overcooked oily food .
