I love tacos and I love trying out different restaurants that serve themm so after all the positive reviews I've read here I finally tried this restaurant along with a friend.  We went this past Saturday around 2pm.  It was busy but we placed our order & took a seat and waited close to 30 minutes for our order.  A long time to wait for tacos but seeing how busy the place was I somewhat understood the long wait.  I ordered 2 fish tacos and 1 chorizo taco.  My friend ordered 2 chicken tacos.  Both of my fish tacos were cold, not lukewarm, COLD...the chorizo was warm.  I figured my fish tacos were prepared first then sat there while the rest of the order was completed.  Normally I would've sent them back but didn't have the time to wait another 30 minutes so I ate them because I was starving.  My friends tacos were served warm.  Neither of us were impressed with this place and sorry to say we won't be back because there's too many other taco places much better than this one.
