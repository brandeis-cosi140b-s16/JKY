This place was great! Until we got the bill and were over charged.  Come to find out, things may be more expensive "on race days." Weird. I didn't see that noted anywhere.  Not in the menu or on a sign anywhere near a door.  The food was fantastic, the service was tolerable for how busy it was.  Our server did hook our table up with cards that get us 10% off throughout 2014 (though the cards are labeled for 2013).
  
tl;dr:  Don't come on a race day! The Award Winning Crunchy Tacos are delicious! Try the Smashed Potatoes!
