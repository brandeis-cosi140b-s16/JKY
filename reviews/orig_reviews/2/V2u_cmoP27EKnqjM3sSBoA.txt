I went in for the first time when I heard they had .99 tacos, but the taco Tuesday special was two beef tacos with rice and beans for 4.99. They give you bean, salsa and chips as you wait which were both good. the waitresses was sweet and attentive and my food came out quickly. The beef was moist and flavorful but the iceberg lettuce and plain tomatoes on top were too wet so I could taste Arizona's lovely tap water in my taco. The price was nice but there was nothing special about my food.
