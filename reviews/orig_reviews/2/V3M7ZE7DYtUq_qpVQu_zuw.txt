Overrated.  Is the al pastor and asada delicious? Yes.  Is it waaay over priced? Yes.  The chips were cold and not very tasty.  The salsas were not memorable.  The corn tortillas they use for the tacos are not half as good as the ones Food City or Ranch Market makes.  They do have a nice selection of beers.  I guess they do so well because their patrons love Mexican food and will pay more to have it served by Non-Mexicans.  I guess if you've never had the real deal before this place is good.  There are many many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix serving much better tacos and burritos for half as much.  I won't be back.
