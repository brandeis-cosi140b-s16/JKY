Dont know what the fuss is all about, one sunny afternoon my fiancee decided that she would like to pick a restaurant this time. So I quietly followed along and she yelp me to this restaurant.

What can I say, I am not a big fan of mexican cuisine but, I guess this place was everything I can dread of. Chips and salsa, good but if thats the only stuff people rave about, you know you got a problem. 

When my carnitas arrived and looks dry and cubed, instead of pulled pork with some sort of marinated sauces, I am too darn dissapointed. I am too hungry to sulk and complain so I just ate it. When I open the tortilla basket and found they only put two? one for me and one for the food that my fiancee ordered, I was so darn pissed. But I put on a smily face since my fiancee feels like mexican. 

I would never come back here again. Finished eating, I just cant wait to go to my usual pad see ew hang out place. 1 tortilla come on???
