This place is ALWAYS dead! The fullest I've ever seen it is every seat at the bar (roughly 20 seats) plus maybe a couple tables. The only reason I'm willing to come here is because I have stupid friends that like this place. The only positive is their "Street Tacos" that I like... Which are cheap.

Overall, this place is at the bottom of the fun list... If you get pulled here, get their "Street Tacos!"
