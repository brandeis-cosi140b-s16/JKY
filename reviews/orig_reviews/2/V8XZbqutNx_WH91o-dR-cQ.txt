Went here tonight. Decor is cool, server dude was nice but that was about it. The joint was dead at 6:30 pm when we showed up. Food was as follows 
Green Chile Cornbread- corn bread was good except for the huge chunk of burnt corner piece I had the bad luck of receiving . I got more skin than pork(eww) and wasn't really impressed. I scooped off all the other stuff to try to salvage the unburnt part of the cornbread.
Nachos- pretty good
Fuego pasta- might have been good if it wasn't cold
Cubano sandwich- my kid said it was good but it was the smallest damn thing on a roll the size of a hotdog bun
So needless to say I wasn't very impressed. I had higher hopes as I had eaten at bistro(AMAZING!!!) and cantina when it was still around. Oh well.
