This place looked like it had potential- but it fell quite flat-as do most Mexican places on  the Strip seem to! 
The wait to be seated was long- yet there were plenty of open seats. The wait staff we dealt with- while not outright rude were not overly friendly. And the food was only so-so when considering the price. 
There is a much better Mexican place just down the street by the Fashion Show- I suggest them over this place.
