They teach you that when you're about to give bad news, you should start with something positive, right?  Here's the good...

The chips and salsa were really good.  The chips were extra salty and I was happy they arrived that way rather than me pouring on salt like I'm waiting for a heart attack.  The margarita was delicious and at happy hour prices, it's a steal.  The queso and sopas were tasty as well.  The bread pudding was also yummy.

And the bad...  

Things were not terribly well seasoned and there were no salt shakers on the tables. Perhaps it's an oversight but tables with no salt shakers are a sign of arrogance.  This is acceptable at places with gourmet food...at your neighborhood Mexican joint?  Not so much.  

Where things really fell down for me was the service.  There seem to be general chaos where the servers were concerned.  Our waiter, although he was very, very nice, seemed extremely distracted.  I noticed other tables (all in the bar section) experiencing poor service as well.  Food went to the wrong table.  The wrong check went to the wrong table.  We waited an inexcusably long time for more tortilla chips and my husband had to ask for them twice.  Our drinks sat empty for a very long time.  We even pushed our empty glasses to the edge of the table to indicate that we were not finished medicating ourselves.  Everything took far longer than it should have.  

The other thing that bothered me were inconsistencies between what was on the menu/what our waiter described and what came out.  The menu stated the bread pudding came with rum raisin ice cream (yes, please!).  It arrived with vanilla bean ice cream.  The waiter stated that it came with a blueberry sauce but it arrived with what was clearly a raspberry sauce.  It was still a tasty dessert but I like things to arrive as advertised.    

I think this place has potential but they have some work to do.
