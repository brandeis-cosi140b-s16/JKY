This is my second time here. I thought I'd give em another try. This visit really isn't different than my last one. I ordered a Green Chile cheeseburger. The waiter had to advise me it'll be hot. Lol ok whatever. So I finally get it. The presentation of the food looked half assed. Very sloppy. I take the top portion of bread off... There's hardly any green chile on it. I ask for a side of chile. It shows up. The green chile was hot. Which is good. It tasted straight out of the can tho. Gross. I'm sure they get Hatch food service cans or something. My girlfriends meal wasn't much better. She got The Green Chile Chicken Especial or something to that extent. The presentation of the food was horrid. It was a conglomeration of rice, beans, and cheese. With a little boat of chicken soupy something or other. She said that it was too salty. 

The food isn't New Mexican. It's Tex Mex style food using Hatch Chile.
