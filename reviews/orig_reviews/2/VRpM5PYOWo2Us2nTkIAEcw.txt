My friend and I were on vacation and had another place in mind, but we came here after hearing great things about Rio Mirage. The guac was decent and our meals (mahi mahi tacos and spinach/chicken enchiladas) were okay, but kind of bland. We liked our margaritas but they were WEAK! We ordered mediums which were a pretty good size, but not strong at all. If we come back to Surprise, I'd rather go elsewhere. I think this may be a chain...
