This place has a great selection of drinks and tasty food.  The decor is fun and the place appeared clean.  Service was great and the food was very tasty and left me wanting more!

It left me wanting more because the portions were small, especially for the prices they charge for the food.  The tacos were something like $3.50 - $4.00 range and based on the size seemed like they should be maybe 75 cents.  

All in all:  Good food, but it's way overpriced.
