I'll give them one thing- they're quick. But I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and I am not a fan. There was a huge dollop of sour cream in it, I feel like I'm eating straight sour cream now. It's also extremely salty. I was hoping for a good chicken broth like regular tortilla soup, something light on my stomach. They offered to bring me something else, but I've honestly lost my appetite after a few spoonfuls of that soup. Also, the "home made lemonade" tastes like the soda fountain lemonade. Hmmmm. They were kind enough to not charge the soup.
