Split a dinner to save money with a friend, and while it saved us money, the meal was just so-so.  Chips were great tasting but salsa choices were either very hit or very bland (strong onion taste).  We combined the two for a slightly better taste.

Ordered the taco/enchilada combo, tacos were bland, no real flavor and enchiladas were descent but also bland.  

Service was good, waitress checked in on us often, however never asked us about dessert.  Probably would not come back.
