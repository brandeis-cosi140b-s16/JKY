I've been to the Chandler sandbar several times with friends and i liked it, but my first time at the desert ridge was really bad. The hostess was busy talking to her friend and didn't even acknowledge us. We found a place to sit outside and waited almost 20 minutes for someone to come to our table and bring us menus. All this time we are sitting there and the servers are just standing by their computers talking to each other. Our servers name was sarah and she just seemed irritated that we were there. Props to her for trying to upsell me a margarita but when i said i just wanted an iced tea to start she rolled her eyes and walked away. This attitude continued throughout our dinner. She was very friendly with the table next to us full of 20 something guys. WHen we asked for our check it took her 10 minutes to bring it and she didn't even thank us for coming in.
The food was whatever, not great, but not too bad either.

Overall I would not go again. I used to serve and expect at least decent service everywhere I go, it shouldn't be that hard!!
