We went for happy hour last weekend. The highlights: Place and Drinks! Place is beautiful and has outdoor patio area for dining. My partner ordered the Turista; I ordered red wine. Turista was refreshing, snappy.  Everything else (food, service) was mediocre/poor. (Other reviewers had warned that service was bad so it was our fault for thinking that we'd get something different). We ordered three tacos. They were super small ($3 per taco, happy hour price). First, we ordered the carne taco (skirt steak, potato-fava bean hash, crispy string potatoes). There was more potato than steak. And string potatoes were stale and soggy, not crispy.  Second, we ordered the pastor taco (chile ancho rubbed pork). The pork was really fatty, very little meat. Third, we ordered the espada (swordfish), which was actually good (just small--). Finally, service was HORRIBLE. The restaurant wasn't even that crowded. To begin, the hostess seemed bummed/put out that we were even asking to be seated. Our server took our order and then went MIA. We had to flag down other servers for water and our complimentary chips and salsa. If we go back again, it will only be to grab a quick happy hour drink at the bar (will not be dealing with servers again).
