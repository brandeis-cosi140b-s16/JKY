Went for friends birthday dinner.. Food was good then we went to cut the cake we brought and the waiter said we couldn't cut the cake unless we paid the restaurant.. Wtf I have never heard such a thing.. Last time we will goto this place. Made a 17 year old feel bad on her birthday. Thank you casa don Juan...
