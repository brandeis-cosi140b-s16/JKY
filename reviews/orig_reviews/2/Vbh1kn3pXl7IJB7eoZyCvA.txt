Living near East Side San Jose in California, I have high expectations when it comes to Tortas and Mexican food for that matter. 

However, I feel that Los Reyes rides on their fame of Man vs Food albiet their torta portions are massive. Nothing here was spectacular to me.

I ordered the Del Rey Torta, from the rave reviews and I do tend to get signature items from restaurants since it should be a representation of who they are. Along with the torta I ordered a horchata.

The Del Rey is a massive torta that easily feeds 2, a half for each person. It comes with a side of chips and in the torta itself it has: avocado, pickled onions, tomato, egg encasing chorizo, hotdog, then cheese, brisket, and fried steak. Bread barely held every thing in and was a huge mess.

The torta had lots of textures, flavor wasn't as flavorful and didn't seem to be cohesive. It was just a lot of meat, cooked different ways in between two slices of bread. The chorizo didn't have that lovely red color nor heat to it.

The horchata was plain chalky, powdering and doused in cinnamon powder on top.

I packed half of my torta home since I couldn't finish my meal, but didn't even end up eating it afterwards. I didn't finish my horchata.

Service is decent. Typical of a family run restaurant, casual but timely. Pricing was okay for what it was, though I would get Mexican food elsewhere.
