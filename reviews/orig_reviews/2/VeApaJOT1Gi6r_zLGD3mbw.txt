We use to love this place. Unfortunately  we now live about 60 miles away so coming here is only an option when we come back from up north.  Used to be Best Fajitas in town, sorry to say not anymore.  Today the shrimp was over cooked which really disappointed me.  I do have to say    
 The tortillas are made fresh when you order your meal. Piping hot and perfect. They never skimp on the meals. Large portions.  The wait staff are really friendly, fast to greet you at your table and they know the menu. Would I  come here again? I don't  thing so. They us to be the best , but I have had better closer  to home.
