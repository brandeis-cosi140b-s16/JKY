Paco's Tacos and Tequila was a nice time because of the choices of TK, atmosphere and service which were all very good.  Where it fell short was in the appetizer size for the money - I enjoy chicken nachos that are stacked high since tortillas are so inexpensive and taste great!  Paco's was good tasting but the chips were a single layer of chips smothered soggy by the chicken/cheese topping.  rate 2.5
The main meal was good but what I want to mention is the "fried" ice cream which another customer had about the same comments regarding the coating and presentation.  I could not tell what the coating was made of and there was adequate ice cream to share but it was soft and did not seem crispy.  served on a plate rather than in a cinnamon/sugared tortilla shell it was not what was expected.  It was eaten because I wanted to taste it and figure out what the coating was...rated 1.5
Would I return - maybe for the margaritas and chips and salsa - however, consider a TK klub and punch a card for each different tk tried and award a food item, tshirt, or discount for a meal, or something to encourage patron ship.  Will I give the food a second chance...maybe but they need to reconsider the fried ice cream...
