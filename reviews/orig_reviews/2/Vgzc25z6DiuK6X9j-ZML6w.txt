I had mixed feelings about dining here. A friend of ours chose this place for her birthday celebration and she raved about it, but the 3 1/2 stars had me a bit worried. I am a 4 star or higher kind of girl...life is too short to waste it on mediocre food. I started with the Queen's Cooler which was tasty, but for $9 I felt it could have been a tad stronger. We ordered the Barrio Guacamole...yummy, but just like Barrio Cafe! I was hoping they would be a little unique in this department. Chile Verde was my dinner choice and the word that comes to mind is meh!! First of all they served it on a skillet so I expected it to be hot...it wasn't. The server even said be careful the skillet is hot. Slightly warm? Maybe. But definitely not hot. I hate eating barely warm food! The flavor? Just okay. Desert was their only saving grace. Mexican Bread Pudding...that I would go back for! Overall experience? Not impressed!! insert sad face here
