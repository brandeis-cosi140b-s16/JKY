Heaven forbid you don't smoke and would like to enjoy your food in the bar area and have a beer. For a California chain, the experience is nothing like "non smoking California". That being said, this is my second visit to this location and millionth time at a Wahoos. I did go into the bar to get a beer and take it back to my table, but when I got it back into the "smoke free room", I noticed after my first taste that the mug was completely cracked at the top. I asked for a bar manager so i didn't have to go back into the smoke and he brought me another beer with an explanation of how the temperature variation from the dishwasher to the freezer can crack a mug. Thanks Mr. Science. (Next beer is on us maybe? PLEEEZE not even an attempt at an offer).   After my food came with my chips and thimble sized salsa, I asked for another salsa so I could finish my chips. (I had tacos too) the girl left, came back and said. "Oh, salsa is 0.38." Really?? 38 cents?? I had such high hopes for this location. Even after I am done eating today I am suppose to order something to bring home to my son. I am honestly going to drive in the complete opposite direction and go to Faustos and get him something. I honestly don't think that this Wahoos will ever get another dime, or 38 cents out of me.
