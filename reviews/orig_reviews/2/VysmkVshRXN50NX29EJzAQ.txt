I want to give this place five stars so bad! I just can't, yet. 

I've been here three times, and each time left me a mix of disappointment (service) and satisfaction (food). 

The service is still not consistent. The first time I went, the host and server were super friendly and things were going just fine. I ordered the carnitas taco, and it was a little bland. I ordered some crispy flautas that were good, but not mind blowing. However, I really enjoyed the house margarita for $3! I was interested enough to return for a second round. 

Second visit was on a Saturday night, and the place was packed! The energy was great, and we were seated by the food counter inside. After a minute of sitting the cooks kept yelling "Order Up!!!" every few minutes. It kept startling me, and I just could. not. concentrate. My suggestion, remove that table position. It's a busy spot, and between the music and the "order ups!" I couldn't hear myself think. There weren't any other tables available that night, so we had to stay put. Honestly, I can't even tell you about the food because I was so distracted by the yelling that I just ate and left asap. I think I had, tinga tacos? 

The third time I had excellent Tinga tacos! The best! However, the service was really below average. Our server was nice enough at first, but we kept waiting for 10+ minutes for margarita refills. He also kept forgetting to bring us things we asked for (salsa, chips, guac). I am definitely not a rude patron, so I didn't say anything --I just had to politely remind him several times. He never wrote anything down which could have been the problem...
