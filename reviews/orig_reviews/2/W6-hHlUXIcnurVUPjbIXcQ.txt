This place is okay. I've been here twice and the first time I came, I had tacos with a side of black beans and to be honest they came just straight of a can and were not warm. The second time I came here, I've had chorizo, potato, egg and cheese, and it did not settle well with my stomach.

I do not know what they do behind the counter but I feel that something is going wrong.
