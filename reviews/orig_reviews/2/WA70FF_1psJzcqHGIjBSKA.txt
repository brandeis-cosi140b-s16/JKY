We went for brunch, I liked the concept: pay flat $35 and you get unlimited tapa plates, and you can add $10 bottomless mimosas. Unfortunately the quality of the food and service was below par. Especially for the price. Some of the plates were ok, most of them not that great. One of my first plates came out cold!  

Great idea, I just think they need to brush up on quality service and food preparation. Our server did not check on us enough, making the whole process a lot longer. Also they let the plates stack up, which is a pet peeve of mine since I've worked in the industry for a long time. I hate when people don't bus their tables. It's simple, when you drop off a plate you should be picking up one. Our service in general was slow, at one point I think we were sitting and waiting to order a drink for almost 30 mins.
