I've been once and am having a hard time convincing myself to go back.  If I do...I'll definitely try the Brussels sprout nachos as I've heard nothing but good things about them.

My one and only visit so far was with a group of 6 friends.  We went on a weekend night a bit later in the evening....probably around 8.  We had no issue getting seated, but getting service was a different story.  Our took our drink order and the first round was delivered promptly, but then she disappeared and we had to wait a while to be able to put in our food order.  It took even longer for our food to be brought out to us.  I will say that the food was delicious once we got it.  The server didn't check back on us and one of us had to actually get up and ask for service for water even.  I understand a wait on a busy weekend night, but the restaurant was practically empty.  Perhaps they were understaffed that night, but if that is the case give us the FYI.  Otherwise, it just seems like we are being neglected.  If someone suggests the place to meet up, I would go back, but I don't have any big desire to make the effort to go.
