Super over priced and the food isn't that good.  The only reason why we've ever gone here is because it's one of the only places inside the Hard Rock Hotel to eat late.  I'm all for small portion sizes, but Mexican food is something that shouldn't come miniature.  I'm sure I'll be back but more out of convenience than anything.
