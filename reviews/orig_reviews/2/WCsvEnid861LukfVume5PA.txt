I have been waiting for this restaurant to open for a while, anticipating the great costal Mexican food that Panchos is famous for.  When I finally dined there the place was really underwhelming. First of all there is no carpet in the restaurant & it sounds like a warehouse. I ordered a chili verde burrito which is a staple in Mexican kitchens & it seemed that the pork was cooked separately from the sauce which enables them to use it with multiple sauces. The pork in Chile Verde should be cooked or braised in the sauce which emparts meat juice in the sauce. This unctuous experience was totally absent at Panchos & considering my companions mediocre dish I most definitely will not return to Panchos. This is a classic Americanized Mexican restaurant and I strongly prefer to eat at more authentic eateries!
