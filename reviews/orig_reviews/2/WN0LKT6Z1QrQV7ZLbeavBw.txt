Not impressed.  The service was not even mediocre.  Do not like the concept in a sit down restaurant that I have to get up for salsa refills even when the chip refills are delivered to the table.  I did not care for the food.  Salsa was fine, radishes were fresh.  Did not like the mahi mahi platter, beans or tortillas.

I would not come back.  So many other dining options in the same parking lot.
