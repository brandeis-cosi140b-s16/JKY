The food is very good but our experience with the bill was not a good one.  My husband ordered the beef and chicken fajitas which came with 3 small flour tortillas. He asked for more tortillas and some lime. They charged us $1.50 for the tortillas and $.75 for the slices of lime.  We have never been charged for these items at any other Mexican restaurants.  The waitress (Aarika) should have a least informed us of the extra charges.
