I am writing this as I sit at my table, so I'll keep this short. I was here several years ago and it was a fantastic experience. However, I came here today and it is completely different aside from the name. They now serve Mexican food (not Caribbean )... which isn't bad in of itself, but read on. 

They are out of ice. They don't have carnitas. They waited until our entree arrived to give us silverware. And there was bone in my chicken burrito. And we aren't even done with our lunch yet. It takes a lot to get me to write out a review on the spot, especially after a long hiatus... but my current experience has compelled me to do so. 

Whatever Casa Rasta once was, it is no more. I won't come back again.
