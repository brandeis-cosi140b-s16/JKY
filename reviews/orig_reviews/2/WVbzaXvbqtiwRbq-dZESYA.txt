Every time I drove by this recent addition to Scottsdale, the patio was filled with happy diners, so I finally found time to try the restaurant myself for lunch. When I ordered the Rotisserie chicken taco, I expected a taco resembling one from Ajo Al's, a six-inch corn tortilla, overflowing with meat, lettuce, green onions and cheese. What I got was a four-inch corn taco on a plate, a pile of chicken on top, some shreds of cabbage, a few pieces grilled corn, with a sauce all over it. Very wet. I couldn't see how to pick it up without getting messy, so I had to eat it with a knife and fork. Even at $2.95, I felt cheated.

I also had ordered the Haus Guac & Chips. The guac was delicious, but there were only three bits of green onions mixed in. The pieces were almost black; I wasn't sure whether something had gotten in there that shouldn't have. The chips were delicious - not greasy - the closest to diet chips I've ever had.

You have to go outside then inside another door to the takeout area to use the restroom. The handicap stall had no handbag hook. I had to put my handbag on the floor. Yuck!

I only give a restaurant one try: this was it for taco haus.
