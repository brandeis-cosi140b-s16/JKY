Not vegan/vegetarian friendly at all. The beans have bacon in them. The server was able to hook it up with some veggie fajitas, off the menu, but still not exactly the kind of thing I would really want to pay money for.

Felt a bit sick after words, so my assumption is that either the food was tainted or that I accidentally ate some sort of animal protein that my body is not able to digest well.

The only reason why I'm not giving Abuelo's is because my server was super helpful in finding me something to eat.
