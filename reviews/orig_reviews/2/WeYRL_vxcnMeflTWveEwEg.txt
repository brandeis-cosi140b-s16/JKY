It was ok i guess....the waitress took FOREVER to come to our table to take a simple drink ordee....the host gave my 6 year old a adult menu when they have kids menus....i had to ask for a kids menu....food was not that great for the prices..rice was hard and beans were bland..the only thing tasty was the chimichanga...dont think i will go back.
