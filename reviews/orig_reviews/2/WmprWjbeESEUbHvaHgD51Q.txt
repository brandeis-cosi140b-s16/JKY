Bad service! Very spicy! We had s party of 8 and the night started great with the waiter answering our questions, accommodating our party etc. however when all the food came out, three of the 8 dishes was wrong, and one had to be sent back just because it was terrible. Also, if you cannot handle spicy food, this is not your spot. There are no mild options. Even the chips and salsa in the beginning are scorching with no mild option.
