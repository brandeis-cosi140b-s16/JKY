The fajita bowl was mediocre. It lacked the quantity of beef a perfect fajita contain but I must say the beef that was there and the vegetables were cooked very well! The employees were very helpful in menu instruction. I feel that the food is over priced but its a cool restaurant. After I left I realized I had forgotten my sunglasses on the table and went back and were very urgent about finding them.
