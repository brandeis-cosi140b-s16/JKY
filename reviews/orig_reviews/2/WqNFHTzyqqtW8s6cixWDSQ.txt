Um, thanks yelpers for the LIES! 

So i woke up from a nap today and me and the little child growing inside of me NEEDED a burrito. I told the bf to get on yelp and Someburros showed up with tons of reviews and a good amount of stars.

We arrive at Someburros and I see a good number of people inside so I'm thinking there's hope.. I've finally found a good mexican place in Arizona! But HAH! was I wrong.... let me break it down for you:

-I ask the girl if she has what I've been craving.. a big carne asada burrito. You know, the kind you can get at all other normal mexican restaurants? She says "oh we don't have carne asada here, we only have shredded beef and ground beef". (UH wtf?)

-we order a shredded beef burrito with some kind of sauce, then we ask what comes in it.. the girl says "just meat and sauce". We ask if we can put anything else in it and she says no. We look at the menu and all of their burritos have basically nothing in them!

- We realize that their burritos are basically giant soft taquitos, so we order this deep fried chicken burrito thing that's on sale on Wednesdays because it looked like it had the most ingredients in it. 

-The chicken thing comes out, and for being "on sale" for 5 dollars, it was pretty small for the price.

I left full, but unhappy. It's definitely better than that nasty Filibertos, but at least Filibertos has carne asada!! If anyone knows of a good place to get a burrito, PLEASE send me a message.
