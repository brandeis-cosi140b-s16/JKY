Very disappointed in the food.......I has the steak fajitas and they came to the table not sizzling.......overcooked and lacked any type of flavor.  Everyone else at the table were very disappointed in their food.  Service was OK........atmosphere poor....... did not have any Mexican type interior look.........I would never go there again.
