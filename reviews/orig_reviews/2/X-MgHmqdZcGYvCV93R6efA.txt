Food OK just average. Friends ordered Pollo Fundido & enjoyed it, but our Chicken Fajitas and Carnitas Burrito were DRY and not so flavorful. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Bartenders needed to pay better attention ... gave our drinks to another couple next to us and didn't even realize the mistake until we pointed it out. LAME!

Nice atmosphere on patio. 

Very large restaurant and we heard manager on the phone calling servers to come in to work,  so service could get spotty.

Plenty of other places with better food and service, though perhaps you'll have to travel outside Cave Creek to find them.

We might come back here but only after trying the other restaurants in the area first.
