One word: overrated
Maybe we got the wrong stuff but....The Baja taco sucks. Dry, no flavor, and obviously we made a huge mistake getting it. The chicken taco was much better and had flavor as well as the queso fundido. However be aware,you would think a place that charges you $10 for a cheese dip would give you at least two orders of tortilla rolls,but they don't, they give you enough for half, then they secretly charge you a $1 when you ask for more.....it's the principle.  We were so disappointed by the exceptional hype the city of Pittsburgh has poured in this place that the mood was set after the flavorless Baja taco. 
The el Diablo did not taste like anything special either except that it was a normal margarita that costs $10. I would have rather dumped $70 on mad mex which has more reliable food am that is worth the money.......Or wish that Yo!Rita was still open......or Verde........or I lived closer to Taco Bell. Our waiter was great though.....
Extremely disappointed by the hype and how overpriced it is. Also for how annoying it is to make a reservation and how long people wait, the place was 2/3rds full the entire time.
