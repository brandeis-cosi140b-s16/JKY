2.5 stars for the novelty of it - the food could have been a lot better.  The carnitas were decent (but dry) and the chicken fried rice was ok, very salty though.  The refried beans tasted like they were out of the can. I liked the chile relleno with the saltine coating, it was pretty good. Emerald chicken was bland. The BBQ pork was tasty and the jerk chicken had some nice spice - but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican?  I was confused.

The restaurant is in a creepy converted warehouse.  I felt like a horn was going to go off signaling the end of my break to go back to work. The guy at the counter was patient in explaining how to order and such, but otherwise they weren't the friendliest at the counter.  The free cookies at the end are pretty good.
