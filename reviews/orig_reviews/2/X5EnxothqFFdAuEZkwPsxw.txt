Not the greatest. In summary - the waiter told us they had the "best margaritas in scottsdale", which wasn't true they tasted like an average margarita mix lacking in tequila. Next for our appetizers - we ordered a few guacamole, which was way too expensive for the amount you received, and didn't blow me away. Then we ordered the street tacos. I had the chicken, which was very dry, lacking in flavor and almost tasted gamey. There might be better options available, but I wasn't impressed with the items I ordered (especially for the price) and probably won't be returning.
