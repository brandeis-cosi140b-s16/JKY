This seems like a mailed in effort from one of my favorite local chefs.  My breakfast sandwich was absolutely average and exceptionally messy given the fact that you are likely going to be eating it off your lap.  The bread was heavy and bland; I wound up discarding it.


One general complaint about the overall new restaurant plan.  I am absolutely a fan of the local restaurants in the airport but as I was in the Southwest terminal I couldn't find any reasonably priced dishes.  I find that interesting given the fact that the Southwest terminals are usually ground zero for families and young kids.  I feel bad for the mom of 4 who has no option but to spend $15 for some french toast at Barrio or LGO.  What happened to  the cheaper options?
