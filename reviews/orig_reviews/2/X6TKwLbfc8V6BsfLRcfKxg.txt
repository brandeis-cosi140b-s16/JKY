High hopes for this place but left disappointed.   Decor is hip and classy.  Drinks were good.  Liked the music but was way too loud- huge pet peeve of mine at restaurants.   It was freezing inside the restaurant even though we weren't seated next to the window.   Servers were nice though flustered seeming.   Menu sounded exciting but everything that I tasted was kind of blah.  Crab/ salsa-  too salty and tomatoes tasted either old or canned.  Lobster flauta was underwhelming.  Spicy seafood stew was way too salty and not that flavorful.  So much potential for the location of this place
