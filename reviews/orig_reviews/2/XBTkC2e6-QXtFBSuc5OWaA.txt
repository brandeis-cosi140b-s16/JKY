Service was good....Fish was way over battered and WAY over cooked.  Had to send fish back and waitress agreed it was hard as a rock and hardly any fish inside the batter.  Salsa's were very good, and burrito's were not anything special definitely not living up to the DDD.  Do not really recommend to drive too far out of your way.  I have eaten lots of authentic Mexican food and they do not have the best that I have ever seen.  We both actually got sick after eating here and never will go back we are both very forgiving and will not go back.  We love dives and this is not one to try, not worth your time.  They are cutting costs probably, they need to work on there standards now and forget about all the DDD hype.   Don't waste your time or go out of your way.
