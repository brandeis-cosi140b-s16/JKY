Sylvia, what happened?
We normally do take out from the Indian school location, but we wanted a sit down dinner so here we are. 
First, $6 for a kids meal and the burrito was smaller than a dollar bill, no fries or rice on the side??I ended up giving my son half my plate because he was still visibly hungry. 
Second, store bought taco shells? Really? I thought better of you than that. Indian school has homemade shells (or used to). These came straight out of the Ortega box. Terrible. 
And finally, service. Our server tried really hard, I'll give her that but when I ask for new silverware don't point out that you already gave me some. Clearly you missed the part where I'm sitting with four kids who likely dropped their fork on the floor. And yeah, uhh when a family asks for extra napkins please bring more than two. 
The red Chile was still good, so that is why it's a two star review instead of one. 
So completely blown away by the store bought taco shells.
