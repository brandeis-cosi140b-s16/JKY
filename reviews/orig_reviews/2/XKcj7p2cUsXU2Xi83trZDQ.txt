I can't stand the long reviews so simply put, food is good, not great. Service is great from the waiters, prices are not. For Mexican food I'd go somewhere else.

My experience: $16.95 for 2 enchiladas, rice, and beans (15.95 for a burrito) is just too much. I ordered from the happy hour menu. I was brought the menu and seated in the "non-cantina" area. When I got the bill, I was charged way more than expected so I asked and was told about the super special cantina area/prices. No happy hour for me. I would have rather sat there to begin with but wasn't offered a choice. I live across the street and rather than help me out for the confusion, she stuck the charges and said it was my fault. Horrible hostess, excellent waiter, but for the price, crappy hostess, 2 stars because I won't come back. Bummer because everyone else seemed nice.
