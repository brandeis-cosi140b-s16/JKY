Am I missing something here? I've actually been back to America's. Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th. 

Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

I'm still on my quest for the Best Burrito in Maricopa County, I'll let you know when I find it fellow yelpers.
