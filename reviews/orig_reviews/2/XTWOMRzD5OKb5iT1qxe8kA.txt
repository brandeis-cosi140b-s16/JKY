I'm afraid I just don't understand the hype of Mi Patio. The restaurant has plenty of parking and it has a good location. It's clean and the decor is really bright and fun. The staff is friendly enough, but I didn't like the food.

I didn't really care for the salsa. It was fresh, but it had a muddled flavor of old cilantro that I didn't like. Also, the chips were stale.

Our food came out quickly, but I was pretty underwhelmed. I had the beef enchiladas with green sauce. The rice and beans had a burnt flavor; it's hard to describe, but I didn't like it. The meat did not taste fresh, and I couldn't see or taste the green sauce. Personally (and I know I'm in the minority here), I thought there was way too much cheese on the plate. I like cheese, but I don't want so much that it makes the food greasy. My husband had beef tacos with rice and beans. He liked the rice, but he felt that the beef wasn't fresh. He didn't finish his plate.

The prices were pretty cheap, but I feel like the food and experience was overhyped. I don't think I'll be back.
