I get the feeling it's on its way out, which is sad.

Sat at the bar for dinner. The bartender appeared to have been injured and walked with a stoop. I felt sorry for him as he struggled to provide things like set-ups and drinks. We waited far too long for a simple order (Nana's chili and a burrito). The food was bland when it finally arrived. The only napkins were cocktail napkins. Even the check took too long to get there. The guy obviously needed help, but no one was helping him.

Too many other better choices around. I can't think of a reason for a return visit.
