The chips and salsa were pretty good. The prices were pretty high and there was not much of a selection. The beans and rice were so bad! I usually will suck down the beans and rice everywhere else even if they are mediocre but these were just plain nasty! Don't know what kind of recipe they are using but this was a deal breaker for me. I would not eat here again. They did have a surprisingly delicious veggie burrito. My boyfriend said it was a zillion times better than his beef taco and burrito. Still, you would expect it to be good for ten bux!
