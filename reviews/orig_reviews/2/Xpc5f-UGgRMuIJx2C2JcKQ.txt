As many have said, the decor is amazing.

But Taco Guild implies expertise in tacos. It brings pain to say, because hopes were high, that the tacos are not great.
- Shrimp taco: the amount of sodium in this taco was such that I couldn't taste anything else.
- Snapper taco: although the snapper was dry, the flavor was actually pretty good. If Thai curry were to be a taco, this is the one.
- Veggie taco: this was probably the most confusing...and sad. It was listed in their "old world" taco section. I took this to mean that this was going to be standard southwestern flavor.  Nope. Soggy Brussels sprouts, tomatoes, cheese, and...guacamole? Why?!? I love Brussels sprouts. Taco version was horrifying.
-Pork tacos: flavor was, for the most part, absent. Meat was dry.

Overall...sad times.
