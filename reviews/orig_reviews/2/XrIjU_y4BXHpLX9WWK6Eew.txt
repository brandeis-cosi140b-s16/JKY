I like this place's happy hour because it is a good deal. The happy hour food and yinzeritas are decent. 

If that was all I got there then I would give them 4 stars, but the service is pretty slow and the bartenders don't pay attention to you even when the bar is empty. Also, do not get a "top-shelf" margarita here, I have tried 3 different bartenders and the manager and they cannot make one. All of  them so sweet that they weren't drinkable.
