Eat here only if you don't have any other choice and if your starving from not eating for a whole week... I don't know if it's just today or every day is like this but you can get better tasting food and service from your local McDonalds!!! NO JOKE!!! Over priced, low quality, low taste... Just bad! I didn't have a good experience but your free to try, as for me, i will never come here again nor will I bring a friend!
