I USED to love Taco Y Taco when they first established, but every time I keep coming, the quality and atmosphere gets worse and worse. :(

I thought I would get used to the ordering process, but it's not organized at all and it frustrates me. It gets confusing when there's a long line for line 1, and you want to order from line 3, but you don't want to cut anybody and make them (h)angry.

Particularly this past Friday night June 12th, 2015, it was hot and smelly inside. The AC wasn't on, and it reeked of garbage and wet dog in the area next to the staircase. It was seriously uncomfortable eating inside, and I regret choosing not to just eat at home.

I ate 2 al pastor tacos (which I usually get) and the al pastor was not juicy like I had remembered. It was overcooked and not flavorful. It's just difficult because I used to be obsessed with their al pastor, and that night I was utterly disappointed (I take my food seriously, especially when I come to LOVE it haha).

Maybe I just came at a bad night. I give them 2 stars instead of 1 because I remember how they used to be. I'm sad that I was actually disappointed with my experience that night.
