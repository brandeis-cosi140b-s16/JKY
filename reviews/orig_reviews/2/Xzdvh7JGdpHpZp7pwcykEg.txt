If I could sum up my visit in one word, it would be disappointed.  We accidentally found this restaurant while sight seeing and was pleasantly surprised because we had seen Top Chef Masters and her food looked great.  

We ordered the Baja Ceviche, Fish Tacos, and the Kobe Beef Tacos.  The ceviche was good but nothing memorable.  We thought that it would get better but I found the tacos to be average and lacking flavor.  It definitely needed a bit more of a kick to it.
