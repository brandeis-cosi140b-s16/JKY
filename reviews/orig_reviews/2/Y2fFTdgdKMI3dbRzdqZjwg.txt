Very popular but very unpredictable and uneven.  The bar is always great and a margarita and complimentary chips with salsa and yummy bean dip can fill you up if you have to wait for a table which has always been the case for us.  Only two stars because the last time we went the food was not good, overly spiced, the meal was not served hot and the waiter could not be found after he took our order.  This was in the middle of the week too.  The prices are high and the servings are very large.  I think we will visit the bar and skip the food from now on.
