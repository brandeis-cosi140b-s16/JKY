Tacos El Gordo has several walk up windows, it's cafeteria style. They're known for adobada or spicy pork tacos. The pork is sliced off the rotisserie and topped with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro guac sauce, and also pineapple if you'd like. They have carne asada, too, and more rare finds like tongue, head and tripe. All tacos are $2.

The Adobada was good, but not spicy nor tasty enough to order a second.

The Carne Asada earned no stars, the meat had an odd flavor almost musty and the runny guac helped it none.
