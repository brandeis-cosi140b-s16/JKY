I have been spoiled at the other location in Phx.  We had the conchita pibil I think is what they call it not sure but it was great there so we happened upon this place in Scottsdale and thought we would give it a try.  

I got a chicken burrito that was ok but I would never get it again if I did happen to go back.  My husband got a 3 taco plate which was either $3.50 a taco or 10.00 for 3 and when it came out it was shockingly small next to my burrito that was just a regular size.  My husband says they were approximately 1-2 bite tacos and honestly that is not an exaggeration.

He finished his $10 tacos in 10 seconds flat still starving and asked to see the menu again.  He has never had to order another meal after eating a meal before just to satisfy his hunger.  This time we tried the appetizer I think it was carnitas that was soaked in coca cola or something.  It sounded good but it did not taste good.  The meat was extremely fatty and some pieces overcooked and tough even black.  I took 2 bites just to give it a fair shot but no just not good and he felt the same so the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill.

The manager came over and we told her how we felt in the nicest way possible.  She thanked us for the feedback and then told us that she hoped we would try them again even after we said honestly after this experience we wouldnt be back.  Maybe we just made all the wrong choices.  Who knows?  I guess we won't find out.
