I wasn't sure whether to give two or three stars.  I read some of the other reviews and many people are spot-on with this place.  It is oddly located, in a small strip mall-type place with limited parking.  It is a large, empty-feeling restaurant with not much to look at.  

I have been here twice.  The first time I was greeted by a friendly girl who, upon learning that it was my first time, offered up samples and directions on how to order.  I found the food to be tasty and interesting but not wonderful.  My husband had the jerk chicken and was rewarded with the worse heartburn he's ever experienced.  He was up most of the night regretting that jerk chicken.  Needless to say we'll never order jerk again.

My second visit was several months ago.  I was "greeted" by an unenthusiastic guy who was just ready to take my order but offered no assistance.  I politely said, "this is my second visit but it was so long ago that I was first here I don't remember how the combinations work..."  I looked at him hopefully, willing him to explain a little to me.  He looked back at me, I guess hoping I would just order something.  I tried again to ask in a more direct way if he could explain the system to me, since it is complicated and no where does it explain to you exactly how to order.  If you just look at the menu it is confusing and I don't know exactly what I'm looking at.  He seemed annoyed and handed me a paper copy of their menu and sort of quickly explained a couple things.  I was in a hurry and at this point I just decided to order some things and see what happened.  Again, I had some food that was interesting but not wonderful.  It is like the first few bits are quite flavorful and tasty....then after a bit you start feeling like you don't want any more.  At least that is how I felt.  

I may not try it again here.
