Just went back here for the first time in a year or so. 
 
I used to like this place when I was really hungry for their excellent serving sizes.  I  noticed though that their serving sizes for their rice and beans with the enchiladas is maybe half what they used to be.  The enchiladas seemed to be the same size.  Ingredients are the same and price is a little higher.

Also, my enchiladas weren't really hot, barely warm, after going through the oven.  Seems like maybe they could slow down the oven speed a bit.

Service here is really lacking....they seem to try and rush you through and you talk to 3 different people and no one thanks you for your order while they are clowning around with each other.   I think the girl shorted me on rice/beans (or are their servings really that small now, not sure) and they tried give me the girls salad that was behind me as well.  All this while there were like 3 people in line.  Sheesh lol.

I think chipotle is a better value now and certainly better service
