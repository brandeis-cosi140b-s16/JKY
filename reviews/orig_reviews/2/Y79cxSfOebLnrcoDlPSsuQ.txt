Heard such great reviews and was so excited to try their breakfast burritos this morning. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The burritos tasted more like egg than anything else. I couldn't even taste cheese that was supposed to be in there. It was just so bland and lacking that special flavor I was expecting. The green salsa was also blah. I was just not impressed with my entire order. Not as good as all the great reviews I have read and heard. I'll give it one more try to see if I just picked bad items on the menu but that's it! Grrrrrr!!
