As someone else pointed out, I gave two stars for the environment. Food is definitely overpriced. I wouldn't mind the price as long as the quality can back it up. Unfortunately, Pancho's fails to deliver. Service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre. It's perfect for a tourist from the Midwest or Eastcoast that has never experienced "good" Mexican food. I will stick to Viva Mercado or Juans Flaming Fajitas when I need my fix.
