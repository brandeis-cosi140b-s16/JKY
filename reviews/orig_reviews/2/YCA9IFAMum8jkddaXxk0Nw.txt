Went there for dinner.  Our waiter was slower than molasses.  Took him 20 minutes to come to table.  Another 20 to bring a drink, we were parched by then.  We ordered nachos remembering from past experiences.  They have changed them, different cook?  Not good,  over this place won't b back in future trips......
