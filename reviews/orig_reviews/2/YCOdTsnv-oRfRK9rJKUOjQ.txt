decent crowd, good vibe. however, the food sucks and bottled beers are $5. plus a cover charge on weekends? hello, this is chandler, AZ.....if i wanted scottsdale prices i would go there and visit much cooler places. this sandbar, however, is much better than the morgue that they call sandbar on scottsdale & shea. 

not bad if someone invites you to go there, but if i'm picking i'm going somewhere else. people watching is good, a mix of normal people, professional people, losers, skanks and aspiring porn stars..so that's entertaining...
