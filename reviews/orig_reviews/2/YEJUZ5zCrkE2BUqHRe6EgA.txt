I give this place 2 stars because it was edible. Carnitas were whole pieces of pork with no flavor. Pastor tacos were the only semi-saving grace for this place. The menu talks about gringo this, gringo that, and I told them I would be compairing them to taco truck in East LA. Needless to say this place is not even close to, "Real Mexican food made by real Mexicans" as their entry sign boasts. Not worth the time of day.
