Got a taco salad today for lunch and it was pretty good up until I had seen how much water was in the bottom. I attached a picture of how watered down my taco salad was. It ruined it for me. The only thing that was really good was the top of the taco shell. 

I'm glad they wash the lettuce but I guess they don't bother with trying to get as much water out of it as possible before putting it in your food.
