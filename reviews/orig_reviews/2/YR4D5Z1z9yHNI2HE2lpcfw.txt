Pros:  Outdoor space is great!  Also, the bar area of the cantina also has a great d√©cor and great drinks!

Cons:  The service isn't the best as far as responsiveness to drinks, taking food orders properly, and checking in to see if we wanted anything else.  Also, the queso fundido is a joke.  Don't order it, especially if you're expecting real queso fundido!  I also had the chorizo tacos.   Not bad, however not great either.  The real con of this place is the food made me sick!  I lived in Mexico, and not once did I ever experience the punishing after effects of food like this place gave me.  

Surprisingly, I would go back to this place.  Only for an alcoholic beverage though.
