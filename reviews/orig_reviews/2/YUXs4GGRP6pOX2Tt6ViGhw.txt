The first thing that irked is the nickel and diming of the chips and salsa. Not cool. Ya I get it that everyone isn't a fatty like my girlfriend and I are when it comes to chips and salsa. That's fine. For the people who love chips and salsa like us though charging extra for more chips and salsa is BS. The main reason why it makes no sense is because they are the only restaurant doing that. The outside of the restaurant isn't very appealing but once you are in it isn't too bad. I was not a fan of the tables and how crammed they have you with everyone else in the restaurant. They have been around forever.  Invest in some booths. The food is what is giving this restaurant high reviews and I agree with that. The food was good. The different salsas and green chili were good. This restaurant has a lot of potential because of their food, but that's not enough to bring me back I'm afraid.
