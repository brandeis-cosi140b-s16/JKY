The food was great but the service was pretty bad. First, the girl who took our order saw us waiting at the register and continued to eat in front of us and talk to her coworkers before she came over and rudely took our order. She talked fast and wouldn't look at us as if she had better things to do than her job. Pretty bad experience. But like I said the food was great. Still don't know if we'll be back.
