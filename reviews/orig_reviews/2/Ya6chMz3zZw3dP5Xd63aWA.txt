Great environment, the little Nanas are simply adorable as servers, food is actually pretty good too. This is my 2nd visit here and what SUBTRACTS significantly on what could be a GREAT EXPERIENCE, is the waiting & frustration that you sense from Restaurant  Management because they are not efficiently managing traffic -EVEN- when there's very little to no traffic.
