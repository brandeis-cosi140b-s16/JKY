Gorgeous setting outside with the pond and high ceilings. Reminds me of La Fonda Hotel down in baja. Unfortunately, after being served one margarita each and both of us finishing them over the Pollo Fundidio while we waited for our friends to join us, we ordered two shots of tequila. 20 minutes later, after our friends had arrived, ordered, and received their drinks we still had no sweet agave in sight. 

We proceed to inquire about our shots, and received a half-mumbled and incoherent excuse about not having more than one drink at a time on the table. He clearly had failed to notice that according to the law [ARS 4-244.23] it strictly prohibits SELLING more than 40oz of beer, one liter of wine, or 4 oz of hard liquor to one person at one time. Allowing someone to order a second beverage when they know that by the time it gets to the table the first will be consumed is standard practice, and we weren't ordering doubles, bothering any other customers, or behaving in any other offensive manner. Not to mention both of our glasses sat empty on the table for at least 15 minutes BEFORE he came back with his excuse.

The manager then came to "apologize" but didn't offer to cover an appetizer or a round of drinks, which is the general practice in the industry when an employee makes a mistake or insults a customer in some way. As a veteran of the restaurant biz myself I was embarrassed  both for the waitstaff and the management. It's a shame because it's such a beautiful place but I will definitely not return to spend $60 on greasy cheese, watered-down margaritas, and a rude staff.
