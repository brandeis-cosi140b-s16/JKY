Not only is this place ridiculously overpriced for the campy Miracle Mile, but it's thoroughly mediocre. I ordered a carnitas burrito which tasted like steamed chicken and tomato paste. The tortilla had the consistency of moist clay...very unappetizing for the price. 

Adding insult to injury, three waiters kept pressuring me with questions the entire time; "Would you like another drink, sir?" "Isn't there anything else we can get for you, sir?" Their cloying attitude made me feel like I was at a strip mall theme restaurant, but what else can one expect with a description like "Mexican fare." Indeed, that's exactly what you'll get here: far below "cuisine" and just short of "food."
