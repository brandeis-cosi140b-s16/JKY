Outstanding salsa!  They bring the pico and salsa separate so you can mix your own to taste and they are generous with both... 

Green chili beef nachos.... Mmmmmmmm, so yummy!  So huge! 

Negro Modelo... Perfectly cold!

Next time we find ourselves at The Old Pueblo Cafe, this is what we will order and nothing more because this was the highlight... Downhill fast after our appetizers... 

Momma had Sonoran Enchiladas and thought they had no real flavor or heat... She tried adding some salsa but it did not help, they were just too bland to be helped.

The Main Man had Mexican Flag Enchiladas and found cold spots within the warmth... What the heck?  His refried beans had whole, hard, crunchy beans among what looked like old, crusty mush... What the heck?  Overall, he says his plate was bland as well.

I had a fish taco and relleno with rice and beans.  The tortilla for the taco arrived already saturated with moisture and falling apart... I discarded it and was left with my hunk of cod, cabbage, lettuce, and sauce... Still tasty but more of a salad than a taco.  The relleno gave me fond memories of La Union Station; if you've been you know what I'm talking about, if you have not... Sorry... My beans had appropriate consistency and I liked the rice just fine for the few bites I took.

The service was efficient and pleasant for an extremely busy Sunday afternoon during the big art event but when most of the main dishes are sub-par, I can't go higher than 2 stars... Stick with the salsa, nachos, and beer and have a 4-5 star experience!
