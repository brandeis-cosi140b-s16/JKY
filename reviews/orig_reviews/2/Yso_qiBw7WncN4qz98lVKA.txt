If I base my review on just the tacos at their price point two stars is accurate.

Their were lots of things I did like about SOL Mexican Cocina. They present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas. The margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey.  ($10.50 and $13.75) I loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together. It is worth coming here just for the goat cheese. The grilled corn was good! Not the best I've ever had but GOOD!  They are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians. Service is above average as our server Amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained.

Now the tacos.

The tacos are Baja style street tacos. They are very small tacos.

My husband had the sampler plate and I ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds.  We tried chicken, beef, pork, fish and vegetable. For the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos. We spent $30.25 on 8 MINI TINY tacos. The chicken was the most undesirable but passable. The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty. The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK. The vegetable (corn & rajas) taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture. The wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit. The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked ($7.50) and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it. 

Your best bet is to come for Happy Hour and take advantage of it.
