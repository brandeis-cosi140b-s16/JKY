I bought a groupon here last year and finally got around to trying the place. My son and I are pretty picky eaters, so we kind of created our own. I ordered a chicken and bean burrito enchilada style, with rice and beans on the side. I don't know what the heck was in that burrito, but pretty sure the meat was not chicken. I had a stomach ache before even walking out....I honestly should have asked for a different item. I don't know what was wrong with the meat. The portion itself was huge. Very large plate. The salsa bar I liked, lots of different options, Inside was cute. Warning though, parking is a hot mess, its literally on 16th st. Good luck getting out of there during traffic. Waiter was nice, but slow. Over all I was disappointed. I will say, the beer battered fish taco sounded good. May go back to try that, but other than that based on what I ate, we wont be returning.
