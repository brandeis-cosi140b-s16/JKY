I fully expected to love this place as we're fans of the other locations and were so excited to see the sign on Camelback.  I give this location a big FAIL for service.  We were seated up front near the bar area by the guy I assumed was the owner/manager/full time bull-ish-er who spent the entire time visiting with a couple at the bar. My boyfriend asked for a soda and waters as we were being seated. The busser brought water,chips and salsa immediately and that was the last bit of 'good' service we received.  It took the waiter forever to come to our table just to take the order or even acknowledge we were there, again asked for soda. It took quite a bit of time for the soda to finally make an appearance at which point the food was delivered.  During our meal we tried flagging down the waiter 3 times to ask for drink refills. At one point he looked directly at us, nodded, and proceeded to forget about us.  After several attempts to flag him down I physically started waving my hands in the air as if I was stranded on an island waiting for a rescue but still not one single waiter/busser or captain BS at the bar seemed to notice or care. (and yes Mr. Bartender sir I DID in fact see that you saw and did nothing to alert the staff) 
I understand talking to customers is part of the business but it shouldn't be at the expense of others.  I'll even give you that it was their opening week however there's no excuse for blatantly ignoring clients sitting 2 feet from you while you do nothing but chat it up with the cute lady at the bar.  Not once did the waiter come to ask how we were or to check on us. The place wasn't that busy but even if it were the guy at the bar could've, you know, just peeked his head up to see how everyone was doing. The food is good but not good enough to make me come back. And what's up with the horrendous decor. We had to eat in the corner with a marble bust of Geronimo giving us the evil eye!
