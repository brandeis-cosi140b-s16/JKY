Food here is really good.  I am pretty regular to all of the Richardson's restaraunts.  I have to complain about a new sharing policy.  I took my pregnant wife there who couldn't handle eating an entire entree since they are pretty large.  When we requested to share (not split) a meal, they charged us an additional $5.  What kind of policy is this?  As a paying customer, is it reasonable to stick it to me like this?  Disappointing for sure.  I will be frequenting other establishments that appreciate their customers ie. upward projects and LGO.  Dicks lives up to the name
