The food is still amazing. I ordered the braised pork tacos and the portobello shrimp taco. Friends split five salsas, also great. 

But the place was dead and it still took 40 minutes to get our food. There was one waiter and he couldn't manage three tables. The credit card machine sent down when it was time to pay. Sure not the waiter's fault but neither he nor the owner told anyone else. Matter fact the owner seemed to hide in back. 

The service was mediocre last time too. And the takeout service is no better. I want to love this place! Just provide better service and I'll be back.
