I have lived in this area for 9 1/2 years and only been to Jalapeno Inferno once. All I ordered was a chicken quesadilla, and they couldn't manage to serve it hot enough even in this sweltering heat. I kept sending it back TWICE!...it came back sun burnt...and the waitress wasn't all that nice about it...thinking I was the problem. Well,  I gave you one chance...you messed up...I don't feel compelled to return as I really don't have to have your food. Don't believe the hype!
