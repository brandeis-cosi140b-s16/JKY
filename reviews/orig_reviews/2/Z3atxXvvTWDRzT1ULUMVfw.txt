+1 star for cool, outdoor patio atmosphere and that I had a table along the fire-pit fountain. +1 star for a nice server and overall fast & attentive service. Other than that, food here is pretty gross. Very limited menu (with nothing you want, except maybe guac, 'cause the chips weren't even good) and pretty pricey for the dog food ("beef") you get. We had nachos as an app, and then actually chose to leave after that w/o doing entrees. Enough said. They did bring some jalapeno (?) flour tortillas and red pepper (?) compound butter as their version of a bread basket, but even this tasted somewhat off. Not bad, but for sure not worth the carbs. There are many great Mexican places in Scottsdale, so skip this one.
