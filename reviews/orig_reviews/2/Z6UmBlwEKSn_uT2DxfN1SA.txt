Not impressed.  Save your money and go to a newer fresher ingredients place.  I came here 2 weeks ago after a long day at work hoping to catch a quick meal.  I ordered 2 chicken tacos.  What I got was a soggy greasy mess with rice and refried beans that could be out of a can.  The are where the sauces are obtained looked old and dirty like no one had cleaned for a week.  I know this place has good reviews and is a Phoenix staple but I'm unimpressed.  Maybe once upon a time this place was the bomb, and that's why people keep going.   But as a first timer- it was gross at best and I can probably cook a less fattening meal at home.  Try paqime instead on central and Dunlap.
