Waited til I'd been to this location 3 times to write a review. Unfortunately it started off bad and never got better.

In a nutshell, food is average and a bit pricey.  Salsa, both the chunky and thinner hot one are pretty good.  Booze/Margs are great but expensive.  Service, in my opinion has been the most painful part.   Last visit there last week I stood at the front desk with my two small kids waiting to be seated for several minutes, while 5-6 employees and a 'manager' were arguing about who was leaving at what time that night.
