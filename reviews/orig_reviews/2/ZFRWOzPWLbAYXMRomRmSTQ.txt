Nasty, nasty, nasty, and gross. The cheese crisp is anything BUT (greasy, limp, UGH) and the chips are STALE and vary between super chewy and/or break my jaw status - when I tried to ask for fresh chips the waiter looked right in my eye, apologized, and said he'd promptly throw them back into the microwave for me... WHA?!?! This restaurant is proof that George W. Bush was a bigger idiot than we ever gave him credit for (for those of you who have never been - the TeePee claim to fame is being a local fave of the Bush). I recommend avoiding this place completely and trying Carolina's, Los Compadres, or Casa Reynoso. Service is hit or miss so if you MUST go - try the shredded beef tacos, skip the tap water, and sit at the bar.
