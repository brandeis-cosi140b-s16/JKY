Went to the new location last night and was sadly disappointed.  Same food, higher prices, poor layout and loud, loud, loud.  We were at a round table and couldn't hear our table mates.  The waiter had to lean over and talk loudly into our ears to tell us "we don't have that, we don't have this."  Why is food on your menu if you don't have it??  If you want a family environment don't go here...the bar is the focal point of the room....the waiter said they were going for a more upscale feel....And it's reflected in the prices..... 4 alacarte tacos, an order of cheese dip and a bean burrito with no drinks....$44.00!!! What the what!!  This is Mexican food people and basic, mostly boring at that. We were excited that they were moving closer but it does us no good ...we'll travel a couple miles to Gloria's or go right across the street to Sylvia's.
