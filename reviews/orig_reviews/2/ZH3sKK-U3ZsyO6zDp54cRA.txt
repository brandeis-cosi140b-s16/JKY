Aaah! This place, which was known for its very strong margaritas, is under new ownership. And the drinks are WEAK, people! Very, very sad. Not that I probably need the extra alcohol, but still..
My husband and I went here over the weekend, used to the margaritas we've had for years (chambord for me, sixth-street for him). We tasted them and, blech! They tasted like they came from those Tastee-freeze machines at a state fair, or something. When my husband complained to the waitress, she simply told him that if he wanted a strong drink he "should order the frozen ones."
Right...
Seriously, the rude waitress thing was something new, too. Usually people there have been really friendly.
Then I had the same wild mushroom enchiladas I've always had. I was dismayed to find that the enchiladas now include squash and carrots and other veggies inside. It really ruins the flavor. Not only that, but the yummy black bean and avocado-onion-tomato salsa that used to come as a side dish has been replaced with -- carrot and raw onion strips. Who the hell eats carrot sticks with an enchilada???
Ugh. They've ruined this place, which used to be my favorite standard Happy Hour/cheap food place. So, so sad.
Any recommendations for a new happy hour, anyone?
