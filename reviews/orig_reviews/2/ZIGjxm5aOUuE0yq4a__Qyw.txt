This would be good mexican food if we were in Quebec someplace... maybe I shouldn't say that, maybe they have quite good Mexican food in Canada...

But we have excellent Mexican food here in the Valley of the Sun.  Many five star locations.  More than any other location outside Mexico (and probably more than many a location inside Mexico)...  This spot is not one of them. 

As the other reviewer stated, a pretty good happy hour, which is why it gets two stars, cause let's face it, a good happy hour can really set up your whole evening.  The food is not good.
