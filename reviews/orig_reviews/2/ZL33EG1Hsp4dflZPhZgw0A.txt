All I wanted was a breakfast burrito and some chips and guacamole. When my husband went to pick it up this morning 10 min after they opened he found that they were really not ready to open.  After ringing him up for everything they  said it would be 15 min to make the guac because it hadn't been made yet. He said he couldn't wait so to just credit him back. They said they couldn't cause a manager wasn't there. What manager wouldn't open the store...ugh! So when we called later to see if they had credit the card back we waited on hold for 5 min then called back to wait more. Honestly, the burrito was good but not worth the unprofessionalism that this place showed! I would have rather gone to a berto's drive thru. Maybe they will hire a better staff and we will go back someday. Oh well!
