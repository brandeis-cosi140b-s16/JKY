I really liked Distrito for its ambience. It is located in a trendy hotel, with open door. I liked how you can sit near the door and feel the warm breeze on your face while enjoying a beautiful view. The staff are knowledgeable and professional, and definitely very attentive. 

The reason for its 2 star is really because of the food. Not to say that it was terrible bad, I guess it really didn't capture my fancy or interest. We specifically chose Distrito over all other options is because of its Mexican/Spanish content. Needless to say we were terribly disappointed to lunch only to find out that they only serve a very "Americanized" brunch menu. Sure, more Mexican options are available (maybe 4) but it definitely did not impress me. I guess if I had wanted to eat at an eggs and sausage place, I'd choose to go somewhere else. 

Distrito- if you want to serve brunch items, then at least make your menu items more "Mexican" A huevo ranchero perhaps?
