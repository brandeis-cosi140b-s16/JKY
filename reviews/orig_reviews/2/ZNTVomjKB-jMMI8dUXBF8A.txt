I should have gotten the salad! That's what I went for.  So as usual.  As soon as you get up to the glass it's a marathon for the workers!  How fast can they get you through!  Don't ask too many questions ( ummmm attention Cafe Rio Some people aren't regulars!  Be patient)  I had a few questions, and I felt like I was annoying the guy.  So I ended up getting the shredded beef enchiladas.  It was soooooooooo freakin salty!  If I had eaten it there, I would have told them I wanted something else.   But the chips and salsa was really good.  I'm not sure If I will ever return.  If I'm not mistaken, I think the salad was pretty good.
