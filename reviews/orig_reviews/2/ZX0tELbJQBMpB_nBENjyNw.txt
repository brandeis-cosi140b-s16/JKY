I visited Cafe Rio based on a recommendation from a friend. I have to say the food we ordered was excellent. What made the experience a disappointment was how we were charged extra for sour cream on my tacos and cheese on my girlfriends burrito. My tacos were on the menu for 7.50 my girlfriend's burrito about the same, add chips/salsa and two sodas our bill rang up to $25
