One word describes everything about this place: BLAND

The salsa was bland, the queso was bland, the tortilla chips were bland, the rice was bland, the carne asada tacos were bland. My coworkers at my table said their salads were wilted... and bland. 

And on top of that, they lost our order and after 25 minutes admitted they hadn't even started making it yet. 

The waiter was very very nice and provided great service, but nothing hit the table with any sorts of haste and when it finally got there it was, as I said, BLAND.
