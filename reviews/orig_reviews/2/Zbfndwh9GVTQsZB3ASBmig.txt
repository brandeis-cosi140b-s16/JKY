I don't understand how people can rate so high. Came in greeters were awesome, was seated and then came the wait. Food was alright a bit salty, the hit here is the flaming fajitas which they douse in vegetable oil in order to light. We did really enjoy the chips, salsa, and onion chile slices however we did not receive amazing service like most if the reviews. They took ten minutes to get our waters and soft drinks, and the pina colada my dad ordered was pretty much ice chunks and milk. After receiving our meal we had to flag them down to get refills and extra napkins or what not. Definitely not a high chance of returning.
