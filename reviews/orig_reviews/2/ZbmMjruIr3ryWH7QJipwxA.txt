Here's the thing. The food is actually good. Al pastor tacos are delish. That's the only positive point I have.

For whatever reason, the water is disgusting. I've been here at least 5 times with coworkers and we all just bring our water bottles b/c we know how bad the water is. Bizarre.

The wait staff isn't that helpful or welcoming.

An upcharge of $2 for a tiny container of extra cheese? It's pretty laughable. Imagine adding 50 cents worth of cheese to a bite. 

Ordered a horchata once which was pretty underwhelming. It tasted like melted vanilla ice cream with a dash of cinnamon. My friend says, "I bet this is just plain milk." I ask the waitress what sort of milk they use since the menu indicates rice milk (and mostly because any restaurant should be able to and must tell you what you're eating/drinking). She comes back with no answer and is borderline rude, "So, yeah, I just can't help you. There's nothing I can do. Sorry." Umm.. okay, then! Sorry I asked?!


Moral: Al pastor tacos are delish. The whole dining experience I could do without.
