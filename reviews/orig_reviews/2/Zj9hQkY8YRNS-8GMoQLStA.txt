We've should've known better.  Never settle for any place just because you are hungry.  OMG. This place serves half chinese and half mexican.  ONLY thing that was good at this place was the scallop dumplings. (They have ladies in the window making the fresh dumplings) Everything else, even the mexican food was *BARF*  Do not order the rice porridge (jook).  Its disgusting. Not only was the food horrible, but the prices were outrageously expensive!  Bad food and expensive. NO BUENO!!  This could've been one star but the service made up for it.
