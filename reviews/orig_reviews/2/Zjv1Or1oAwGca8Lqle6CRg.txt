Never heard of this place, but a friend loved it and wanted to go there. There were several of us and we were seated quickly for a busy Saturday night. The restaurant is really large and I had a really good margarita. We had chips and salsa and bean dip. The salsa was thin and spicy. The bean dip was ok.  I originally had beef tacos, beans (only refried) and rice.The beans and rice were ok. That's something that is hard to mess up. The beef tacos were made from shredded beef. I don't care for shredded beef tacos, but that wasn't my complaint. The tortillas for the tacos were so greasy that I couldn't eat them. YUCK!  I ordered an enchilada since I couldn't eat the tacos. There was nothing special about the enchilada. It was big. I'll say that. 

The service was very good. Servers were friendly and attentive. The restaurant is large and can accommodate groups. The problem that I have with large Mexican restaurants that accommodate groups is that the food is usually lacking in quality. I personally feel that this is the case here. I won't go back.
