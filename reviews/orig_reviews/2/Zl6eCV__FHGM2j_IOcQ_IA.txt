Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7

food is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.

Nothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy. Pork was kinda tough, beff was stringy, chicken was dry.

No pico? WTF!! 

Place looked like the person cleaning the dining room went to break right in the middle and left their stuff strung all over.

I would avoid this place-really kinda shitty but hell it's a long ways before anything else if you live in this neighborhood. poor you.
