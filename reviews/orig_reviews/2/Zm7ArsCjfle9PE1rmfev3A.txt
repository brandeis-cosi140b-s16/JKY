I know that lots of folks LOVE this place, and its tacos, but I just can't get there. My friends have raved about Taco Tuesdays, but the fact that the tacos are fried leaves me cold. I've tried multiple times to enjoy them, but I've had to give up. I guess your tastes just have to run in that direction...
