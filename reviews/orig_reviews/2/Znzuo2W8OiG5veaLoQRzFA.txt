Ambience is good 4 of 5, appetizer chips and salsa was good can be better, comes with four dipping bean, salsa, ranch & chilli salsa 3 of 5. Main course was good can be better, we ordered fajitas, and burritos the veggies were over cooked also the qty was less, tortilla were dry and not fresh guacamole was not so fresh and okay in taste. Service was poor as they took 10min to get me beans after serving fajitas also they served my pepsi 5 min before ending my dinner that too  after two reminders. Avg price per person was 15$ not value for money considering the qty and service. I am not sure how it got best review on Yelp!!!
