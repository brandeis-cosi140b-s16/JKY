Overpriced, small portions and very bland food.  The salsa was the only thing that had any flavor.  The inside dining room is noisy and was only about 1/2 full for during our dinner time visit.  The outside patio looked like the place to be - it is beautiful - but it was a little too chilly to eat outside.  

They do have a lunch menu with entress priced at $8 compared to an average of $15 for dinner.  I would be hard pressed to recommend this place and we will not be returning - Serranos which is right across the street has better food.
