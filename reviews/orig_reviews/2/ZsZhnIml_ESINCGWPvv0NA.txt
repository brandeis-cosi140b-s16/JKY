This is our first time to this location and we noticed the same lady from the original location several years ago.
She was super attentive, friendly, and fast.
The food was not impressive as the original location on Decatur.
The fish, calamari, and pork belly were dry and bland in taste. The 4 sauces to add for flavor were delicious,  but it didn't do any good to the dry factor..The beef and kim chee fried rice was too wet and over bearing of kim chee.
We will not go back.
