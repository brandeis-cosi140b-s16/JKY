We were in the mood for seafood but wanted something a little different. The description of this place sounded perfect - a fusion of Brazilian, Asian and Mexican fare. 

The menu was all over the place and seemed like they had trouble deciding on what to emphasize - so they tried to do a little of everything. There was only one other table seated in the restaurant and we thought that was a little strange for 6:15pm on a Sunday evening. We opted for counter service and took advantage of the daily special which was 3 Tacos and a Beer for $10. 

We were given a number and told that the bartender would bring us our beers. A few minutes later, the beers arrived and the bartender set them down and walked away without saying a word. We didn't get a "Hi", "Welcome" or "Kiss My Ass"...Nothing.

The food arrived and I asked for some spicy salsa. The server was nice, prompt and accommodating. Hubby got Chicken Tacos and I got Carne Asada. The ingredients were fresh and the spicy salsa was nice and smokey. Other than that, it was just OK. Nothing to come back for. Nothing that I would recommend to anyone. Just OK.
