I was so excited to try this place yesterday! It has been on my list so since me and the bf had a night off we decided to try it. It's right near my house so I was hoping for a new hangout..

It was busy when we walked in and smelled great. We ordered frito pie, a green pork tamale, 2 red enchiladas, a side of green stew, a side tossed salad and sopapilla. It took about 25 minutes for our food, and it came out cold. The frito pie was complete mush in the center, like it had been sitting for a few hours, so gross.Why would you make something like that in advance so it is mushy?? 

The enchiladas were good once you got past the sauce. The red sauce tastes like ketchup with a bit of chiles but you get a whole bunch so I guess that makes up for it. My tamale was really old, I kept trying to cut it and it was just hard all on the outside. I was sad about this, I love tamales, and it was just gross. Also, when I cut into it there was maybe a teaspoon of meat and thats it. My salad dressing was off and really sour. We decided the 20 bucks was worth finding out we didn't like it, threw our food away and went to another place close by for dinner.

The reason for the second star was that the sopapilla (which the girl forgot and I had to go up and ask for, much to her irritation, which I didn't see why she was so irritated, the other girl was doing all the work while she sat behind the counter doing her makeup) was amazing and the green chili stew was ok. 

Maybe I caught them on an off day? Maybe I just didn't order the right stuff? Cause if this is authentic New Mexico food, I feel kinda bad for people who grow up on it.
