Will not be coming back. Food was fine - not great, not terrible. Server was nice, but only checked on us once, which is why we never got to order a second margarita and had to go to the bar to get a water, since there was never any brought to our table. However here's the real kicker, after our food was delivered we had to wait for five minutes to eat it since we were never given silverware and after tracking down a hostess,  we were told that it was in the dishwasher so we would have to wait, oh and though we did get forks - the knives never arrived as they were still washing - cutting my steak meat with a fork was great.
