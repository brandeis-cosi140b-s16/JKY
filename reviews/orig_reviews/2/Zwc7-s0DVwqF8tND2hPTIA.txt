Authentic is not a word that I would use to even remotely describe this food. The only seasoning used is SALT! The food is extremely bland and very generic. I'm extremely surprised of those who wrote good reviews. I wanted to give it a chance and really let the extra 1/2 star convince me and my friends to try this place while visiting Vegas. 

The only reason i gave YOLO two stars is because of the drinks and the service. The house margaritas were only $5 and pretty strong and tasty! The service was also really good, but unfortunately not good enough to make up for the subpar food. 

I just hope that those who dine here do not at all expect to eat authentic Mexican food and I'm pretty disappointed in myself that I have it a shot. 

Sorry YOLO!
