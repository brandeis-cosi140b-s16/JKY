Looking at the other reviews I think that maybe I came on an off day. Though I do think it's kinda interesting that there is such a things as "Mexican-American" food... wouldn't it just be American food? Or "Food of the Americas", I like that better....

Anhyoo, the food was only ok, and I was the only customer at the time so you'd figure I'd get better service. But the plus was the drink. So if you're in the mood to go to a bar and the Heart Bar is too busy, go to Yolos for a drink, but skip the beans and salsa.

Enjoy a Martini for me!
