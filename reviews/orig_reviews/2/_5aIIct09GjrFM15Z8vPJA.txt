Ambiance was nice.  Went there for lunch, it was dead, waitress took 10 minutes to come over.  Margarita tasted like a Slurpee- now dn't get me wrong, everyone likes a Slurpee but not for 12 bucks and alcohol is a rumor.  They praised their guac dip but it had no flavor- it is missing some diablo spice.  Lunch was average,  you would think of a name like Diablo's there would be some heat to the food.  Maybe they should call it Chili's but then again, they use more spice.  And that is not saying much
