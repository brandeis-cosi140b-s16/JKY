So I am beginning to think that we all have our dive restaurants that we just can't let go of.  We hold on dearly to the early memories of salivation and desire.  As we continue to pass through the doorway of the dive, we ignore the stench of mildew only dreaming of the yummy dish of yesteryear that we fought crosstown traffic to get to.  The worst is when we brag to our friends about the "best" place for_______ only to discover that we are just exposing our weaknesses and opposition to change.  Perhaps you aren't that person but I have had an awakening of sorts with Chapalas and realize I am a Dive Lover.  For years, I have gone back to my old school Mexican paradise for the ever so greasy enchiladas and a few Dos Equis.  In fact, I am beginning to feel the desire welling in my mouth.  It wasn't until my last visit that I began to remove my beer goggles and see it for what it really is....a dump aka dive.  The place is a Vegas native so to speak and I would assume that they could afford to spruce things up a bit....please Chapala's do something.  The smell, the occasional tiny creature running across the floor, and the overly greasy food has now got me rethinking my standards.  Am I now becoming a food snob or is it that my standards for cleanliness have now reached a healthier level?  I feel certain that I will cave in to my weakness and give it another shot....I am a junky.  I sure hope that they feel my energy as I send out the message..." a good Spring cleaning is in order!"
