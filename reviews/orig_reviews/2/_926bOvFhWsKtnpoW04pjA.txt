The food was fine, think chevy's quality, but I wouldn't eat here again nor would I recommend it, so two stars. 

-Guacamole: large portion, was brought to our table ice cold; either avocados were in the freezer, or guac was made in the morning & refridgerated. Taste was decent, but I couldn't tell til it thawed. 
-Chicken taqutos: again crazy portion sizes; fat, thick rolled tacos. Ends were crisp & tasty, middle was soggy. 
- Tacos: disn't take more than a bite of each. Fish taco tasted like a frozen fish stick, & was kind of fishy. Crispy taco w/ shredded beef was just huge & salty & greasy. 

Obviously, quantity over quality is the name of the game here. 

Waitress was overwhelming. We were one of three parties there before noon & she annoyingly showered us with attention, asking every 5 minutes, "and how are things tasting?" I was polite & didn't tell her. 

I'm seeing a pattern with vegas eateries: as long as a restaurant doesn't completely suck, they're bestowed a near-perfect four-star rating. That rating system doesn't work for me.
