Walked by here the previous day and the place was packed with a line out the door. We figured it must be good. I made a reservation for the next day, we arrived and had to wait for a few minutes while they cleared the table. Had great seats by the window. Then the wait came. We received a glass of water and then waited. We seen the server buzzing around but evidently we were invisible. Finally she came by and I wanted a margarita. Went for strawberry on the rocks. It was very sweet and hard to explain the taste. Not very good but drinkable. I went for loaded steak tacos. Ok this made up for other things. They were very good and all the toppings were fresh. The guacamole was very good. Service did improve but the evening could have been better.
