The food here is mediocre at best.  For the price of this place, I'm expecting authentic Mexican cuisine.  What I got?  A plate full of over-salted meat.  I've tried this place 3 times now, trying to give it a fair chance, but I just don't have anything nice to say about it.  They obviously aren't familiar with cooking Mexican cuisine because I got no hints of herbs and spices typically used.  Everything is over-salted to make up for the bland food.  I walked away each time with a throbbing headache from the mass amounts of salt I consumed.  I think that because this place is sandwiched within the Biltmore shopping center, people think the place is good.  But trust me, you're better off saving your money and finding somewhere better to eat.
