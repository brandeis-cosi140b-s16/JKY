This establishment used to have excellent service and food, but sadly this has not been the case the last few times I have visited El Encanto. I am in no means picky with what I eat, and I am not comparing 5 star meals to a place such as this, but their Plato Burro consisted of a few strands of dry meat shoved into a cold tortilla. The rice was cold, beans microwaved, and the server came around to the table once every twenty minutes or so. The only thing that prevents this place from having 1 star in my book is the pretty duck pond, and their salsa is very good. Avoid this place and head somewhere else if you want good mexican food.
