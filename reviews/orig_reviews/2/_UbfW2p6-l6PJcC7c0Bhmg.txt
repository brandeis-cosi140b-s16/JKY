I am a big fan of Taco Tuesday. BUT thats about it.  Chips and salsa yum!  $1.25 tacos awsome.  However I have yet to find something that isnt fried or "heart attack on a plate".  Of all the times Ive been there for dinner I have clearly forgotten that I didnt like it the last time.  Stickin to Taco Tuesdays only....The shredded beef ones are the best! :)
