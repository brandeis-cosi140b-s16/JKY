I've been coming here for a few years, always loved the carne asada burritos but over the last few months the quality and consistency of the food has been fluctuating.  

Today was the last time I'll go unfortunately.  I am very sensitive to liver and kidney flavors and there was definitely something wrong with the meat today.  Far worse than its been before.  I almost threw up because of the pungent taste.  

Why two stars?  Because maybe it was just bad meat today or cross contamination with some other meats.  Sorry Burrito Shack, I won't be coming back.
