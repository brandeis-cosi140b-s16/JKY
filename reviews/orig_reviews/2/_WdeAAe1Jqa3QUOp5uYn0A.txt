I've been to Cantina 1511 about 5 few times now and I have to say I have mixed feelings about it.

The food is wonderful. It's creative and classic and delicious. The salsa is some of the best I've had in Charlotte and being from Southern AZ this is a big deal.

My mixed feelings come from the service. I have yet to have good service at Cantina 1511. The waitstaff seems confused by the menu, today my server asked ME questions about the menu. When I am there I feel like I am always waiting for something. 

It is a shame because the food is really good and I love the atmosphere but if I am going to be paying $15 bucks for tacos I expect the service to be worth it.
