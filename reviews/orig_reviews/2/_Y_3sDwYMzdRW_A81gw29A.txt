When eating a meal on "The Strip" one would assume that the service and food are above par.  Sadly this is not the case for Diablo's Cantina.  The service was lacking and there was no sense of urgency or follow up...it took almost 20 minutes for us to even be acknowledged and we were sitting at the bar/counter.  When we finally found a server and asked for a menu, the response was a finger point and a mummbled "ask the bartender, not me".  When the food made its appearance it was bland and lacking any spice and flavor.  Overall I the experience at Diablo's was a let down and I will most likely never return or suggest it to visitors.
