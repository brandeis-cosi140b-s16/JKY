Food was generally acceptable, but...
Service was slow and snarky.
The soda machine was broken so you could only have tap water or a $10 Margarita. WTF?
You have to pay for chips. The salsa spread was unique, but one of the salsas looked like earwax. Mango puree?
Still, it beats waiting in line for the buffet. Hint: If you need to sit on the floor to rest while you're waiting in line for a buffet, you shouldn't be waiting in line for a buffet. Try Yolos!
