Used to love this place but every time I go now, the service and quality just plain suck. 

The last 3 times I have bought  guac from them, labels, slices of skin and brown guac are what I get. I used to really love their guac but I can't even bring myself to purchase it again.

The service that I get is just getting worse and worse. The kids they used to hire were really cool and respectful, now they are nothing but jack asses. 

I used to love this place but as of today I won't be returning. It's a shame because I know the family used to take pride in their food and service.
