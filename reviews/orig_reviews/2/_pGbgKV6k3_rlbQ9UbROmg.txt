I've visited this place 2 times. The first time they were new so I wanted to give them a chance to work their kinks out. The service was what you want when you go out to eat so that was another reason for me to give it a second shot. Both times I was not impressed with the tacos. I give them credit for trying to do something unique and special with the menu like a Thai taco and duck taco, however the delivery falls short. The first time I went my tacos were cold and the second time they were just warm, but almost like they had been sitting out too. The service still remained likeable, but I could hear that they hadn't done away with their mish mash of music which had no cohesiveness from country to oldies to pop. Don't get me wrong I do like different types of music, but they had nothing really similar that it was just distasteful. The building itself is beautiful and well done. This place really could be great, but for now it's just as okay spot, with slightly pricy food that I don't see myself returning to.
