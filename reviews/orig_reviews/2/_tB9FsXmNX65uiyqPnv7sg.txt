I'm giving this place two stars because the prices of the meals were way to over priced, especially for okay food. I got huevos rancheros and... Never again... Hahaah. I will say that the server was very nice though! I got the melon margarita which was delicious, and he let me try the banana margarita too. Soooo I might go back to try the different flavored margaritas which are pricy too, but that's about it.
