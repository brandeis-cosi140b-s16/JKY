katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.

let me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar. 

 i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink. 

katie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked,
"are you going to get a drink?"
"ya, if he ever comes back" was her response

then i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point. 

another 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips. 

then we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread! 

so our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.

then, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming

the chips and salsa were not good. 
my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.

if you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.

2 stars for service
