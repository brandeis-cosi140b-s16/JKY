Ok I'm just going to break it down:
1. What mexican restaurant doesn't have carnitas?
2. No complimentary chips and salsa with order.
3. Rice is very bland
4. Tamales covered in a green cream sauce, I'm used to the chili verde type. I should have ordered the 'sauce' on the side.
5. Beans were good.

I don't think I will go back any time soon. My palet for authentic mexican food apparently is needing more. There are too many restaurants around here to choose this one. Lo siento Compadres.
