We wanted an actual sit-down breakfast before our flight, not just fast food. Jose Cuervo Tequileria was supposed to open at 7:00am, but we waited until almost 7:15 for them to open the doors. We had a friendly waitress, and I appreciated that they had the full menu available from the get go.

I ended up ordering Carne Asada and Huevos, which is slated as sliced steak, scrambled eggs, pico de galo, tortillas, and home fries. It was a pretty cheap cut of meat, but was at least seasoned well. That being said, it tasted more boiled than grilled. The accompanying eggs were fairly ho hum, and the home fries were most assuredly frozen. 

Maybe we should have gone to Burger King instead...
