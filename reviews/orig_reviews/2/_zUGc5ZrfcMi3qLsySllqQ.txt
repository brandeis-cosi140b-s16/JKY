Could not belive our experience last night!  Went to the local Cafe Rio about 9:15 on Friday and the place was not very busy.  When I went to get my beverage, both the horchata and strawberry drink dispensers were empty.  Not even a spurt for the fountain sprayer.  And  this is despite most of the staff walking by the empty dispenser as they got their own drinnks and took their breaks.

I told the cashier that the horchata machine was empty and I would like some.  She said "ok", but after nearly 10 minutes there was still no horchata in the machine.  When I approached the cashier to see if they would be filling the machine, she SHOUTED at me, "I KNOW"  Could not believe (a) that they would let the drink machines run out while the restaurant was still open and (b) that the staff were so poorly trained that they would shout at customers.

Tenty minutes after arriving and as we were finishing our meal, they finally put some horchata in the machine.  As I went to get a sip before leaving, it was readily apparent that no one cared enough to also fill the strawberry drink.

Food may be convenient, but service and training are certainly lacking.  Pollo Loco started very well but customer service after the were sold by Winchells made them a much-lesser pick.  Afraid Cafe Rio is going the same direction.  Great when they only had a few stores, but sadly they are totally losing control as they rapidly expand.
