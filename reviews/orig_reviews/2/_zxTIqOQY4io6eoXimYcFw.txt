I went here about a month ago and it was not a good experience. I went on a saturday night with a group of about 6 girls. We wanted to get some drinks, but we were unable to because the place was so crowded, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one (don't know how good the drinks may be). In the 20 minutes we were there I was hit in the head with a belt buckle (someone was swinging it.... really?!?!), my foot was stomped on, and a beer was poured on me. Not my kind of place at all. I would never come back, sorry guys.
