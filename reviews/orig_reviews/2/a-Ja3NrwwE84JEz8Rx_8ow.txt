Grade of C at best. Was looking for a neighborhood Mexican restaurant, and decided to try. Barely slid in to the booth and the waiter was standing there asking for a drink order-didn't have a moment to look so way to quick on the approach. Was back quickly again with a "ready to order"-no smile, no personality, no interest. Feeling rushed, made a quick dinner and drink selection. The cocktail and tableside guac were flavorful, but that is where the flavor stopped. The blandest and most visually unappealing beans( a soupy flavorless paste) and bland rice accompanied my cognac chicken and mushrooms-generous portion but devoid of any interest. Prices are moderate, but dont waste your precious date nite or money dining here. I won't.
