A friend and I sat at the bar for lunch. We had the baja tacos. 3 battered tacos with rice and black beans. The tacos were very good- the flour tortilla seemed home made. Overall, we were fairly impressed with the food. It is the service that left us unimpressed. The girl behind the bar was more interested in talking to her friends than serving us.  I had to flag her down, first, to get a menu, and then to order, and then to get a refill on my empty ice tea. After I asked her for an ice tea refill, she then actually went back over to the guy she was talking to and actually
finished her story - before getting the refill.  She tried to force a couple smiles to save things once she knew we were not happy with her service, but mostly acted like she wanted no part of being there. We were finished, and then waited at least 10 minutes for her finally to ask if we needed our ticket. Then she gave us the wrong ticket.... These type of people do not belong as the main bartender - they can definitely ruin your business.  Tacos and 2 ice teas with tip (which honestly she did not deserve) was $40. Next time, I will go to Rubio's...
