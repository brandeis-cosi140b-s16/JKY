The three salts with the excellent chips was a great start, but it was all downhill from there.  Yeah, yeah: Texan bias, but this place was slow + expensive + bleah.  Caveat:  only had appetizers, so the main dishes could be worth the raves.  

But the appetizer sampler was pretty dismal:  La Choy - level empanadas, torta things that were really stiff and chewy, and flautas that were passable.  Okay service once they found a table in the empty restaurant.  Drinks:  good, but that is not a problem in Vegas if you have $14 and a drivers license.

I'd skip it and try something else.  Even Nathan's hot dogs has better bang for your buck.
