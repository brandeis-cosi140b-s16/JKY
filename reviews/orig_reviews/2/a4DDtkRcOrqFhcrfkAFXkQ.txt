Maybe the trick here is not to use the drive-thru. I thought it would be wildly convenient, but it took 15 minutes to get my simple order, without apology or explanation. Menu is straight forward: tacos and burritos with all of the expected meats, small seafood selection and some quesadillas, and that's about it. 

Staff may or may not speak English so bust out your best high school Spanish. While you wait in the drive-thru, enjoy watching the staff make their own meals or snacks and eat them, then return to work without using gloves or washing their hands. As you wait for your own order, forgotten by the cashier.

Lengua junior burrito is well-sized but literally consists of just lengua and cheese. Probably a better option than ordering several separate tacos, if you're going to get them with all the same meat. The lengua itself was soft and flavorful and delicious, but the taste got boring after half of the burrito. Alas, I had not been given any salsas, dios mio!

Ceviche tostadas is two crispy shells and a small-looking portion of fish in a Styrofoam cup with avocado slices. Fish was fresh and had good flavor- simply seasoned with sal, pepino, y limon, but it really worked, especially with the creaminess of the avocado.
