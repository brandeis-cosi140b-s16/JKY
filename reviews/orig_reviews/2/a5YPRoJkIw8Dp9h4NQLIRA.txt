Without the fun mariachi band, this place would have gotten one star.

While we were seated right away, we didn't get a server for at least twenty minutes. Even tough we did get chips and salsa, we were waiting so long for service that we went through the chips and had to serve ourselves another basket. 

Once we finally flagged down a server, we got to order. The food took at least another twenty minutes to arrive. And three of us just got the quesadilla! 

Now, the food. When a quesadilla is on the menu for $8, it's typically enough for a meal. The quesadilla was one corn tortilla with some cheese and like three pieces of meat. It was so small that it made the price offensive -- and it wasn't even that good! 

To add to such a bad experience, three of the five people ended up with stomach aches. I would not recommend this place at all, especially given the fact that Burger Bar is next door and is about the same price.
