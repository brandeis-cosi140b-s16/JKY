There was a time when I was a regular here. Not anymore! Once again, I end up with a terrible server. This is the closest place for me to meet my daughters and grandchildren for lunch as I work nearby. But, once I again I had to leave and have my lunch packed to go. The server was rude and very obviously frazzled. This place has a serious staffing problem. I just don't understand why they can't get pleasant and qualified staff.
