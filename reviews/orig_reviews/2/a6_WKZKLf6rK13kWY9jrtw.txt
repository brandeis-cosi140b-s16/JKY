I frequent Lindo every now and again as it is my son's favorite Mexican place.

I will admit that I have never had any dish that was bad. I like the salsa (although they could offer more types) and the bean dip. The chips are usually a little over done and need salt IMO.  I do like the fideo soup..it is a nice change.   

The Margaritas are not impressive and I am sure I do better with one eye open missing an arm so that is a letdown as I crave good margaritas and will choose where I go alot of the time on them as sometimes I just want a drink and chips/salsa. 

The service here is always amazing I will give them that but this is the only location I go to as I refuse to go the the GV location as it looks like a damn nightclub all the time it is so packed.

So final judgment is not an impressive place and another place that is over-hyped by people with no taste for what quality food should be
