First time here and the facility is actually very impressive inside and out. I also noted how incredibly clean everything was including the restroom. Service was just ok. Server brought out chips and 4 salsas. I would expect the server to take 8 seconds to explain what they were instead of having to guess. Wife had lunch chimi day it was ok. Kid quesadilla was cold. I ordered chorizo chicken. It was rather good but the portion size was stupid small. Like a half a breast. It felt like a typical corporate menu item downsized for cost. It was more an appetizer portion. Host staff was really unfriendly. When I got there I went to restroom to wash my hands and blonde host said nothing on way in and out. 2nd restroom visit Hispanic female looked up and gave me eye contact and said nothing as she went back to reading whatever she had at the podium. I always feel the host staff is super important as they are the restaurant ambassadors and the first and last impression. No Nothing is ever good enough for you with me Michael.need to be so unfriendly. 

Probably wont go back..to many other options around town with that food genre.
