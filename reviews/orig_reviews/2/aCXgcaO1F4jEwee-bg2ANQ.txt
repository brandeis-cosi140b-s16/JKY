In the famous words of Chuck D and Flavor Flave "don't believe the hype."

For years our friends of been raving about this place.  We have heard people call this the "best Mexican restaurant in Madison" and other people call it the "absolute best Mexican food period."   So after a couple years of wanting to try this place...we finally did.

I cannot complain about the aesthetics...it is a cute little place without all the traditional bright colors....but thats where the good ends.

FIRST OFF:   How can you have a Mexican Restaurant that does not serve Margaritas?    Really?   When I want to devour a burritos I want some Tequila and Lime to go with it.   Even if it is the pre-made junk.

SECOND:  The food was bland.....about as bland as bland can be.   My wife ordered a Chicken Quesadilla as she always does at Mexican restaurant and it literally had ZERO taste.    Heck she had to use all of the salsa form the chips to even remotely get a flavor to it.   Oh...and speaking of chips....they are complete straight out of the bag store bought terrible chips.  Even Laredo's has better chips....well...actually they have better food all together and that is saying a lot!

THRID:  Lets talk my burrito.   I decided to go a different route than my normal fajitas or taco salad and got myself a steak burrito.   OMG....this this was.....TERRIBLE!   The steak was as hard as a rock.  The burrito itself was even more bland than my wife's quesadilla and literally had NO TASTE AT ALL.   Worst part is she stole all the salsa and it took the rest of the meal to get more.

So...when heading up Park street and wanting Mexican food this place is a joke.   Traditional....sure but tasteless traditional and just...I would rather eat at Taco Bell.
