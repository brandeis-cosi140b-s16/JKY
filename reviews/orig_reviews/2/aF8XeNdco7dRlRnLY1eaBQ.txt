Nacho Daddy happens to have a vegan menu, which is awesome. The server we had was very nice but somehow my meal got mixed up and I ended up with something non-vegan. My friend from Vegas eats here all the time, she's a vegan and loves it but I wasn't impressed. Receiving the wrong meal kind of put me off and I didn't really enjoy the food either. It may have just been an off day but unfortunately, I can't give a good recommendation for it.
