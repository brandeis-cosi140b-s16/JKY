Love this place but the service sucks. I sat for 7 mins and did get any service. No water, just chips. They ran out of the cups for salsa and I just sat there. What a joke. I asked if I could place my order, the waiter just said yea, then walked away. So I continued to sit there. After what seemed to be 5 more minutes I just gave up. I left. What a shame too, I used to like this place. They need a better wait staff. Fail.
