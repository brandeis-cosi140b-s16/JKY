Mi Patio es su Patio. 

Actually- you can have it. It's not that great. I was attracted to it because of the $1.75 margaritas. Now I know why they are so cheap... where's the alcohol?!

I would pay more if I could have alcohol in my margarita. They should really change their sign to $1.75 lemonades. 

I do have to say that they have really good chips and salsa. The chips where broken and I had to fish around my bowl to find a full chip but when I did, it was perfect with the fresh, spicy salsa. 

Since I wasn't that hungry, my brother and I decided to just get munchies so we opted for the Supreme Appetizer ($18) which was a giant platter of lettuce, mini chimis, rolled flautas and a machaca salad in the middle. Honestly, I couldn't recognize anything but the flautas. It looked like a salad. The rolled tacos tasted like it was fried in warm oil because it was stale and not crunchy but the meat was good if that counts for anything.

I should have went across the street to the 24 hour Mexican food joint.
