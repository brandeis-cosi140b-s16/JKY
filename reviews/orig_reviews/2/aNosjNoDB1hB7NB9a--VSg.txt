I loves me some fresh salsa... that said, we sat down and were immediately served chips and salsa. The red salsa looked like spiced ketchup and I was immediately worried. The green salsa looked like it would taste good but unfortunately neither was anything to write home about. The red was so bad that I didn't want to actually eat any of their food and the green just wasn't good enough to try anything else out. Hubby had a mojito which was good, minty and refreshing but that was about all that we were willing to try after the salsa. It's salsa, you can't really get it wrong, it's that easy! 
One star for fast / good service and another star for good chips and a good mojito :)
