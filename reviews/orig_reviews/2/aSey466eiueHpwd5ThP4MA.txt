I wanted a chicken quesadilla for lunch today so my husband went to get me one. When I got home I started eating it and discovered it tasted weird. I opened it up and there was NO chicken and barely any cheese . I called them and the girl said they would remake it and I asked for sour cream on the side. They even made my husband return the messed up one I had already bit into. He gets home this time they didn't give me sour cream . I gave up at that point . Doubt I will go back .
