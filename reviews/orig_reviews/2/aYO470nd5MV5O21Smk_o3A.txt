Okay, I've had two experiences here both different.  The first was excellent.  Awesome service, good food, delicious margaritas.

The second time I brought some out of town friends and it failed to impress.  Service was lackluster, the food was okay so I guess I should just stick to what I had the first visit if I go back.
