I'm Mexican-American, Arizona native-born and raised here.  Excuse me, the owner is Greek origin.  He doesn't really know what "real" Mexican food taste like and the people he hires are "fly by night" cooks.  I've experienced better quality Mexican food elsewhere because here it's not only very expensive, they used the same ingredients in their soups but change meats.  Burritos, combos, appetizers, soups, signature seafood, breakfast combos and burritos are small and too expensive.  It's no wonder nobody notices because most patrons are too drunk to see the price is too high.  Tacos are the only reasonably-priced menu items that are worth having.  There are better authentic Mexican restaurants nearby, such as, Herrera's, Valle de Luna, and original Garcia's on 35th Ave & south of McDowell Rd (with music).  The decorations they have is overwhelming and looks like they are hoarding them but most everyone is too drunk to notice.  They hired girls who dress a bit SLEAZY to get the patrons to buy more drinks.  What happen to this place, the owner got greedy and needs money.  What is with the 3-5 star ratings!  Are you blind!  Oh, yeah and they are now so s-l-o-w, it took them 35 minutes to make two lousy fish tacos.  Who they hired beginner cooks!  And they put up phony food photos, the portions are much smaller.  Any reviews prior to spring of 2013 are way better than after the summer of 2013.
