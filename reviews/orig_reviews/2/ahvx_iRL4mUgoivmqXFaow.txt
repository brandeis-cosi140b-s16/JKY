We visited Chuy's on whim since the line at Cowfish was ridiculous. Common occurrence, right?

Out of our party of four adults and one child, no one was impressed enough to return. 

Pros: wait time was decent, server was friendly, atmosphere was interesting, food was truly Tex Mex and spicy!

Cons: margaritas were crammed with ice and were gone in three small sips, no beer on tap, guacamole was served on a huge bed of lettuce to appear like you were getting a decent amount (you weren't), everyone's plate of food came out a ton of rice/beans and not a lot of substance, prices were high.

I had the Baja shrimp tacos which was really just a few pieces of shrimp on a tortilla with about a teaspoon of sauce. No flavor. Nothing special.

We won't be returning. Even if the line at Cowfish is ridiculous.
