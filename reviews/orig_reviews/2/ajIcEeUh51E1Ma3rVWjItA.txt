Touted as the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas by my date. We were around here for First Friday and all the other restaurants had an hour to an hour and a half wait. Mexican is never my first choice when it comes to dining options. 

For starters, we got the cheese dip to go with their salsa and bean dip. This is the highlight of the whole meal. I would have been happy to order a few bowls of this and a side of guacamole as my entree. Instead, I got sampler plate. It consisted of a tamale, enchilada, and a taco. I did the pork in red sauce, chicken enchilada, and beef taco. The meat was dry on all three. At this point, I was full anyways.

The margaritas are good. A little more on the sweet side than I would like, but a squeeze of the lime wheel helps. They come in two sizes, regular and the large. You might as well do the fish bowl, because life is better with more alcohol.
