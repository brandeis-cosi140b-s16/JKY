Had some take out from the Durango/215 location(formerly Sliding Thru) and the food was excellent.  Delicious, steak and kalua pork burritos...pretty big portions! My 18 month old daughter's kalua pork taco had so much meat, it was enough for 2 meals!!
Not to mention extremely friendly staff! We were excited to come back. We figured "If take out was this good, maybe dining in would be even better!"

Fast forward to today-

We get inside the restaurant and discover that it's a Chipotle style assembly line kind of deal. No biggie...if the foods delicious, I don't mind!  We order bowls this time instead of burritos.  Big bowls...skimpy portions. Our bowl was BARELY 2/3 full. If that's your portion size...please get an appropriate size bowl!!  My daughter got the same taco from last week but  this time it was a pathetic, anorexic version of the one from last week. Maybe a spoonful of meat. They charge $3 for a kids taco and APPARENTLY $1 more for meat. That's $4 for basically nothing!  Not to mention the menu was confusing as hell in regards to the kids taco. I'm sure we're not the only ones to find it confusing and a bit of a rip off. Now what happened in a week to cause this drastic change? The staff wasn't nearly as nice as before. Although the manager did try to remedy the situation and gave us a refund on the taco.  The food wasn't nearly was good as before. Bland, and not very hot.  I'm especially bummed because this was our "cheat" meal after eating healthy all week. Last week I was going to be a regular customer...after today...not so much...

P.S. Hawaiian food is supposed to  be tasty, big portions of deliciousness. The portions today were for the price they charge... Insulting...
