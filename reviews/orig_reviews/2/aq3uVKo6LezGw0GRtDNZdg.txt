Two stars for extreme inconvenience. The food was ehhh. I've had better asada fries at home. The layout for this place is just plain stupid. There's different lines for different meats and if u accidentally get in the wrong line, because it isn't really obvious that u have to stand in a certain line for specific food, you may be turned away and asked to stand in a much longer line. It's ridiculous. We sat inside and every time you need to refill your drink or get napkins, whatever, you have to fight through people waiting in lines. After you order and get your food, it's then you go across the room to pay for it. They're asking for shady people to walk out the door without paying. Whoever designed that place needs to never design another establishment.
