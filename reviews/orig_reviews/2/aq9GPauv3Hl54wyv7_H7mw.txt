The Tee Pee is not so bueno.  It does have a cool old school Arizona vibe that's hard to come by.  The decor is totally quirky.  It was amusing to watch parties of six sit in side-by-side booths for four and two.  The BF and I got  the "privilege" of sitting at the George W. Bush table.  Putting lame duck politics aside, the food was pretty lame as well. 

The chips were greasy and the salsa was bland.  The Albondigas Soup was the best part of the meal.  The meatballs were tasty (but sparse) and the chicken broth was nicely spicy.  The fajitas left much to be desired.  The beef and chicken were both over- cooked while the onions were nearly raw.  The portions were okay for lunch, but they would be lacking for dinner (and we didn't order off of a lunch menu).  

This place has a downscale touristy vibe.  I watched a group of six take multiple pictures of themselves in the quirky booths and of the food.  Perhaps they want the pictures for an exhibit of what Mexican food looked like in the US in the 1950s.

Time has marched on from the Tee Pee.  For wallet-friendly Mexican, check out Mi Patio on 7th Avenue.  For gourmet Mexican, head over to Barrio Cafe on 16th Street.
