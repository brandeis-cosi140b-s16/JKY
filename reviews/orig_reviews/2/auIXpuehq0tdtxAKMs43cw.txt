The service is so poor here. I waited in line behind two people for at least 15 minutes. The food is good but don't come here hungry because you'll be waiting. Just saying.  Back a second time and the service still sucks. Where is the management here? Tables are dirty, too many people on the line, too many people standing around doing nothing. Clean your act up or this is my last time here.
