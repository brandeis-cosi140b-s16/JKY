Was not impressed.

This restaurant is located in a trendy shopping plaza, surrounded by trendy and boutique stores.  I should not have been surprised by the dining experience but I was.

The restaurant smelled of fish, not pleasant cooked or spicy fish, but just plain fish.  If I had been eating at the pier this would have been ok, but even after I got home that evening my clothes even smelled like fish.

The food was supposed to be trendy mexican, but I got more of a hipster feel from it.  They just tried too hard.  The salsa's had a little flavor but were not unique.  The appetizers had great presentation but again the flavor was not unique (coconut calamari and guacamole sol).  The salad (ensalada sol) was not memorable.  The street tacos; chicken was dry, the pork was greasy and SALTY, I stayed away from the beef.

The server forgot my dessert.

Wouldn't recommend it, won't return to it.
