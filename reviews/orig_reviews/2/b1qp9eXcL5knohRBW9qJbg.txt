Salsa was wonderful!  But nothing else.. Chicken enchiladas tasted like stewed chicken sitting in a pot all day and then put in small floured tortillas and added bland sauce. 4 or 5 for 18 bucks??
The 3 crispy fish tacos were over cooked, no sauce in them with stale floured tortillas.   
We were disappointed. 
Atmosphere was nice.
