Hadn't been here for years and was craving fajitas.......Not what I remembered...The steak for the fajitas was overcooked and very tough. Looked like a few pepper slices mixed with a whole onion. My wife got the chicken chili relleno. It came drenched in cheese that was actually soupy at the bottom. We found a tiny amount of chicken after scraping away all the excess cheese. I give it 2 stars.....1 for the service and 1 because I ate it.
