Good customer service, but such a long time for the wait.  Food was dry and bad flavor combination,  I rarely give bad reviews, but for our 13 people bachelor's party, less than half were happy with our food.  It was a busy day, so we believe they waited for all the food to be ready and then brought it all out.  What a weird taste combination and dried meats.
