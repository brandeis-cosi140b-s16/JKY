went here with a few friends from out of town. came during happy hour and wasn't impressed. slow service. hardly any smiles. not so great margaritas. they were actually pretty bland. not strong, but not even sweet. something was off with them. didn't try much of the food but the unlimited chips and salsa were alright. a little too salty on some chips, but eh, better than the drinks.
i'd be willing to give it a 2nd chance because i had some friends that said they enjoyed it. maybe i got them on an off day, but they weren't even busy.
