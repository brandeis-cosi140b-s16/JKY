This place is gorgeous with a hip, trendy ambience.  Service is spot on, our server was really good.  But, alas, the food....bland, boring, just not good.  It should be exciting and wonderful, Asian/Mexican fusion....dreaming of sweet and spicy, but instead just sweet.  So much fruit, not enough spice.  This place really needs to work on their food, I was extremely disappointed and underwhelmed.
