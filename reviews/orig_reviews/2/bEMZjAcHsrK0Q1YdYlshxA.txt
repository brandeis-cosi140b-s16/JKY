Stopped by the Scottsdale Some Burros tonight, I asked the girl if the verde scramble was vegetarian. She said yes, except that it came with refried beans, and they had lard in them. She said I could substitute whole beans for the refried at no extra charge. Great, except that when I got home, I saw that I was charged an additional $1.75 for the whole beans. To make it even worse, I didn't get whole beans, I had the refried beans.
 
They've  just lost a customer. We won't be back.
