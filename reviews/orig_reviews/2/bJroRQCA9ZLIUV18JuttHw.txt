The food was good but the waitress was passive aggressive and condescending. The wine was corked but we did not mention because we were getting dirty looks for asking questions. She was annoyed by every question and did not explain the specials to half of our group that arrived two minutes later than the first group and treated them like idiots when they asked questions. The disdain and eye rolling reminded us of our worst experience in Paris. We've never submitted a bad review before.
