More pleasing to the eyes then taste buds.  The $9 ice cream scoop of guacamole was very tasty and the margarita was delicious...the filet mignon chile relleno  was probably the worst thing I have ever tasted...for real, and the chiliean sea bass was okay enough ..kinda fishy though.  So beautiful surroundings and good service but expensive and unpleasant tasting food.... Sorry I really wanted to like this restaurant.  I have never written a review before....that's how bad the filet mignon chile relleno was...tasted like they poured some Tommy Rockers chile on it.
