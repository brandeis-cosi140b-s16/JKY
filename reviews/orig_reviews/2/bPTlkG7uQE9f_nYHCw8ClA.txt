Service has really gone down in this place.  You have to ask for your coffee refill and they did not bring all of my breakfast at one time had to wait 5 minutes for my tortillas and by that time the eggs and chorizo were cold.  Not a good experience which is sad as the food is usually great and it's one of my favorite breakfast spots.  Looks like it might be time to find a new one
