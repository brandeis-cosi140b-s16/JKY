I wish I could say I liked it, but not so much; however,  it's an interesting concept.  

First of all, it's hard to find (that's why they call it Dick's Hideaway...DUH!).  It's really dim on the inside.  The epitome of Southwestern style.  If you walk in and go to the area on the right, there is a huge table that can fit about 10 people, so you would probably be sitting with some strangers.  I don't mind because I like meeting new people.  

Anyways, the plates are not shareable (it says so on the menu that sharing is not allowed), which I don't understand because their plates are huge!  I don't like wasting food.

Also, I had the carne adovada, and it wasn't that awesome.  The portion was huge, the meat was too salty.  I wasn't a fan.  

The place just has a nice ambiance to it. 

The food, not so much.
