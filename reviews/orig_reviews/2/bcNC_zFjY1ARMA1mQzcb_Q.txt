There's nothing terrible about this restaurant, the food is tasty most entrees were covered heavily in cheese (not my thing) the perfect storm margarita $7.50 or so was quite tasty my pork tacos meat was dry my wife had a stuffed chile relleno (smotherd in cheese) once she removed the glob of cheese the chile was tasty the salsa tasted like picante sauce out of a jar service was good when our waiter brought us our check he had written have a blessed night.........WHAT.........i dont mix religion and drinking.......... to many really good mex restaurants in az to dine at a americanized version.........ps this was the new mesa location
