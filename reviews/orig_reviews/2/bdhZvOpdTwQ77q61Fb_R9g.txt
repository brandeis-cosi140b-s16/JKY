We came here for lunch and used a restaurant.com coupon.  With the coupon, the prices seemed ok, but the menu prices are high for the quality of the food.  I live in California, where we have access to tons of Mexican and "Mexican," so perhaps that colored my opinion.  

We ordered the quinoa fritters, which were a little oily but had a great flavor.  My husband and I split an order of three tacos and sides (you can mix from the tacos listed on the menu, which was a nice way to sample more).  We had the avocado (ok, kind of dry), the carnitas (pretty good, not exceptional), and the chicken panucho (extremely oily, no real flavor).  This came with beans and rice (red and green), which were ok.  This was easily enough for the two of us to share.  

Our dining companions ordered the three tacos (shrimp and Yucatan pork were both deemed "good," can't remember the third) and the Border Classics (chicken panuchos and some tamales and empanadas), which was also "good."  

There is a .50 charge for water, which I thought was odd; it included still or sparkling water.   Service was very good.
