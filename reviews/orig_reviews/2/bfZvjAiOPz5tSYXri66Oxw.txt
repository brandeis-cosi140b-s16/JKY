Not what I expected from this caliber of establishment. The service sucked. I requested items on several occasions, & received none. I ordered the shrimp & scallop dish. Shrimp was over-cooked and scallops were raw. They told me to scoot my scallops onto another plate to re-fire. Totally not right. Brought them back still under cooked. Really? Then they put on super spicy chilis onto the plate. I almost burnt my mouth off. Don't go there. You can do better!
