I've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met.

My comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc.

My comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more.

Lastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct!
