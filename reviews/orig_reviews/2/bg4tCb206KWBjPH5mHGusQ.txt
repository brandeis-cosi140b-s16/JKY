The staff were friendly and the place was clean. The service was also very fast. However, the food was not good. My husband got the pollo fundido and the chicken was undercooked. I got the chicken tacos and they had no taste to them. I will say the rice and beans were ok. I wasn't expecting high end restaurant quality food, but I figured this might be better than going to a traditional fast food restaurant. I was wrong.
