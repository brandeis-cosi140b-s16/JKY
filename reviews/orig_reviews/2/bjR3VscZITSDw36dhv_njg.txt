Second time there. Wasn't impressed the first time either, this time was free for n event but the only decent thing was the guac, the pollo tacos n mushroom tacos were pretty bad, was hoping for better but the el pastor taco kit at Costco is 10 times better......plus the place is way overpriced for what you get, bummer
