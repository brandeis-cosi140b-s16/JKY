they did have to deal with a lot of delayed flights/cancellations due to high winds. i'll give them that benefit for taking 15mins to get us a server. but damn, $36 for 2 drinks and no food? i know it's an airport and all and a Sonoma Cutrer should probably be marked up due to location, but, damn. i know it's limited at this end of the terminal, but, i may just have to paruse the lounges at the other end of the concourse. oh, the second star is for the fact you can get your drink To-Go now. Meh, I've experienced better.
