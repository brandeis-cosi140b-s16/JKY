It's "okay" but nowhere I would go on my own volition.  I've been here twice with coworkers and the service was pretty slow both times.  We've always had to have our food boxed up soon after it finally arrived.  I also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention.  The food was okay, but they're very heavy on the sauce and cheese.  My chicken enchilada was decent, but didn't blow me away, despite the "most authentic" praise others waxed about this place.

I also don't think the koi pool (it's not made to look like a rocky pond or anything natural) is very sanitary, so I'm subtracting a star for that.  It really should be an enclosed aquarium when it's right in the middle of a restaurant like that.

I'd go back with coworkers if this was where they wanted to go, but as for myself, I am sticking to Los Tacquitos.
