Very concerned for those who give this place a good review. Los taquitos is right across the street!!! I don't know what lil dicky dumbass is talking about, I couldn't eat my red Chile burro, it was horrible. The carne asada fries= soggy fries, cold cheese, and tough cold meat. No Pico, guac, sour cream.. Just cold hard grease!
