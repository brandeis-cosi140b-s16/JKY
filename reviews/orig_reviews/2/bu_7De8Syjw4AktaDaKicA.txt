Mediocre at best. 

This is your average Americanized Mexican place that is lacking in depth of flavor and quality but still likes to charge for it. The salsa is just meh and did not have any spice, the dishes we got were just ok and way way overpriced for the quality.  I even asked for spicy sauce with my tacos and I did not even have a lick of spice let alone flavor.  I could have made something better at home. 

The service was ok but the waiters act like they get extra commission for the more liquor they sell.  The table next to us was ordering margaritas and our server was milking them like a cow and he barely even asked if we were ok until we were done with our meal.  

I felt like I had a ton of bricks in my gut after eating here and felt blah just like the meal.  They also don't take American Express. Will not be going back that is for sure.  

If you want authentic Mexican food with lots of depth of flavor and spice, please visit Leticia's Mexican Cocina.  It is waaaay better for the same price. It's worth it.
