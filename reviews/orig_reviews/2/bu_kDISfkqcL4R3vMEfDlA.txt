*Just reviewing for the bar*

We had wandered in from The Strip looking for a nice bar to get a few drinks at. My homie was nice enough to buy everyone a round of Patron shots from the bar. It took a good five minutes for him to get noticed by any of the bartenders and it wasn't even terribly busy.

My main complaint? My Patron shot was warm. Yuck! Definitely not the way you want to drink Patron, All in all, not my favorite bar in the world. Hopefully, as a restaurant it's better.
