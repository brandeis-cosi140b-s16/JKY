Don't know how this place stays in business.   $35 bucks for two drinks.  There food is maybe one or 2 steps above Taco bell.   Only thing this place has going for it is the friendly bar tender we had and mildly amusing restaurant  decor.

Would not recommend eating here save your cash and go to taco bell.
