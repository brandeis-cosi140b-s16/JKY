I'm so sad writing this review because I had such high expectations. I blame my husband for talking up the place so much.

Totally overrated. Don't get me wrong, I'll eat anything, anywhere if it's good, so the totally sketched out location, and dive-y no frills decor (decor is the wrong word, there is no decor) didn't bother me. But I have to say, I've had vastly better Mexican food. We got the machaca hard tacos and the machaca was so bland. The chicken soft tacos were ok. The cheese enchilada was awful. The killer for me was the tortillas used in our dishes weren't fresh. Also, they ran out of tortillas which I wanted to purchase and I was bummed about that.

My husband, who used to work in the area and frequented Carolinas says that this experience was a fluke, perhaps because we were there fairly close to closing time (although I don't think that's a valid excuse).

I wasn't impressed. Hubby wants me to return for breakfast with him and give this place another shot. Eh, I won't go out of my way to come back but if I'm in the area (unlikely) I guess I'd be willing to give it another try :/
