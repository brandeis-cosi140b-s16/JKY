Food is great! Service is a whole other issue! I called to place a pick up order, the lady that answered was so busy.. she would start taking my order then kept telling me to hold. I had to literally repeat my order 4x. (That's fine she got busy I understand) but when we arrived guess what? Of course I should have known. MY ORDER WASN'T EVEN READY NOR STARTED! AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF SHE WROTE MY WHOLE ORDER COMPLETELY WRONG! Then when asking for cucumbers because they were so out, she made it seem like it was the end of the world to get more. They never have lids for their unknown salsas, as if the salsa Nazi was going to take it all! Not pleased!
