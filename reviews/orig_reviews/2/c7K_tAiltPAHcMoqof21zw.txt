Shockingly disappointed!  We went to SDC last night for dinner.  Good meal as usual until it came to the bill.  It would appear as though the Spotted Donkey now has a mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of 5 or more.  This came as a bit of a surprise even though we typically tip 18%-20% for their good service.  What was really surprising was that our "party of 5" consisted of 3 adults, a 4 year old and a 20 month old.  What was a satisfying meal of a sudden became marginal.
