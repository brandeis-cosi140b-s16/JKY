Took the drive out to Phoenix hoping I'd finally find some great Mexican food. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I ordered a chorizo, egg, potato & bean Burrito. I gave that a 6/10. What killed it for me was the cleanliness of the restaurant. Dirty tables, salsa spilled on the floor & tables. Plus they said they had horchata...it was one of those OLE fountain drinks. I was shocked. Seriously if you can't make your own agua frescas, I can't trust you to make me Mexican food. I lived in California for 24years, 15min away from Mexicali, Mexico. I know Mexican food & this ain't it for me.
