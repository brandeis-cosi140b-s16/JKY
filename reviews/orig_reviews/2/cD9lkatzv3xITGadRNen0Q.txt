This was another restaurant on the last trip to Vegas that really wasn't anything too special -- but priced as though it were. It certainly was ok -- chips were fresh and warm -- though the salsas weren't anything to get excited about. Fish tacos were good, but hardly memorable -- and their standard Margarita tasted all fakey fake.
