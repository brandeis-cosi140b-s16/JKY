First time at Salsa Blanca. Walked in and was pretty confused about where to go to order or if someone was going to come up and take my order. I then saw the big menu sign, so I wandered over there by myself.. not having any sort of direction from the wait staff. A kind man took my order after I was overwhelmed by all of the choices. Ordering went smoothly. I ordered the tamale and taco combo and a soft drink. The waiter who took my order told me my food would be right up and handed me a cup, which in turn made me think I could get my own drink. Another waitress by the fountain drink dispenser gave me a weird look when I went ahead and did that. I wasn't sure if I should sit at an empty table to wait for my food or in front of the register I ordered at. More clear signage might help with that.

I got my food within five minutes after sitting down, which was great. I got home and started eating my meal, realizing that it really did not have any flavor whatsoever. The tamale and beans were bland. The rice was also flavorless and tasted as if it was burnt or overcooked. The meal was filling though and priced well for the portion size.

Don't think I'll go back. I'd rather go across the street and have Chipotle.
