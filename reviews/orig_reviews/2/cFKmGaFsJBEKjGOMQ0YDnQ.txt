The food was less than spectacular....i had the carne asade burro.  The meat was extremely cold, chewy and lacked seasoning.  I would not come here again for the food.  However, the guy working the register was really sexy, friendly and helpful.  I may go again just to buy a bottle of water so I can see him but otherwise I won't be ordering food. lol
