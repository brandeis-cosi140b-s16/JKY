I went for dinner after not having visited for over a year. I recalled why I stopped going. The chips were burned and I had to ask to have them replaced. They stopped giving bean dip with the chips. And when I got my food it was lukewarm and tasted like fast food. I used to like this place 20 years ago but it is not the same now. Will not be going back unless it is for happy hour.
