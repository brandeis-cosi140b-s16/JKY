I'm pretty sure the toilet overflowed right before I walked in here. I'm not being mean, it really smelled like they had plumbing issues. So if they were that's probably a freak thing, and doesn't affect the rest of my review, which wasn't very good by the way...
This place is definitely not worth your time and especially your money honestly. Take it from a Hispanic who LOVES tacos, burritos etc...I can name five places within five miles that are way better for the price. The Burrito I ordered was large but hardly contained any beef (I ordered a carne asada burrito). It also had rice, guacamole, pico de gallo. and it was flimsy, burritos are not supposed to fall apart lol, the salsa was meh...the reason I think they may get a lot of business is because of the location. It's right on the corner of Rural and University. How can it not get business being located there? It's a college student hangout because they live within walking distance, close for when they are hungry... Spend a little on gas or the bus and go up the street.
