Stopped in here for drinks during "happy hour"  and there seems not to be one here. Not quite sure if they think they are too good for it. I dont mind spending $12 on a drink if its worth it but um...their drinks are 4 sips and $12. Their Margarita was blech too.. sorry Mission wont go back! didnt give it 1 star b/c the food looks promising.
