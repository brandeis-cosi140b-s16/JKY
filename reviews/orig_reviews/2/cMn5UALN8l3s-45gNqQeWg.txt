Where can you see two Michael Jacksons and a Superman kick it? The back of La Salsa Cantina. 

I guess we should have known that it was going to be an "eh" experience when it took five minutes for someone to come to the podium and seat us...even though the restaurant was half full. The two friends I was with were getting impatient, but finally a hostess came and seated us. 

It took about ten minutes for the waitress to finally come over and take our drink order. But since that took so long, we decided to place our food order as well. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come out, but we ate the chips and salsa to hold our hunger over. 

I ordered the nachos, they were good and filling. Whatever my friends ordered, they didn't really care for. I had to wave down the waitress to get a refill on my soda. 

I understand that the restaurant is located on the strip...they're probably busy all day. It just seemed like they were understaffed or something. And since it's a chain, I highly doubt that it will be going out of business anytime soon. The next time I'm craving Mexican food in LV, I'll probably skip the La Salsa's and choose another restaurant.
