"This is gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you."

Having grown up in Albuquerque and Santa Fe and having a true love for New Mexican cuisine, as well as knowing how to cook New Mexican cuisine, imagine my absolute delight that someone had decided to open a New Mexican food restaurant in Vegas apart from Carlitos Burritos.  (Which, by the way, is a SMASH hit 5 STAR place.. and the Nevada Governor's fave place to visit when in town, I know, I was there when he said it himself, but I digress...) 

1 star for having the "huevos" to open up such a restaurant 
2 stars for the beautiful Southwest d√©cor, complete with an RC Gorman print on the wall... 

Regretfully that is where I will leave it.  

Service was miserable.  NOT a crowded afternoon, it was AARP / toddler hour.   Took FOREVER to seat us and there were more than enough open seats.  Once seated, we counted 18 minutes until someone came to our table.  That was after my husband had to flag someone down.  These are the basics, people.  

Once we did order it was an eternity to actually get our food.  

Carne Adovada was super dry and not worth a third bite.  The pork chile verde was loaded with large potatoes, no hatch green chile spice at all and one piece of pork.  Really?  

My husband and I were so disappointed.  I seriously have no words for the level of gross.  

Too bad, it would have been a huge hit for my family had it been better.
