I'd gladly eat here again if money isn't a concern. My gripe is a hidden "CNF" charge you find on your bill. This is a "franchise fee" equal to 3-4% of your total bill. I think it's totally wrong to charge this after the fact. Then just add that amount to each menu item. Just seems shady if you ask me.

PS another in our group nearly choked to death (yes really) on a chicken bone that was close in size to a tooth pick. This was in a dish that was comprised of some type of pulled chicken. The waitress witnessed him choking.  The manager came out and tried to compensate him for the life threatening incident with a shot of booze from the bar!!?!?
