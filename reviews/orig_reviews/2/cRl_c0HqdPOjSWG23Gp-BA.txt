I think they have really good food....in fact i was so impressed by their food that I wanted to have my rehearsal dinner there. I called the first time - was told the manager would call me back, a week later - nothing. Then I called back again and was told I'd need to call back that the manager wasn't there. And I called back again and he wasn't there again...i finally gave up and reserved my party of 25 people elsewhere. Guess they didn't want our business.
