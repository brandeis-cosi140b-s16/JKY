This restaurant was a joke! We were seated right away but it took nearly 45 min for them to bring us our food! The price was rediculous $18 for a burrito that was tiny, we were charged for the chips and salsa that we didn't even order! Robertos puts the to shame when it comes to real Mexican food, real service and a bang for your buck!!!
