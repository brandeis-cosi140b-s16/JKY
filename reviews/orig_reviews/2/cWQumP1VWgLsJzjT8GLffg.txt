Do you believe in the hereafter?
Well not anymore.
Because whatever it is you came hereafter, you're not going to find it.

Why?
This is the Denny's of Mexican Food.
Look around.
Notice anything?
Like how there's no Mexican's anywhere in sight?
That's never a good sign.

Folks, when you can't even get a Mexican to eat here, you might as well be selling roadkill.
