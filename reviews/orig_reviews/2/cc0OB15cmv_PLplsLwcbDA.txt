Just ok.  I had two taco entree and it seemed bland. Rice was tasteless but the black beans were tasty Lunchtime had 5 tAbles occupied. Cool theme. Music army a decent level so we could talk Food was delivered to table no one every came by to check if things were fine  there are a bunch of hot sauces in a 6 pack on the table. Mine were mostly empty or filthy - I grabbed an adjacent tables 6 pack. 
Underwhelming, probably would not return
