Normally I love this place, and I recomend it to everyone, but my recent visit was beyond disappointing.  Not sure if the owner has chosen to go for less quallity meat, but I'm not sure I would have fed my two burritos and five tacos to a stray dog that was about to die of starvation.  That was one of the worst meals that I have had in a long time.  I'm a native and I took some other locals there for the first time, and I was embarrassed to have taken them there after we sort of ate the crap that was bundled up in a tortilla. 

I had the carnitas, and my friends has the carne asada.  Both were loaded with unedible cartiledge, and my carnitas had bone fragments in it.  The rice was nearly raw throughout both burritos which was mixed in with some other over cooked rice.  This probably means that they are mixing old product in with new product.  NO BUENO!  Maybe the Clark County Health Department needs to do an inspection of the facilities to ensure proper use of cooked food.  Its obvious that there is a lack of training on behalf of the owner/management if they are even around to oversee at all.  

Dear Pepe's,
GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!
