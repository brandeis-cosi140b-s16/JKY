Visiting Phoenix and our friends who live in town often go there.  It was super busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Thursday night, chips were greasy, in fact all the food was extra oily, flavors ordinary, services extra spotty as our very polite very overwhelmed waiter (with only 2 days experience) struggled to bring out food that took a long time to come and in fact one of us had not received her food and 3 of us were done.  I don't think they'll be back soon and we won't ask to go there....to bad, we were in the "Clinton Ate Here Room"
