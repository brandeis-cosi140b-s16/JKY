The view is amazing and definitely the highlight.  The food was ok, not what I was expecting. Some things were great others were subpar. The service from our waiter was horrendous. The attendants were great, but the server never checked on us, no refills, never came back to the table except to drop off the bill. 

The chips that came out were decent, they lacked salt. The salsa was good, especially when mixed with the bean dip. My mojito was just bad. 

I had carne a la tampequeno, a favorite of mine based on time spent in Mexico. The version at Lindo is okay, but the meat was not what I would have expected.  The rice an beans were the same thing I would expect from a hole in wall. Not bad, but nothing special. 

Our table was seated with a prime view.  The servers assistants were always around, and the table stayed clean. But no one offered anyone a fresh drink, or checked on the food. Sad really. 

Maybe we will go back. But it won't break my heart if we don't.
