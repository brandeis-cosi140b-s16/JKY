Way over priced. Very basic margarita $8, a good margarita $12.50, and the food cost is worse. Three chicken taco's, with just meat in the tortilla, rice, beans, and queso on the side $17.50!!!  They could at least add some peppers, onions, or gold flakes for that price. The food is average Mexican food, and not worth the price.  Server was very friendly, which earned them 2 stars instead of 1.
