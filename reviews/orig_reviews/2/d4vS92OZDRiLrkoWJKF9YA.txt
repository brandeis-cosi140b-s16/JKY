Quick, call Guy Fieri!  You've lost your mojo!

Had lunch there this noon.  Jerk chicken, egg foo young, chicken fried rice and refried beans.  The chicken was tasteless (I've been to Jamaica, so I know what it tastes like), and the egg foo young was warmed over with package gravy.  The fried rice was bland and the refried beans came from those big cans a Costco.  The portions used to be pretty good sized, but they've cut back on that too.  That and a drink was $10, way more than it should have cost.  Big, no, HUGE disappointment from the past.

Bottom line: bland, small portions, over priced.

Unless I hear that the location was taken over by aliens today, I won't be back.
