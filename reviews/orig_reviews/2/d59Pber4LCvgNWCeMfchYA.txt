This was my first time at this location and I went there for lunch.  First off, it took over 30 minutes to receive our food and I had to go ask where the food was. The time it took is unacceptable and because of that would probably not go back during lunch hours since I generally only have a 30 minute lunch period. When I got my order, it was incorrect; however, at that point I could not send it back to due time constraints and I needed to eat and leave. The food was decent, but not as good as other locations that I have visited.  I would only return if others want to eat there, but not out of personal choice due to the time it took to get the food.
