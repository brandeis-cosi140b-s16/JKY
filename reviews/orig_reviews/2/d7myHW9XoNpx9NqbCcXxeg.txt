From the outside this place looks like all fun and games.  $2 beer, a party atmosphere and free food during happy hour.  Whats not to like right?  Unfortunately the music is way 2 loud when you get in.  Its really difficult to have a conversation.  The free food has made me sick on more than 1 occasion.  The service is slow to the point that I usually go to the bar to order a beer.  I would give this place at least 3 stars if they turned down the music a couple of notches.
