Great potential, badly executed.

I came here for Taco Tuesdays... awesome prices. $1 for beef, chicken, pork tacos, $2 for steak, mahi, and crispy fish tacos. $2 domestic and imported drafts, $3 margaritas and Sauza shots.

Horrible service. Not my first time here, but on this instance I had to wait 30 minutes to order a drink and tacos. And 15 minutes after that I had to ask my waitress where my drink was.

Frustrating. Good margaritas tho.
