Place is beautiful inside and out. Food is mediocre at best. I might have returned for the atmosphere if it not for the supposed owners and management. I was having lunch on the patio and had SEVERAL screaming kids climbing a tree RIGHT next to my table throwing rocks and screaming. When I notified management I was informed those were the owners kids and he couldn't do anything about it. He bought my meal instead. I said thanks but that's not what I want. I want to relax and enjoy my mediocre food in peace. I am completely turned off that the supposed owners would let their children disturb their customers dining experience. And even more turned off that the problem wasn't fixed. I will not be returning.
