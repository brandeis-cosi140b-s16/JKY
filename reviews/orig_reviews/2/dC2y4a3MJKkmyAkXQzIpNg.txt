Barrio is known for overpriced food and drinks. I have used to go to the original Barrio location a lot and watch the prices rise big time over the years. $11 for a dessert. The Barrio Queen has the same concept. Overpriced f&b. Don't get me wrong, I know that the food quality is good, but there are a lot of better and comparable restaurants available that's a lot easier on the wallet.
