My yelp buddy Rachel S. and I came to check out the house that Don Juan built a few days ago.

We came in for dinner around 7 and were seated promptly. They have a small parking lot in the back which is awesome as finding parking in the area can be a problem in itself. Like most Mexcian spots, Don Juan gets props for complimentary chips and salsa but they made it even better with a side of bean dip yum!

Located right on Main Street near Charleston, Don Juan is located near the Downtown Arts District and gets packed during First Friday, They restaurant itself tries to capture that old-town Mexican feel with it's brightly colored walls, titled floors and hanging florals. The night we came in there was a mariachi band in the next room playing for diners - a nice touch. 

The menu is huge, easy to get lost in, and has pretty much every incarnation of Mexican food you could want. There specialty seems to be tamales but they have a pretty wide range of seafood offerings as well. I thought it was a little over priced, two chicken tacos with rice and beans were like $13. My  smothered carne asada burritto was ok, it looked like a giant enchiliada but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The carne asada was very dry and the fillings could have used a bit more spice. The re-fried beans were mediocre but the Spanish style rice was pretty good. I just didn't feel like it was worth the $15 I spent, there are alot of great culinary finds in the downtown area and I feels like Casa Don Juan could do more.
