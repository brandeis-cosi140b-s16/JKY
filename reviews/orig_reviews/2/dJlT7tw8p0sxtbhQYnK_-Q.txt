I wanted to like this place, I really did. I had a super craving for mexi-food and unfortunately where I live(N. Scottsdale) doesn't have too many authentic options. I have grown up eating mexican food from my own nana's,  & my tia's, prima's, nino's... (you get the idea) so I consider myself an accredited taco critic. I ordered an asada and a fish taco, which also came with rice and beans. The rice was the best part of this meal. The fish was unidentifiable and very mushy, it came grilled(? I'm not even sure). I took maybe two bites and that was it, salsa couldn't even save this. I personally prefer the baja style and would recommend rubio's or basically any other place for fish tacos, unless you like canned tuna fish in a corn tortilla. I'd also like to throw out there I thought their salsa lacked flavor and was watery! Ugh!!! Tragic!!! The carne asada was only slightly better it came out room temperature and had an odd smoky flavor. I'm all for grilling food but I get the feeling this carne had maybe been grilled a day or two before and reheated? However, my boyfriend had an asada burrito and his carne was considerably better. All in all a disappointing experience and I will not be coming back. I am curious as to how this place was chosen to be featured on Food Network?! Hopefully for their sake this was just a bad day for them and they step their taco game up. As for me, my venture for great tacos is aimed further South (:
