I have been wanting to come here for ages! Ok, well, maybe only since i moved back to Phoenix a month ago...but still...in hungry foodie days, a month is FOREVER.

The vibe is cool and trendy and Johnny Anonymous was playing the night we visited...love them! 

So first off, I have to say, only two vegetarian options..UGH. Usually mexican places are an easy feat for me when it comes to finding delicious no added meat items. Not so much here...your choices are Vegetable enchiladas with zucchini, squash, sweet potatoes and mushrooms or nachos. Let me say that as a very white looking mexican, I know that sweet zucchini and squash do not go with anything mexican food related. Where the heck is the green chile and beans?

I ordered the Todo Santos Nachos. They were...ok. Not a lot of flavor, but luckily my super hot boyfriend had some tasty queso dip that I added to my mini tostada nachos to liven them up a little.

We also ordered guacamole for the table, which was, eh. The guy who mashes the avocados must have stormed out and quit during his shift, because it was basically halved avos served with a few tomatoes and feta on a sad looking lettuce leaf. Luckily, I am a guac expert, so I mashed those right up with my fork and added some salt pronto which helped us to at least be able to scoop them up with our chips.

I am willing to give TQLA another shot because I am a sucker for brunch, and they offer Sunday brunch, so I will be headed there on a not so distant Sunday. Stay tuned my pretties.
