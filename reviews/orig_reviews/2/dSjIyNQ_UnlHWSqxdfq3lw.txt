Food is blah, I prefer Chevy's over this place. Indoor decor is nice, service was so-so. Prices average (and we used a player's club coupon for $6 off for two). 

Oh, and the guacamole tasted like crap...something was just "off" about it.

What I was most peeved about was that we weren't aware that they had poolside tables and they didn't tell us!! UGH. Hello, we're in Vegas, I want to see hot people in skimpy clothes! So yea, we sat at some random table looking into the kitchen. It wasn't until we were leaving that we noticed a whole other back room with a glorious view of tanned bodies! wtf...seriously, WTF.
