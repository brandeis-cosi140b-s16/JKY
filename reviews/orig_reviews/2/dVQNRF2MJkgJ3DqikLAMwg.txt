The star rating is not what I want to give David's because I typically enjoy their food. However the only way I have found to eat David's is in the physical restaurant itself. 

I've ordered delivery from here a few times and it's never good. I just got cheese fries and a burger and I can't even eat the burger because the bun is so soggy and same kent the fries. Both are soggy, cold and not edible. 

I felt bad for the delivery guy so I still threw him a bad tip even though it took over a hour to get here when they told us 35 minutes.

Pretty bummed about David's right now
