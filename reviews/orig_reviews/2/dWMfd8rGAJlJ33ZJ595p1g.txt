Save yourself the trip and go to Chipoltle or even Taco Bell! This place is way overcrowded and not worth the wait. I ordered 6 tacos on taco Tuesday and my date had a steak burrito. I had 2 of each (chicken, pork, and ground beef) and the chicken was good beef was ok and the pork was inedible. The salsa bar was nice but not enough chips. My dates burrito was overlooked for steak. Also just for sour cream is an extra .50 cent! Most places don't charge extra for that!! Will not return due to price and quality. Overall bad experience with some below average food. Next time will get a quesorita at Taco Bell and save 10$!
