Nice outside area. Service was friendly. Very expensive for what it was. And for all the random things, the food really didn't have much flavor. Not impressed with the "tree hugger" menu. We had just moved here and ended up at this place by mistake. (Couldn't find so cal fish tacos). It's a great yuppy hip health food place, but not family friendly looking for REAL tacos.
