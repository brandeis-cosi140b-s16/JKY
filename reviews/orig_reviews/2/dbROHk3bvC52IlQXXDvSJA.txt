This place is ok for a quick taco or burrito fix 24 hours a day.  I must agree with other reviewers that some of their food can be a little on the greasy side, like their nachos.  What I really like about this place is the salsa bar, and the fact that you can ask for a "toreado" (fried jalape√±o pepper) at no charge.  What I dislike is the  fact that they will charge you extra if you want to use a credit card, in fact when I first went there and found out they charged for using a card.   I thanked the girl at the register turned around and went to jack in the box instead.  Like I said the food is not that bad, but I won't use a card.
