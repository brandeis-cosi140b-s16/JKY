I am not quite sure what all the fuss is about. I found this place to be extremely overpriced and the food was just ok. My husband and I stopped by for a mid-week lunch and while he enjoyed his carne asada tacos, my quesadilla was served on a flour tortilla the size of a small corn tortilla and I subsequently had to order 4 baskets of chips to supplement my lunch. The salsa was good but why charge for chips and salsa? I could go to any other Mexican restaurant and get them for free and next time I will.
