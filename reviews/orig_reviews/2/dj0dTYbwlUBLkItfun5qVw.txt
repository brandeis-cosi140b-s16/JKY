What happened? I've been coming here for 27 yrs (since, and all through college) and things have just gone DOWN over the past few years. I used to drive from
S Scottsdale to get take out. Now, I'm just left disappointed. The chicken is much flat and drier than days of yore. And beloved pickled red onions? Less pickled, more briny salt laden. It just does not roll down your arm with juicy goodness like it used to. As a matter of fact--all I taste is salt, salt, Please get back to your roots. I just don't find the inkling to stop by anymore. And God forbid, my hub (after years of Supremo), said he would rather do Loco now. Who's in the kitchen these days? Please bring back your plumper birds and less salty condiments. Please? Please.
