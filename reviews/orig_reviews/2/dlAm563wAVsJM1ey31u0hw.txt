Obviously many like this place, I find it to fall short of real Mexican food as West-coast folks know it. Unlike SoCal or Baja , the portions are small and the prices are high.

My true test at any 'traditional' Mexican food restaurant is the carne asada tacos. That's what I ordered, and was very much unimpressed. The beef did not smell fresh. Evidently my nose and taste buds were right as my stomach bothered me all day after. It was very gamy tasting, enough to where their verde salsa couldn't cover it up.

I'll save my next trip for Tacos El Gordo. Fresh, inexpensive, and authentic.
