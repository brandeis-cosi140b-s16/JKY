WAYYYYYYY OVERPRICED for Phoenix. Food was good not great, except for the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.That was delish but very small and pricey. Drinks were tasty but small and pricey as well.The staff was okay, the ambiance was cool but didn't match the prices.This cafe is literally near the barrio but nobody in the barrio would be able to afford the prices and honestly could eat better food at home....Very disappointed!! If your into getting ripped off or your a hipster who doesn't mind pricey "authentic" mexican food, then this place is for you. Love visiting Phoenix but happy to be home in Los Angeles with affordable, delicious, authentic mexican food.
