Well, pros and cons. The food is quite expensive and tonight is was salty. We started out with the queso with artichokes. It was not that great. It did not come with tortillas,  which I thought was standard, my mistake. For my main course, I had the enchiladas del Mar with crab and shrimp. The enchiladas by themselves were alright,  but the rice & beans were awful. The garnishment on the rice looked like a side salad of carrots and cabbage....WAY TOO MUCH!  Service was decent. The layout of the restaurant is horrible on the upper level. There is not much space for aisle walking and you walk right past other tables, almost brushing them. I think if I was fat, I would've hit the guests.  Our wait time was 1 hr 45 minutes, we ended up waiting about an hour, which we were happy about. The last thing we ended with was the tres leches, it was the best part of the whole night. Only thing missing is fresh strawberries on top. I won't be back. If you want good Mexican food, go to Lindo Michoacan in Centennial.
