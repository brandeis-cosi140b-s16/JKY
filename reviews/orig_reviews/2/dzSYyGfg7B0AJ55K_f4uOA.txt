Two strikes you're out Barrio Cafe. I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment.
