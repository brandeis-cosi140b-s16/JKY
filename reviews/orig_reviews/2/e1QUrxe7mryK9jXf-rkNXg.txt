Was expecting way better for some reason. I'd never been, but heard the name several times, so we stopped in for dinner tonight. 

Cleanliness didn't seem to be of high importance in the little I saw of the restaurant. Smelled a little like cleaners inside the door, so that was off putting. My glass was sticky and the table was stained, it just felt like a low-end chain experience. 

Food was okay - pollo fundido was marginal. I've had better before, but it's hard to mess up. It was lacking quite a bit of flavor, though. One person in my party found aluminum foil in her food, to which the server responded that it was a "hard, dry basil leaf." Right. 

Probably won't come back here again unless I'm on this corner and want Mexican food. Pretty unspectacular - I can get dinner that's more flavorful at a hole in the wall place for half the price.
