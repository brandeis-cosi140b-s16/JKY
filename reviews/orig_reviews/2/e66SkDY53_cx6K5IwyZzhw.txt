Came here with a group of friends to do some day drinking on Nat'l Margarita day. This was our second stop of many planned on our adventure. I ordered the bulldog margarita expecting something amazing........and was disappointed. The only thing I tasted was beer and margarita mix. There was either a very small amount or no tequila in this drink. This is a very popular drink; I could see it on almost every table that afternoon. I am not sure if I will be back, not a fan of watered down or virgin adult beverages.
