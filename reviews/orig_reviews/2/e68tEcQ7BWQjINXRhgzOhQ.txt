I am a huge fan of this restaurant but they have poor organization and communication skills. I went in on Tuesday at 2pm and it was very slow. We were moved three times before ordering because the staff said the areas we had been seated in were closed and waiters weren't zoned in that area. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and mine came out incorrectly. For a slow period, communication should be on point. It was rare that we were checked on and the fish tacos were very bland and slightly cold by the time I received them. I am willing to give it another shot because I remember a time where the service and food was incredible, but this put me off.
