I so wanted to like this place.  I've driven by it several times, and at night the mulitcolored lights and cute signage give it an intimate, urban-hip feel.  I will say that the staff is super friendly, and the service was very good.  But for me, when I eat out it's all about the food, and it was not that tasty.  It was cheap, for sure, but I've had cheap, delicious food before and this was not it.  I ordered the blackberry lemonade and their special burrito of the day, a chicken burrito with green chile.  The lemonade tasted like cotton candy, and it wasn't actually a drink; it was a slushy.  The chicken burrito was pretty dry, and was filled with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and what looked like kraft shredded cheese.  It's my fault for not asking what all came on the burrito, but I HATE shredded lettuce.  I had to struggle to find any green chile, and when I did, it didn't pack a lot of flavor.  I wish I could recommend it, but I probably won't eat there again.
