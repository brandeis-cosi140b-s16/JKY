My husband and I gave this place a try tonight and we're very disappointed. First, the wait in the drive through was ridiculously long and there was only one car in front of me. No one behind me. I ordered steak tacos and my husband got a steak burrito. The steak was very sweet. My tacos crumbled as I picked them up. My husband's burrito was tiny compared to the ones you get at Chipotle or zabas and all the guacamole was all at one end and all the steak was all at the bottom. I also ordered a side of chips and guacamole which had absolutely no seasoning. The girl in the window gave me free pumpkin bark because of how long we waited and that was pretty good so I'll give two stars for the bark and for her trying to make up for the wait. I'd pick Chipotle over this any time.
