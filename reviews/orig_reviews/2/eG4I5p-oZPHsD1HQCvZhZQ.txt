I love me some Wahoos but this specific one is weak.  Took over old poker bar so no windows in the joint which kinda defies Wahoos principles in general and feels too much like a bunker.  Food is Wahoo's so you know it's good but service struggles if your not a regular.  If it is crowded your screwed.  Staff a minimal crew.  Much better vibe in Sumnerlin and new Henderson one has amazing views of Vegas.
