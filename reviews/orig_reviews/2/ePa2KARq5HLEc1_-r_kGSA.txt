First, the design is beautiful and worth the trip (as you walk through to AZ88). If only the food would live up. The duck queso is one of the better dishes in Phx, but everything else is a disaster. Came back a second time and they were out of the duck dish (at 6 on a Saturday). Margaritas are poor and not very strong, chicken tacos had the unfortunate habit of being raw.
