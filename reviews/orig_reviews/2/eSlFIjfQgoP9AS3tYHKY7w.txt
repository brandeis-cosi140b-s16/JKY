I am not one to complain but hands down the worse service I've encountered in a long time. Was told an hour wait and an hour later they told me it would be another hour. Took 30 minutes for anyone to acknowledge our party and take an order. Food came before drinks. Moved inside to our table and waited over 40 minutes for a beer. 

Billy the manager was great and the only reason I'd give this place another shot. It's a great concept but such awful service leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth
