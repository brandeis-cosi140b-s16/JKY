If I could rate it 2.5 I would, and in my opinion it's 3 stars, but 2 = "Meh" on yelp.

The food here is average, a little quick and sloppy, especially at night with the college frat boy kid rush. The security / ID checkers are pretty nice, the waitresses and hostess are pretty air headed, I've been here around 5 times, same experience each time. For example, I asked "Did you see me come in here with ___?" Both girls at the front stared at me blankly, "Umm... I dunno, I don't really pay attention, ha sorry." Then they went back to talking to each other before I could respond. 

Macayo's always has pretty cool events though, but those are separate producers of course, they never have enough events at the back area events either... staff is also pretty rude to me, and I'm always event staff, ignoring me and complaining when I said the main staff didn't get any food.

This place is good for people looking to scarf down some quick faux Mexican food, preferably a young person, college crowd, "bro", "frat", idk I assume someone that likes fart jokes. I does not appear to be good for children or families to me... not good for dancing. Get's 21+ around....7pm I think. Awhile ago I went with some older friends around 9, there was literally no one there, odd night, and 1 security guard with the kitchen still open. My friends went inside and used the rest room, got a couple drinks and I stood outside shouting to them by the ledge. Then we left.
