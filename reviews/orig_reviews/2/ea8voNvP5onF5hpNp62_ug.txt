My Dad and wife accompanied me here a few nights ago for a much needed recharge of some good ole' Komex fusion food.  This was our experience:

Food:  Between all of us we ordered a half order of the combo fried rice, pork belly masubi with egg, a pork tostada, an order of pork wanton, and a cheese quesadilla. The combo fried rice was very good and went off well with all of us (the shrimp were the really small cocktail shrimp).  I like my pork belly a little more tender than our masubi; however, it was okay.  The pork wantons were good. and the cheese quesadilla was also good; however our waitress referred to it as a "Fusion quesadilla"...it was just a tortilla and white cheese, there were no fusion ingredients.  The pork tostada was surprisingly not very good at all, I didn't taste any Asian fusion flavors.  The fusion tostada bed or "fried" rice was soggy and clearly wasn't fried like the previous times we've sampled it.  The fact that the pork tostada wasn't cooked like Sonny cooked it and the fusion quesadilla had no fusion just disappointed me.

Service:  We loved our server!  She was so nice and had a very positive spirit.  She was fast, courteous, kept our drinks filled and delivered an accurate order.

Atmosphere:  I would highly suggest hiring a commercial cleaning business to do a full-service cleaning of Komex.  There was so much dirt caked onto the lower trim of the walls and floor, I was simply in shock that they let it get so dirty. 

Price:  Not too bad.

Overall,

In my opinion: Komex Fusion (*Decatur Location Only*) went down hill since their Yelp Stardom peaked, since the new location opened, and since the owners decided to focus on the Buffalo location as the primary.  What bothers me most is the fact that they started out so good.  I know exactly what happened; but really, what happened?
