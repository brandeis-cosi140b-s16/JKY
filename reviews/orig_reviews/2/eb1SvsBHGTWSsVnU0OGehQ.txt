Maybe I just don't prefer my Mexican food deep fried and smothered in yellow cheese, but I was pretty disappointed in Jalapeno Inferno. 

I had a Google Offer, so we ordered a few house margaritas, the appetizer sampler, and the hatch chili pork enchiladas. The appetizer sampler looked like it guaranteed gastrointestinal issues, but we dug in anyways. There was just a dollop of guacamole that did not appear to be freshly made. The bean dip and quesadilla were both bland. The cheese dip was tasty, but it was the smallest item on the plate. The rest of it I believe were mini tamales, burros, and fundidos, but they all looked and tasted basically the same. To put it succinctly, all of it lacked pizzazz. If this represented the best of their appetizer menu, then I would not recommend any of the appetizers.

The hatch green chili enchiladas, on the other hand, were pretty tasty. Good, spicy sauce and succulent shredded pork. I pulled all the melted cheese off (which came off in one perfectly congealed brick) my enchilada, and I think that made me better appreciate the sauce. The rice and beans that went with the enchilada were fine.

The house margaritas were predominantly mix, so they were entirely run of the mill.

We sat on the patio, which was nice, except for the occasional wafting of cigarette smoke. I'm from Ohio. There you can't smoke in restaurants period, not even on their patios. I miss that.

Speaking of Ohio, the Mexican food at Jalapeno Inferno was basically like the Mexican food at average joints in the Midwest: average and appealing to those with palates that crave the fried, bland, and unnecessarily cheesy. The hatch green chili dishes (which I could never find in Toledo, Ohio) were this place's saving grace.

All in all, not worth the drive to North-North Scottsdale.
