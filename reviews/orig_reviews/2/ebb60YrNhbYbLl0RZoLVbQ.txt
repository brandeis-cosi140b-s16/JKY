We have eaten here many times and had great food/service. We ate in the bar area last night and had the worst service/food ever. My margarita was served to me in a dirty glass to start. I was drinking it and it stunk. I then realized there was gunk around the rim under the margarita salt. Next, I order the carnitas rancheras and my husband gets the sopa del mar. I never get my albondigas (choice of soup or salad). I had to ask for it when my meal came out. Then I had to ask again for a spoon. Then I had to ask for the guacamole and corn tortillas that came with the meal! My husband ordered a very expensive soup. He didn't finish it after he ate the seafood out of it. He said it tasted like veg beef broth with seafood thrown in. Nobody ever asked how our meal was or sent a manager to our table. They gave us our bill and sent us on our way. I tipped the server not because of the service, but because I used to be a server and understand that's pretty much all they get. Mind you we have eaten there 5 other times with no problem, but I do believe this will affect us going back any other night other than taco Tuesday. :(
