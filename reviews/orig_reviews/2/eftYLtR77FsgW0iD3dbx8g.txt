Horrible service, food isnt anything to brag about... def. The worst food ive had in vegas. had to wait forever to get a table yeah we were a big group but seriously we even made reservations! the waiter had us sit in assigned seats cause he couldnt remember what each person ordered so as more of our group showed up we had to stay where we were and ask our waiter where he wanted them to sit.. very rude.
