I've been gone from Sylvia's for awhile, and  I was not impressed on my return visit. I'd never had a bad experience before, but this visit left much to be desired. First, our server was, well, bad. I've been a server, so I know it is a tough job. But she was virtually non-existent (and didn't have a lot of tables to begin with), and when she did come, she messed up drink orders, and messed up my taco order. I used to love their taco shells, but these seemed to be store bought. I wanted beef but got chicken, and I hope the beef tasted better, the chicken was rather bland. My friend didn't think her burrito was very flavorful, either. The bathroom had no usable paper towel dispenser. Just overall nothing like the Sylvia's I remember.
