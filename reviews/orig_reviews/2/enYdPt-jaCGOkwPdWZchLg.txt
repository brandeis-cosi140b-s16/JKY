In a city overflowing with food options, from the all-you-can-eat buffets that range from excellent to mediocre to the $1.99 shrimp cocktails to the Michelin-star fine dining experiences, this place falls flat on its face.  

We came in here after a long, long day of boozing and traipsing up and down the Strip.  We found ourselves here later in the evening and instead of being, "well, what do you want?"  "No, what do you want?"  We decided upon this place "just because" and of all the places we ate at, w/the exception of the Victorian Cafe at the old Barbary Coast, this was the most unimpressive of all our meals.  

The food here is atypical of any "tex/mex" eatery, as in On the Border or Jose Teja's, but I didn't leave here with my clothes and hair smelling of the place, so that bumps it up a star, and being in close proximity to a toilet doesn't hurt, either. 

You will leave here with a burrito hangover, I assure you, if that's what you are looking for - so uninspiring, I almost forgot I ate here.
