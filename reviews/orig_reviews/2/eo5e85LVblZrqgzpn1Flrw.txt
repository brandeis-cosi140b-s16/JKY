I am going to have to just give the pace an ok. I would give it a 2.5 if I could.  Not to bad but not great either. The best part is that I had a restaurant.com certificate so that was 25 off by bill. Service was so so. Started off ok but then the waiter disappeared on us. Took forever for him to refill my drink. 

I ordered a beef enchilada beef taco and a chicken taco. All were average at best, not much flavor to them. I a, not a spicy food fan but even I had to throw some hot salsa on them. Side orders or rice and beens came out room temperature. All this for about 19 bucks.

All in all don't waist your time unless you get a restaurant.com certificate. Otherwise it's not a good value
