Noticed a lot of people on Yelp praising the food but lamenting poor service at Gardunos. I find myself thinking the opposite.

The wife and I came here today for a late lunch. She ordered the cheese enchiladas and I ordered the nachos with carne asada. Both of our meals arrived with that orange hue of low quality cheddar cheese. My food tasted OK, probably the sort of thing that would have made me very happy a few years ago, but somewhere along the line my standards for Mexican fare have been raised and this felt a little like the sort of "Mexican" you might find in a diner in the heart of Utah. No really distinct flavours, quick to congeal, and the sort of thing I'd be more likely to expect served up in a polystyrene, clamshell box in a food court rather than at a restaurant.

Gardunos has a salsa bar with a decent bean dip and some OK salsas -- a good thing since the stuff you get on the table by default tastes like it's straight from an economy sized plastic Pace bottle -- but the salsa bar at Guadalajara at Sunset Station thrashes this one senseless. The other issue I have with the salsa bar is it's a little dirty and when we were there there were only four of the little salsa bowls for us to use and those were splattered with salsa drippings from the bar. On top of this, they are so small that you have to snap your chips in half if you want to dip.

Throughout our meal our drinks were refilled promptly and everyone was friendly and helpful. The food here isn't inedible, it's just very, very average Mexican fare and there's absolutely no reason to ever go here unless the food is free or you're trapped at The Palms.
