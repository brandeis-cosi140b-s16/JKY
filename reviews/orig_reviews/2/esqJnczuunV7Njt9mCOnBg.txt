Group of 6 went for Sunday night dinner. The place has a pretty cool, modern ambiance.
The menu looked tasty, but no one had any alcohol due to the night before. Iced teas and waters for everyone!

Then...Mike the Server happened to us. I had to ask for chips and salsa because apparently you have to ask for that first they don't bring it to you automatically. That was unappealing. He stacked too many salsa bowls on the serving platter and spilled salsa over my friend. It was on the table and floor as well. They were cleaning it up and salsa buddy went to go get cleaned up. Mike the Server (MTS) then walked to the other side of the booth and spilled a bowl of the chips next to me on the table and floor. MTS was having a rough night. He communicated it was his 3rd day. Shocker. 

I ordered the pozole and chile relleno. The pozole was way better than my entree. It was green salsa based and was very tasty. I shared it and had leftovers to take with me. The stuffing was better with the chile and was not breaded like other chile rellenos I have had. Not sure if I liked this version as much. Everyone else ordered enchiladas and my guy ordered the brisket. That brisket was very tasty with the pickled onions. Everyone had leftovers to take home as we filled ourselves with tasty chips and salsa. The manager came by and wasn't very apologetic like MTS. She made little snarky jokes to try to be funny but I wasn't that amused. MTS gave the table flan on him since, you know, he spilled everything on us and made the evening rocky. The flan was very dense and had a nice sauce with is. I had one bite and that was enough. My buddy did in fact earn it since it looked like he got shot.

Would I go again? Probably not. There are so many better restaurants in Downtown Gilbert with not only better food but better service. I understand it's a new place but I've already made up my mind. My advice: don't wear white to Barrio Queen.
