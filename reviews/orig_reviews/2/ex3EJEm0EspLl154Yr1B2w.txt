This place is gringo heaven, the music is much louder than it needs to be , the food is average by the time you stand in line and order, wait to pay and get to your table your food is less that hot. A co worker recommend this place trust me there are to many good Mexican hole in the walls that are clean and have great food in this neighborhood
