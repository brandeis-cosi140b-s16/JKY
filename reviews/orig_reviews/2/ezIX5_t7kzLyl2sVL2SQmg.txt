I love the food here! The tortilla soup is amazing as well as the corn bread. It's great, but I do have to say I think it's idiotic of them to charge an adult a dollar extra for a quesadilla that's the exactly same and a kids. I didn't ask for meat our anything special. My sister had asked for extra filling of cornbread in the enchilada, which the server.. then applied then scrapped off after. =_= some of the servers also seem to be mad sometimes, which is also bothersome. The only ones that have ever been nice is the blonde guy and the girl with gauges. I will be back with the hope that the guys make my enchiladas....
