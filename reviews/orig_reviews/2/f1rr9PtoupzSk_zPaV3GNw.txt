I went to Los Sombreros last night and was pretty excited to check it out since I live close and have heard great things about it.

OK...so we get there and there is no where to park..there is a lot behind the restaurant that I believe belongs to Pep Boys and has signs up saying you'll be towed if not a pep boys customer.....ugh...we took our chances since there was no where else to parking (we were thankfully not towed).

It was pretty crowded..but I was ok with that...especially since it was a Friday night. ...and then I got to meet the hostess.   Got up to her podium she looks straight at us and without saying anything like "excuse me for a minute" she turns her back to us and has a 5 minute conversation with a someone working there (which I would have been understanding about had she acknowledged I was standing there at least.  When her conversation is done  she asks how many, we say 4 (2 friends were meeting us and were seconds away).  When we ask about an estimate in time for the wait she says she won't "worry about that" until all of our party was here...I explained they were in the parking  lot..blah, blah....Her attitude was nasty and  giving me a poor first impression.

Red Sangria was Mmmmm, Queso fundido with chorizo was WOW, sea food tacos were just ok, chips and salsa were just ok....and all of it was a little over-priced!

My fav thing about this place was the ambiance...big patio outside with some fire pits going...a man playing mexican tunes on a guitar...and warm colors throughout.....Still I really don't think I will be returning..
