so i read a lot about this place. it was supposed to be one of the best mexican places in LV. at least on the strip. 
i will say the service was good but i use service really only if it was exceptional or miserable, or if it was good or bad as influence if i am not sure about the food. to me food is the main indicator for a rating. and the food here was just not that good. it was more calimex or tex-mex but not mex-mex. but to be honest it was mostly salt-mex. because every dish was way too salty. in that price range there are way better restaurants in LV and for good mexican it might be better to get away from the strip.
