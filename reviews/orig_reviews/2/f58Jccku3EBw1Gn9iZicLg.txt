Way overpriced for what you get. I had a salad and boyfriend had a cheese enchilada plate with rice only. The portions were very small--my boyfriend had to eat something else when we got home.  Also three dollars for a soda--this just pisses me off. What a rip off. The food did taste good,  and our server was nice but probably not ever going to come back. It's just not worth the effort.
