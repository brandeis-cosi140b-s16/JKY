I should have read the reviews before going here. They don't put prices on the menu for the drinks because a draft beer is almost $10. Service was terrible. Took forever to be acknowledged.  Waitress saw my empty glass and empty plate. Why did it take ten more minutes to flag her down to get bill?  Gave it two stars only  because the food (carnitas tacos) were actually really good.
