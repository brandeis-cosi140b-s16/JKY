Amazing location and good food but horrible service. Went 3 times trying to see if I hit a bad day originally and was sadly disappointed.  Takes forever to get service and no apologies for the long delay. Food delivered but no utensils to eat with and had to go to bar to ask for roll ups before the food got cold. Never saw our server after the food was delivered and had to ask someone else for our check. The food was delicious but definitely not worth the lack of customer service.
