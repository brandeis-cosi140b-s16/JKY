Had a great meal here in Jan 2012, but our return visit this year was disappointing.  No standout dishes, nothing memorable, nothing great.  Whereas the year before we walked away totally satisfied on every level, this time out was just a letdown.

Also, the bartender did nothing but try to push stuff down our throat.  I've never had such an aggressive server at any establishment, made us feel like we were being "sold to" -- at dinner!?!

That said, some clever dishes, and they serve nicely sized portions.  Perhaps we came on an off-night?  Only gave it the 2nd star due to memory of the first visit.  Proceed at your own risk.
