Place gets packed so watch out even when using your card to buy drinks. I went on a Friday for happy hour and bought myself and a friend a drink and the next day my bank account I was charged $50.00! My bill was only for 12.00.

Another instance my guy friend was wearing a hat and they did not let him in after 10:00 pm because no hats allowed. I looked over into the Patio and their were plenty of guys with hats on.....I'm sure the security guy was discriminating so we left.
