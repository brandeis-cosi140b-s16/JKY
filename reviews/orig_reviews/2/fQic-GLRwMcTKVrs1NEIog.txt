I'm giving them two stars because the food was decently good. Having said that, all else is pretty negative. Sat outside on a sunny Thursday, was one of less than 10 tables in the restaurant. Host was nice and inviting, server was slow and lazy. I ordered an ice tea and was finally given it in a dirty glass after I had to ask again for it 20 min later. That was when we finally saw the server again. Silverware and plates dirty, my wife's water glass had food particles floating in it upon delivery. We won't be back even if the food was ok, I hope the health department goes in there and gets them to clean up their act.
