Ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago. Combo dinner w/ green chilli.  No draft mex beers. 

OK food just not the kind of Mexican food I like. I like my corn chips covered with salt, hot and greasy, like they just came out of a boiling vat of lard. Theirs were the kind of generic chips you can get anywhere.  Rest of the food was average.

I lucked out and got a very good waitress who checked on my table often. 

The atmosphere was kinda of weird. The painted celling made me think of Aphrodite's palace in "my big fat Greek wedding". 

Anyway they got really busy about the time I was leaving so they are doing something right. Just not a place I will make a regular stop.
