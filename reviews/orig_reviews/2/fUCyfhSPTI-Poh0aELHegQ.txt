1) long wait to order
2) long wait for food after ordering
3) 3 out of 4 meals were cold
4) salsa and bean dip were pretty good. 

We ate-
Carnitas- (pile of meat. Not much else)
Sopes- looked ok. But was cold
Chile Rellano de camarone- cold chile rellanos aren't very good
Chicken burrito- cold. Not much flavor. 

Yes, we could have sent cold food back. But after the wait, we were pretty much ready to eat and leave.
