I always have hope for this place because the location is perfect for me, and it seems like they have the right theme going for a decent restaurant, but I'm always let down every time I've tried it. The last time I went I sat in the bar area expecting to get faster service, but it was the exact opposite. They kept forgetting about our drinks, it took over 20 minutes to get our food, no refills, didn't ask if I wanted another beer, and then we couldn't even find our waiter when we were done to get our tab which ended up taking 15 minutes. The food wasn't great & it was kind of cold. If I hadn't of waited so long I would have sent it back. It was obvious that are disappearing waiter forgot about our food & it probably sat there getting cold.

The location is still great for me, so I'll probably try it again like an idiot. Who knows maybe I'll have a better experience next time, but for now I feel that 2 stars is being generous.
