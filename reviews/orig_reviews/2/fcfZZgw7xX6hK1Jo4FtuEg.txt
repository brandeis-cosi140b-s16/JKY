I have been going to Carolina's for years. I have to say, the quality has gone downhill. The salsa is watered down, the flavor of the food is lack luster and the portion sizes have diminished, as the prices have gone up. It used to be fantastic, but not anymore. If people offer to buy me food from Carolina's, I decline. I go across the street instead. I'm sorry Carolina's, but you have lost a customer. In the PHX fast Mexican food market, there are many better choices, even within walking distance.
