I'm updating my review after a second trip.  I brought family tonight because I'd enjoyed my last trip.  I called ahead to make reservations and specifically asked that we be in the shade.   When we arrived, we were promptly seated in the direct sun. The host quickly disappeared and it took several minutes to flag down someone who could arrange a move.  It was early and not at all crowded but the staff acted as though we were asking for their first born.  Once we were moved, we didn't see a member of the waitstaff for a loooong time.  We had all finished out water and were really hoping to order drinks and our meal. Finally our waitress showed up.  It seemed as though the wait wasn't her fault because she seemed surprised that we hadn't been waited on.    Our food and drinks were fine but I won't be back and won't recommend it again.   A real bummer. This place could be so great but the service is very poor.
