After strolling through the streets of Vegas, a common sight were people drinking "adult slushies." At first i thought that these were virgin, until i continued to see empty beer and wine bottles everywhere.  I had to finally ask someone, "can you drink on the streets here" and they were like "yes."  I was amazed,  and then it all made sense.  Seeing all of this, i started to crave a margarita badly.  After passing Cabo Wabo a few times, i thought that this would be an appropriate place to quench my thirst.  There was a slight wait to get into the cantina, but the outdoor elevated patio was worth the wait.  Upon being seated our server told us that they were out of menus, so we just asked for a margarita and a mojito.  We started with some chips and salsa.  The salsa had a really smokey background, but not that much flavour.  Shortly after our drinks came, after taking one sip, we both realized that these were very water downed drinks.  We were both very unsatisfied with the drinks, mine literally tasted like just a lime slushie, no alcohol.  We basically just wrote off the night as a poor restaurant pick, but then our bill came.  My drink was $10 and my sisters was $14, i have never felt so ripped off.  I think that is why Cabo currently has a low Yelp rating, because people are feeling ripped off. 
Overall, i would not come back here, because i believe it is a tourist trap.  They are banking on the one time diner, versus the returning diner.
