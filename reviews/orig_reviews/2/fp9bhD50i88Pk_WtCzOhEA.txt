I was excited when taco guild open.  So, my husband and I decided to try it out before we went to the ballet in downtown on a Sunday afternoon.  First of all we waited ten minutes before a waiter came over to give us water and chips.  Then we waited five more minutes before we could order our food.  Last thing my husband ordered a burrito without rice on it and it came with rice on it.  :(  At least they were good about getting him a new burrito pretty quick. 

The atmosphere was pretty cool and I liked the look of the place. But the service was not all that great and the prices are a little high for a street taco.
