Just got done with lunch here.  This is the thired time that I have been here.  we go because we love Cuban food, but I do not think that I have ever had what I would consider to be a good "Cuban Meal" here.  Today I ordered the Bistec de Palomilla.  The meat was either under seasoned or not seasoned at all.  It came to the table, "just warm" covered in onions. It seemes that a dish like this should come with chimichurri sauce.  I also ordered the Mariquitas, which is thin sliced fried plantains.  These came out cold, like they have been made hours ago and just put onto a plate.  I have had these in several places before where they come out piping hot, fresh, and amazinly good....but not here.  I have to tell you that the best and freshest thing that was on my plate seemed to be the white rice.
