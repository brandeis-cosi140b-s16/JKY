Service was ok, not the best burrito. I had the bacon burrito and also tried chorizo and egg burrito. Honestly don't think I will be going back. When my food was ready the guy at the window said here you go "babe"  kinda not what I was expecting .. but anyway the food was meh and the service meh. I put two stars because it wasn't horrible food just not great, I only ate half and didn't care for it anymore. But also a star because of the way the building was, I thought it was pretty neat how they had it set up, unique and went with the name "shack" just wished the experience would have been better.
