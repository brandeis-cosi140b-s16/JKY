Ok to good food but not for the price. I'm not going to ratectge tequillas bc if a restaurant has over 50 of one kind then anyone should be able to fond at least one they like. Overall not impressed by the hype and felt more ripped off by the food. Over cooked flank steak, and the waiter even tried telling me that's how it's suppossed to be. Spoke to the manager and he refunded that entr√©e. Very disappointing. I could have just drove to Henderson or the strip for something this pricey and over hyphed
