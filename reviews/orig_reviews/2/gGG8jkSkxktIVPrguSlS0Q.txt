The chips, salsa and bean dip were good!  However, as a proud native New Mexican you have missed the target by a long shot! The red chili was weak and too thin - the green was good, but not prepared per New Mexican tradition, nor the ground beef! I won't be back as I was hoping for a Papa Felipes or Los Cuates experience, but that takes a 400 mile drive! I wish you the best!
