I saw all these great reviews so I decided to give this place a chance. As we walked in we greeted and seated. The bench seating is uncomfortable so I suggest you sit in a chair. The waiter was very attentive there was only 2 tables occupied in the whole restaurant so it was expected. 

The tables looks like they are from the 80's with the shiny black and white fake marble look. We felt like we were sitting in someone living room. 

We ordered the beef stroganoff which was ok a bit oily for our taste. We also ordered the vareniki with potatoes which was ok at best. The hit of the night was the chicken porharzky cutlets that was awesome. The rice was kind of bland and needs some help. The potatoes were really good. The orders took a long time to come out.

I don't think I would go back It's just not our style....sorry
