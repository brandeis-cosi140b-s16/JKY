They have an interesting concept but this is another fusion restaurant that has an identity crisis. I went here with a large party and everyone left unsatisfied. We tried just about everything on the menu. I don't think the food was disgusting. But we were not impressed and it ABSOLUTELY was not worth the price. We were the only ones in the restaurant but service was slow and not very friendly.
