Well I had my heart set on mexican one evening when we were in Vegas. My husband and I decided to try La Salsa Cantina. I had the burrito while he had the chimichunga. We both drank margaritas and lets just say that they margaritas were SOOOO much better than the food. We have a local mexican chain here in town (Columbus) that is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than this place. I was really disappointed. It almost seemed like they forgot to season the food at La Salsa Cantina. What a disappointment in food and price.  Also, the food is WAY overpriced here too. Go elsewhere!!!
