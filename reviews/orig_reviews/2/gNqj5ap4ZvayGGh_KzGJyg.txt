So I was raving about this place until I went for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was 4:50 when we asked to be seated in the main dining area because they opened the door/window panels in the middle of AZ summer. 5pm came and I had to argue with the brunette, frumpy, lumpy and ill-mannered head hostess to seat us inside because we were sweating like hookers in church (by then). She had the audacity to ask us to make reservations next time. The dining room was 95% empty. The food...I went during the week and it was phenomenal. I ordered the guacamole crab app again but this time they topped with a tea spoon of crab versus the plentiful amount of yesteryear. Bottom line: don't go to this restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night because you'll get bad service from staff and inconsistent food quality from the middle chef.
