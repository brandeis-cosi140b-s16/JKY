I will say that I've had mixed experiences at this restaurant.  Unfortunately more miss than hit.  The salsa is good, the chips salty and fresh.  I had lunch there today, and for me this is the last time I will visit this establishment. The food is not authentic, that's not the issue.  The problem is that the food they do serve is underwhelming and utterly devoid of seasoning. It's terribly bland, and in some instances watered down and soggy.
