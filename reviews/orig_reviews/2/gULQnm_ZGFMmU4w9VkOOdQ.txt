I have been to the Carolina's Original Location many times and always enjoy but sadly this location does not boast the same consistency. I ordered a combination taco tostada and enchilada with rice and beans. What a mess was served, a tostada with beans on one edge covered with wilted lettuce and the cheese missed the top and ended on the rice. The enchilada was simmilar with only 1/2 with cheese and sauce strewn across the foam container. To complete the disaster the taco was broken in three sections and covered with lettuce to hide the mess. It might have been a one time mistake or a new cook and I will try again as I always enjoyed the original location and like this location.
