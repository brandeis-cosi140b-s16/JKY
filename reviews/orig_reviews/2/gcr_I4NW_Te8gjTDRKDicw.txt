The two stars are for the awesome plates (literally the dishes- they are gorgeous) and the tasty queso, guac, chips and salsa. Everything else we ate last night was really mediocre at best. Unfortunately at the price point that's really unforgivable. Things that were bad: rice in rice bowls was undercooked, service was super slow from kitchen and bar (I get it, its a big and busy restaurant - so make your staffing such that people don't want 25 minutes on a margarita), speaking of margarita, our table ordered a few and they were very inconsistent and not tasty. Disappointing overall.
