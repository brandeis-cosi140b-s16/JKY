I ate here for my friends wedding dinner. So there was a fixed menu. The food was fine. Its basically fancy Mexican food that looks better than it tasted. There were not very many authentic flavors in the authentic dishes that were listed. Being Mexican I can be very picky about my food. However my favorite dish was the guacamole appetizer we had.  I gave this restaurant 2 stars because the waiter who was helping my table was rude and overstepped many boundaries. He made a comment about me being white (which I am not) because I was born in the United States. I retorted saying he was racist. He replied with, " You were born here so you are white." I  told him where I was born was none of his business and just because I was born here does not make me white.  This interaction was very off-putting and made me so angry at such a festive occasion.  I left this restaurant with a sour taste in my mouth and quite offended.
