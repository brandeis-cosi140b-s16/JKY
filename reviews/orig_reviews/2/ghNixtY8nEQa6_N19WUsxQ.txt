A friend and I came here for a "ladies who lunch" catch up session a while back. Not great, and here's why.  The waiter, while he was very attentive, couldn't pick up on the vibe that my friend and I were trying to cram 6 months of stories from not seeing each other into one hour and a half lunch.  He just kept asking us personal questions and talking to us. If you're looking for that sort of interaction, that's fine, but when you come to the table and we haven't even opened our menus to look at anything because we've been talking the whole time, I think that's a hint that we can cut down on the chitchat.  The queso appetizer was gross. When I get queso, I expect a creamy, cheesy, DIPPABLE sauce.  This was none of those things. Very hard to eat, the taste was ok, but it was not what I expected. I had some fish tacos, and they were very... meh, as the kids say these days.  And for the price?  I'll probably never go back there, there are SO MANY other great Mexican restaurants around.
