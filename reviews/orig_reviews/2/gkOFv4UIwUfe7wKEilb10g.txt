If I had to sum up the experience this evening it would go something like this: good food, atrocious experience. Here is why:
1) 15 minutes after being seated, the chips and salsa was nowhere to be seen. People seated after us had already received theirs. So what are we? Chopped liver? Our money not as good as others'?
2) Told 2 different people but to no avail. Actually the appetizers we ordered arrived before the chips and salsa.
3) Actually the appetizers arrived before the beverages.
4) Finally, the drinks arrive and they arrive in installments.
5) BTW, the appetizers are on the table but no silverware, no plates.
6) Then the plates arrive: 4 for 7 guests. Must be communal eating. If I wanted to eat Ethiopian style I would have gone to an Ethiopian restaurant.
7) Credit must be given where due. The food was good. However, the drinks were no more than mediocre for the price. A $20 Presidential Margarita was little more than a watered down concoction of margarita mix and sugar.
8) The insult to injury was a $4 charge for a shared item. What bull?
9) The server spent a fair amount of time selling us on his other vocation: fine art. Wanted us to go to his website and buy his fine art.
10) Last but not the least when the server brought out the check, he had the gall to say that he expedited our drinks. Are you kidding me???

These are my top 10 reasons that I will not be coming back. Long story short, this restaurant is not making it into my Rolodex.
