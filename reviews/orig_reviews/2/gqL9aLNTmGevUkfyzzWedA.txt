Eh.  Mediocre tacos, mediocre service.  The food here is just really bland.

After driving all the way from LA through rain and snow for an all-out taco extravaganza with the Vegas locals, this was a major bummer.

Asada: Whatever.  I've had much better at the taco trucks in LA.
Chicken tacos: Not so good. The chicken really lacked any flavor.
Prices: Suprise! They appear low, but they don't tell you it's like $1.50 extra to put toppings on each taco.  They let you figure it out for yourself when you look at your receipt.  Not cool.
Service: Slow.  It wasn't crowded at all (bc all the people who know better are across the parking lot at Tacos El Gordo) but it still took a looooonnnnng time to get our 3 tacos.

The tacos here are big, so just 1 or 2 will fill you up.  But there are much yummier places to eat without spending much cash (like right across the parking lot, for starters).
