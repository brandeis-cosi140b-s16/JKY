We had the absolute most horrific queso fundido of our lives here.    Oily, greasy, paste... yuck.

However, some of the tacos were redeeming.    My chicken was super spicy, my carnitas was too mild - but together they worked well.

My husband didn't particularly care for his lobster (skimpy, more breading than lobster) and thought his pork (not carnitas) was dry.

I really wish we tried harder to find a better place.    

A few days later we did - heaven lies just down the street at Frank and Lupes.

We visited on a Sunday or Monday in September for dinner and were the only patrons.    The economy sucks man!
