Gina is a great waitress.  Have eaten there now three times, fair at best.  The shredded beef is tough.  The rice is boring and the salsa and chips very boring.  Youg might ask why do I go because other people choose the place and I was hoping I might find something I could say was good. We had the fried Ice cream and what should have been nice and crispy(corn flakes) was soft and chewy because they were pre made and kept frozen till ordered.
