So went to eat a late lunch at San Felipe's Cantina on 11/23/2012 . We asked to be seated outside and there was plenty of spots opened. She said that we had to wait and I said there is plenty of seating out there, so we went to the bar. Not more than 5 minutes later did she seat someone outside. I felt like I was being discrimated against. The girl at the bar finally got the manger and we got to go outside. He did give us a free appetizer, but the serve still sucked out there. They never came back to refill drinks. The food is good but the serve SUCKS.
