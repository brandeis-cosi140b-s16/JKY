I waited till my third visit to write a review on Agave.   Going to Agave is probably like dating a ditzy supermodel:

Looks fantastic.    
Gorgeous! inside and out, day or night.  This spot tricks you into thinking you are not in Vegas...and the patio is cute, cute, cute!

Very sweet.     
Yummy desserts and margs (cucumber cilantro gets my vote).

Embarassingly slow.  
All three visits. This last time, we sat at 6, food arrived at 7:14.  Seriously?

Lacks substance.     
Entrees are just ok, def NOT worth the pricing.  White corn chips are horrid (stick to the blue ones).
 

Agave is a great spot to take someone for a drink (you will score bonus points), but eat somewhere else.
