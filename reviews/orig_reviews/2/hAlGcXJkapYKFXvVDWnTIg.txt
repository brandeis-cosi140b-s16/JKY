This place serves frozen supposedly alcoholic drinks, similar to Fat Tuesdays.

They have blue lemonade, pi√±a colada, strawberry, margarita, vida loca, and cherry lemonade to choose from. You can also choose to get two flavors swirled together.

However, I say "supposedly alcoholic" because my boyfriend and I not only weren't able to taste any alcohol (which is fine), after downing a 46 or 42 ouncer together, neither of us could feel any of the alcohol either. And I'm quite the light weight. We ordered less at Fat Tuesdays and felt it.

What a rip-off.
