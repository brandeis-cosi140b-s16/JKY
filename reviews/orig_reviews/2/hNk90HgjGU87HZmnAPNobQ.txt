For being the city that never sleeps I don't get how every food place in this airport closes before 9, except this dump. The service is terrible and I don't completely blame the slow ass server but the stupid patrons are half to blame like the woman that asks opinion on guacamole....just fucking take the fake ass shit or not! This isn't freaking Gordon Ramsey's restaurant! Can't even get a beer in a decent amount of time...thank god I never have to come back to this dump. 2 stars because I feel sorry for the waitress
