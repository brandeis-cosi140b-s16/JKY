I can't speak to the authenticity they claim for Mexico City, but I've definitely had better.

The guacamole was excellent, but the main course was sub-par. I had the pork carnitas and they were OK. The atmosphere was modern and cool, but this is more gourmet mexican than I was expecting. 

I probably wouldn't go there again, but if gourmet is your thing, this might be the place for you.
