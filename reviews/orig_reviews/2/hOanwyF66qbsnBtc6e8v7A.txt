My hubby and I visited Carolina's for the 1st time last week. Our order was wrong. Today we  returned to give them a 2nd chance...in less than a week. Both visits were for take-out orders. Our first take-out order was missing the guac and sour cream that I paid for with my chimichanga. When we returned today I told the gal at the counter and she apologized and said that when it's busy sometimes they forget to include side items. Then she immediately gave me a free side of sour cream and guac to go with my meal. When we got home with our second take-out order my hubby's order was completely wrong! He asked for a beef taco combo plate - he only eats corn tortillas because he is has a gluten intolerance and does not eat flour tortillas. What he got was a cheese enchilada (flour tortilla) and tamale! GEEZ. He could NOT eat the enchilada because of his gluten intolerance and missed out on the tacos he was looking forward to eating. If the staff is aware that they make mistakes when it's busy, why don't they take the time to double check orders before giving them to the customers. I'm sure we are not the only customers to receive the wrong order. Yes, the food is decent, but if I can't get what I order it's not worth going back.
