Totally confusing from the decor, to the ordering "system", to the menu, to the location of utensils, napkins.....the flow of the place is ridiculous. Food was OK.  Guess I dont appreciate stale, flavorless tortilla chips, brown (old) guacamole and peasant cuts of meat. I'll take Roberto's over this joint any day.
