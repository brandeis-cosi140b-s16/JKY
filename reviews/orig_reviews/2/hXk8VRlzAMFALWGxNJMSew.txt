It pains me to give this place 2 stars because I am in love with their tacos, the sauce they put on them is so delicious.

However, what kind of place with a full service menu starts carding at 5 pm everyday!?! I used to come for Taco Tuesday last year, when I was only 20, and have tacos. Sometimes they started carding kind of early (7 pm-ish) but normally they didn't start until around 8. Still a bit early but not outrageously so. I attempted to bring my friend for tacos last week. Even though I am now 21, she is not. We arrived around 6:30 pm, and were told that we could not enter the establishment because she wasn't 21. The bouncer told us they card at 5 pm everyday (earlier on Sundays) and  we could come back with a parent or guardian. UM, not only are we college students whose parents live out of state, even if they were nearby, what 20 year old would even bother doing that?! It's like being under 13 again and not being able to go to the public pool without your mommy or daddy....it's just ridiculous.

The logic of this policy baffles me...there were young children there with their parents eating dinner. I really just don't get the point of letting 10 year olds in with a parent but not someone who is 20...not like it was prime drinking hour!!  Carding at 8-9 makes sense when it started becoming more bar than restaurant, but if you are going to have a full service menu, it's just stupid.

Since Loco Patron apparently did not want our money, we went across Scottsdale Road to El Hefe and had delicious tacos and guacamole. :) They impressed me there, giving us the happy hour deal on tacos even though we arrived just after HH technically ended. Fabuloso!
