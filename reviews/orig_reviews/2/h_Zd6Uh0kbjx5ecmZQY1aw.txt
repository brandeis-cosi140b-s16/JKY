Every time we go to this place the tacos are ice cold. Last nite my wife and I went there for date nite, and it was bittersweet.  I asked the guy to warm up the tacos and he said he couldn't take back food that's been prepared and he didn't have time to make warm ones.  I left the plate there. I went back to the register and was given a reorder which was cool.  The funny and maybe gross thing that happened later was after I had put my finger in the original taco order to see if they were warm and left it on the counter, the guy gives the order to some college kid. The nasty part is, I just had sex, before going there to eat, so this guy was eating what I had on my finger that's now in the food.  Careful what u take for free!!!
