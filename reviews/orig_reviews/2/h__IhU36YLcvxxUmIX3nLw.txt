Let me first start by stating that I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian (meaning I eat eggs and milk products) but no meat or meat products (such as chicken broth, lard etc...) so my two-star rating is informed by that. I usually am successful at finding great food at mexican restaurants since many have transitioned away from using lard in much of there food and provide some fresh, vegetable based options. Not so much at Nando's. After informing our waiter of our vegetarian status, he wasn't sure what was vegetarian or not. After asking the cook staff, we found out that there is lard in the enchilada sauce (UGH!) and beans. We ended up ordering some cheese enchiladas with salsa instead of the regular sauce. 

In terms of what we ate, it was okay. If you like lots of cheese and eat meat, you may love this place! It's your basic mexican restaurant fare (lots of meat, beans and rice) :) Also, the atmosphere was nice (adorable patio) and would consider going back for margaritas. But in terms of food, I'll keep looking for a mexican restaurant with some healthier, vegetarian friendly options and a staff who is confident in what they are offering.
