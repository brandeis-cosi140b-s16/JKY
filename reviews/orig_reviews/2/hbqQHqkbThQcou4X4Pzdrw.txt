I've always liked the Border Grill in Los Angeles, so I thought I'd take my family to the one in Las Vegas while we were there recently. It's cute, and the food is decent enough. But the service is not nearly as good as the one in L.A. We had two vegetarians in the group who absolutely couldn't eat onions--which eliminates 99% of the menu--and the server did not offer to see what he could do to accommodate. Just kind of shrugged and said, "Sorry." Mid-way through dinner, our table of six was forgotten about. No refills on tea or other drinks. We had to really work to get dessert. All in all, definitely not worth the price for this kind of service. Wouldn't return.
