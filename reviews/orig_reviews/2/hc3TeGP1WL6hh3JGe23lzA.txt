To be fair, I have not been here since the renovation, so this review is solely based on their food and customer service. I noticed that they changed their sign outside about a month ago I think, so I guess that's what ya'll are referring to. Moreover, ambiance and size don't make a difference to me unless they greatly impede or considerably improve the enjoyment of my meal. When I went, the location did neither, so my opinion on the matter is neutral. 

So unless their food changed with the renovation, this review will be helpful. On second thought, I would like to add that the floors did not look very clean. Not in a nit-picky sort or way, but in the way that the edges of the furniture and some of the walls looked grimy and dark. Hopefully that was improved by the renovation. 

Let me begin by saying that I know what truly good Mexican food is. This is NOT truly good, authentic Mexican food. It's not gross or anything, but it's definitely nothing special. Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me was that the meat didn't have a good, grilled taste. It almost tasted like they had used liquid smoke to give it a grilled flavor. My husband thought the same. 

However, thumbs up for customer service. I asked for a slight change in one of the orders and they fulfilled my request without a fuss or even an extra charge, which I was willing to pay but was told would be unnecessary.
