I'm somewhat shocked that this place averaged 3 1/2 stars.  Coming from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Mexican food.  From the hole in the one senora style to even the finer dining version of Mexican restaurants, this place was not too shabby. 
First of all, the location is a hit. Right by the canal for viewers to watch gandolas go by, it's a perfect setting. 
Then, munch on some nachos with their salsa and guacamole while sipping on some fruity margarita, dinner seemingly sounds better.
We feel the buzz from our delicioso margaritas so we go the high route and order the most expensive dish on the menu - the AZTEC BONE IN NY STEAK.  It came with the the crab cornbread with truffle butter.  Lets just say that the crab cornbread with the truffle bread saved this order because this side dish was worth going home to write about.  As for the steak, if you love overdosing on sodium or you just came out of a sweaty and exhausting basketball game, then this over salty steak is just for you!  For folks who don't crave that saltiness (that's me), I would not recommend this dish.  We had to ask for it to be redone and the waitress was extremely nice about it.  I can tell the chef or cook was snooty about this because the 2nd steak we got back had absolutely no flavor, just the meat itself.  You can tell easily what the chef was thinking when he was told that the customer didn't like his steak.
I was a big fan of the cornbread.  If you think the cornbread is worth $37 and you have money to dispose, I would give this order a shot.
And so what the steak came out overly salty and then the second one came out tame.  We had the salt from our margarita glasses that we used to pick and press onto our flavorless steak and made the most out of it.

All in all, the cornbread, the margarita, chips and salsa and the setting was good.  Just not the salty and unsalty steaks.  If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Vegas, try Border Grill at The Mirage.
