Pros: Chips, Guac, and Salsa

Cons: Average, uninspired entrees, and a customer unfriendly reservation policy. Even if you make a reservation and follow their rules on when exactly to arrive (11:45 AM) they won't seat you until all of your party arrives. This would be okay if there was room to sit or stand comfortably in the main part of the restaurant, but there's not. It was annoying to see other people without reservations seated while we were squashed against a wall. If we were offered seats at the bar right away, that would have been slightly better, but it didn't occur to anyone to do that until 10 minutes later and our full party had arrived. Poor customer service.
