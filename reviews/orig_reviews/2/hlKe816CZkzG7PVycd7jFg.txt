The food was decent other than the brown/rotting avocados they served and said "that's how they always are".  I grew up in so cal with two huge avocado trees that produce 2000+ avocados a year and avocados aren't supposed to be brown.  It's also very cramped inside, almost no seating available, I think it maybe had seating for like 20 or so people at the most.
