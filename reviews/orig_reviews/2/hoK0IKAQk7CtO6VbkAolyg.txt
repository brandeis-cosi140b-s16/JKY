This place was kind of disappointing. I was excited to try some spicy Mexican food, but it just wasn't that great. I went here with the BF tonight and the service was quite bad. We got there at about 7:45 pm and were seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, about 15 minutes before the waiter even took our order. Then we proceeded to wait about another 30 minutes for our food. Also, the salsa they gave us was spicy, but the flavors were weird and neither of us really liked it much. When our food finally got there, it was also a disappointment. I ordered the combo #1 which was a taco and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada was actually pretty good, with a decent flavored sauce, but the taco was not good. The meat was tough and flavorless. The combo had a chili pepper next to it, so I thought it would be spicy, but it was kind of bland. The BF got a bean and cheese burrito and said it was alright, but nothing special. Maybe people really like this place because of the margaritas, they did look good, and probably would have made the food taste better and the service seem quicker. However, we did not get any margaritas. Also, it was very expensive for what we got, around 23$ with no drinks..... way too much for the quality of food they are serving. We will not be back.
