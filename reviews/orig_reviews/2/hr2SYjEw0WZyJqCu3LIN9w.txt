The skillet fajitas are about the only thing worth getting here. I don't know if I wasn't drunk enough to appreciate the food or what, but it was extremely mediocre.

Chips and salsa are generic, salsa lacks any sort of kick. Not sure why each table gets two bowls of the same salsa either, unless someone made a mistake. Speaking of service, it was also very basic- barely saw my waitress, was never asked how the food was, only got a smile out of her when we got the bill.

I had high hopes for the ahi tacos, but the fish, though fresh, is not marinated or seasoned in any way- rendering the order bland, basic, and boring. For $16, even downtown, it should have some sort of flavor.

Subtracted an additional star for lying about happy hour- HR website says it's 3-7PM, Mon-Fri. Waitress says they don't have one, when I mention the site she states it's at the bar only, and there is no food on it. Not true, but apparently they don't honor it if there's a performance on premises that day. You'd think they'd encourage people to eat on property and spend more money, guess not...
