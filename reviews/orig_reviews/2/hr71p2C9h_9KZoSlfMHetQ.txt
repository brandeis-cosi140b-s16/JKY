My husband and I used to frequent the Henderson location and loved it. We would take friends and family when they were in town so when a new one opened up, we were excited. The environment was nice, different from the Henderson location but that's expected because this is more of a bar theme.

The service was ok. They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long. 

I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired. 

Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand. Finally after bringing it by it took another 10 minutes for him to come get it and the card to pay, despite 1/3 of our party standing up.

Many groups came, ate and left while we were still waiting for our food. We had 3 people in our group so our order was not large. 

I won't be back to this location and probably will skip on the other location too.
