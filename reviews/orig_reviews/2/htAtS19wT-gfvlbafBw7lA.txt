I get dragged here because the hub is a Hawkeye and Sandbar just happens to be the only Iowa bar in the east valley. Saturday morning can be pretty crazy, however don't expect speedy service, or good service for that matter. Not sure what happened this year. Last season the service was much better, the servers were friendly and prompt. 

One Saturday I came with the hub and a group of friends. We ordered  2 breakfast burritos off the brunch menu. 20 minutes later, the waitress came by to verify our order (she didn't even put the order in yet!) 40 minutes later we finally got our food. Our drinks took a millennium to get to us as well. 

Now I get if a bar or restaurant is busy you will wait more than usual, but communicate that to us. "Hey we are swamped right now as you can see, I will get your order to you as soon as possible".  I get when the server has a bad day, we all have them, but it's hard to have a good experience when everyone has on a sour puss. 

To be fair, the food we ordered was hot and tasty. Just wish they would -UP-  the customer service a little more. 

**ALSO be warned, if you open a tab with a credit card, they put an automatic $50 hold on your account, maybe just bring CASH***
