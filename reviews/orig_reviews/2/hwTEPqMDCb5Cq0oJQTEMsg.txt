The Mission evidently has a mission to treat their customers disrespectfully.  We made reservations very early before Saturday.  On Saturday, we called to confirm our reservations.  They had the reservation (it was for 6:15 p.m.) and then said we had to be done and gone by 8:15 p.m.  I couldn't believe it.  I have never had a restaurant every do that.  If they need to manage customer flow, they need to do it with the chef and Wait Staff, not with the customers.  I thought maybe it was some kind of mistake, so when we were there I introduced myself to the manager, reported what happened, and he said, "oh yes, that is completely normal, we have been doing this for five years."  If this is true, it is a terrible idea.
