I really wanted to like it here.  Great location.  Beautiful restaurant.  Delicious looking menu.  The food was very good but not enough to get me to got back. I'm fine with there being a wait when I go out to eat. However, this place is not designed well at all for customers that have to wait. There are no seats at the entrance, no benches outside.  The restaurant is CRAMMED with tables so standing at the bar while you wait is uncomfortable for those trying to find space to stand, let alone those sitting down trying to enjoy their meal. Our waiter was sub-par.  When he finally came to our table, he immediately asked if we were ready to order.  Had to ask another waiter for water, and by the time my margarita was served (only because I had to ask a busser if he could check the bar to see if my drink was up there), the ice was melted. Our waiter never checked on us once our food was served. Overall, good food, terrible layout, poor service.
