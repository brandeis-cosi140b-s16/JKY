Went and tried the jade chicken in a burrito and a carnitas quesadilla, black beans and rice. My favorite thing here was actually the snickerdoodle cookie they serve with the meal. The carnitas were dry and the jade chicken tasted funky in a burrito. I tried it without the tortilla and it was OK but several bites had gristle. The beans were good. The tables were all dirty though the place wasn't crowded. I tried the plum dipping sauce and it really didn't work with anything on my plate so I'm not sure what it's intended for. I think that this is a good concept (Mexican/Asian fusion) but poor execution.
