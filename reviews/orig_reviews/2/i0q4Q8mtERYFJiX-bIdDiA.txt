I've eaten here before, and it's never been great, but NEVER has it been this bad. 

The first thing I want to mention, is that I have very little tolerance for heat. As in, their regular salsa that comes with the chips is on the 'just-a-bit-to-warm' side.

Started the night with mini-chimis. These were OK texture wise, but a small dip into the sour cream obliterated all pretense of flavor.

My Grande Margarita arrived sans alcohol. I didn't order a virgin, but there was either no alcohol in it or so little that there was no sign of buzz on a 6 hour empty stomach.

I ordered the Carne Asada, which normally comes with salsa and hatch chilies. I asked for them to hold the hatch, however a few bites into it - when it finally came out -  the intense heat hit me. I rolled back the cheese on top to see a healthy serving of hatch underneath. Yeah, no. Half my virgin Grande Margarita later and the heat finally started to subside. To boot, the steak had been boiled and over cooked. When we informed the waiter, he was very apologetic and removed it from the bill.

My partner ordered the white sands chimichunga with a side of hatch. (yeah he's a heat nut) Since it's fried and smothered with sauce, it was fairly obvious that it had been sitting awhile given it's sogginess, lack of temp and the beginnings of film on the cheese.

My son's grilled cheese and fries were hot. (painfully hot actually)

The waiter was nice but food was poor and service was very slow, which is why I'm listing at 2 stars.

If you MUST have Arribas, spend the gas and head to the one in Scottsdale.
