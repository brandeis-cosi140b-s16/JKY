We came in for a quick bite to eat before leaving Vegas sat outside and ordered a strawberry Margarita, it was so sweet you can barely drink it.
We also ordered the nachos and chicken wings the nachos were very good I font know about the chicken wings cause my wife had one wing and noticed a hair in her plate and lost her appetite we sent it back they were kind enough to take it off our bill needless to say it was not the Mexican food we are used to here in southern Cali would I go back to Vegas of corse to wabo Cabo don't think so
