Honestly? I didn't care for this place. I get they're trying to be authentic to mexican style of ordering tacos, but we're in America, and it's confusing. 

I speak spanish and I asked for salsa, dude looked at me like I was an alien, they don't speak English so I don't know what was hard to understand.

Prices are too high, flies, meh service, confusing setup. Needless to say we haven't been back.
