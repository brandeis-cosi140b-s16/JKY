Meh indeed. Though Pink Taco must have had its good days it definitely isn't a good Vegas dinning destination. The food was mediocre, the service horrible. 

We had a big group and had to go with the prix fixe menu. We also opted for the all you can drink beer and wine. Drinks not only took forever to arrive but the wine was worse than 2 bucks good old chuck. 

Advice, stay away, gamble away, and treat yourself a much better place.
