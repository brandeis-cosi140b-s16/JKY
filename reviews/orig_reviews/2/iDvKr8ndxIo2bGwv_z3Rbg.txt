My husband was looking for Milanesas. So, we came to this place since they were the only place in Scottsdale that I could find that had any on their menu.

My husband ordered Milanesas, with rice and beans.  I ordered a burrito and taco combo with carnitas.  The Milanesas were not cooked to order.  They were dry and brittle looking.  The meat was paper thin.  The beans were like Taco Bell beans; they were of a watery substance.  Their carnitas were boiled and tasteless.  My burrito had nothing BUT carnitas in it.  Who does that?!!They serve their combo meals with a side of lettuce and tomatoes with a dollop of mayonnaise.  Pretty strange if you ask me.  The only thing I enjoyed was the horchata.  Thaaaat's about it.  

After going to a few places in Scottsdale, looking for AUTHENTIC Mexican food, I have officially given up.  The only reason I gave two stars is because the horchata was really good.  Other than that, the place is a hole in the wall FULL of flies.
