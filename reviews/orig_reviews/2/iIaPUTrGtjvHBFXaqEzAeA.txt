Luckily we learned about the small taco shop on Groupon. We drove past the Glendale location and we thought it was closed. Had to call to double check the hours. Once we walked in, we were greeted by the manager or owner, very welcoming. He offered us some chips and guacamole. Came to find out there was no refill on chips and we had to pay for the guacamole...  I would have liked to enjoyed some chips throughout my meal, not just the first 10 minutes. Me and my boyfriend don't drink soda, so he offered a drink we took water. He brought us the water, but in a PLASTIC CLEAR CUP. Like the ones Circle K gives you. However the tacos we ordered were AMAZING. I had the Carne Asada street tacos. They were delicious. We ate and talked. about 20 minutes later, still no waiter for a refill. I had to get up and walk to the bar for more water. Finally the check comes... we paid in cash and we had decided what the tip was going to be. The change came and the waiter/manager/owner took some of the change as his tip... 

So if you can get past the bad service, getting offered something that should be free, small plastic water cups, then you'll have a great meal. We're going to go again, but to the other location.
