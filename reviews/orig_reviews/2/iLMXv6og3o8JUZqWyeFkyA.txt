We came here on a Sunday night with friends. We were a party of 5, with four adults and one child. First off, the place is gorgeous, beautifully, minimally designed with lovely fireplaces and firepits at just the right spots.

The margarita I drank was very good, nothing outstanding. In Arizona, you better make a better-than-decent margarita or the sheer volume of competition will run you over.

Our friends who live there ordered their usual, the Monterrey, and they loved it. I had one of the restaurant's specialties --- Ribeye Cascabel --- and I was greatly disappointed.

First off, the ribeye is supposed to be one of the most tender cuts of meat from the animal, but nobody told these guys. This was an overcooked, tough piece that was chewy, chewy, chewy. And the cascabel sauce it was supposed to be "basted" in, well, bathed is more like it. Swimming? Drowning? And the sauce was all pepper, no subtlety; two bites into it and my tongue, mouth and lips were burning.  They charge $24? For this? "Meh" indeed.

We didn't stay for dessert and frankly, I wouldn't go back. C'mon, with all the "gourmet" Mexican available in the Phoenix area, why bother with this place?
