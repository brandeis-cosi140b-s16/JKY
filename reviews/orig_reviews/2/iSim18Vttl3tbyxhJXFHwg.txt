My husband and I wanted to try this place for happy hour on a Friday as we had heard good things about the food. 

We arrived at 5 pm and noticed it wasn't very busy. We quickly found out that happy hour is only served at the bar or high top tables, and if we couldn't find a spot we would have to be seated at a regular table and be served from the dinner menu. 

We walked around a bit and noticed almost all the happy hour designated areas were full, with the exception of the sushi bar. Feeling unsure if the sushi bar was really a happy hour spot, we stood around until one of the hostesses came by and asked to seat us again. She seemed rather inconvenienced for having to speak to us despite the fact that the restaurant was 75% empty. 

We said we would be seated and she grabbed some menus and sat us outside on the patio, even though it was really hot and the inside had many open tables. 

At this point we were both feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable, and we took a look at the menu. Though our server seemed to be a little friendlier, we were no longer excited to try the food, nor were we hungry. We didn't want to dine in a place that felt a bit too pretentious. We decided to leave before ordering anything. 

Although the restaurant had a unique vibe and decor and we heard the food was good, we left feeling that it's not our scene, a bit too posh and trendy for a relaxed happy hour to kickoff the weekend. I'm sure it's a great fit for others, but I won't be trying it again. 

Also the only parking available is complimentary valet, which is never really "complimentary."
