Ordered carnitas quesadilla and chips n salsa. Not enough salsa or choice of salsas. No garnish (pico, lettuce, etc) with the quesadilla. Just a little "swipe" of avocado crema. 
Not to mention the restaurant was grossly understaffed for a Friday night.  Everything took a while. Luckily my flight was delayed and I wasn't in a hurry. 
Server was friendly.
