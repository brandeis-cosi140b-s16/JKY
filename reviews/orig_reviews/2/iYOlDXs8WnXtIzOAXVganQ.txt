I know that a ton of people like this place but I've never been impressed.  The spice level is too much to be enjoyable so I tried something that wasn't listed as spicy.  I had the chicken taco salad and the chicken was good but there was no real flavor to the dish.  The Camelback location (where I ate today) did have really good service which is completely different than the experience that I had at the Ahwatukee location awhile back.  So many better options for Mexican food in this area.
