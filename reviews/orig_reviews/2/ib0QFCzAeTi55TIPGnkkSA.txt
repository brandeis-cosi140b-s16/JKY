The decor is nice and our server was attentive. I had a margarita and it was not good for $9.75 I'd expect better. The food was not very good. It lacked seasoning and was luke warm.  It seems like they try to cover up bland food with sauces and or salsa. For the flavor and portion size this place is over priced. We came here because I wanted to try it for my birthday. My husband low key told them it was and they did nothing. Too bad! Nice place but not worth the money.
