Ultimately disappointed. The food is good but just good. One would expect much better quality food with the prices Panchos lists. The building itself is very nicely setup and decorated. The staff is very attentive and friendly also. But $18 for a "queso dip" - listed as an appetizer mind you - that is composed of mostly cream cheese is exactly the type of robbery you can expect from this place! Note: I'm only giving an extra star for the friendly service and warm environment.
