Sooooo super disappointed with my meal. I've watched the Two Hot Tamales on TV for years, when you could only find them on PBS.  So I was pretty excited to have a chance to dine at one of their restaurants. 

My first issue was with the property itself - there's no restroom in the restaurant.  I only wanted to wash my hands so it was more than inconvenient to trek down a flight of stairs to do so (out in the casino).  At a minimum, they should have a sanitizer dispenser available.  I just hope the staff has some place more convenient for frequent hand washing.  Gross. 

Then the service was just so-so.  I had one single refill during my meal and I had to ask for it!   Even then, the waitress took another 'forever' to honor my request.  She came up just as I was heading to the bar to get it myself. 

All of that could have been forgiven had the food been remotely intriguing.  But it wasn't.  The guacamole had some funky twangy creamy action going on.  We trued doctoring it with the tomatillo sauce. My friend's grilled fish tacos were over cooked and served on some stale tortillas.  Other flavors leaned towards bland.  Our other companion had to salt his carnitas.  Turns out, he paid dearly for his selection. He spent much of the night on the throne. My chicken quesadillas were just 'meh'.  I've had better Mexican/Tex-Mex at chains.  I don't expect much from those and in comparison- easily get better.  Really disappointing.
