Ambiance and little else. 

Food was mediocre at best. Going on the server's recommendation, I got the barbacoa tacos. Good, but microscopic. And I had already eaten 2 of the 3 tacos before the topping sides that were apparently supposed to accompany the tacos came out. 

Andy was great: energetic, engaging, and on his game. Best thing about the place. 

Hostess, less so. When I saw on Yelp I could get a free drink coupon from the hostess stand, I went to talk to her, and she said, "Didn't I already give you one?" She hadn't. I get it: a lot of people come through the doors. But is a free drink coupon worth the risk of scolding a customer unwarrentedly?

There's better places out there. Don't waste your vacation on this place.
