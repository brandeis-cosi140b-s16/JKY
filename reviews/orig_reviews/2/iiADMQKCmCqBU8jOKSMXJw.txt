Long story short. The service was ok, brought me my Salad but no dressing. Ten minutes later my dressing arrived. It had a very odd taste. Salty,  but since I put it on the salad I just tried to eat it. My. Husband wasn't pleased with his food either. We have been there several times and really liked it. Something has changed and we won't back.
