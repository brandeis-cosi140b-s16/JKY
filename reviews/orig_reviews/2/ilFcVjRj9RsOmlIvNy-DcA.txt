If I found myself in a nightmare where I was lost in the never ending corridors of the Mall of America and stumbled across a Mexican restaurant, I imagine it would be exactly like Macayo's.  As to why anyone who lives in Phoenix would want to spend their money at this place when there are literally hundreds of quaint, authentic family owned Mexican restaurants in every part of the city is beyond me.  Okay so the food wasn't too bad and it's probably consistant as well.  In fact I'd give the food a 3 since I'm not too picky but the utter soullessness of this place was almost too much to bare!  Green Day was blasting in the bar area where we were seated...and to be fair, I don't mind GD but come on, in a "Mexican" restaurant?...and at full volume?  Maybe it was just a poor seating arrangement and it would've been better in one of the other hundred or so rooms.  More than likely though, this place just isn't what I or any other self respecting lover of Mexican food would consider a good place to eat.  If you love going to theme parks and if you enjoy frequenting night clubs and you want to combine this into your false illusion of a good Mexican dining experience, by all means come here and you probably won't be disappointed.  But for everyone else who actually possesses an ounce of dignity when it comes to where you eat, please do yourself and the local ma-pa Mexican restaurants a favor and visit one of them instead.
