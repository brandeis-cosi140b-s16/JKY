There is absolutely no reason to dine here for Mexican food....it is non descript...no pride in preparation or presentation.  It is just bland food.  Service is very good but that does not make up for bad food....from the chips to the finale'....bad...and very noisy with screaming and misbehaving children.

Try Lindo Michoac√°n on Desert Inn...is was good but hope we can even find one that is better...it is an easy 3 star
