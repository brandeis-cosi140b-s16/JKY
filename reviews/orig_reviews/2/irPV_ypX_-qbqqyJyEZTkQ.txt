My husband and I ate here on a recommendation from a friend. The food here is ok. They use spiciness as a seasoning so all of the food is too spicy to actually taste the food. My husband really likes spicy food and thought everything was too hot as if to make up for actual seasoning and flavor. He had the pork tenderloin and thought that it was bland. (This is one of the items that didn't have peppers.) even the guacamole has to many peppers. Strangely enough the salsa are too bland. Go figure. By far the best thing on the menu is the Caramel flan. Make sure you ask for the sauce on the side. Another plus, the service was very good.
