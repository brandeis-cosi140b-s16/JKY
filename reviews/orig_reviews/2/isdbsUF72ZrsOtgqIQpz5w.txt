My friends have been hyping this place up so I tried it today on a business lunch. I liked the atmosphere. The music and the open feel we nice, and the service was very good. Food came out fast as well. That's about where it ends. I had 3 different tacos, two of which I would probably never order again, with the third being just ok. The chips and salsa were not that good and the rice was average. I think if you wanna go somewhere uber-trendy and way over-pay for tacos that are not that good and are definitely not Mexican food, then this is the place for you.
