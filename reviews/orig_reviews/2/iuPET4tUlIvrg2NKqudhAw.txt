Food was satisfactory, nothing amazing but nothing horrible. Service however was horrible, possibly even drunk! 

Party of 4.
Friday night, 7:45ish.
3 man band playing 90's tunes.

Ordered 3 beers and a water, got the beers in a timely fashion but she must have had to bleed a stone for the water. She dropped off menus and didn't return for about 20 minutes, it was not busy enough to warrant her disappearance.

Ordered mini tacos, steak fajitas and Taco salad with steak, food was as I stated satisfactory. Definitely not a "must have". She forgot to bring the tortillas for the fajitas and the dressing for the salad.

Did get a free beer because one member of our party had to raise his hand while holding his empty beer bottle as a beacon of hope. Manager happen to see it and brought a beer over.

Atmosphere is fun, music suits many tastes, but the staffing could use an overhaul.
