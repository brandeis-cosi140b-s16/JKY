This review is based solely on food and experience. I did not get to partake of any tequilas or margaritas, but I was not looking to drink alcohol on this lunch occassion.

To start with, we ordered some chili con queso. Our server then prompted us, "do you want the white queso, or the chili con queso?". Only the chili con queso is listed in the menu, so I had to ask about the white queso. $5 gets you a small bowl of Velveeta product with some rotel in it. Something you can easily make at home. 

For lunch we ordered a chicken quesadilla (for my partner) and I ordered the chopped salad. Once again, we were prompted with an option that is not listed in the menu- "would you like the small salad, or the large salad?" Our server had a hard time explaining the difference in size, but eventually she got it out. I'm glad I got the small size, but if you want the small size and you want to add chicken to it like I did, be prepared for a $11 salad. The dressing was tossed in with the salad, but I wish I'd asked for it on the side, because I was underwhelmed with the overall flavor of the salad as a whole. The chicken appeared to be pounded out flat, and was dry. Nothing special here.

While we were waiting on our food, I took a look around at some other plates...Now, I get that the tacos are what they're known for, but $11 for two tacos is just absurd in my mind. I am a taco afficianado, and the ones that i saw on other plates just didn't look all that great. Best way to serve a taco is simply corn tortilla, meat, onions, and cilantro. Authentic, and less than $2 at a true mexican restaurant. I get that it's tex mex, but if you're out for authenticity, Paco's Taco's is not the place to go. Venture on to South Blvd, or Eastway if you want the real deal.... you could feed four people for the price of two here.
