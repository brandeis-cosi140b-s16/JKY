I was torn between a 2 and a 3.  A  2 doesn't mean I'll never come back, but it does mean the food is not the quality I prefer from a sit-down Mexican restaurant.  This is one of those casual eateries where the food is slightly better than a fast-food joint but not totally unpleasant. The chips were very pedestrian. The salsas could have been made from canned tomatoes.  If a friend wanted to stop here I'd be ok with it, but if I wanted a nice evening out, this wouldn't be the place.

Other than the food, the ambience was casual and comfortable, everything was clean, and the waitstaff were attentive and friendly.
