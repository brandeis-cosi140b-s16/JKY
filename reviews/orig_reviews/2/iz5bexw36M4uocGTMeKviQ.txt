Spent a long weekend in Vegas for the first time and decided to stop in here. If you ask me what we had to eat, I can't remember. Which is kind the type of place this is. Very unmemorable. The one thing I do remember are the margaritas! The margaritas were phenomenal and the decor was absolutely amazing! Besides that, find dinner elsewhere but totally stop in here for a few drinks.

Service was also terrible considering the prices at this place. So if I do go back, it's for drinks and maybe a seat outside if the weather is nice. Plenty of other places to try in Vegas!
