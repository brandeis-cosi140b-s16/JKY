Food can be better, we ordered a breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros; they were fair. The burrito had white rice, not Spanish rice and claimed to have bacon, but I doubt it. 

Only had 1 huevos instead of the typical 2 like every other place, and paid 9 dollars for a mimosa the size of a 5 oz glass! 

Overall I would go somewhere else, don't bother going here.
