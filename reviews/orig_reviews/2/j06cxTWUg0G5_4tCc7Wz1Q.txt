Every time we come here, the service is horrible. Came in with a crowd of 8 and got sat on the patio. We all ordered drinks from the bar and they were watered down as if they were sitting there. Got 1 order of chips and salsa and never got a chance to get a refill. One of the girls was missing her dish. Couldn't even get the server to tell him. Finally told him and he said they will make it soon. After 15 mins she still didn't get it. They finally came to give her her food and she told them she didn't want it anymore because of the wait. That is ridiculous for her to not have her plate of food and to wait that long. One girl ordered guacomole appetizer and didn't even get a chance to ask for chips. Terrible. Food isn't even good.
