I waited so long to visit this place I finally did last night and had a terrible experience with our drinks and service. Bartenders think they own the place, sour experience with them and their attitude, drinks were returned twice we left after 30 minutes. I didn't have any food but We do not think  we will be back with that customer service & quality of drinks..
