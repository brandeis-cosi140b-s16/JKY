Came to Azteca after a day of shopping in the area and made a last minute change to our dinner plans. Our group wasn't very keen on fast food so we picked a restaurant near our hotel and settled quickly on Azteca. In retrospect, we should have read reviews before deciding on this restaurant. Chips and dip were served when we sat down but instead of red and white sauce we got red sauce and Cole slaw. Kind of interesting for a Mexican restaurant. My dining companion had chicken fajitas, I had the chicken taco salad. The fajitas were very well prepared and the chicken was delicious. The taco salad was not very good. Chicken tasted funny and was served with cheddar cheese instead of the typical Mexican cheese which mixed differently with the chicken. Overall, I would not return to this restaurant but it wasn't too terrible for a last minute late meal.
