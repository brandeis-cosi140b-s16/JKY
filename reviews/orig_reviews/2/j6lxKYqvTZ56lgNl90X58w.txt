My family and I came here years ago and it was the best Mexican retstraunt in town by a mile. 

Over the years the service has declined IMMENSLEY! Not just a service. The food is nothing what it used to be. Now it's just a dive Mexican restraunt using canned enchilada sauce and canned retried beans. Everything used to be homemade, definitely isn't anymore.
