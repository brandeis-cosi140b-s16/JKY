This restaurant is definitely overrated. The only two things I liked about the place were, the over all ambiance & the fish tacos. Everything else tasted basically the same & very average. The sour and acidic sauce overpowered the taste of everything else & gave us a horrible heartburn afterwards. Our food server never checked on our table & we had to wait 25 minutes for our check. I saw he was Overwhelmed with too many tables. Meanwhile the hostess at the podium was just standing there and chatting with her friends and doing absolutely nothing. She could've totally see us waiting for a check and help but she even didn't bother to leave the podium and see what's going on.
