Probably the best tasting food at PHX. However, $9.00 for chips and salsa after I've already bought beer and appetizers is a bad, bad thing. There are enough negative reviews about this specific subject (read below) that the management should take notice and at least make chips and salsa complementary as long as the customer has purchased something.
