One million times "Meh."

Went here tonight before the Coyotes game.  This place was pretty much the only one without a 30-45 minute wait, so we decided to check it out.  (Yes, this should have been our first clue, and we took it - but decided to risk it anyway.)

I remember when this place was Bar Louie and AWESOME, so I already had a grudge going in.

1.  The "new" decor sucks.  I am not sure what the weird symbol has to do with "Calico" or how it all comes together to be Mexican dining, but - whatever.

2.  The wait staff was... eccentric.  All seemed to be new to waiting tables.  (And likely there to get experience to go work at Yard House... lol).  Not bad, just not particularly knowledgeable or quick.

3.  The food is DEFINITELY not great.  We had to choose from an event menu (expected) but the options were all bland.  No signature dishes jumped out at you.  It reminded me of a Taco Bell menu printed on a "nicer" sheet of paper.

They cut a lot of corners here.  The bill comes in a cigar box versus a typical bifold bill holder, the sugar holder is a generic white plastic thing that was hand-painted, and the nachos that we ate were about a 1/5.

We enjoyed not having to wait, but we were talking about what we "would have had" at the Yard House for most of our meal.

Given the vast amount of other options at Westgate, get there early so you can wait for a table and eat somewhere else.
