The cadillac margarita is very disappointing, not enough alcohol. The pink tacos were decent but my tortillas broke apart as soon as i picked up the taco. The service was horrible, we asked to start with guacamole and chips and they ended up bringing it out with our meal. When we told them we didn't want it anymore the waitress shot us a dirty look, she also didn't check up on us at all
