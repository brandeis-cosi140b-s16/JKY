I'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips. Sorry, it's just a standard by which I live by. The chips were nothing special and did not taste freshly made (closer to store bought which wouldn't be a surprise). The salsa was 95% water which is a bummer. We had to ask for extra because there wasn't much substance. 

I ordered the sampler platter dish which came with a little bit of everything. The taquitos were yummy, but that was about it. I smothered most things with guacamole to make it edible and left about half the plate. My friend had the tacos and seemed just fine with them.

The service was awesome until we were looking for the check to leave. Then we had a hard time finding our waiter. If you like Taco Del Mar you'll be satisfied, however I expected a LOT more out of a mexican restaurant in Phoenix.
