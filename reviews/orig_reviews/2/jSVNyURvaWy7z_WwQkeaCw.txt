big time meh.  maybe 1.5 stars.  only went because we were short on time for a show and had a credit on restaurant.com.
 
we were seated immediately, but the server took almost 10 minutes before coming by.  we ordered and she quickly brought waters.  drinks took a little bit long. 

our ceviche appetizer came, delivered by another server, who noticed we still hadn't received chips and salsa. smh.  ceviche was bland; the shrimp was not "cooked" in lime juice.  I had to grab our server to get another beer. she was very inattentive and or overworked with too many tables.

my lady had the chille rellano which was decent, but not great, even though I love skirt steak.  I had the shrimp fajitas which were also just okay, although there was a good amount of shrimp.

even after piling some of our plates at the edge of the table, it took another 10 minutes to get a dessert menu. 

next time we will go to Ri Ra with their awesome local discount.
