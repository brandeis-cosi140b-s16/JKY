Customer service and friendliness of staff and manager a ten. Food not so much, burrito bland and soggy. Burrito at food court across the street operated by Mexican wayy better burrito and much cheaper. Mexican corn was also a bust! Had better corn for cheaper from street vendors growing up.
The chef needs to sample and test authentic Mexican establishments and rebrand.
The margarita too sweet low on tequila. May come again if the joint across the street is closed...
The manager is awesome though and the staff! :-)
