Whoever said this place has good food, doesn't know what good food is! The food was bad! Way too salty, cheese tasted like crap. The service was pitiful! I ordered water and guacamole at the same time, and the guacamole came 10 minutes before the water? The guacamole was basically avocado and onion, that's it! The chips were all broken and stale. The only reason this isn't 1 star is because they had horchata and they were inexpensive and close to the airport. My advice? Skip it!
