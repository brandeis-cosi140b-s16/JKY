Duck and lamb tacos? Are you freaking kidding me?! If you're branching out into unconventional stuff but can't make a decent carnitas or carne asada taco, you should rethink your restaurant. Taco Guild is all flash, no substance. It's biggest saving grace is it does have decent local beers on draft and some nice cocktails. Come for the ambiance and drinks, not the food.
