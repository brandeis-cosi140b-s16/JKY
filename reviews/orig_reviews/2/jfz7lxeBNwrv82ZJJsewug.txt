My wife and I, who are vegetarians, ordered a couple tofu burritos and we each found a chuck of meat in ours.  Additionally, the staff misplaced our take-out ticket so it wasn't ready when we arrived and once it was made, they forgot an ingredient.  I would give this place one-star, but when we called the manager, he was very kind and offered a free meal.  Because of him, I'll give it another try, and I may potentially update this review.
