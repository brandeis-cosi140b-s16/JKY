It was okay. The pigs fly buns were good and so were the dumplings, but the rest was pretty average. The pork spicy noodles and the tacos I would never order again. Good atmosphere and fun fit out but pretty average food. And while we are onto it - a $20 vegetable fried rice, we didn't order it but what a joke!!! Who are they kidding!!
