Ok, so it hurts me to give 2 stars because Phrank was one heck of a guy. He greeted me immediately and was very social, I love these kind of people! I order and give him my debit card, he comments on my name, and from then on when he addressed me he called me by my name, I mean how nice is that? I ordered the trainer salad ( I really really really wanted the nachos, but summer is coming) when it was placed in front of me, it was different than what I expected, everything was separated, didn't look like a salad, oh well, my fault for not reading the menu. The hot sauce and the tomatillo sauce had decent flavor, but the more chicken I ate, I kept drinking more and more water. I found it to be very salty. My lips started getting that feeling when all your water in your body is being depleted. I'm sorry, wasn't a phan of the salad Phrank. I may return to try the fish tacos.
