I tried their other location and it wasn't all that great but I was recovering from being sick so I decided to give it another try. Onsti wasn't impressed. Their ordering process is horrible and confusing. I didn't know who was in line and who was before and after me. 

The chicken taco was actually really good. The chicken was flavorful. I did not like the carne asada  taco at all. Got a huge piece of gristle on my first bite and that killed it for me. Husband got the al pastor but didn't like it either. Lacked flavor. 

The Mexican corn was good but cold buy the time it made it to my tray. It cost 35 dollars for two adults and four small kids (10 and under). Pricey and not that good.
