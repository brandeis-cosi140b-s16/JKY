Had dinner here last night for the first time. A little worried because of all the negative reviews. Arrived around 5:00 to a 10 min wait (no biggie). While waiting we got to hear the manager hit on the hostess, so at least we had entertainment. Seated and waited 10 min. For our server to appear. Seems like they were short handed because she said she was very busy. Order waters and queso, which takes another 10 to get. Then had to wait another 10 to order  (not even kidding). So 40 min after arriving we order, still waiting.  Had to ask a hostess for refills, which never came. Food finally arrives and is not too bad, but have definitely had better. The best part was the queso, it was delicious. Could be a good place but service sucks, which I think is due to understaffing, not waiters fault. Probably won't return as this is the main complaint you hear about.
