Had four different tacos last night. You aren't going for the decor or ambiance...service was good, but the food was meh....land taco was very good....soft shell crab was pretty good. Skirt steak was ok...hard to differentiate flavors and items sort of tasted the same...same flavor profiles...went to Jacks across the street to wash it all down!!
