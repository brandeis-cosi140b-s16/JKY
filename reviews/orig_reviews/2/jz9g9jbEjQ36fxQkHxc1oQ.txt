Carne asada is alright, but you've gotta put more effort into your food than handfuls of shredded cheese on most menu items. On my second visit, I opted for the green chile burrito...the tortilla was nothing special, and the chile was bland. You call THAT a green sauce?

As the green, gravy like mixture spilled everywhere, I tried to enjoy it with some tortilla chips. Their chips aren't anything special either. I like the salsa bar and the atmosphere, but when it comes to a quick Mexican dining experience, I know you can do tons better. I don't hate this place, but the bar is set higher in the desert.
