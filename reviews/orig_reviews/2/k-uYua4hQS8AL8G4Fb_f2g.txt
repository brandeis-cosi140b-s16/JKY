Cool layout looks like a fun place. Great location in downtown Chandler. Overpriced food and not that tasty. There is not reason a fast food taco shop should cost 35 bucks for two people to have a burrito 2-3 tacos as small as they were, 1 margarita and and a beer. The tacos were the tiny street tacos that are usually 99cents at most places. Wouldnt reccomend.
