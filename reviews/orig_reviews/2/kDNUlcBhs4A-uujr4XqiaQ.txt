A bit disappointing.  The food is edible, but nothing to swoon over. Its a trendy little spot that relies on hipsters. Think white guys in sweater vests wearing Kangol hats with women in pashminas and colorful cowboy boots. The bartenders appeared to be required to mix all their drinks over their heads.
To call the food there Mexican would be a bit of a stretch. Possibly Mexican inspired or if you want to stick with trendy nomenclature Mexican fusion, but definitely not something that makes you think that there is a pack of a Mexicans in the kitchen. 
The mole sauce on my dish was quite thin and bland, and the yucca fries were tragically flavorless. The chicken was well cooked but poorly seasoned. The side of black beans was delicious but seasoned in a way that make me think of India, not Mexico.
The dinner was by no means unpleasant, but I'm not going to be racing to get back there.
