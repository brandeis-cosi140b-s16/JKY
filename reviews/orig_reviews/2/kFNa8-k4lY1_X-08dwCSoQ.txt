I am only reviewing for the drinks and atmosphere on Saturday night. We made it there after dinner at ACE. We were out in the patio area. It was a little warm, but not too bad. Got a table facing the huge glowing TV out in the common area of Tempe Marketplace. I think you can probably tan from this. LOL! 

Getting drinks were OK wait. No one came by to clear the table off (drinks from the last group). Drinks were good, price was OK. All of a sudden the music got loud and some waitresses jumped on the bar tops and started to dance and give away shirts, plastics lays, and straw hats. It was OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 40 somethings...   Nothing special!
