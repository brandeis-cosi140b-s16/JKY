I was drawn to this place because of the historical building and quite frankly, that's where the quality started and ended for my husband and I. 

Service was very disjointed and food was average at best. I was particularly disappointed in my 8.00 cocktail which was their take on a Salty Dog (one of my favs) that tasted like watered down grapefruit juice from a mix. Other flavors promised were nowhere to be found.  They advertise using local farms... How about some
Fresh squeezed juice?

Probably won't be back. I'd drive to Mexico first.
