Dinner wasn't bad.  Had the salmon and it was decent.  Food wasn't overly hot, though.

The mojito I had was the worst I've ever experienced.  The bartender stuck whole mint leaves in a glass, added lemon-lime soda and maybe a touch of rum.  It was undrinkable.

It's a decent choice if you don't want to spend a fortune and you're in the HRH.
