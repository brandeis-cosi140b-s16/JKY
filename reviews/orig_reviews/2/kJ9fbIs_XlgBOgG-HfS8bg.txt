Unimpressed. It's very pretty and has an interesting menu to read but for the prices charged, I was very disappointed in the lack of FLAVOR in the dishes. The only thing that was even remotely interesting was the salsa served with the chips. As an Arizonan, it's by default that we eat a lot of Mexican food. I've had way better. It's too high priced for the lack of flavor.
