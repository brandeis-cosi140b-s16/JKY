The wait staff was exceptionally pleasant and efficient, and the ambiance was great, but my list of nice things to say ends there. The tacos seemed to universally use poor cuts of meat, meaning it was full of gristle and fat. My barbacoa taco came out cool to the touch, leaving me wonder how something that was slow cooked could have cooled down. The steak they replaced it with was hot, but also chewy. They did remove these entrees from our bill, but even with the pleasant staff, I'd be hard pressed to return. I'd rather hit up Las Palmas for a taco any day.
