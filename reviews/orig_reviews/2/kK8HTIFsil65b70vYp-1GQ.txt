The food was so-so. The place was clean and the service was decent. Ordered the carne asada fries and actually think the meat, sour cream and guacamole would've been better on fresh tortilla chips than on fries. Also would've preferred real shredded cheese vs. liquid cheese. Overall, I'd only give it 2 stars. Was more fast food Mexican than what we'd prefer.
