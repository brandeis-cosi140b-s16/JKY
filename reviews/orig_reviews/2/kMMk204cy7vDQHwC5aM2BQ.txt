Just had lunch there.  It is a nice place and our waiter was good.  The food was pretty tasteless.  I had the tortilla soup and chopped salad.  The portions are tiny considering the prices they charge.  My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.  The soup is simply tomato with some fried tortilla strips and Mexican cheese.  My wife had a burger that was nothing special.  The bill including  a standard tip was $87.00.  No reason to come back.
