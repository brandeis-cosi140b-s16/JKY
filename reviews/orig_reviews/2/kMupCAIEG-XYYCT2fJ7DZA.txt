My first time here and probably my last. It really is not very good. It's definitely not mexican. It's as mexican as Taco Bell. But I rather go to Taco Bell. I got the steak salad. It was good but it's just very normal. For $10? That's too much. I can easily make it a home. The good thing I have to say about this place is that the ranch lemon sauce for the salad was delicious. I would buy a bottle of it. If I HAD to come back I wouldn't mind eating this again. But my mom got the burrito and she ate my salad with me because she hated the burrito. It was Barbacoa. The meat was pretty good. But that sauce. The sauce they put on top was so gross. One of the worst I've ever tasted. Completely ruined the burrito. I also tasted the rice and it was super bad. I only wanted to try it so I asked for a little in my salad. I had to take it out because not even my would would eat it and she eats almost anything. 
I would never come again unless I had to. And I would eat the salad with the awesome sauce.
