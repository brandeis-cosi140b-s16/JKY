I read the negative reviews and my exact thoughts were; "Well, some people are jerks and nothing makes them happy. It probably isn't as bad as they say." Wrong.  Save yourself some money, soak some cardboard in warm water, place it on a warm corn tortilla, and eat it.  It isn't that the food tastes bad.  It's that it doesn't taste like anything at all.  I got a taco platter with three different types of tacos, pork, chicken, and beef.  They all tasted exactly the same, like an empty, warm, corn tortilla.  The only reason I gave them two stars was for the excellent wait staff.  Doesn't make up for the flavorless food.  Wouldn't even feed the leftovers to a dog.
