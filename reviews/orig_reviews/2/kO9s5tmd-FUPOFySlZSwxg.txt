Just had Father's Day lunch here. Enjoyed the food but not great service. Our server rarely came over. I was thirsty for more water 90% of the meal. Needed more salsa and had to ask someone else because our server was nowhere to be found. I get it when things are busy you cannot be everywhere but she didn't even acknowledge that we were clearly being neglected. That was my first time so could have been random bad experience.
