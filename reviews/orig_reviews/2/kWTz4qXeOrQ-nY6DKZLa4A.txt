I'll start by saying that I really like Cafe Rio's food. 

Now - this location I've been to 4 times since it's right by my house. Normally I go to the one by UNLV. 

At this location, every single time they have messed up an order or I've gotten the wrong food. Like another reviewer said, I've also been overcharged , although mine was for add-ons that I didn't order and didn't receive. One of the workers, who has been there everyime I have, basically ignores you when you order, and just puts everything on your order even if you ask for it without. 

The service is also incredibly slow at this location. If the one by UNLV can handle the college lunch rush plus take out and catering, there is absolutely no reason why this location can't. If you're in line in-store, your food will sit and get cold while they blatantly ignore you and instead fill an online or catering order. But if you order online, they don't even start the order until you get there to pick it up- and even then, it sits by the cashier who is clueless as to who the order belongs to.

If you don't mind slow service and get getting what you order or pay for, then this place is fine. Otherwise, just avoid this location.
