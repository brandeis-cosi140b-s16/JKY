If you're gonna eat tex-mex in the downtown phoenix area, this is your best bet. 

I typically go here every time I come to Phoenix, and it's pretty great. the outdoor seating with the Grotto view is really really gorgeous. 

The chips and salsa are FANTASTIC!!!! You get an assortment of chips and they are the best I've ever had. 

The blackened fish tacos set my mouth on FIRE. I had no idea they would be COVERED in chili powder. too extreme for me. 

Typically you get, white chocolate wrapped in a tamale leaf to cleanse your pallet after you are finish with your meal, which is one of my favorite parts of dinner ... but our waitress forgot :( ... definitely ask! 

I would say this is your typical "mexican/southwest" restaurant, where the entire menu is basically variations of taco salad, 10 different variations of quesadillas, and tacos of some sort, and 3 pages of different margaritas and drinks with "loco" in the name. 

Not too bad, not great either. I personally prefer the Greek place next door :)
