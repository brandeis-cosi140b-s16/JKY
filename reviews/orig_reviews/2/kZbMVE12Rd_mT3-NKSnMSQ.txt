I'm disappointed that people actually go here with all of the other choices around. If you're accustomed to the spicier flavors found in the southwest, the food at this restaurant will taste bland. 

The chips and salsa are nothing special- it's very much like buying a bag of yellow corn tortilla chips and name-brand salsa and putting it in a bowl. I've had the enchiladas here (the sauce is very tomato-y) and a couple of different combination platters with tacos, chile relleno, tostada etc. Overall, everything was very bland and uninteresting. I don't eat rice and beans unless they're particularly tasty, needless to say I took one bite of each and left them alone. I've also had an appetizer sampler with quesadillas, nachos, and taquitos- it was tasty while drinking but for the price, it's a better deal to put such a snack together at home. 

The redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio. It's set up in such a way that very little sun gets in, and there are misters all over. The breeze blows just right so it's always nice and cool outside, even in the middle of the summer. 

This might be a good option to come for some drinks and hang out on the patio, but don't expect to be impressed with good Mexican food- you are looking in the wrong place!
