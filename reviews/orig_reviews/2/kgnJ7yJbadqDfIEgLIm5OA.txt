not impressed at all.  it very rarely happens, but my fellow yelpers steered me wrong.  took way too long for our food to come out (30+ mins), the queso was almost inedible and the entrees were VERY disappointing.  i ordered the ol' #1, aka - 1 taco, 1 enchilada and rice & beans.  i always order this on my first visit to a mex restaurant, because if you can't get this right, you can't get anything right.  it was bland and the only thing worse than the food was the portions (i stole that from woody allen).  

i would not recommend this place to anyone from out of town, because it falls very short of the mex you can find in other cities.  

my search continues for the good mex spot in the QC...
