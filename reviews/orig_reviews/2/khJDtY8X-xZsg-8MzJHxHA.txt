I have been recommended to barrio cafe by a coworker in the culinary field, he told me it was really good authentic mexican food, and I was really excited and looking forward to try it since I am mexican and have experienced food from mexico city. 
The place is very nicely decorated, the bar has a big variety of tequilas and the music is spot on.
The appetizer had a very nice taste , not too salty, just right for a tapenade.
We ordered the famous guacamole, which was also different from what you normally see, but to my taste it had too much lime juice, which made it a bit sour. 
I ordered the horchata and it came in a coca cola bottle, which was unique and very good!
i also decided to try enchiladas suizas, my husband had the pozole and my mother the chile en nogada
The enchiladas to my taste were not that great, dry and the chicken came in huge chunks and also very dry. Un seasoned vegetables and no hint of tomatillo.

The chile en nogada was the best of the three, nice flavor and good presentation. 
My husband honestly did not like the pozole, he thought it was salty, and he found pomegranate in it, which was too much. 
The best thing of our meal was the service, excellent customer service!
