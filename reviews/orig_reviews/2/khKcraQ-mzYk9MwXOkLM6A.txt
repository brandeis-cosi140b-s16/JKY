Bad service!!
First off the bar was sticky...a bit gross.
Ordered a pork dish, but they brought me the wrong one...the guy down the bar got mine... For as expensive as this place is that's really unacceptable.   Rather than make a fuss I said I was fine... There was no offer for a free drink or anything for the mistake...would have been a nice gesture...
The waiter did say to someone that a mistake happened but we were both fine...   He could have been much better.

Overall the good was good but a bit heavy.  The service was a total failure,
