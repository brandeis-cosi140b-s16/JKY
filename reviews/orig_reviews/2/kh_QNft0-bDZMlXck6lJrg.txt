I really wanted to like you Verde. The atmosphere is super fun at this little gem in Garfield, but the blandness of the food/drinks/staff was just sad.

We came here later in the evening hoping to sit on the patio for some drinks-the place was empty and the less than charming hostess told us we couldn't sit on the patio unless we ordered food.

So, after looking around at all the open tables inside and out --perplexed we walked inside where the bartender said we could sit out at this cute couch set up outside. Hooray! We ordered chips and salsa and margaritas. The margaritas were meh, and the chips and salsa tasted like they were from Giant Eagle. I hate to complain but if you are a Mexican restaurant you should, baseline, have delicious margaritas and chips and salsa....sigh.

Pros: atmosphere, cute couch setup
