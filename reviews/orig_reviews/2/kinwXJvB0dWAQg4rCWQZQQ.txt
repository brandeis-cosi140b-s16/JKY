This place happened to be really close by while we were waiting to check into our hotel.  Unfortunately, this place wasn't good at all.  I ordered the fish tacos.  They weren't very well seasoned and the salsa was pretty bland.  The cheese dip was probably the worst I've ever experienced at a restaurant and that's saying a lot given the amount of Mexican food I eat.  The only decent thing I had was the margarita (although severely overpriced) because it's hard to go too terribly wrong with tequila.

Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place.
