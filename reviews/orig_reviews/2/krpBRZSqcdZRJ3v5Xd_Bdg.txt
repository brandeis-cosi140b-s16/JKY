The place was clean, the service was great, the food was nothing to woohoo about.  I have been there twice, the food is consistently the same bland and boring stuff.  The salsa is just a step above Pace picante, the beans are not good, and the rice was the same.  If you have never had 'good' Mexican food, then you will probably love this place.
