Being local Las Vegans, we wanted to check out The Linq. I looked online prior to check out HH. Also noticed 20% off food for locals on Monday, which it is. On our way in we saw some of the food on the tables. Portions were very small. Our waitress came over, very pleasant. Told her we were there for happy hour. She took our drink order and we asked about food special for HH. She said there weren't any. So I mentioned the 20% for locals on Monday. She said we couldn't combine HH with the Locals discount. Pretty crappy. We ordered the chips and salsa for $3. Thought it was delish. Hubby had three draft beer and I had the 2/1 margueritas. The waitress was kind enough to put my second drink in a to go cup. The marguerita was good. Service was pretty slow and it was not busy. So that was a little disappointing. The decor was nice and if it was cooler outside, the patio would be nice for people watching. But I came away feeling it was a bit "tourist trappy". Would do HH for the margueritas, chips and salsa if I happened to be in the area but I don't see myself going back to the Linq.
