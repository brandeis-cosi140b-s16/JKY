What a disappointment. From the outside and menu selection, La Comida showed a lot of promise. However, when the food arrived, things quickly went downhill. This restaurant is not authentic, and the food just isn't good. 

We ordered queso fundido. It's basically melted cheese and extremely hard to mess up. I've eaten this appetizer a million times at a million restaurants. The only way you can ruin this is by buying the cheapest cheese that probably isn't meant to be melted. There was a think layer of grease over the cheese, and it tasted like rubber.

My tacos were okay. My margarita, which I take very seriously, was a joke and completely overpriced. That's the problem with this place. The food is mediocre and way overpriced.
