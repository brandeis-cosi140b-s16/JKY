I keep getting dragged here for group lunches and dinners.  It's never great. In fact, I don't understand why it's rated so high, especially with number of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. . The chips taste off like the oil's been used for 9 other things first.  The salsa is ok. The service is ok. The entrees are one step below ok. Whatever you order will come mushed together on your plate, welded together with cheese.  I have friends who love getting their free birthday dinner or sitting at the bar for a 'dinner' consisting of beer and chips.  If that's your thing, ok.  But don't expect much from the food. Upside is it has a decent parking lot so it's not hard to park.  There are no stairs to get in and out but navigating once inside the restaurant is tight. Wheelchair patrons should call to ask for seating in advance (my suggestion, not a restaurant requirement).
