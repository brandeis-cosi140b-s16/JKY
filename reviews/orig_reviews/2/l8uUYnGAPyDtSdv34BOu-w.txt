I went here for dinner and food was okay.

I went here for a night out and it was packed. The music was not that great and neither was the crowd.  The bouncers gave us a hard time with our IDs because we were out of state. I would not recommend this place for a night out.

I would however recommend this place for an afternoon football game and some beers.
