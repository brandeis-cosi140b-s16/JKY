Food was not good.  Had the steak nachos and the beef tasted like it had been frozen.  No flavor with a rubber texture.   Also had the empanadas, not bad, but after the horrible nachos and bad queso fundido (cheese was not melted), the meal was ruined.   Add the loud rap music being blared on the loud speakers and the $84 tab for horrible food, it was quite a bad dining experience.  Would not recommend.
