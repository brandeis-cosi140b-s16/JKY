This place served extremely strong margaritas and decent food but the service was HORRIBLE!  Our server was nice but completely remiss in attending to our needs.  Two of my friends sent their food back to be rewarmed and it took forever for us to eat despite having been ready to place our orders almost immediately.  Don't go unless you have a lot of time to wait around as they seem completely disorganized.
