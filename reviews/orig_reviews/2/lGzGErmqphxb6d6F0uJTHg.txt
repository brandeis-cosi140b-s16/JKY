Been here twice now while visiting good'ol AZ and its hit or miss. The first time was way better then the second visit, not sure if they just had an off day the second time around or what but this second time was a little disappointing. The Avocado pineapple margarita was two thumbs down, tasted like cheap tequila and water and even though it had chunks of pineapple I have no clue where the taste disappeared to. The first time we went was because of the pork belly and yes it was good the first time, this time it tasted like old, over fried carnitas. The street corn was sour, waaaayy too much lemon or lime juice on it And the queso appetizer was straight up gross! Better off just heating up some cheese whiz. I'm giving two stars because the first time was better, hoping this second time was just an off day and service is pretty good.
