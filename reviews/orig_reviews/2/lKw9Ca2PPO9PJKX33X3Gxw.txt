Since "Taco" is the first name of their restaurant, you would think that would be their emphasis.  Not so much.  My family and I ate there on Sunday.  Service took too long,and the tacos were bland , steak was dry, and the corn tortillas were small for the price.  Chips and salsa were good.  Breakfast burrito was fair.  I would not go there again.
