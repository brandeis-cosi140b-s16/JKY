Arriba makes an attempt to create New Mexico food in a generic kitchen - the result is decent food in my opinion - just not great food.  The spiciness is just right and there is a good compliment of green and red chile, and good variety of options.

The real issue I have with this restaurant is the service.  I keep going back periodically (not often) as I'm drawn by the food, along with convenience and reasonable prices - however, every single time the service is poor at best.  The servers are pleasant when standing at the table, but once they are gone - they're gone! - no place to be found!  You can get parched of thirst, have a mighty hungering for another chip, or be waiting on your bill - they just disappear - and this has happened every single time I've been there!  This is really probably more of a management and training issue - as it really seems to be the culture of the establishment.
