Walked inside and liked the change from Lolita's previous decor. We were there at about 3:00 on Sunday. About 1/3 of the restaurant was occupied. They told us there would be a 10 min wait!!! Confusing. I wanted to try this place. But not gonna wait when it's not busy. Had to leave. Found I love burgers 100 ft away;) so far so good.
