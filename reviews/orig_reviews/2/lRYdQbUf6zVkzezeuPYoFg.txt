The only thing that saved this horrid place from 1 star was the manager.  We tried this Saturday night with a  Groupon...nothing else would have motivated me to come here.  10 minutes to get a drink order.  Menus came out that didnt remotely match the website-they were the Spring Training menus (in October) due to their having an event...which I surmise was a lousy band outside.  Manager said he would try to make anything on the online menu happen-but no menu to provide so there we were looking on our phone to order.  Ordered the Steak avocado salad and a fajita burrito.  Tried to get th efamous fundido...sold out at 8pm.  We waited while my wife had a sugary mango margarita with a thimble of booze for a mere 8 bucks and I got a bottled SOL for $4.50 because evidently none of the tap beer worked.  Dinner came-Salad was basically a bowl of raw chopped white onions, burrito steak and hardly any greens.  My wifes fajita burrito was wet and basically full of rice for $13 with a cup of crusty refried beans.  The manager stpped in to check frequently and I felt bad for him as he was dealing with a complaint at every table surrounding us.  Even the Groupon couldnt save this place.  2 stars based on management effort...otherwise this was really a 1 star joint.  I think they are there to provide booze before a Padres/Mariners game in the spring.
