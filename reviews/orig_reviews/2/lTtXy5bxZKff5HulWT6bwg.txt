This is my first trip to Nacho Daddy.
Unfortunately, I've better had better experiences at other Mexican restaurants.

For starters, I didn't know the chips with salsa wasn't complementary like other places. I wish the waitress had mentioned that beforehand, other than that the service was good throughout.

I ordered the enchilada trio plate, it was okay but nowhere near justification for the price they charge $14.95.  I couldn't tell I got three enchiladas, they looked all mushed together aside from the sour cream, guac, and the pico on top of it.  I felt the ground beef needed more seaoning it tasted dull. They did give me lots of rice and beans I guess that's  something.

Overall, I feel comfortable going elsewhere.
