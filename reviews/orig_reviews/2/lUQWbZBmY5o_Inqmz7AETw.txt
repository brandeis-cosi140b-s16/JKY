I give this joint two stars, mainly for service.  Staff wasn't overly friendly, but they were attentive and efficient.  Zero stars for food.  Chips were ok, but only one of the three salsas they brought was tasty.  It seemed like they were trying to be original with their unique salsas, but something just went wrong and they weren't good.  I had the Baja fish tacos, which were the worst I've ever had.  The fish was ok, but bland.  The tortillas were pasty, like they were undercooked.  The rice could have been Rice-a-Roni, but it wasn't even that good.  The beans were the one thing I ate most of.  My friend had fajitas, and the meat was tough.  They brought her tortillas wrapped up in a cloth napkin, that kept them warm for about two minutes.  All that combined with weird lighting, which gave the place a cool atmosphere but made the food look even less appetizing (a green light right above the table?) just made the entire experience bad.  I won't try this place again.
