Ngah. I wish the food was as good as the view. If you enjoy alcohol with your meal, you'll probably get tipsy enough to gloss over how mediocre the food is. And if you're fine with sloshing hot sauce on the main dish then you're probably not very picky about whether the meat tastes gamey or the tortillas greasy. Maybe we got unlucky, or maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I ate at the DI location about a decade ago and remember it tasting equally disappointing.

Servers were friendly and helpful, even while comping half of our meal; chips and bean dip were above average, but so too were all the prices. Water was clean tasting if you care about that sort of thing. View is fantastic. And I really disliked the food.

We would love to find just one meal here that works for our cursed picky-eater super-taster palates, so we'd have an excuse to come by and enjoy the view and friendly service. Who knows what it'll take to come back, though.
