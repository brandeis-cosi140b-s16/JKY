Beautiful room, but hit and miss on the food. Great selection of specialty margaritas, but most of them were too sweet.  The calamari was good, the taquitos too, but the tortilla soup was not good, and the corn cakes were even worst.  The chicken empanadas were marginal.  We had a very sweet waitress. Very good at her job.  Overall, will not go back
