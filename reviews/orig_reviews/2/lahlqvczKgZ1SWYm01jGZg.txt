Dear Yo Rita bartender/server:

I realize that I may have come about it all wrong.  That is, I was happy and excited to go to Yo Rita's after being away from Pittsburgh for awhile.  I could see that you were busy, all the tables were full which is why my friend and I sat at the bar.  But after waiting 10, 15...minutes to order?  And then, a male couple who came in after my friend and I received:  table settings, with knife and fork (!) wow, I had no idea since we did not get these things, they heard the Daily Specials, something you did not tell us.  And although they came in after us, you took their order first.  And we did want more drinks, but it would have been nice to have them during the meal, not after we were finished.  Oh well.  Maybe you just figured you were going to get a bad tip?  But you see I waited tables in college so I tip well.  Well I do when I get good service.  I also like going to back to great places, with excellent food and service.  So you can imagine I won't be coming back.
