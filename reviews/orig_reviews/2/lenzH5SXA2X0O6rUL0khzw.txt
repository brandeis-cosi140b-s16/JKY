I've been here in the past and not had a bad experience but my most recent visit on 7/12 was not good.

So we go on an uncrowded Saturday around 4pm.  We are seated promptly and they take our order.  The whole point of going was to get a big nacho platter they have.  Well we order that and two entrees and guess what. No nachos ever appear.  

We remind our waitress of  this when our food arrives ahead of our appetizer and I gotta say she was  dismissive about it,  "Oh I forgot."  Forgetting what we ordered really isn't okay and you need to try and make amends not just ask if we still want it.

The food we did get was only alright. I got one of the Pittsburgh themed burritos and wife got a California burrito.  Both were just okay.

The place is clean but the bathroom door handle for example  was broken and a staffer was in there talking on their cell phone. 

All in all I sad to see this place start to slide.
