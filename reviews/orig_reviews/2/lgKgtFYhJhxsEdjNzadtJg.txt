Nifty little hipster burrito joint. Food is decent, service is mediocre. Don't expect anyone to be too friendly or accommodating. Burritos are large, steak could use a little more seasoning. Apparently there is a salsa bar, but it's well hidden. I guess in a rush, with not too many options around, it would do the trick. But it wasn't really worth the hunt.
