The goods: chips and guacamole, ca√±onita margarita, mojitos, and... Um....

This place is great for resting your feet and chomping some chips to absorb the remainder of last night's alcohol. Having a margarita will chase that last shadow of a hangover away. Just don't expect to be in a hurry or to be at all dazzled by the food.

An hour into our meal, our dishes arrived and were flavorless and UNCOOKED. Plates seemed like they weren't clean and service was excruciatingly slow. As many other reviews state, this isn't a place to enjoy much of anything other than drinks. As it to your Las Vegas Don't Do List.
