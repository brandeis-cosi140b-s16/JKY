I have been here twice now - once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times I have gotten below-average Mexican food. My fajita meat was so dry that it was almost inedible and required an awful lot of water to get it down. My enchiladas were bland and flavorless. Their margaritas are great, though, and are hella strong!

Decor is colorful and bold, but the layout is terrible and doesnt cancel out noise. The restaurant is VERY loud and it was challenging to hear my friend from across a table! The blender at the bar also is really noisy and we had to stop our conversation every time it went off.
