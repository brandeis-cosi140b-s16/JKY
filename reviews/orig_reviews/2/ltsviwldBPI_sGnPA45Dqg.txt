Basic, bland cafeteria fare.  I had the beef burrito. Found the beef to be flavorless. The big tortilla was nice. There were no authentic flavors/spices jumping out.  

Its not surprising alot of people on here like the place, the food is bland and predictable, it is very Americanized Mexican food.

For a chain Mex restaurant, Chipolte beats this place.
