If you are going for a drink and a snack then expect the drinks to be weak and over priced. The service is friendly but they are clearly understaffed. The trackside guacamole had too much line so all you will taste is sour.

The best thing about the restaurant is people watching. Also, the chips are homemade.

Tips
Don't order a drink they have to make
Tell the guacamole maker to use a third of the usual amount of lime juice.
