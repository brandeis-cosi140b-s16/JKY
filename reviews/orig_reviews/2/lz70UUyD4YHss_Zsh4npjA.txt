Terrible, terrible service. We waited 15 minutes for the overwhelmed server to show up and she was a little grumpy.  Requested a bottle of wine and were told that the bottle we wanted was out of stock, so the server offered a recommendation. Turns out the recommendation was also out of stock as was our 3rd choice. Ordered the table side guacamole and (1) it was not table side (2) the chips were stale. The server let us know that all of there chips were stale so we made do. The guacamole itself was great. The main course  took too long to come out but was wonderful when it did arrive. I had the pork my wife had a shrimp appetizer.  Overall it took longer than an hour and 15 minutes; way too long for an airport.
