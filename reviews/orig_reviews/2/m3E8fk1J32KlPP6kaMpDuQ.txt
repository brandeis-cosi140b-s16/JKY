What the hell?

Wahoo's famous fish taco is really a dry, flavorless lump of crusty fishfunk.  I would have gotten more satisfaction staying home and eating nasty mincemeat fish sticks!

If you want a real fish taco, go to Rubio's!

Edit:  The manager of this location, Victor, sent me a private message asking me to return and give this location another shot.  I have added a star because I appreciate managers who are communicative.  MAYBE, just maybe, I'd give this place another shot if I happened to be in the area (which is far from home).  However, my review stands as written for the time being.
