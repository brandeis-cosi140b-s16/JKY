My mother told me that if you don't have something nice to say then don't say anything at all.  So, this will be short.

The service was good.  Nice, friendly staff.
They have about 2 zillion menu items on their very large menu board.  When I walked up to the cashier she asked what I'd like.  I just kept reading the menu.  She asked again. I just smiled and said, "I'll need a moment".

I had the #4 Combo which is three small bean mini-burros, guacamole and refried beans.  In deference to my mother's advice, it was edible.

Did we need another fast food Mexican restaurant in N. Scottsdale? No.
Does this place even come close to Rubios or Baja Fresh? No.

Sorry Mom!
