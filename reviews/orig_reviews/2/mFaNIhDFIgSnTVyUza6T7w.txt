I went here with a friend because of the reviews. 4 and 5 stars? I don't see it.

They do have a good mix of authentic and Tex-Mex on their menu. The menu is extensive...but I'm only going to comment on what I had.

Fajitas. I ordered a mix of pork and beef. When they arrived they were sizzling hot but flavorless. It's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat. The only way I could tell the difference from the beef and the pork was that the pork looked like pulled pork -- and about that... isn't fajita meat typically grilled? It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me. 

The only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.

I forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, "It's ok I guess".

The service was great and the waiters were very friendly. The salsa was "ok" and the bean dip that came with it was, well, bean dip...nothing "addictive" about it like I saw in another review.

The lounge singer they had was playing mostly songs from the 80s. 'I Just Called to Say I Love You' by Lionel Richie? C'mon, Man. I think he played 2 Mexican songs the whole time we were there. I personally think it was more annoying than entertaining but hey, maybe other people like that kinda stuff.

I probably won't be back because it simply wasn't worth it. Bland and ordinary.
