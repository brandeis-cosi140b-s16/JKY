I keep giving Paz more chances, but it's the same story every time. The food is really mediocre, and only carries substantial flavor when doused in salsa or cheese. They still think ingredients like plain, canned beans are acceptable in a city with extraordinary burritos on every corner. There are a couple of decent tacos, but that's it. 

All of their tequila-based drinks taste the same. One Love margarita tastes like a frozen house margarita. Agave bramble tastes like...well a few blackberries in a house margarita. I can only drink the groovy, $3 margaritas so many times before I go nuts from the monotony! I'd switch it up with beer if their beer selection weren't so boring. 

By the way, good luck getting drinks if there's a show. You really think two bartenders can handle all the people outside? Get freaking real. 

Can we all just admit that Paz is by no means a good restaurant? We're only coming here for the events, right? Never do I ever say "Hey Paz sounds great for food right now!" It's more like "oh, x artsy event is utilizing this space, may as well kill two birds with one stone". RoRo is short on patio space, so everyone flocks here for the atmosphere and large group seating, and that's cool. It is certainly aesthetic, but everything on the block is. 

There are better places for bargain cocktails. 

You (will) know in your heart the food leaves you unsatisfied. 

If there's something quirky going on here, I'm still down. I can keep my cool here with my friends for a couple hours. Then it's off to a place that doesn't squander so much potential.
