The food was good but the service really wasn't all that. In fact it was terrible. We came in on a Friday night around 9:30 PM it wasn't crowded but it took 20 minutes before staff noticed us seated waiting to order. The waitress provided lousy service by not checking on us till it came time to pay. The music was blasting from their cantina which made it difficult to hear much less have a conversation. I would not recommend this place unless you want 2nd rate service and have extra patience.
