Tacos In The Back, Waste Of Money In The Front!  Driving by this place the first couple weeks it was open, I just knew I had to take some time and check it out.  Unfortunately, as "cute" as this hole-in-the-neighborhood venue is, the food was very disappointing on both occasions I went there!  The motto is:  Pick a meat and pick your price tag.  $9 gets you 2 fairy-size tacos, a soggy tostada and a small drink...enough disappointment for 1 person.  Disappointing 2 people could set you back $20-$30 quickly.  The tacos are tiny and the meat is bland.  I tried both the beef and the chicken during my visits there.  The beef had almost no taste and the chicken was so dry my last time there, I could barely swallow it, even with the low-quality liquid additions from the "salsa" bar!    When I took my fiance, she wouldn't even finish the meal, she was so disappointed!  The ingredients in each of the menu items are exactly the same...meat and tortilla.  The taco is a spoonful of meat on a tiny tortilla.  A tostada is a small mound of meat on a larger tortilla.  A quesadilla is a small scoop  of meat with a little cheese added...in a tortilla.  They would do better to simply offer "tacos" only and reduce the price.  All the menu items taste the same and the only real difference between each one is the increasing price tag.  I highly recommend you avoid Backyard Taco if you have tastebuds and/or financial sense!
