I bought a living social deal so my bf and I decided to come for dinner...what we didn't realize was that it was restaurant week. The deal included 2 margaritas so we started with those. They were good, but nothing special. The waiter said they were made with a standard mix, not a freshly made mix. We also asked for chips and salsa. Well that's not on the restaurant week menu so we were told we couldn't order it. Our living social deal was for 2 Margs and 2 entrees. We decided to order chips and guacamole since THAT was on the menu. I asked for a side of salsa...no salsa bc it's not on the menu. WHAT?? Seriously! We are at a Mexican food restaurant. No salsa??! Even the table next to us was annoyed at that. Ok. Moving on, our food came and it was pretty good. We ordered the chicken enchilada and a pork adobo. We were happy with the flavor, but it was super small. The enchilada came by itself on a plate - just one. It was in a typical taco size tortilla, like the size you'd buy at store (but fresh and the tortillas there are definitely delicious). The pork was good. I didn't care much for the sauce, but my bf enjoyed it. The decor was also kinda weird. Mexican food restaurant and the chandeliers were made of wooden clothes pins and painter red, white and blue...that's odd to me. Honestly though, the food lost its glory bc of the absolutely HORRIBLE service. The manager came by and he was really friendly, but our regular server really stunk. Service is almost as important as the food - and they can both, just as easily as the other, leave a bad taste in your mouth. I'm going back to Cien Agaves. Better food, fantastic service, awesome margaritas, and more reasonable prices.
