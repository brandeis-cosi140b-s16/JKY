I seriously don't understand the hype about this place. I've been there twice and was not really impressed. First of all the tacos are tiny. The meat is decent but they are really small. The first time I was there I ordered 2, and the guy said "Thats it?!". They we're decent, not fantastic.

Next time I tried the Fries with adobado. It's basically a pile of fries, topped with your choice of meat, guacomole, sour cream, some kind of mayo based sauce and unmelted shredded cheese. It's great if you're trying to consume 2000 calories in 1 meal.... I didn't really like them to be honest. They should melt the cheese. 

Nothing about this place stands out, I seriously think the Mexican food in LV is lacking... and this place is no different.
