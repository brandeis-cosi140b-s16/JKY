The food here is absolutely average, but the service the night we went there was abysmal. We sat at the table for 15 minutes before getting a drink order taken. 30 minutes later we had to ask where the hell our drinks were. Same for ordering and getting dinner. We spent 2-hours waiting, and 20 minutes eating. The local manager did his best to put lipstick on this pig, but good-gad-almighty, if your time has any value whatsoever, you don't have the time for Rio Mirage.
