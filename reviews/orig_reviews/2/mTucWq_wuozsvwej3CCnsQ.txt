I ate here a while ago and it was the first thing my friend and I ate after a day in Red Rock and as soon as it hit our stomachs we knew we were in for some horrible food poisoning. I kid you not, I went to the bathroom to throw up in the middle of the meal because my stomach hurt so bad. I have never gone back and as much as I love the idea and concept of this place, I do not want to have to worry about shitting my pants everytime I eat a bulgogi burrito.
