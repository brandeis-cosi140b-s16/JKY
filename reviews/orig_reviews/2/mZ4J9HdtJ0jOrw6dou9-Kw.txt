My review is based on the service not the food.

We walk in and there were three ladies at the front and none of them bothered to look up and greet us when we walked in.  I even said "hi" and no one looked up.  We stood there for another minute or so and finally the girl asked how many was in our party.  That should have been a red flag for me because first impressions of a business is the right impression.


We sit down and our server comes to the table.  She looks like she had a damn attitude that she had to be at work.  Whatever, not my problem, I'm just hungry.  So we order drinks and then our food. We were really hungry so we were wondering if we get chips and salsa complimentary. NOPE! They wanted $12 for a simple ass chips and salsa.  Instead of being nice about it, our server acted like we couldn't afford it so we just said forget it whatever.  Our food comes and mine was fine.  My friend asked for a side of salsa and she said it was extra and because we already had a bowl of salsa that my cousin ordered, she said there was no point of her ordering any salsa.  I'm sorry; I didn't come to a restaurant for food advice, I came to eat.  So after we finish, she comes and sets the bill ON THE CHIPS THAT WE ORDERED. REALLY????? How disgusting is that?! This girl had the worst attitude and it was noticeable.  It coulda been because we were of a different race because I noticed that she was nicer to the table next to us that were of a Caucasian descent.  Don't make it noticeable that you're a complete racist or unhappy to service people.
We let the manager know afterwards about the service and he was extremely apologetic and wished that we had told him sooner but it was the matter of us being able to pay for our food that she thought we couldn't afford.  I'm probably never going to come back here after that service.
