Like my fellow Yelp reviewer, Norm, said...I should've listened to my fellow Yelpers about this place. I didn't really have a choice because it was a co-workers going away happy hour. 

We had quite a large party of people showing up at intermittent times. Our party in total was about 15-20 people. 

They kinda corralled us into an outside fire-pit area. As more people showed up, we struggled with finding seating, so everyone was just kind of standing around. Quite a few of our co-workers showed up with their children. I was a little surprised that they did not even try to accommodate the mothers of our group. 

Our server was absolutely terrible. As more people showed up, he didn't even bother asking for their orders and we have to wave him down multiple times. He simply did not take the initiative to take any orders at all. He barely spoke as well. He was very unfriendly (he had a sour look on his face the entire time) and seemed inconvenienced and annoyed by us. It took forever to even get a couple drinks, and when we did get them, the beer wasn't even cold. 

I'm not even going to comment on the food, because I was so annoyed with the service that's the only thing I can remember. The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because the overall atmosphere of Tivoli Village as a whole is enjoyable. It's just a shame that this place doesn't hire the people to compliment that.
