Mexican chain that is average at best. 
Good atmosphere and long waits. 
Margarita's are eh. Something was missing. Oh that's right, the booze! 
Food is meh. 
I ordered the: Grande Burrito - Shredded chicken with sour cream sauce, Mexican rice, cheese and refried beans all wrapped in a flour tortilla. Chicken didn't taste very fresh and it was oversalted (normal I guess). 
Service was good. He was attentive. Prices were average. 
Would not return...food isn't worth it.
