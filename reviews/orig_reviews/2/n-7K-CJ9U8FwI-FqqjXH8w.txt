1) Weird waiter. Speak faster and be clear if you are hitting on me or are just stupid. 
2) Slutty other waiters. Umm are you kidding me? Could you please cover up your boobs? Yeah, thanks. 
3) Slow. Slow. Slow. Don't kick out my underage friends before you even gave us the check. 
4) Do you have any specials? You can buy a bucket of beers, and pay for each beer. Cool.
5) Food was meh.
Good News
1) Weird waiter agreed to make fake shots for our underage friends, hilarity ensued.
2) Held our reservation when we were late.
