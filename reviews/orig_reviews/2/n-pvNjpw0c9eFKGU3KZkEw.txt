I've been to, and reviewed the Tacos El Gordo in SD so I was expecting the same kind of experience, I was wrong. Even though this location is a lot less crowed than SD the food and staff did not make up for it. Let me begin with the workers: Rude, rude, rude. I understand they have to serve a lot of people, but you don't have to give me glares. They were also very sloppy about putting the tacos together, especially the al pastor guy. Maybe he was having a bad day, but he looked like he wanted to kill someone as he put my tacos together. Also, the food is not very consistent. One of my tacos tasted like burnt meat, and the another was super dry. The rest of my tacos were good on the other hand. But overall, I'll just stick with going to SD.
