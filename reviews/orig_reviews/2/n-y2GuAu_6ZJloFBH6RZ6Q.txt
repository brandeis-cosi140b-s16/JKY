Went to lunch with a friend today.  Her white sangria was HORRIBLE.  It smelled like dog urine and was unbelievably bad. I ordered a margarita and told the waiter the drink was terrible.  He brought us both margaritas but still charged us for the sangria which was $2.00 more.  They use flour tortilla chips  on the nachos without mentioning it on the menu.   They are thick.  The nachos do not come with salsa.  At all.   I had the Cubana sandwich.   Way, way, way too much mustard.   The  filling only covered 3/4 of the sandwich.   But it was the mustard that was really the turn off.  Service wasn't bad, but not good either.   The patio is great in the right weather.  I hope they get their act together..
