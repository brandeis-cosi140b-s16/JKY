Accidentally ate here after forgetting that the food is terrible. Ordered a combination plate of a pork taco, a beef tostada and a chicken enchilada. I got a bean tostada that was soggy, a chicken enchilada that tasted like pork and had grizzle in it and a stew like porkish slop placed in a crispy tortilla shell. This time I will remember to go somewhere else for dinner.
