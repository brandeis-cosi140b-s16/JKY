Not so great. I had higher expectations for this place. The food is overpriced, a burrito for almost $10! Their menu is a bit misleading, saying a burrito comes enchilada style, but then they charge you an extra dollar for it. Not very friendly to newcomers either. You have to know exactly what you want and if you ask them to repeat what they asked you, they scream louder instead of enunciating more clearly. I will give them that their portions were large and their queso is very good, but overall it was a disappointing experience.
