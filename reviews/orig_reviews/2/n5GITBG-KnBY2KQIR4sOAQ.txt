We went during happy hour and sat in the bar area. The place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything. I ordered a strawberry margarita which was WAY too sweet! It was half foam on top and I didn't feel like it was worth the $6 price tag. Usually when I go to mexican restaurants they bring you chips and salsa however, they had a buffet style layout with a few extra items you don't normally see. The service was great and overall a clean establishment! I wouldn't recommend for happy hour again- too many other great restaurants in the area.
