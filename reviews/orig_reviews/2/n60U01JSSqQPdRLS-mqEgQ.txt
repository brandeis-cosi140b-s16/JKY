I really grow weary of people talking this place up as the place you would HAVE to bring outta-towners for good Mexican food in Arizona. The aguas frescas are really the best thing here. You have to have an early lunch though because they run out way too fast. For the life of me I will never understand why, if there is a high demand for one of your products, you wouldn't make more of it. In the past when I ate here, they would have about 3 5-gallon containers of 3 different flavors. This time they had one and I didn't bother to even ask what it was. It looked like a basic lemonade and there was about 2 gallons left at 1 pm, so it couldn't have been great. The aguas frescas are really the only reason that I would consider 3 stars on this place. 

I've been 4-5 times over a period of about 10 years. Every time I go I leave disappointed. The beans are okay. The rice is dry. The meat is average. I've had chicken, carbon, and carne asada, and they all have been just fine. The restaurant is very small and crowded with a terrible layout. I realize that they have probably done the best they could with the space they have, but if there is any line at all people will be standing in line next to your table and orders will be coming from the kitchen and through the line to incessantly interrupt any conversations that you are trying to have. 

The hype behind this place probably impacts the harshness of my critique as well. If I was in the area, too hungry to wait and drive somewhere else to eat, or out of gas, all while being in the mood for the semblance of Mexican food, then I might stop in for a bite. Otherwise, there is much better Mexican food to be had in Arizona.
