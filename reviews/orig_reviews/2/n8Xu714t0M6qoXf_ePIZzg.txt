Bummer! 
I'm from SF visiting AZ for a debate program. Went here to grab some cheap eats. Long story short, the waitress overcharged us. When confronted, she said she had no way to fix the error. Whatever ... That was annoying. My friend requested salsa and when told she had to pay for it, she made a genuinely confused face. The waiter (different one) said awkwardly "you don't have to look at me like that." It was a weird vibe killer.
Moving on
Food : bad. Had a Torta that was overly sweet. No free chips , you pay for salsa. Tacos were weird too. One tortilla, no salsa to put on them. 
But the cardinal sin here is when she offered to get me a beer, she lagged because she was busy flirting with men around. Listen sister, we had a long, hot ass day in Arizona. The least you could do is get me a cold beer, on time so I can drink while my friends are eating. Not chug a beer before we have to run. 
+ one star for the bartender who spoke to me and gave me a discount. Really nice guy. I wish the food could save this experience, but that was not worth the money either. ) :
