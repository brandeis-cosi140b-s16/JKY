Ok food, but horrible service had to ask several times for water. Waitress never checked back in to see how the meal was. It took her three trips to finally ask if we were ready to order etc... Would not recommend and wished I read the other reviews first. They all say the same thing about service. Total bummer because the space is pretty.
