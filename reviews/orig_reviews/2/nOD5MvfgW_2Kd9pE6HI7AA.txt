Went here yesterday for lunch while my car was at MINI being serviced. The place for starters has no feeling of arrival. There is just a door on the side of a building with no awning, patio, etc. There was no one there to greet me when I came in so I made my way over to the bar. There were a couple of middle aged women running the bar and doing a mediocre job of it at best. I ordered the chimichilada, MAN, you gotta REALLY like mushrooms to eat that thing. The chimi part of it was ok, but nothing really to write home about. This place has been dubbed a direct competitor to Richardson's? get real. The chips were the only good part of my meal. I'm a big guy with a big appetite, and I didn't even have a desire to finish my meal, it was just not a good dish. Besides the food, the restaurant was just really akward in layout. The bar top seemed as if it were a removable piece of furniture from Ikea... not cool. One of the waitresses even had her two kids hanging out in the restaurant running back into the kitchen, eating, etc. Pretty sure that would violate some sort of health code. I'll stick to Richardson's thank you.

UPDATE 6/26/08:

Went here to please my co-workers... they all wanted to go after taliesin west tour so I figured I would give it another shot. Worse than the first time... the service was worse, the chips and salsa was worse, and the food was even more bland. Not as many mushrooms though. I'm gonna keep it at 2 stars though, because I hate to give out onesies.
