This is Mexican food for white people. Not horrible, but rather bland and boring.

Carne Asada = over cooked and way too under spiced

Ground Taco Meat = way too much chipotle and not enough cumin

Chimichanga = tasty, but super greasy 

Fajita Chicken = not enough Adobo seasoning

Refried Beans = pretty darned good for retried beans 

Salads = both are surprisingly flavorful

Store bought flour and corn tortillas (lame)
