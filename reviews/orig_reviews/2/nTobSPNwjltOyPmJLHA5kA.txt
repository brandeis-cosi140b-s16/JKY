Hmmm, One Beer, Two Tacos, One diet soda, $20.51.  That pretty much says it all...yeah the food it okay, it's just pretty expensive for what it is...I know I know I'm a captive audience, like a rat in a cage they can charge me whatever they want, but $3.29 for a soda???  I should have stuck my head under the fountain at Burger King next door, maybe I'll try that next time.  If you don't need a beer skip this place and get a $5 slice of pizza at Sbarro.
