There is a paradox at La Hacienda. Why would a great Latin restaurant dinner house serve the worst-in-a-lifetime breakfast buffet in this diner's rather extensive experience?

The restaurant is servicing the breakfast with room customers. The scrambled eggs in the buffet were food service quality and left an unwelcome aftertaste with each bite. There was no toast, no toaster, and the breakfast meats (sausage & bacon) were cold.

But, for dinner, totally different. The food was amazing. The steak and short ribs are to die for. The service was superb. The after dinner flamb√© dessert was both exciting and totally delicious. With their fantastic nighttime ambiance, with lit candles and roaring fireplace, this is definitely the place to bring someone special. Definitely order the at the table guacamole, which rocks, and the after dinner coffee, which throws sparks to the ceiling (ladies and gentlemen, watch your hair when passing by).

Bon appetit!
