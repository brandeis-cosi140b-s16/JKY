First off I am a big fan of Cafe Rio normally, however, this location just doesn't seem to have it going on. I feel like they skimp I the trimmings. I always order the tortilla soup and I've been twice around 3pm and they are already sold out. After waiting in the line too! Then they didn't put the guacamole or give me the tortilla to go with :-( I still go but I have to be very specific to tell them how it's to be made, even though every other location does it correctly.
