Definitely overrated. I ask you, how can you claim you make good Mexican food (supposedly full of flavor and spices) and you can't even be bothered to put a little salt in the guac? Everything I've ever tried here is so BLAND!

The only redeeming thing about this place is when you see the little, old Mexican ladies making the tortillas in front of you. Having said that, I grew up on the Texas/Mexico border. Every taco shop on the border does that.

Don't get me wrong. The tacos here aren't awful, but they're certainly not worthy of four or even three stars. My guess is that most of the people who gave this place a good rating were a little drunk when they ate the food.) The location is two seconds from Wynn.) If you're sober and want good tacos, go somewhere else. You're welcome.
