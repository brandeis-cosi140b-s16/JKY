Meh, not sure why everyone is raving, coming from bay area we have great mexican and asian food. Honestly, the food is more of a fad fusion trend than it is quality. 

 One thing I have to say is the service was outstanding, friendly folks. Free rice and drinks for the kids under 10......these are the good things.

The bathroom was disgusting, one of my friends felt sick mid meal and the other threw up/ got the runs a few hours later. These are the bad things...

Really good service, but overall I don't think any of us would want to be repeat customers.
