ENVIRONMENT - A more upscale Mexican restaurant. Great for a nice date night!

SERVICE - Very friendly and helpful

FOOD - Overall, i thought it was a bit too pricey for what we had. I'm not an expert on mexican food and don't have it often, but here's what i thought.
+ Carne tampiquena $18 - steak, rice, guac, and refried beans. Again it was okay... Nothing special..I actually prefer the striploin at other places, maybe mexican just isn't my thing.

+ camaron al mojo - $25. I dont think this was worth it. It came with 4 shrimps which weren't that flavourful. There was also salad, corn, and rice, along with some garlicy bread. Not worth $25.... It didn't impress me.

+ queso fundido $6 - this was an appetizer. I mainly got this cause it has nopales (CACTUS!!).. It's my first time travelling out west sooo yeah. This was maiinly just mushrooms and cactus cooked in melted cheese which you put in soft tortillas. The nopales just taste like green peppers, and the dish was just okay. 

+ margarita $6 - strong! But mm drink,

Don't forget to check in to claim your dessert! They gave us 3 types of desserts to choose from. We got the chocolate flam which was pretty decent. Soft and spongey.

But i'd probably wouldn't come back.
