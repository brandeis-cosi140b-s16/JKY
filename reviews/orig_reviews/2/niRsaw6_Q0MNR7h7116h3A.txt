From No Culinary Backwater.
A much anticipated but, a highly disappointing meal . I grew up eating a lot of Mexican food. Most was very good and some very very bad while living in California. Visiting Mexico City I was introduced to more authentic flavors. My friend's mother was a great home cook. She made fresh hand made tortillas. There was very few things which where much better than that. My first job as a line cook was in a Mexican restaurant. I was a souse chef in a hot Tex-Mex place in San Fransisco. Making friends with the remarkable Chef Guillermo Peters of Canal Street Bistro and his modern take on Mesoamerican cuisine . So I have a pretty good grasp on what makes a good meal from Mexican cuisine. Moving to Charlotte I was missing taste from home. My wife and I kept on hearing about Three Amigos http://www.threeamigoscharlotte.com/
. Canned microwaved , over seasoned or bland. Spanish rice made with frozen vegetables and condensed chicken MSG laden stock does not entice me to comeback. If your only exposure "Mexican cuisine" had been Taco Bell I guess you would call this a great place. For my time and money If i want good Mexican cuisine , I will have to make it myself.
