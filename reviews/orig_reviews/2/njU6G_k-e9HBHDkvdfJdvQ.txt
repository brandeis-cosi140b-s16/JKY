Let me just say, I love cafe rio. Order all the time. Today, I went into the one on Maryland and I never seen more rudeness than I did today. As I watched one of the workers ask Sonya for help, she basically said no ask someone else. While Sonya was saying no to help one of her fellow employees out, I watched as she rolled up silverware for a catering order. 1. She has no gloves on, 2. She was coughing all over the utensils. I feel so bad for who Evers catering order she was taken care of. Once again, Sonya was asked for help and she yet again said no. I felt horrible for the woman asking for help. I will not be returning to that location.
