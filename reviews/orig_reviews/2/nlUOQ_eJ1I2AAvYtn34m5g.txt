I've always liked Chipotle. The bowls are NEVER a bad idea. Now, I go there for a post work out meal and I ordered a steak bowl. Which is something I always get. But this particular day I wanted to get chips and guacamole. I was in line and I noticed that the guacamole had a weird color and I was a little unsure about it. BUT the server was putting the guacamole in other people's burritos and other meals so, I got some. I get home to eat and try some of the guacamole and I literally spat it out. It was disgusting and frankly, a waste of money. I've honestly never had this problem with other Chipotle's. Just this ONE in particular.
