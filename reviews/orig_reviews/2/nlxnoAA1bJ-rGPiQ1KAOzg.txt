Don't get me wrong, this place is my #1 favorite spot to get tacos. But tonight ago my bf and I encountered one of the rudest employees. The man taking our order, Javier, wouldn't even wait til we were done ordering. He yelled out our first order to the kitchen.. but we still had two more orders to place. He did it again and he seemed so surprised that we still had one last order, then he rolled his eyes and scoffed right at our face, basically saying "are you kidding me?" My boyfriend even apologized and he just yelled "NEXT", basically just pushing us away as if we were a burden to him. 

Normally, we would let something like this slide since I understand this place can get super busy and I assume stressful for the employees. He might've had a bad day or something, but the way he sneered at us was extremely rude and left us feeling kinda awkward.. like wtf? We were so confused. The experience we had today was just one of the worst ever I just had to write a review. (My very first review after having this account for a while) ((Thats how you know it was bad))

No offense Tacos el Gordo, I love you. But Javier, what's good?
