Maybe just an off day, but we stopped in for lunch based off reviews and are kinda bummed we did. We were the first ones there right when they opened. The table was sticky and it didn't feel very clean. The fish tacos smelled a bit funky when they came out and tasted very fishy. My husband got the steak tacos and the meat was crumbly and dry. There wasn't much else to the tacos except cabbage. The salsas were good, but very little comes with the meal. The side of rice was delicious but left a bad taste in my mouth when we left. The soda was flat and even worse when I asked for a new one. The patio looked cute for a strip mall. The place filled up fast with regulars so something must be good!
