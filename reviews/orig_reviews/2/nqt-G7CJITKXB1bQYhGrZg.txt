I am a regular customer at the Chula Vista location and the Al Pastor Tacos are the best I have ever had period.  But this location did not have the same flavor that I was used to, in fact they were staight up flavorless, just ruined the whole experience for me and my firends for thinking we were getting the "same" tacos back in CV.  maybe it was that day I dont know but not going there again.  Taco loco no more.
