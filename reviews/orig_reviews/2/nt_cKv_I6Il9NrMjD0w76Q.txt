The coffee is good for the price.  The breakfast potatoes look & taste like they were made yesterday.  The bacon is really good!  The waiter sat two people right next to me.  You know, uncomfortably close & in my space.  There was plenty of seating elsewhere.  I initially had a server that said "My coffee isn't working today" making me think they couldn't serve coffee.  Then she explained the coffee she drank hadn't kicked in yet.  OK?  I overheard her tell the same story to another table thus confusing them about the coffee.  That story isn't working, stop telling it.  It's 7:00 AM and we are here for coffee.  Maybe she was new?  My table was sticky.  Next time I'll order a side of bacon and fruit.
