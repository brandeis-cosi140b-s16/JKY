I'm downgrading my review. Something is going awry at this location. The staff gets my orders wrong the last 3 times I've went. They also have closed early on me a few times. These mistakes are understandable but today I am so disappointed in the actual food quality. The steak is hard and chewy and most of the steak my husband and I couldn't eat in our bowl. Also I asked for vegetables and all there was green peppers, no onions or anything. Just disappointed. If you are doing well with what you have why downgrade you meat quality? Yes we notice!! I'll be going to chipotle or cafe rio next time.
