Well, I'd read some great reviews so I was excited to try it.  The decor was great and the service was awesome too, but the prices and the food leave alot to be desired.  We boyfriend and I got there at 530pm.  The chips and salsa are complimentary, but the salsa was thick and tasted like they used alot of chili powder.  My boyfriends loves salsa and he couldn't even eat it.  I compare all my salsa to my favorite at Mi Patio, and I haven't found anything that compares to it, so I wasn't expecting anything better, but this salsa was really bad.
We both ordered a margarita.  The drinks came in a standard size bar glass. I also ordered just one taco...a shrimp taco.
The big surprise was the bill...$9/ea for the margaritas...and $4.25 for the taco.  I felt like I just threw $30 out the window.
Oh, and there's NO happy hour.  I was told the happy hour was from 11a to 5pm.  What??
Yes, it's hip, yes, it's cool...and I don't mind paying for great food/drinks, but it was definitely not worth the high prices.  The margaritas would've been priced around $4.25 at any other mexican joint and that tiny taco should've been about $1.25!  The tortilla was the size of a small pancake and had just 2...yes 2...shrimp inside..we each got a bite.
I'm still kicking myself for paying that kind of money for nothing special!
