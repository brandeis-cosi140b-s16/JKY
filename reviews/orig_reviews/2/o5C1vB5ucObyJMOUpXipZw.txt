I went here in November with a really large group and loved the concept. I got the jerk chicken which burned my face off, so when I went back last night I decided to not get that. I was with my kid, and I ordered her a teriyaki chicken. I got myself the Jade Red Chicken because it was suppose to be the best.

The cashier said it would be awhile because there were a lot of people. I said that should be ok, and figured maybe it would be 20 minutes. Forty-five minutes later he brought our food. Hers was a bowl of whiterice with way too much teriyaki sauce all over it. There was NO Chicken at all! I took it back and they dumped cold chicken slices across the top and put on even more sauce. My Jade Red Chicken was dry, overdone and crunchy. Terrible.

And it wasn't even until I got home that I realized they didn't remember to give us our cookies!

I give it 2 stars because the concept is really cool and they have free wifi. Those are the only reasons.
