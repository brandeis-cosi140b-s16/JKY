I had been wanting to try Cabo Wabo because it is Sammy Hagar's Joint (He was the best singer for VH....DLR was a pussy-ass pouseur with a bad weave!). The one in Tahoe looks lame, this one looked closer to the original.

I tried the Carne Asada Nachos and my bro had Steak and Shrimp Fajitas. The Nachos were ok, mostly chips and that velveeta-ish type cheese, but the carne asada had good flavor..

The Steak and Shrimp Fajitas looked a bit small.

The prices were way too high for the amount of food and the quality. Next time, just buy a shirt!
