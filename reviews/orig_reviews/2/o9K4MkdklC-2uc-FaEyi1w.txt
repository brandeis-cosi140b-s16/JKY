Came in for late lunch... Food is very mediocre. Ordered chick fajitas for two ( looked like service for one) chicken was tough and rubbery. Filet nachos had tiny pieces of who knows what they are calling filet.. I would try this place for happy hour, but definitely not worth the money otherwise. Good selection of tequila though
