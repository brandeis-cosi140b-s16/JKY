((Maybe it was an off day))
It looked promising.
1. The COFFEE tasted gross!
2. Need to use purified water.
3. Had eggs rancheros I think the Eggs we're bad! Along with the salsa! ((I got Sick later on that day))
My mom had Fish tacos she didn't finish them either the only things that were good was the quesadilla
 
((But like I said could have been an off day!))
