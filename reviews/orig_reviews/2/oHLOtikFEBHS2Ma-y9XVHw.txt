I have always loved this restaurant, but have had to stop going to it because my last 3-4 experiences were not very good ones.

The last time we were there I ordered a chicken chimichanga and they brought me what was either fish or undercooked chicken. I took one bite and then looked at it and it was pink. Chicken obviously isn't supposed to be pink. I sent it back and got another one and it was ok, but still not all that tasty.

The time before that my pollo fundido had cinnamon on it as if it had been fried in old oil that had been used to fry a dessert or something. Not only did it taste disgusting, but I am allergic to cinnamon, and having it in my food obviously isn't a good thing.

The time before that we had a fairly rude waiter.

Not sure why I kept going back. I guess because I had always enjoyed their food before. I love their bean dip and salsa, but I just can't go back anymore. I'm bummed, truthfully.
