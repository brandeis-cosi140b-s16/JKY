I've been to this restaurant twice now. Thought that maybe the first time was just a fluke......please, save your money and eat elsewhere. I would say stick to margaritas and chips & salsa at t&t! Tamales were terrible, nasty cheese sauce on the nachos, very greasy cheese dip, nothing was desirable with the exception of our drinks. 

Service was slow. Hostess wasn't friendly. The bus boy was nice!
