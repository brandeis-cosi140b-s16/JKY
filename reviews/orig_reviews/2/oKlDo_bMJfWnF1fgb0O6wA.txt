My boyfriend and I were coming back from Tucson and we were feeling some Mexican food. Being non- familiar with the area, I went with this spot because of so many comments of their "happy hour". I really don't know how this spot is... 4 stars, gotta admit that yelp failed me this time :(

Atmosphere: nice and modern, felt kind of like Buffalo Wild Wings with the bar and TVs... Maybe it's because of the name, I was expecting a more authentic environment. The waitress was fairly attentive and prompt with our water and orders

Food:
+self-serve salsa bar woo hoo: most of the sauces were decent, not really spicy for my standards
+HH blended margarita was pretty good, it was $4 or $5 and a little bit of alchy in it
+the warm queso dipping for chips was pretty good!

- so not impressed with everything else...
- dry rice with dry enchiladas and tasteless refried beans
- the "salad" in my bf's combo was the saddest little salad portion I've even seen...
-overpriced for the quality of food we got

I will not come back here for the food. BUT if BWW is so too crowded and you want a nice modern restaurant with a full bar and ooooookay non-authentic Mexican to watch some sporting events, this might be the place for you!
