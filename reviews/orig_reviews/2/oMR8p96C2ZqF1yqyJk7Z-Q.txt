Just like a childhood movie favorite that is not quite as good when you revisit as an adult....Azteca did not hit the spot like it used to years ago in college. I had fond memories but when I visited a few week ago the food was greasy, over portioned and over cooked. The salsa was pleasantly flavorful but our entrees had a not so fresh suspect look about them.
