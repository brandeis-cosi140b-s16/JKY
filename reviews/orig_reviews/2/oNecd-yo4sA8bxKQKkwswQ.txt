Frank (Phrank?) was really great the first time I stopped in, when they weren't too busy. He hooked us up with good service and was very personable. I like the place so much that I even offered to photoshop one of his signs and send it to him personally, which I did shortly after leaving. I told him to suggest a meal, and he did, so ended up ordering a couple of awesome tacos.

The 2nd time I visited wasn't so pleasant. I don't think Frank even recognized me, not to mention I didn't get my drink that I ordered. I left my order number (these things they give you when you order) on the table along with some of my belongings and went to use the bathroom. By the time I came back, my order number was gone, my food wasn't there, and I had to interrupt an order that was being taken by Frank to tell him what was going on. He got the attention of his workers and they brought my food on a tray, but I ordered it to-go. Three errors in one sitting, and I tipped extremely well straight away and left the restaurant feeling like I wanted my tip back. Probably won't be going back to Phat Phranks again after this trip. Sorry Frank!
