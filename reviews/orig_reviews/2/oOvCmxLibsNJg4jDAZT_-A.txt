Over the years we have gotten to know and love the wait staff here and always have great service.  We stuck with this restaurant through periods of terrible service and terrible management. The new chef has driven us out and ruined the fajitas, though.  They actually gave us completely unseasoned chicken and onions on the fajita platter. Seriously?  The new salsas are awful. Does everything have to be chipotle these days?  What is so wrong with a classic tomato salsa with yummy chunks of onions?  We were sad when we walked out this last time. After eating here almost weekly for 5 years, it was like saying goodbye to an old friend.
