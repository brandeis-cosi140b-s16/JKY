What a horrible place. I'm sorry to see this open up in Park Road Shopping Center. I've been twice, and the infractions upon standard treatment of human beings is atrocious. I'm not one to give bad reviews, but this is not my kind of restaurant. Awful customer service, attention to detail, acknowledgement that you've even come *in*. The list goes on.
