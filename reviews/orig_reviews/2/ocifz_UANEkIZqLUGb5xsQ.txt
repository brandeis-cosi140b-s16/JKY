There are so many more places you can spend your hard earned cash and get a much better meal. Telling the truth is not slander.  

Yes, the chips and salsa are good. They, however, are not the meal.   I find the food to be bland with a mushy texture.  For example, the picadillo tastes like something you could buy a mix at a grocery store and make at home.  

The restraunt is cute-looking, but dirty.  The rafters have dust bunnies.  The last unfortunate meal I ate there, we were seated by a group.  The restraunt was not busy at all.  The server never came to collect my card so we could leave.  I ended up taking it to the hostess.  If you want sub-par food, sucky service, and a dirty restraunt do go here.
