I've definitely had better. The food was great! But the service SUCKED!! We decided to eat a late lunch and figured we would miss the crowd, we did which was nice. The place looks cool, and has an upstairs bar that looks over the strip. All of us enjoyed our food but as I said the service was not good. We waited 15 minutes for the waiter to ask what drinks we wanted and then another 10 for the drinks to arrive (a soda, water, and 2 margaritas). Our food was taken to the wrong table sat there for 10 minutes then they realized the mistake and brought them to us, we refused to accept them and demanded a new appetizer. Then later in the meal my sister asked for an extra pickle with her burger and they said it would cost $1.00. Also, she was going to get another soda and they wanted to charge her for another and she declined. Over priced, bad service, but good food. Your choice.
