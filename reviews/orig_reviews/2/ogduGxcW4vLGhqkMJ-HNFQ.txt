I was attending a conference at a nearby hotel and wandered in for lunch one day. I had a chicken burrito that left me disappointed: cubes of white chicken meat in a watery green sauce that had little flavor and no heat, wrapped in a non-descript tortilla, with rice and beans.

Service was good, price was reasonable, but the food wasn't even remotely interesting and that's a pity.
