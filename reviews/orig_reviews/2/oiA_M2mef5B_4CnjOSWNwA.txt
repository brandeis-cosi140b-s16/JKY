I'm giving this place two stars only because I enjoyed the chips and salsa. I ordered a combo of a Tostado,enchilada and A tamale. The tostado shell was overcooked, the enchilada was unremarkable and the Tamale had very little meat in it and tasted just like the enchilada . . I honestly had one bite of everything on my plate and then pushed it aside. My son ordered something else and he did not eat his meal either. My daughter in law had a green chili burrito and she loved it. So if you must go to this place try and order that. I wont be going back.
