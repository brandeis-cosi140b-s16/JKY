The edamame was covered in some sort of sweet sticky sauce. Not sure what the point is to order a healthy appetizer if they are going to serve it covered in syrup. Beef kabob was so rare it bled all over my plate and turned my yogurt pink but was still very tough. Overall it's nice that they deliver but that may be the only way they can give this stuff away.
