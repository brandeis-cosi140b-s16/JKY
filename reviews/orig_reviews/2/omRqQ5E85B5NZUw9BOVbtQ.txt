I'm always on the hunt for yummy Mexican eats. Dona Maria has long had my curiosity since I love me a tamal. Restaurant.com had $10 dining certificates at a discount which provided me with the perfect excuse to give 'em a try.

Dined in last night, only a few tables were dining. It was quiet and service was attentive. We asked for a hotter salsa than the one given and they came back with a delicious smoky spicy option, Chipotle, if I had to guess. It was excellent. We loved the heat. Albondigas soup followed, it was pretty good, I enjoyed the flavorful meatballs. Both entrees were combos: tamal enchilada style and beef & bean burrito, and chile relleno and cheese and chili tamal. It was fine, but highly Americanized. This gringa likes the real deal so it was a disappointment. I thought the tamales would be better since it's in the name. On it's own it was a bit bland and dry, it needed more zest. So the enchilada style went over better. I covered mine in the yummy hot salsa and it did the trick.

It's not a bad option, but there is better around. 2.5 stars.
