My family and I love Elmer's food - it's delish!!!  Big caveat is that they can't seem to get our orders correct.  We've been there three times in the last six months, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and the last for dinner.  The got our order correct one of three times.  The last time they got everything right on the receipt, however, the actual order was all screwed up.  My bad for not checking before I left with the to-go order but it was a ton of food and not marked on the styrofoam containers.  Trust but verify, I guess.  Really sad considering the tastiness of their food.  Awesome place if they get your order correct.  The order they got correct was breakfast and I was one of two people there which is likely why they got it right.
