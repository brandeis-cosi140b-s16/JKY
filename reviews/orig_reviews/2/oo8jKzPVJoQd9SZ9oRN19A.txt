I love the downstairs especially during thd winter with the fireplace. ..BUT the service last Friday at lunch at 12:45pm was inexcusable!  No employees for 5 minutes! Then still ignored while handing us menus (no water, no hi, no welcome) just slapped menus down and talked with an employee. When I told her we needed to be done in an hour ... she just looked at me and said I dont think so. We walked out! STILL NO WATER AFTER 10 MINUTES and NO ASKING US ANYTHING!!
