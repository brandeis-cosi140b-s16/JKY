The food is pretty unique which makes up for it not being authentic Mexican food. They have some interesting burritos which are fun to try but I only come here for half price because then the food is more worth it.

However, coming here late is rather uncomfortable as it is full of people drinking mostly margaritas (which are pretty amazing mind you) and some how the waiter uses that as the reason they can't lower the volume below deafening; I'm writing this review at a full table because we all agreed to give up talking till we leave.
