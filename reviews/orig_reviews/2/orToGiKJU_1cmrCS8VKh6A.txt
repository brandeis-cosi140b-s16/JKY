Authentic Mexican food? I don't so! 
I went in on a Tuesday afternoon with a few friends. We were not greeted when we walked in. However, we were seated with in a couple of minutes. One of my friends noticed that the chips were stale so she proceeded to ask for fresh beans. I ordered 2-enchilada dinner with black beans. The tortillas from the enchiladas were tough, I couldn't cut them using only a fork. Enchilada's are supposed to be tender, it really seemed as the tortillas were left out and used the next day. The Black beans were so bland and came out of a can. I ordered a side of guacamole and had to ask the nice server to take it back. It tasted really bad-not fresh at all. I have given two stars for the service. It's not the waiters fault so I can appreciate them.
