Sitting on the patio on a Sunday afternoon watching the Ladies of Maricopa County in their impossibly high heels and very short skirts (how do they stride along like that????) stroll by was fun.  As for the rest---after wanting so badly to try the Barrio Queen and being thwarted countless times, all I can say is: what a disappointment,  Of the four of us, not a single diner at our table could find anything really positive to say. The Mexican food at Filiberto's is better and so is the service.  All I hear about is all the accolades the chef/owner has received----she must be juicing the judges up on margaritas.  Won't be back.
