Adequate at best.  A step above restaurants like Macayo's (maybe).  Definitely not worth the drive.   My feelings are that it receives such high rating from the locals in that area who are essentially :locked: in place in such a remote area and never make in town to any real restaurants.  Food was decent, service was terrible.
