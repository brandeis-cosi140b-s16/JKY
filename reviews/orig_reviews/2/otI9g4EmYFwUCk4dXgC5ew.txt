After hearing about this place being the best, my girlfriend and I decided to try it and its not what everyone makes it to be w could have payed way less buying the ingredients ourselfs and taste the same or even better. We bought a total for 4 tacos each and 2 drinks and ended up paying $25. They only have 3 different meats for the tacos as well chicken fish and carne asada. Seriously so not worth it save your money and go to a little hole in the wall it will be just a good or maybe even better and way less expensive.... Hope this helps some of you out there
