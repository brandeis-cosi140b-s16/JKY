I was here last year. Not impressed. Food was not memorable. Atmosphere was too casual if that's possible. Too many flies in this way-open, patio-style restaurant. Service was - well I don't remember. But what I do remember was that there is nothing about this place that says, "Come back!" ...Nada. My experience wasn't awful but I have no incentive to return when there are so many other places to eat at Tempe Marketplace.
