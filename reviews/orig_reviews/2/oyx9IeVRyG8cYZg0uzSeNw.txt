Our first and not likely to come back for awhile.  Empty tables all over but still had to wait for text. When asked why the wait was told they just opened and they wanted to make sure the kitchen could keep up. Is this thier first resturant ?
 
We got to seats at the bar and ordered.  I had three very small tacos - not much flavor. Husband got the carne asads burro he liked it.  Chips were mixed some stale some fresher (yesterdays) and the salsa was way to mild with little flavor. 

WIll stick to tried and true Euro Cafe when we want to head to downtown Gilbert.
