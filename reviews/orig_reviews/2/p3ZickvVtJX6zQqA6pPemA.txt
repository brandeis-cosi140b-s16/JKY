Went here on a $25 for $50 Groupon offer. Great deal, right? What could be so bad?

20 minute wait for a table at 3pm, 15 minute wait to see our server, another 10-15 minute wait for our drinks (coke and iced tea), then another 20 minute wait for our appetizer after we got our drinks. By the time all was said and done, it took about an hour from the time we reached their front doors (STARVING) to actually get our hands on some food -- and they don't serve chips and salsa while you wait (wth?). 

On top of the long wait, their food was supremely subpar. Their iced tea was watery and didn't come with any lemons (or sugar for that matter... our table was void of any sugar what-so-ever and it took another 5 minutes to flag down another waiter to get some for us). The nachos we ordered were the only edible item we got. Their tack salad was sadly pathetic with wilted iceberg lettuce, canned kidney beans and weird tasting guacamole. By the time our fajitas came, we were so turned off by the lack of service,  loud music, annoying DJ, and sad looking food and beverages that we decided to just pack it up and leave --- which took another 15 minutes to get our waiter for the check. No Groupon is worth that suffering. Maybe I'll come back again in the (far) future for drinks -- at least the loud, obnoxious music will be drowned out by the sweet taste of hard liquor.
