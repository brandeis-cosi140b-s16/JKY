I've been there once.  I did happen to go on a night they were offering a 5.99 anything on the menu (ups the value point) special.  I took that chance to get both a big chicken and cheese quesadilla and big meaty burrito.  Both came with chips.  The chips were good but the salsa bar was of the refridgerated variety.  While that's obviously good toward keeping things fresh, the problem was everything was so near the freezing point that you couldn't each your chips with salsa.  The excellent queso stepped in for a save.  The two entrees were bland and the seating area left much to be desired.  All in all, it's not bad but not so good as I'd want to return.  It's a home grown effort with out the million dollar budget chain restaurants use to get the details right, I know.  It's when a small mom and pop's joint still manages to get the details worked out, you have found a winner.
