We found ourselves here towards the end of an evening of mojitos, shooters and craps. Having walked and monorailed from Mandalay Bay looking for inspiration, we allowed ourselves to be led here on the recommendation of the most inebriated member of our group, who also happened to be the most Vegas-savvy. We lived to regret it.

The salsa that came with the complimentary chips was, I admit, very good. So was the fresh guacamole. Sadly, it was downhill from there on in.

The biggest complaint, from the whole group, was how salty all the food was. My experience was of very ordinary diner food served with little real care. The presentation was sloppy and some of the plates looked like they'd been sitting around for a while.

The next morning, when our friend surfaced, his only comment was 'How did we end up at Gonzalez y Gonzalez. I hate that place.'
