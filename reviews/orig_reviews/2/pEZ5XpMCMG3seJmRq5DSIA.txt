Went on Cinco De Mayo .....waited about 5 minutes for a table. They went to seat us and found the table not cleaned so they asked us to go back and wait in the lobby.
Finally seated, waited forever to get our drinks, as well as chips and salsa.  We had people who came in after us and seated, who ordered their food well after us get their food first.  We asked the waitress what was going on, she stated they could not get staff to work tonight, so they were short and trying to do their best.  We observed lots of people coming in and not being helped (they pulled their hostess to wait on tables) walk right back out after not being greeted at the door for over 30 minutes.
It was very sad to see this happening in a restaurant that was highly recommended to us.  Did not enjoy our dinner at all.
