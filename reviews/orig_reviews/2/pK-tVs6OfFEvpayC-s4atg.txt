YIKES! I demoted them to 2 stars. Why?!

The food, plain and simple. It really isn't Rosa's on University. I had been running errands all day last Saturday and I ended up at Bark Avenue Pet Supply, right next door to Tia Rosa's.

I remembered thinking it was ok the last time so I thought, why not? I couldn't afford to be picky as my cousin and I were having a bad low blood sugar moment...I knew it was bad because I started to have the shakes -- anyway...sorry...I am digressing.

There weren't that many people there, so that was a good thing. Service was wonderful. The chips and salsa revived us, as did the iced tea.

I decided to splurge and get the chimichanga instead of the salad I would have normally ordered. BIIIG mistake. One of the things I liked about Rosa's on University is that their chicken chimichangas are flavorful - the chicken is always spiced right and it's never dry.

I truly wish I could have said the same about this one. I was so angry with it that I ended up just yanking the chicken out (they put beans inside the chimichanga instead of it being straight chicken -- yuck) and eating the deep fried shell. The salad on the plate was going bad - it was brown and slimey.

My cousin wasn't thrilled with her burrito and the refried beans in general just had zero flavor. I can't believe that these 2 restaurants are the same ones operating off the exact recipes. Tia Rosa's has gone dreadfully wrong somewhere and I can't quite put my finger on it.

The atmosphere is still cute and the bathrooms are always wonderfully clean, but the food...the food...PISSES ME OFF. IF I PAY THAT MUCH FOR IT I EXPECT IT TO BE GOOD.

The appearance of the place forces me to give it 2 stars because it really is adorable. Now if only the food had some flavor and consistency from the original Rosa's on University.

I refuse to go back there -- even if someone else is paying.
