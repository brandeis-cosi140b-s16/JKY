We chose to eat a late lunch on a Wednesday around 2:30. The decor is quite modern and wide open. There was a definitely a chill in the air so we ordered coffee. The waitress was very accommodating in regards to inquiries about the menu. Our coffee was lukewarm and it took 25 minutes for our lunch to arrive. The spinach enchiladas were boring and prepared using very small tortillas. The brisket tacos were tough to chew, dry and lacking any distinct flavor. Rice and beans were good and small in portion size. Did I mention the coffee? The waitress never checked to see if we needed a refill. Overall, we were disappointed in the quality of the food, portion size, flavor and service.
