What has happened to this restaurant?  Just two years ago when my husband and I discovered it just blocks from the Rio Hotel and Casino, we were thrilled to have a great Mexican meal so close to the strip.  When we ate there in November we thought the food was not the same quality that we had just a few months before Then my daughter and I tried it in February and it was worse.  I ordered the steak Fajitas.  They arrived on a cold plate, not sizzling like they normally do.  There were 9 small pieces of beef, three small pieces of onion and 3/4 of the Fajitas consisted of bell peppers.  The Fajitas were flavorless.  No seasoning, just cooked meat and peppers.  What a disappointment.  We noticed on the menu that if you want more chips and salsa, you must now pay $2.99 for them.  What a ripoff since the bowl of chips is small and was about  1/2 full.  Ricardo's is at the corner of Decatur and Flamingo and I hear it is better thanBointo Michoacan.
