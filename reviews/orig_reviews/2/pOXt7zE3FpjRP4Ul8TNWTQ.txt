I have given two stars for many reasons. First, our waitress had to be asked at least 3 times each for anything we asked for. Needed a booster seat. Had to ask 3 times. Needed sour cream. Had to ask 3 times. Etc. The floors were disgusting and the tables were not clean either. The burrito I had was good, but my husbands chicken enchiladas made him sick. I took them home and had them the next day and got sick myself. The rice was gross and dry. They also were out of all kinds of things. I will not be going back and would not recommend going here.
