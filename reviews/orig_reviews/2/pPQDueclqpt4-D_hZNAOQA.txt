Hubby and i became hooked since they opened, staff was really friendly and food was great, freshly made with great authentic taste. Owners opened up another location Eastern and 215 great for them but now they have increased prices, cut down portions, taken out items that made it great, friendly staff just a bit, not like it use to be.
