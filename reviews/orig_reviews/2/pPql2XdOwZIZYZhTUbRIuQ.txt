The one good thing about this place is it is always consistent, the bad thing is it's always a consistently not good.  

The margaritas are so-so, the food is so-so and so is the service - this time we lucked out and got an adequate server.  Most of the staff are poorly dressed and unkempt.  Make sure to order your next cocktail way before your first is finished so you get it in time.  

The kicker, the state of the restaurant - it is dirty, unkept and in desperate need of a face-lift or at the very least a fresh coat of paint and pressure washed.  A friend that was with us stated that it's because college kids don't care about the environment that they eat in.  Looking around I pointed out the families and said that if they appealed to the families and the corporate offices in the area, they may have a better environment for guests AND staff.

So why do I keep going back?  It's never my choice.  I only go at the request of other and don't recommend them to anyone.  Have I contacted them about poor device issues?  Yes - management has reached out to me in the past but with each visit, it is clear to me that guest feedback does not effect how they run their business.  

The good news, it's America and they can run it however they choose and as long as they are in the black, they aren't going to do anything to change.  Can't argue with that logic I suppose.   I would suggest their Jimaca summer salad though - the dressing is the thing that made it great but I am going to be on the hunt for Jimaca for my salads at home.

I'll just keep going to Fuzzy's for my mexican food and entertain my friends at Cafe Boa.
