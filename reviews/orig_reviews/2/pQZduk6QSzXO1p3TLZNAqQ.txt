Service was slow, had to "borrow" silverware from the empty table next to us because the waiter was nowhere to be found. The drinks were overpriced. The Margaritas were good however $12 for a Margarita in a plastic cup at a restaurant seems outrageous. The atmosphere was much like a Hard Rock cafe. With that being said, the food was good.
