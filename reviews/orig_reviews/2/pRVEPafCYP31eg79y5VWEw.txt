This review is for Latin night on Friday's. 

A friend mentioned she wanted to go to Chayo for Latin night. I'm not big on the whole club scene, I like to stick to bars so I said why not. Latin night is every Friday from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m., which is lame, last time I checked we were in Las Vegas, not Los Angeles. 

So, we get in, there's a decent amount of people, there were tables all around the "dance floor", It looks like they just pushed dining tables to the side to make room for people to dance. There is a DJ, he played everything, from reggaeton, bachata, and salsa, towards the end of the night, he started playing corridos, that was our cue to leave.The mechanical bull is up and running if you want to ride it, but you have to take off your shoes. Bartenders are on the slow side, it took me 15 minutes to order and receive my drink, I ordered a sex on the beach, it had more juice than alcohol in it, you could barely taste it, on top of that it cost $11, I thought that was pretty hefty for a bar that literally served me juice. This is coming from a girl that's a lightweight, give me one sex on the beach and I'm usually quite tipsy. This drink did nothing.

I don't think I'll be visiting Chayo again. I didn't really enjoy my experience.
