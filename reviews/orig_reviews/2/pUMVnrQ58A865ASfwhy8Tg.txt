This place was horrible. Order incorrect. Service slow in an empty restaurant. No follow up on food. When ordering without onions, our server said... "Are you allergic," then proceeded to bring onions. Leaving the restaurant, the exit was clogged - hostess suggested that we "walk around," indicating an area where she expected us to interrupt other patrons' dinner to leave the restaurant. Beer was cold though!
