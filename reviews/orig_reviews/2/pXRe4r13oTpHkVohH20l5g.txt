I had high hopes for this place after seeing the reviews but it disappointed and I won't be going back. 

The chips were thick and stale. The salsa lacked flavor. The Guac was literally just mashed avocado  with a few pieces of cilantro. My carne asada burrito was a rice burrito. It was so overfilled with rice that I couldn't taste anything else. My coworkers fish tacos tasted of pure fried oil. So gross. 

The food took FOREVER to come out. We were all done eating and one of my coworkers hadn't even received his food yet. 

This place was bad all around and the food say heavy.
