The only reason I give this 2 stars is because the food was pretty good. 
Now the bad. 
First my friend and I sat at the bar to get something to eat, sat there about ten minutes, the bartender didn't even look at us. but we were there so we just opted to get a table instead. It was about 10:50 and we wanted lunch food.  WRONG. lunch there, for whatever reason, doesn't start until 11:00 on the dot. What's up with that??? and also once we got a table, it took a while to have a waitress come over to take our order. I will not be going there again.
