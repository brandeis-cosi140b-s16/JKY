Been here twice this time i ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, oh was i surprised as to how small my plate was, i actually thought it was an appetizer. Only 4 medium sized shrimp and a handful of rice and beans. Everybody else's plate was twice as big and cheaper than mine. Nick our server was great but i recommend management  that they make this plate bigger since you pay more than the other entrees. I was displeased and left hungry which never happens when i eat at a restaurant. If anything i always have leftovers.
