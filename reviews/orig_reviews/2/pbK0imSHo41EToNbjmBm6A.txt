Someone stole our reservation (they heard the receptionist say my name and took it even though I checked in and let them know id be at the bar) and after waiting 20 minutes we still didn't have our table (we found out right away but they weren't making them move)! They said they want to make everyone happy yet these people stole my name and my reservation and we are the people waiting ... I could not believe this happened- they had two managers working on this and then they called the GM over- the GM finally made them move (I guess they made another table for them?!?) after about 30 minutes- one of the managers finally came over and said sorry. My thought was why didn't you make them move 30 minutes ago since we knew what was going before they were all even seated- he said they couldn't physically remove them- yes that's true but they could have denied service but they didn't... They still got their drinks and chips while we were standing there waiting. I just felt like this could have been handled better- I kept having to walk over to see what was going on... They weren't coming to me or at least bringing us chips while we waited. Once we got seated we had great food, a round of free drinks, and a great server but having to wait 30 minutes while those name thieves munched on chips and the managers not handling it quickly made me pretty HANGRY!
