I love cafe rio and the food is really good but this location is horrible. They always run out of salmon I went for a whole month once a week on my day off and I only got to eat my salmon salad once because they always run out. To make matters worse they don't even bother putting out a sign and I waited in a long line for them to tell me they had no more salmon it was 1 in the afternoon. Its insane to me how they can run out. Today I absolutely had to yelp them because I stood in a long line and finally gave up and left. I left because I got close enough to realize why the line was so slow and long because they ran out of tortillas. What kind of mexican restaurant runs out of tortillas. Once again nothing was said to anyone in line. The line came to a complete stop while they tried to make the dough. Then they would throw the dough away and start again lokking and looking at the recipe. I just don't understand its friday night you should expect to be busy. I will say this it was the last time ill ever go to this location I will go an extra 10-15 minutes away to the centennial location from now on. I'm done with this location.
