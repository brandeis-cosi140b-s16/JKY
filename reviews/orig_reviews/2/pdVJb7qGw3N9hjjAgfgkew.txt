The Scottsdale Rd Jalape√±o Inferno used to be our favorite Mexican restaurant, and we have recommended it to many friends.  Not any more.  Things have changed, and both we and friends have noticed.  Some of it concerns Happy Hour and where it applies - used to be the entire restaurant and patio - now only the bar and bar patio area, which adjoins the  restaurant patio.  We had a party of 6 seated on the patio next to the bar patio, weren't aware of the changed Happy Hour, and were refused Happy Hour prices.  Rather than picking everything up and moving, we left and went to another restaurant.   On a recent previous occasion, we were served food that had been under the heat lamps too long and a waitress that was less than friendly.  Something has changed at this JI, and not for the better.
