I'm being grumpy because I have had far worse food. I drank water that tasted like my swimming pool. Chips obviously not fresh. Salsa tasted like canned tomatoes.  my Chili renno was not bad. Rice and beans not bad. Overall I enjoyed the meal. But for Arizona this place is lame. Also server had the personality of a cartel thug
