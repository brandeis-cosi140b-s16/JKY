I have been here a few times and I am never too impressed.

Scottsdale prices, and odd presentation detract from my overall experience.

The tortilla chips here are whole tostada rounds, meaning you need to break them yourself, they are also quite thick.

The guacamole has a bit too much lime for my taste and not enough spice.

The tacos with veggies could have used a bit more filling.
