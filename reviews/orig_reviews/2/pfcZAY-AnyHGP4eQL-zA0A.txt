So...here's the scoop:
Host asked what we wanted when we walked in the door (to eat, both of us, please?)
He seated us at our choice if tables, and seemed surprised that we were OK with a "community table"...there were a dozen other people there at the time.
A server brought waters, then told us the other guy would be our server.
The other guy stopped by about 5 minutes later, and asked if the previous server had taken our drink or app orders, and seemed annoyed that A) she had not, and B) we hadn't decided yet.
When he brought our drinks back he didn't get the order right, and seemed bothered that we wanted it right.
When we asked for HIS recommendation for what he liked, he said it was all good and he didn't have a favorite. 
When Jen asked for hers without cilantro, he asked if it was a preference or an allergy (it's an allergy).
Our appetizer came out quickly, followed too quickly by dinner.
We had: roasted corn on the corn appetizer, four tacos (al Pastor, Lamb, snapper, and braised beef). The food was DELICIOUS, the place was architecturally noteworthy, and the service was as bad as I can remember, and we eat out way too much. Maybe it was an off-night for our guy. I hope so, because I could be convinced to go back!!
