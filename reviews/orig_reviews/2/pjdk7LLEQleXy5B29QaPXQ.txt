Food is great. Service is slow. I've been standing in line for 20 minutes and the line isn't even long. As a restaurant manager, I know this isn't what managers want to hear about their establishments. I think part of the reason is that there in nearly zero communicstion, employees are moving slowly, and they seem to not care. Just some feedback for the crew to improve. Best wishes!
