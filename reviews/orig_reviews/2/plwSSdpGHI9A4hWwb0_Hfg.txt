Went on a Saturday night. Big mistake. Live music is SO LOUD  everyone in the place had to shout across table at their fellow guests. We were told by our waitstaff that the owner likes it that loud even though numerous customers complain to the  waitstaff. Hate it when owners won't listen to reasonable complaints from customers.  We were all just hoping to enjoy an evening out with friends and that wasn't the case. Got the mariscos enchiladas not worth the $22.00 I paid. Really feel like this place has seen its hayday and now it's on the downhill swing. Disappointing and in no hurry to return.
