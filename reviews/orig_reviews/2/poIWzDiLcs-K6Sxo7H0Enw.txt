This place looks really nice from the outside, and once entering is when it all changes. The service is terrible, I had the most ditzy girl ever, she was not friendly and was spending her time flirting with other guys. I can see management only hired her for her looks obviously... I ordered a chicken burrito, came back with a steak burrito. She took too long to check back on us so I ended up starting to eat it simply because I was too hungry to wait 30 minutes for her to stop talking to the guys she was eating food off of. Then I mentioned that I asked for a chicken burrito, and she said she could only give me 15% off when there was clearly over half the plate still full. Then we asked to split the check in half because we shared an appetizer(which was full because it tasted poorly also) and she was unable to do it. I've been to many places and they are able to split the check in half. Anyways, don't waste your time here unless you're a goodlooking male in your early 20's because the girls care about no one else.
