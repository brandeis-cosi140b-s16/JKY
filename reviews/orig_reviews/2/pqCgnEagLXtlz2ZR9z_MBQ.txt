As a friend once said - "Below average food at an above average price."  I couldn't have said it better myself so I stole the line.  You can also read it in her review which is currently mocking me from the list of previous Verde reviews to the right of my screen.  Stop judging me, sidebar!

This is my second visit to Verde, the first being during their "soft" opening.  I decided not to review it at that time - instead giving the place a little more time to get their cajones together.  No such luck on this visit.  During my first visit I was treated to the very warm atmosphere and friendliness of the bartending staff. Unfortunately, my trio of friends waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and things didn't improve from there.  The food was fine, but pricey for what we got IMO.  Round Corner Cantina does it better and cheaper...again, IMO.  

This second visit was more of the same. Again we waited for our drinks, which this time were just a pair of Diet Cokes and a water, so no complicated mortar and pestle business there.  My two buds ordered the same dinner - grilled chicken tacos and I had the Pollo En Mole Poblano or, Big Ass Piece of Chicken, for short.  Again, the food was totally fine.  Their tacos were fine tacos and my chicken was fine chicken, though pretty bland.  The best and most surprising part of the menu was the Mango Iced Tea, which we only discovered due to an unexpected shortage of Diet Coke (true story).  

I want to like Verde.  Mexican is my absolute favorite genre next to cake and donuts.  Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen.  It's Round Corner, Mad Mex or Emiliano's for me.  I'll probably try a third visit since it's on my daily commute and I can't resist a good tequila.  I'll pass on the food, but bottoms up!
