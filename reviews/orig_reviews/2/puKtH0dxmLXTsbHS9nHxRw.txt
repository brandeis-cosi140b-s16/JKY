I visited Original Lindo Michoacan in May while in Vegas for the Mayweather-Pac fight. A group of us took cabs from the strip to the restaurant. 
1. The service was great
2. The food was just ok. I've eaten    Mexican food for over 35 years. It was just ok.
3. The margaritas were the worst I've EVER had. You can't be a good Mexican restaurant and have terrible margaritas.....

With that said, I won't return when I'm in Vegas this September for another Mayweather fight. I had read so many positive reviews but I was thoroughly unimpressed. My reputation as a foodie took a hit from the group I had brought there....
