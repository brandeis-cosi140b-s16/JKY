The hubbs and I went in one night while the kids were away. We live close by but hadn't tried it before so we thought we'd give it a shot.  I was surprised when we went inside, I thought it would be more....well, just more.  Oh well, some of the best places to eat are dives, right?  

We ordered our food (pricier than you'd expect for what it is) and sat down to wait. When our food came we settled down to eat only to be told that we had to eat elsewhere, that the dining room closes at 8. When we got there we thought we had plenty of time because the door says they're open till 9.  A little put off, we packed up and headed to our car. The door was closed and locked after us and all the lights were turned out. Guess they were closing early that night (8:30).

Things didn't improve from there. We dug into our food as soon as we got home only to find that it wasn't very good. I had ordered a carne asada torta, which I had been craving, and the meat was dry and salty and the guacamole was only spread on the bread in a super thin layer like you would mayo. My hubby got tacos and by the second one I could see he had lost interest. According to them they were bland. 

Overall, not a great experience. Next time I'll head to Rienda's. They've never let us down.
