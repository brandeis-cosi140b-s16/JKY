We've been to Nacho Daddy twice...it was fairly new the first time we went so they were still "working on things". We sat in the bar area for Happy Hour. There is a small appetizer section of the menu where you can get items half price during happy hour, so that was pretty good...but it's mostly bar type food (chicken fingers, sliders, etc). Great value, but we were a little surprised that they charge for chips and salsa. What Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa??? Sure it's inexpensive, but isn't that the point...give your customers something. The food was decent, nothing worth noting.

We went back tonight, sat in the bar area again and were hoping they may have worked out the new restaurant issues. The happy hour menu is the same. The sliders come in a choice of meats, but you cannot get one of each (the last time we went, you could). Apparently, the chef doesn't like to do that. Although the chef did, he wouldn't do it again when we went to order more for the table. They still charge for the chips and salsa, and there are only two lousy selections of beer at happy hour prices. I liked my strawberry margarita, but I seriously doubt there was any alcohol in it. Oh, and the chips were tasteless and stale.

The food was okay...for happy hour prices, fine, but I wouldn't pay regular prices at this place. Can we bring back El Jefe's?
