We went to this place cause we looked at some reviews and people gave high remarks BUT we were disappointed. The enterance showed promise, but the inside let us down. We sat at a table inside that over looked the pond with the ducks and turtles but there were 5 flys on our window alone. And we sat right next to a fly light. I ordered the quesadilla and added chicken and it was soaking wet with juice from the chicken. The tortilla fell apart because of it be so soaked. We had ordered the app quac but it came with the meal and tasted more like avacado paste than quac. Had high hopes but was let down.
