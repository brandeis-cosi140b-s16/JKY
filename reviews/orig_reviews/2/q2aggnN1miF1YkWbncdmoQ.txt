Warning: Avoid the black tortilla chips!!!

We went here for the happy hour and the proximity to my house. While I found the $5 house margaritas not very cheap for a happy hour, my friends and I ordered a round anyway. The coolest part about the drink was the glass it came in. One friend found the taste sweet, while I found them average. 

I ordered the Blue Chicken Enchilada. All in all the food tasted decent. 

My problem with Agave came the next morning. 

This is no joke, my stool for the day was bright green. 

At first I thought I was having a medical emergency. Then my friend, who also ate there, said he had the same thing. We both had green poo from eating at Agave. We contributed it to the die in the black tortilla chips they serve. So if you go here, avoid the black chips.
