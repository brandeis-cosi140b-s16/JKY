Again with the hype for Old Town bars... Yet another friend said, "You have to try ABC Bar", this time being El Hefe. Yet another bar failed to live up to the recommendation.

(Though in retrospect, her recommendation was probably due to her running into the same old man who liked to buy all her drinks every time... should have taken that into account).

Strike 1: So loud I can't hear myself. Literally engaging my diaphragm and voice projection training just to make myself heard to my friends and the waitresess.

Strike 2: The tacos are not that great. They have duck, which is the only really saving grace about them, but they're like $5 for this little tiny,1/4 of a tortilla sized taco. They tasted pretty boring to me.

Strike 3: I had to hunt down my waitress. I mean, I walked around for 10 minutes looking for her to cash out, and this place is SMALL. I was very tempted to walk out on the tab just due to the crappy service..

Strike 4: We got water dumped on us due to the awnings outside. The manager sent us a round of shots, and he wasn't fooling anybody, they were pure grapefruit juice. Gee, thanks for filling my Vitamin C requirement...?

Oh snap, 4 strikes and you are definitely out of the park for good, El Hefe.
