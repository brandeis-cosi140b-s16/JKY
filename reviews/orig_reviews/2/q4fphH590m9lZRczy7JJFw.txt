It's either a one or a two, I'll be generous and give it a two. 

My first and only time in this place was to celebrate mine and my BF's birthday, we were staying at the Monte Carlo so it made perfect sense to go downstairs here.
We ordered a shot, and Miss Bartender told us that she can not make any shots, all she can do for us is a shot of Patron.  NOW wait a minute, you're a bartender?  
We settled for it, paid $12 for each shot and walked out.
HOrrible service from this lady, needless to say I will not be coming back.  
It was also very stuffy in there. I did like the dimmed lights.
