Not impressed. The food was not very flavor full and the service was slow and non existent. We couldn't get out waitresses attention so my husband went to order a drink at the bar. There were 4 people behind the bar washing dishes and even looked up at him and didn't see of he needed assistance. This is not what I am used to from a Mexican restaurant. You don't get what you pay for.
