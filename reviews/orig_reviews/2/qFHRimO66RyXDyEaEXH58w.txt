In a word, disappointing.  I've never dined at Delux.  Despite their reputation, I find it hard to believe that I could get a burger, better then an animal style, Double-Double, outside my own grill.  Now that I know that the folk who own Delux also own Revo, I doubt that I will ever taste a Delux burger.

My friend and I ordered separately.  I, a Green Chili burrito and she, a cheese crisp.  Service was OK.  I got my burrito in a timely fashion but my friend had to wait forever for her cheese crisp.  This isn't a sit down joint so I don't discredit it too much for that.

I picked up my burrito and as it was flopping over, I took my first bite.  It deflated.  I saw what little was inside, sink to the bottom half of the tortilla.  My burrito was half-hollow.  What filling was inside was bland and of little substance.  The salsa was pretty good but needing it is not a plus.

My friends cheese crisp was good but no points for melting cheese on an open tortilla and slapping guacamole and pico de gallo on it.

I certainly won't be eating here again.  I am not fooled by upscale decor.

On a side note: The Jalisco-style places are just as fresh as a Revo.  Saying they're not makes you look ignorant and stuck-up.
