We have gone several times and the food has been delicious and service excellent. Today we got chicken tortilla soup and a quesadilla to go and Ohmygod!!!! The chicken tortilla soup was the most disgusting soup I've ever had...it was like it was all of the leftover chicken pieces. There wasn't a single solid piece of chicken just chicken fat and strange parts of the chicken. The quesadilla was soggy and had bell peppers in it? I don't know I was shocked...we threw everything out and went back out for soup we felt comfortable consuming.
