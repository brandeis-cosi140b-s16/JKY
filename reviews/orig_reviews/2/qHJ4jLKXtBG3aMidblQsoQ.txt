1 and a half stars.

Previosly i would have given this place 3 or 4 stars because it is authentic greasy mexican food that was always pretty decent.

However the other day me and my roomate went here for lunch and both got food poisioning.

So I'll  leave you with this caveat, eating at taqueria guadalajara is like rolling a pair of dice.  It might come up good and you get some alright mexican food or you might crap out and get food poisioning.

I definately won't be eating here again but once again that is due pretty much entirely to getting food poisioning which was lame.
