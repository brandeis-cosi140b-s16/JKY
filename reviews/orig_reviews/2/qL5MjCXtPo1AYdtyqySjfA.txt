Went here on a Friday night (honestly because we couldn't get into Cowfish) and it was mediocre at best. 

Started off with the house chips and salsa and ordered a side of guacamole. The salsa was too spicy for a house salsa, with lots of jalape√±o seeds. The guacamole was flavorless. No flavor what so ever. Squeezed my margarita lime into it and added table salt. Still didn't help.

I ordered the chicka-chicka boom boom per the managers request and enjoyed the boom boom sauce, but that was about it. The rice was dry and the beans bland. Canned beans are better. 

My boyfriend ordered the combination dinner; the sirloin taco meat looked questionable. 

I was expecting this to be a decent Mexican restaurant but it was beyond sub-par. We won't be going back.
