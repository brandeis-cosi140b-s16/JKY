If you go to the mission, you'll enjoy some great food and an elegant setting. I highly recommend getting the guacamole that they make fresh.

You must also be prepared to deal with the worst service in Scottsdale. The waiter asked me and a friend how we found out about the place, and he made us feel out of place. He also assumed that we were having trouble reading the menu because the quality of food was too good for our tastes.
