I read the reviews on here, so I was excited to try this place especially since it's so close to my house.   After eating there once, I doubt that I will ever go again.  I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the beans, and theirs didn't taste good.  I ordered the machaca (shredded beef with onions, bell peppers and tomatoes) tacos.  They came without any cheese.  WHAT?!?!?  How can you give me a taco without cheese!  The meat was OK but the taco itself was very greasy.  My husband ordered two enchiladas, one machaca and one chicken.  He liked the machaca but took two bites of his chicken and didn't like it.  I have to admit their horchata (rice milk drink) was good and a good size.  I know there's better Mexican food out there, so I'll keep searching...
