I love the food. But they have the worst policy when it comes to splitting checks. We went there with some friends who were out visiting and they put up a huge fight just to split the check. We then went there again tonight with my mom who is visiting and again the put up a huge fight to split the check. The waiter had the worst additude about it. Sad we will not be returning here again.
