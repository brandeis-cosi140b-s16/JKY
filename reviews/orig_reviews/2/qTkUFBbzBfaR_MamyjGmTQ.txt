Food is OK. Guacamole is delicious.

But service is horrendous. Slow, rude, lackadaisical. We asked for water refills so many times. When it finally came the server slammed the bottles on the table as if he was inconvenienced by having to serve us. Our group of 8 was the only other table in the restaurant around lunchtime when we sat down. We immediately ordered guacamole. 20 minutes later when the guacamole had still not arrived we politely inquired. "It's being made by hand. It's not in a package somewhere. If you need something fast, this isn't the place to come!" All we could think was, wow, 20 minutes isn't asking for an appetizer "fast" and considering its downtown location, you might not want to tell downtown professionals that you cant service them promptly.

Meals came out at a variety of times. First 3 people served together. Then 8 minutes later another 2 people. Then 2 more. Then the last person. 

Almost ran out of water again.

Also when we arrived at 11:35am I told the server I would like to order soon because I needed to leave by 12:30-12:40. I did make it out in time, to their credit, but I don't think 60 minutes over lunch is "speedy" in a downtown environment when you are the second table in line for lunch.

Our group had visited this restaurant one time before, and decided then not to go back. We thought that because it had been a few months we would give it another try. It was WORSE this time.

Never going back.
