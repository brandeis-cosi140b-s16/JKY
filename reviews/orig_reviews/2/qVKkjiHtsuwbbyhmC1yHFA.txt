My hubby and I are fairly new to the Scottsdale area and on the hunt for a good Mexican food restaurant.  We stopped in here because it had a nice patio area, but the menu prices were high.  We ordered chips & salsa and guacamole to start.  After reading the mediocre reviews on Yelp, we decided that this place was way over priced for what the offer.  Our chips & salsa and guacamole cost us over $11.00, (not including the tip). The guacamole came in a very small bowl and wasn't all that great...definitely not worth the more than $5 we paid for it.  We have opted to spend our hard earned money elsewhere.  BTW - where I come from, good Mexican restaurants don't charge for chips & salsa...
