Okay, I live in the Melrose district and try to frequent the local businesses whenever I can to support my 'hood.... but I think that I've marked America's off my personal  "patronize" list. 

Went today for the first time in about a month for carne asada burritos, and a Mexican Coke. Burritos were, well, limp AND lame. No real flavor, no spicy "kick", and kinda mushy and just overall bland. 

Service was very matter-of-fact and not friendly in the least - are all of the employees at the 7th Avenue location unhappy with their jobs or are they just "salty" on Sundays because they're hung-over from Saturday night. No, really.... borderline rude service and the place was not overly busy or crowded.  

As the previous Yelper mentioned, parking is indeed a bitch as times - just park on the side street - it's much easier than America's lot.  

Final thing - this place is kinda pricey given the portion size - which has also been previously mentioned by others. It seems to be that portion size is getting SMALLER over the past 3 or 4 months. Cost-cutting, perhaps?? If so, it's really degrading the product.
