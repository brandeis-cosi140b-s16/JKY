The food is great but service is terrible at this location. I accidentally asked for the house dressing instead of the vinaigrette and you would have thought I asked them for the world on a platter. The restaurant was an absolute mess, napkins and food all over the floor, sticky tables and even though I informed someone that the soda fountain was out of syrup, it wasn't attended to the entire time we were there. 

It's a shame to have such a poor representation of this great chain.
