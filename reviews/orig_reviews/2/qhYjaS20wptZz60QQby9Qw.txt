Didn't like it, but we have the best Mexican in Dallas so I am biased.

The margaritas were decent. Salsa was ehh, just had brisket tacos for apps...Cute patio. Live music, as in the guy with guitar singing "la bamba!"

Wouldn't go back. Crowd was kind of boring. Other places along Scottsdale Blvd looked way more lively.
