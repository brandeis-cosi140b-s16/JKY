Maybe I ordered the wrong entrée 

 I absolutely love Mexican food, and have eaten at just about every Mexican restaurant in Metro Phoenix. I've read a number of reviews for Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, so I was excited to give it a try. 

I want to start this review on a positive note.  The service at Poco's Fiesta Del Sol is amazing.  Once you are seated you're served a hot basket of chips and salsa and the salsa is delicious. I wish I could say the same about the rest of my meal.

On todays visit my lunch companion and I shared a chesse crisp, ground beef burrito with cream cheese, and a side of refried beans. The refried beans were dry and tasteless, the ground beef burrito with cream cheese  was very greasy and just didn't taste good.  I know some people seem to really like Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, but I'm just not one of them, maybe it was my entrée selection
