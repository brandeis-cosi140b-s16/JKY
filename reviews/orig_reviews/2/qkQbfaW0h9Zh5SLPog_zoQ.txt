This is one of the only sit down establishments in the Las Vegas C terminal. The main draw is the bar - it is Jose Cuervo after all. If you would like food, I can only explain it as a sit down Taco Bell, except the quessadilla is $14 instead of $2.

The patrons here are the worst part. They are either too drunk, too sad, too happy or confused. If you are a poor weary traveller stuck on a layover here and want to sit down, I am sorry.

The guacamole and chips here is $10. Again, this is a Taco Bell - so picture Taco Bell guac.... yes, it's green but you question if it has avocado in it.... that's Jose Cuervo Taqileria.
