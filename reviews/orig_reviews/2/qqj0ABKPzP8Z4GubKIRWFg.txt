The service is excellent. Friendly staff. Knowledgeable about the food. The shrimp appetizers were great. The guacamole was good. The chips were bland. My shrimp tacos were flavor less. They seriously need to learn how to season their food. Second time I've been there and the food needed a kick. I won't be back.
