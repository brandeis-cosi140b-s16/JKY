Sad to say, this was a disappointment.  We eat out quite a bit and try all the new restaurants.  The picture in Phoenix Magazine made the restaurant look bright and cheerful....but thought it was quite the opposite.  Interesting menu...the chips were great, but, unfortunately, the food was just "ok".  There are many other places in town that serve very good Mexican food.  In Amy's review, she said she "breaks out in hives when she has to eat in Scottsdale....well I felt the same with the clientele in this restaurant.
