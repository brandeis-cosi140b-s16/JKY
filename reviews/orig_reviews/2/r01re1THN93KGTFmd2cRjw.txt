So went to the media opening of this restaurant last week and had a fabulous time. A+ service!!! Got a gift card to come back and use.

Came back last night and walked in, there was no hostess. Waited around, which was fine because I was waiting for my friend. In that 5 mins, no one acknowledged my existence, even though the bartender and a server saw me. I did not see a sign to "seat yourself," so I waited. My friend showed up, so we stood there waiting again. Finally left and went to Yard House.

In an area with so much restaurant competition, I would think they would be seating customers right away. I was looking forward to chicken enchiladas all day too :(

I would only come back to use my giftcard, if they will actually seat me next time!

2 stars because I had fun the first time around.
