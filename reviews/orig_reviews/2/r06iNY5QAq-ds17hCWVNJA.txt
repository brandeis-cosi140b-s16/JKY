Meh, I've had better. Went here for lunch the other day and the place was packed. Seated right away and was met by the server instantly with chips. There was a little man walking around with a make shift cart offering tableside guac. A little odd and pricey. $6 for one avocado or $8 for two...hmmm...ok. Not bad for price of tableside guac if the portion matched the price, which it did not.

Ordered the combo place of tostada, enchilada and taco. Came with typical rice and beans. The portion was HUGE! Could barely finish it and had to wait to start it because it was so hot. Hot like it was sitting under the lamp too long. Flavors were just ok. 

All in all, decent, though not a place I'll likely return considering all the other good Mexican restaurants around town.
