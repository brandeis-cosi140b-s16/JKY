I'm not from here and was looking or some authentic Mexican food.  I found this place while driving on the highway after picking up family up from airport. Based on the reviews (4+ stars), I thought it would be a good place to eat on the fly. 

I should have been leery when the restaurant was empty at lunch time (12:30).  
The set up was very nice with indoor and outside seating.  Service was slow.  It took a while for everything (order, drinks, appetizers, check) despite there being few diners. Margarita was weak.  Fajitas didn't sizzle.  My family thought that the food lacked flavor (added lots of extra hot sauce ) but I thought it was OK (only added a little hot sauce).  

Next time I'll pull over and spend a little more time researching so I don't end up at a place like this again.
