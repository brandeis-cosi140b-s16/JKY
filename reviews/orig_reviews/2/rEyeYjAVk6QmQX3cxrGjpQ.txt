Gorgeous ambiance and amazing aesthetics in the Casino area of ARIA... UN-Fortunately... the food isn't any good and the drinks are mediocre.  Great choice of tequilas and scotch which was cool. You're best off getting chips and salsa and a water, and thats about it.   This is Mexican food for the white man!!  It's not authentic, or traditional, but it is a great place to take a date b/c the decor is amazing.  Too bad the food isn't as good as the venue!  $8 for a tecate and $14 for an average margarita.  If you want great Mexican food with great drinks VISIT "SEGUNDO" by the fashion show mall/RA sushi.  If you don't care about good food but want a nice atmosphere, but all means visit!
