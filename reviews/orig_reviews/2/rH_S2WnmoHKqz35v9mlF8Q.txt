I've given Cien Agaves three chances now and they just haven't provided me with anything that makes me to try them again.

I've had the veggie tacos, the fish tacos, chips, salsa, beer and the chips, salsa and beer were pretty good.

This past visit the service was good so that raised it to two stars.

If you are a friend of mine and you want me to come to a happy hour or lunch, do not pick this restaurant.
