It was all right. I really can't say anything, to be honest. It's not quite a 3 star, but it's not even really a 2. Service was nice and the people were nice, but the food was a bit..."eh."

Nothing to write home about. Prices were nice and cheap.

I'll shell out a few more bucks and hit Rosa's. It's more flavorful. While LT has a decent kick, the flavor is a bit ho hum.

The tortillas were nice and fresh...that was the best part of the meal. I had ordered the carne asada burrito. It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right. The carnitas tacos were a bit of a let down...the meat was dry, but the salsa was all right.

If you're looking for fast and easy, this is it. If you want food brought to you and you can relax, I'd suggest going to a sit down restaurant.

This had too much of a fast food feel for my taste.
