This restaurant has seriously gone down hill the last few months.  I used to love coming to Macayo's for a dinner but not any longer.  Their service was always great but the food has changed the last few months and not for the better.  I love tacos and I love that their tacos were shredded beef with a homemade crispy taco shell.  Now the meat is ground beef and the taco shells are pre-made from a box (all uniform shaped).  If I wanted a taco like that, I'll go to Del Taco or Taco Bell.  The last 3 times in 3 months that I've eaten their food it made me sick all night long.  I noticed the food was more greasy too.  I have tried different things each time but it has all made me sick. I won't be going back any time soon.  Damn shame too because I liked this place.
