Perhaps I made the mistake of ordering burritos when the drive-through person had said they were known for their tacos. After all, what good is a restaurant named Los Tacos, if you can't master the tacos, right? 

It was one of those days that I wanted a fat burrito. 
Cool thing is they can pan fry your burrito so that it gets crispy. However, the order was a bit more work for drive-through than expected. 

The standard carne asada burrito comes with beans, pico de gallo, and rice. I paid extra to add the triple mixing of sour cream, guacamole, and cheese. 

I'm not used to ordering a burrito that doesn't come with what I would think are the basics. 

Even with the additions, I'd give this burrito 2 stars. Decent, but far from good. 

I'll be back to give the tacos a shot in the future, but maybe not for a while with the choice of plenty other tacos available. 

The convenience of a drive-through is a definite plus. 
My burrito cost about $8.50, and I've had far better paying $5.50-$6.00 at some hole-in-the-wall places in California.
