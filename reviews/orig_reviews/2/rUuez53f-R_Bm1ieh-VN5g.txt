Decided to meet some friends here for lunch. Being the fashionably late person I am, showed up around 4:30. Which lets me check out all the cool decor, except the freaky bathrooms. Felt like I walked straight into a club decked out with neons and blacklights while peeing. Just a bit weird since it doesn't match with anything else they got going on at all.

The service is very friendly. I liked her recommendations and thought they were sensible. Had a salad for lunch. It was fruit. With wine. Okay it was a Sangria, I'm on a liquid diet okay? Why did I choose this? Because I could not in good conscience pay $3-4 for a mini taco.

Sorry Maverick I did taste my friend's orders though and was not super thrilled by the flavors. I can get a better taco from one of the Latino food trucks on the side of South Blvd. Serious.
