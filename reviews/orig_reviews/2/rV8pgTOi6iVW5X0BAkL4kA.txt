The first time I went here with my husband for date night with get, I really wanted to love this place. The atmosphere is fun and I liked the dia de Los Muertos theme a Spanish slang on the menu (comida a toda madre!). We ordered quest fundido and a asking chola and dos xx. Aright, coo...got street tacos aaand royally disappointed on the al pastor, and pescado. The Barrio pollo was good, but I've had better street tacos, well, anywhere. the service was good, but the food bleh. 

Went again about a king later with a girlfriend, sat at the bar and took forever for someone to even acknowledge us (it was NOT busy, still open seats at the bar and restaurant and was early Saturday). Ordered a drink to calm my irritated nerves, had a quirky male bartender who actually turned our bad start around. Left satisfied and this time ordered a pollo and a carnitas-safe choices. Aright maybe this place is growing on me!

Went a third time for a hangover lunch and this is where I've concluded this place does not justify their pricey menu items. Waitress f'd up 2 of the 4 orders and while she quickly fixed it, her smug attitude was a turn off. I ordered a pork green chili taco and then there's no fuckin pork in it just all green chile and onion, I mean come on?! Who is working back there in the kitchen? Only one way to describe their food-Americanized and not in a good way, they can't get it right and for $3.50 a taco I would expect better. I get $1.25 tacos better up the street on Gilbert and Broadway, but I might come here to get tipsy first.
