We stopped in. A couple days before xmas. The wine and margaritas were tasty, but not cheap. 

The service was slow. We ordered thr poblano dip and chicken entree. Both arrived cold. We informed our overwhelmed server. She microwaved both dishes for us... fresh cut lettuce , tomatoes and all.

Food was terribly bland. 

I would not return.
