Visited on March 1 for dinner with a large group. It was super crowded, pretty noisy (these are things I can forgive if the food is good). Service wasn't great either, there were only 3 servers and they were working pretty hard. We waited a long time for our orders and about 2 people had to wait a really long time for their food.

The chips and salsa were eh, ok. I ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco, no sides. The food was bland and not too flavorful. Unfortunately, a person in our party found a hair in their taco. After hunting down our server, she quickly took it away, but there was quite a wait for the new plate.

It's cheap, but I wouldn't go back unless I had no choice.
