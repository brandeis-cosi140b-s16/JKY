This place just gives off a "Meh" vibe. On the bright side, it is located inside the Flamingo and you can get relatively inexpensive food and drinks. On the downside, the quality of products and service match the price point, so it isn't much of a bargain. I've been here for both the food and the nightlife, so I'll cover both separately. 
 
 Food: Pretty mediocre bar & grille food but at a very reasonable [Vegas] price. I paid (thanks to losing card roulette) for 4 people, including a few drinks and tip, and it was right at $100. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and I don't remember anyone being overly impressed with their food. 
 
 Nightlife: We were passing by just after 1am on a Thursday and they were clearly having a party. Dark flashing lights, club music, and the place looked packed through the small window opening. The promoters out front tried to rope us in for the open bar, which lasted until 3. We wanted to go in and scope out the scene, but somehow the promoter convinced us we didn't need to do that. After a bit of price negotiation, we decided to go in around 1:30. They poured plenty of strong drinks (if you tip well), but they closed the bar at 2:30, not 3am, so we really only got 2-3 drinks for the $15 plus some obnoxious tips to get service. The place wasn't overly crowded, but they had select sections closed off so it seemed much busier than it really was. 
 
 I'd like to tell you that I won't be back, but in Vegas if you can get an edible meal and an open bar for $40 per person, you take it.
