I am only give it two stars because they did have good guacamole. As for the rest of the food it would get 1 star. 

I thought it was impossible to mess up tacos but these were so bland! I even drown them in salsa to try and help them but that didn't even work. 

I have zero plans to go back to eat but would maybe do drinks and guacamole.
