Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.

Had Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.

Huge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.

Ordered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!

A friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her "Well, lemme see what I can do". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh

No add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.

I won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar.
