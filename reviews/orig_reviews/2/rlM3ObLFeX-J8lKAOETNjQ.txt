Based on recent reviews, I convinced the Dr. we should give this place one more try tonight.  I..was wrong.  We sat outside.  The place was busy but not overly so.  Found something interesting things on the menu. The Dr. ordered a glass of wine while we look for something interest to eat.  She waited and waited.  Ordered wine with our food order 7-9 minutes later and when I didn't get my wine in a reasonable amount of time, I ask the server for it. She brought mine and still had not brought the Dr. hers.  Really? That wouldn't be the servers last mishap of the evening. She went and retrieve the wine but no sign of an apology, I'm so sorry.. nothing. We ordered.  I had the shrimp tamales which were decent enough and the Dr. had tacos which she ordered with flour tortillas and got them with corn tortillas.  I had also ordered a side of beans which I never received.  The guac and salsa where ok to better than average.  Nothing super special (We are two real deal guac heads. We know guac).  The pour of the wines of was very generous. Think 10-12 ounces but when the Dr. tasted my Rioja, she immediately wrinkled her nose and said that is old and sour. We looked at each other with that look that says "ok we gave them a shot but we ain't never coming back here" and ask it was time to ask for the check.   I let our server know I never received my side of beans so I don't want to pay for it.  She said 'oh, you don't have to pay for them.  You want them now?' She had just cleared our table of all the empty dishes from what did arrive and our silverware.  I said no, just the check and looked at the Dr. with that 'did we teleport to bizarro world or something'.. We left a small tip and left....won't ever go back.
