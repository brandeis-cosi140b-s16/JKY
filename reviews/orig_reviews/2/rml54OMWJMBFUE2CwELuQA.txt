Sorry folks....I don't know if there is a lot of dead taste buds out there or we just
get confused with portion size and quality of the food....
I took my MIL form Oregon other day to have lunch (second time...first was soon after it opened and was not impressed then-too much cheese...) and although it is very nice  inside and service was very good....I cannot say much for the food. Sure...you get huge quantities but it is more "gringo" food than any kind of spices or flavor..even my MIL who knows little about good Mexican food said "this is bland"....
I ordered the chicken burro..it was huge...stuffed with large white tender chunks of chicken...
totally tasteless. I had a whole mouthful of the chicken and there was absoulutly no flavor!  I then tried the Tostado...nothing more than refrieds out of a can with lots of cheese, lettuce and tomato on top..I can make this at home...when we go to a restaurant we want a step up at least from home cooking....
Anyway the list goes on....what it boils down is the lack of any kind of spices or herbs
or even "smoking" the meat...Remember Tia Rosa? They smoked their meats and had a herb garden in back....talk about many flavors!!!
To be fair...maybe its what I ordered....I am willing to go back and try some of their
specialty dishes...maybe this is what their known for....not large quantities of "gringo"
food....
