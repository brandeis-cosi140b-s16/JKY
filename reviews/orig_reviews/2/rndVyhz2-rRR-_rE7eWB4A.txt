Definitely over priced! Especially for the 3 tacos for $10+? We had 9 orders of it one time and it took an hour to make... We were getting very anxious and annoyed. When we told our server we wanted to cancel our order she finally went to the back to check and brought it out. SMH. An order of tacos comes with 3 tacos, rice, and black beans...

It does the trick if you're stranded in Vegas and can't find any tacos if you're craving some. Interesting name too. Can't say anything else about restaurant since we did a to go order.
