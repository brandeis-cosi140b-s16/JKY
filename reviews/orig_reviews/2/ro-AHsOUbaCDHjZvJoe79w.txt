Been here twice and disappointed both times.

Food is OK. Guac is over priced. Specialty cocktails way too sweet. Staff not very personable ... I would actually go as far as to say continuously weeded and awkward.

Went there a few nights ago with family and friends and we literally sat there and chatted for an hour before I finally made eye contact with our waitress like "HEY WE'RE READY". Just because we're talking doesn't mean we're not hungry.  She was running around all night just looking way too busy.

Tortilla soup tasteless.
Ensalada Sol was good, but I could've made a better salad at home for half the price..
Want to add chipotle shrimp? Don't. Also tasteless and no spice at all.

Apparently the enchiladas and street tacos are good.

Also, the apparent manager reaches over our table to turn on the electric candle... Without saying a word. We all stop to look at him since we had no idea who he was and why he were reaching across the table turning on the candle and then walking away. Try something like "Hi! My name is soandso, and I'm the manager here. How are those margaritas?" ... While reaching for the candle. Or better yet, TURN THEM ALL ON BEFORE DINNER SERVICE ;) 

Customer service isn't bad, just weird. Hostesses are friendly opening doors and what not, but when you mention its still happy hour you should give us happy hour menu's as well and there are tables near the door, hold off on the personal chitchat, because I don't care what you're doing later tonight.

ALL SUMMED UP:
Food: overpriced (not saying it's totally bad, but it's OVERPRICED)
Service: inexperienced staff and way too casual for The Quarter (use proper verbiage, make eye contact, and SMILE... advice applicable to everyone working there, except the young boy who always refilled my water :)
Atmosphere: trendy.

I'll go to Chipotle next time.
