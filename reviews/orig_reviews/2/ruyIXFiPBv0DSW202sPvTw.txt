I've gone to various America's Taco Shop locations before and have never been that impressed. I'd say the same for this experience. 

1st things, we ordered this for a school lunch meeting the other day. We put in the order the night before but no one ever saw it. It was packaged in a hurry and very difficult to distribute. We certainly wold not order it for a group event again. 

That being said I went back today because I was craving tacos and could bike there in between classes. I was happy to see they gave me napkins in my to go order but that was about the only good thing.  The tacos were meh, as I had expected, but the worst things was this entire place smelled like a bathroom. So if you think America is a bathroom I guess the title is for you. I personally love America and do not care for this place. 

I'd take a pass.
