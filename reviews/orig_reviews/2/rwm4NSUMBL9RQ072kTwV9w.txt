I was really disappointed by the food. I love Mexican food and have high standard so I may be biased. 

Food was mediocre. Guacamole was very basic but the salsas were great. Chips seemed fresh (although I'm not positive) and likely not from a generic bag produced in mass quantities. However I hated the tortillas.  I love fresh flour tortillas that are very authentic. There isn't an option for this. We only got corn tortillas the fajitas.  The fajitas were drenched in too much sauce which is very sad because the chicken  and veggies were cooked perfectly. I wouldn't wipe enough of the sauce off. The corn was undercooked. 

Service was not good and I have trouble saying this because the staff was very nice but it was too disorganized. The waiter forgot many things but was always nice when he approached so of course I figured it was just too new of a venue. Perhaps they should do mock service if they didn't bc the hostesses were very confused as well. They didn't bring any napkins or utensils and seems a little lost when I asked for it. But they were very sweet and gracious so I can't hold this against them.  I think a little more training will solve this. 

I was excited to try the cocktails but the balance was wrong. My drink was too sweet. I appreciate when they can make a good drink that is balanced so just some minor adjustments are needed. 

I think they have what it takes but there's a lot of work to be done. Good selection is staff but more training is needed and some works needs to be done to perfect the food.

I would give it some time before coming back.
