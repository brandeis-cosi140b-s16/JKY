I really thought this would be a great place to eat, but I was really disappointed ! Got there at 11:30 am place was super busy! Really wanted a beef burrito, went to order . No beef?! Really it's the beginning of your lunch rush and no beef ? Only 2 options chicken or pork. Went with the pork. The presentation was great it looks fresh . But the inside including the pork was cold! Bland flavor ! 2 people cost 24.00! Wish I'd gone to Del Taco! Won't go there again !
