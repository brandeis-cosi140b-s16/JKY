This location has turned over several times over the years, which is perplexing given the enviable location.   Only a couple buildings down, Pei Wei rocks it with a steady flow of business.  

Hacienda is another disappointment, adding to the lineage of subpar establishments that have attempted to gain a foothold here in the Summit.  

Service is slow and could really use an extra body or two both with the waitstaff and bussers. The Calamari salad's centerpiece, the calamari itself, was bready and underseasoned.  The Chile Relleno could have been good, but there was too much cheese stuffed inside the peppers.  This, coupled with the fact that the Chiles needed another minute in the fryer, contributed to a mealy almost pasty interior which I just couldn't stomach.  

The drinks need some attention, too. The Mango Miracle is anything but a godsend. Overladen with cilantro and finished with a mango nectar which has no mango flavor, I was left still searching for that miracle.  The skinny organic margarita was oddly bubbly with an overly sweet aftertaste.  

Unhappily, I think we will find that the Hacienda will soon become the ex - Hacienda in the not too distant future.
