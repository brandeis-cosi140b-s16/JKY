This place was a bad experience.  We checked out the menu before going in and it seemed like a great idea to have both Mexican and Chinese in one spot.  The waitress told us all to order about 2-3 dishes per person...I'm so happy we didn't listen.  The soups were decent sized, a few of us had 1 each.  The flavors were not very good.  I got the Ocean's nest and it was not soupy like I had expected but wasn't bad.  The seafood was pretty bland and overcooked.  There were 2 other kinds on the table, 1 was extremely salty and the other had no flavor whatsoever.   The dim sum was a complete rip off.  $12 for mini sized everything!  Not one person was satisfied w/their meal (there were 7 of us) and the bill came out to $300!!  Ridiculous.  Our waitress only came back once at the end to ask us if we wanted dessert, but the other servers were nice...I'm hoping they got a cut of the outrageous 21% gratuity.
