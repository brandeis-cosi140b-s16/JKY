Wanted to go for a dinner, not a loud club environment and watch older mom's hit on the male staff and bump and grind with them.  Food was ok.  Just wish I could have heard what my dinner guest were trying to talk to me about.  So we just ate and left so we could enjoy each others company.  The drinks were super strong, to the point where we could not drink them.  The waitress was the best!
