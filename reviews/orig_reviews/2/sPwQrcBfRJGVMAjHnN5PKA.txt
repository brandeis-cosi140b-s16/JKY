Based on the previous reviews and proximity to my place, this seemed like a great place to bring my guest from out of town. The first two items I ordered were not available despite being prominently featured on the overhead menu. I settled on a bbq bacon burger and we decided to split the chili cheese fries. I must have missed it when the memo went around that chili cheese fries are fries with melted cheese whiz and over cooked ground beef sprinkled over them. If you believe this stuff is chili, I have some beach front property in Wyoming you may be interested in. For the prices levied, you'd imagine the food would be a bit more palatable, but I'm pretty sure what I just consumed was a JTM patty on a bun they picked up from the discount past freshness date rack. Apparently the tacos my friend had were somewhere near the threshold of acceptability. I am under the impression this place may have recently changed ownership and/or management (the receipt still shows the old name "Flame Burger Factory") and unless it undergoes another change, the likelihood of my return rests in the neighborhood of airborne swine!
