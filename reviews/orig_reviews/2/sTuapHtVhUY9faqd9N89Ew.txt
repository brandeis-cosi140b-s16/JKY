This place is divey.. clean.. but divey.  It's like the Roberto's of Korean Mexican fusion except I probably would have preferred Roberto's. Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, I'm used to Korean food being somewhat healthy and I know depending on the Mexican food you could be looking at the perfect post-drunk grease or something you won't feel ashamed of after you've consumed it.  This food made me feel like I was clogging my arteries midway through the meal. The flautas with spicy Korean pork were somehow bland.  I don't even know how this is possible when spicy pork (mewoon daeji bulgogi) is anything but bland and it's the filling.  I got corn tacos with kalbi and spicy pork, they were okay.  My friend was destroying the kimchi fried rice, I'm not the hugest fried rice fan so I don't feel it's fair for me to try and review it.
