My family ate here on Sunday afternoon.  We sat outside at one of the two shaded tables.  It was super hot outside, but I tried to not let it bother me. I thought it was a bit too expensive for the quantity of food and the location.  As for the food itself:

Chicken taco with verde salsa: dry chicken, lacked flavor, but it was all white meat which I appreciate

Shrimp en fuego: battered deep fried shrimp, really good

Chips and guacamole: there were at least two chunks where 20 chips had all stuck together in a giant stack, and the guac had zero flavor

Empanada: really good.  Sometimes empanadas get tough but this one was flaky and delish

It is a convenient location, but I won't go back unless someone else initiates.
