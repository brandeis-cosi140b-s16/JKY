Had the pork bbq and it was TOO sweet for me.  The only thing I liked were the flour tortillas which were freshly made, floury and warm and delicious!  Rice and beans were standard, and unfortunately I didn't get any salsa with my meal so I don't know what that's like.

I called my team's order because I was afraid of the lunch line and the order was all taken correctly for about 6 of us.
