All I was craving for 2 days was tacos. I just wanted tacos. I should have went out of my way to find a legit taco truck, but I didn't. Instead, I got lured into the convenience of how there is a Mexican restaurant right downstairs of my hotel. The name made me even more excited thinking that they specialize in tacos. 

I would say this place is one of those more "Americanize" Mexican restaurant. The complimentary chips & salsa already gave that impression because salsa did not have a kick in flavor at all to begin with meaning they cater it to more Americanize people knowing that they can't handle spiciness at all. I was looking at the menu, it was 17-20 dollars for a plate of 3 tacos with rice & refried beans depending on what tacos you would be getting. I thought, hey it's Vegas after all, rent is probably not cheap here so they had to charge like that. Price is not what bothered me, I ordered the combo tacos where 1 is chicken, 1 is carne asada, 1 is pulled pork. The chicken was dry, still ate it. The carne asada was probably the best, wasn't hot when it came out, but tolerable. Pulled pork was horrible, I couldn't finished it and scrap all the meat off  and finished it with rice & beans stuffing instead. 

I like to leave at least something positive, they had a Mariachi Band that came around. It was pretty hilarious because they knew more than the traditional songs, they sang modern songs like Beyonce's Single Ladies and Jason DeRulo's Wiggle song. HAHAHA. 

Let me save my money and get 2 1/2 meals from The Original Chicken Tender place in the food court instead. Yum.
