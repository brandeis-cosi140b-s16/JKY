Just left this place. I understand they're busy, but that's what every business tries to achieve right? Because they were busy they gave below subpar service. It was a man and woman working and the woman looked miserable and wasn't exactly polite. The guy was trying his best but service suffered. We were told there was a thirty minutes wait originally, but noticed two spots at the bar open. So we asked if we can sit there and she said let me ask. After walking around for ten minutes, not talking with anyone and seeing that we didn't leave she wiped the bar down and we sat. We got our chips and we grabbed our own salsa. After ten minutes we got water. And that's it. No one offered to take our drink order or food order. A single man sat next to us after us, and a four top behind us. The four top was the last to be seated. Got their order taken first. Then the single man. Never us. They looked at us and it's a tiny restaurant so they saw us. The woman seemed like she didn't want us to eat there because they had a bad rush. Well don't worry we won't come back again. And all the placards for their awards were for another taco shop.
