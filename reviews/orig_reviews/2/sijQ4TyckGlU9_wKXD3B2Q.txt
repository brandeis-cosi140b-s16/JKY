I had high expectations on this place and unfortunately they were not meet up. Super dry tamal, one of the worst I've ever had and in top of that a very expensive one. The chips were very fresh which is nice but the salsas were really bland. My enchiladas were ok but not better than what you can get at any of the bertos restaurants. The only good thing was the margaritas and the service was great but definitely won't be back
