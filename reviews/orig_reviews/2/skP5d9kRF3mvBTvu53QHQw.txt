I could not have been less impressed with Border Grill. I had been looking forward to it for months while planning my honeymoon in Vegas. Staying at THEHotel, I thought it perfect timing to give BG a try, especially after falling in love with Mary Sue from watching Top Chef.

The food here was by far the worst I've had in Vegas, and also the worst Mexican food I've ever had,, and Mexican is my favorite. 

The complimentary salsas were completely bland, the chips stale. The guac was the only half decent thing we had, but at $9, it better be! 

My husband and I both ordered tacos - me the carnitas, him the carne adasa. My carnitas were just ok - nothing special. He said his carne asada was the same.

The most shocking part for me was the rice. It was absolutely inedible. Both the red and green were completely dry tasteless. Completely awful. 

I expect to pay a lot of money for food in Vegas, but I've had better food from a dirty taco truck than this restaurant. I would never return and would never recommend this place to anyone.
