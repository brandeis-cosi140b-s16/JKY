Tonight I ordered from sombreros to go. The Tempe location my check number was 182 I ordered a beef chimi with green sauce a beef taco beef enchilada  no garnish and rice along with a large drink. When my order came to go I checked it thank God because they gave me fries instead of rice. They gave me the rice when I hit someone's attention .When I got home my taco nor my enchilada had any cheese on it . I just had sauce on the enchilada and maybe two pieces of shredded cheese of . all I saw was the corn tortilla and sauce on my enchilada. My taco with meat and lettuce. My enchilada was tasteless with just a tortilla and the meat and sauce. The tasted bland. I never had an enchilada I didn't like. And I didn't like this. For sure!I really like someburros however this doesn't give me faith TO order takeout again. I've been a loyal customer of the Tempe location since it opened in 1986. Quality control needs to be taken care of. And the back and be forgiving to the front and give it to the customer. Improve your process to make sure that everything is taken care of it I'll food has what it needs on it and in it.
