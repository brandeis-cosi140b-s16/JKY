Made a reservation for 5ppl with a view, when we get there we are squeezed into a booth for 4 with a chair at the end with no view. I get that its a Saturday night but that's not my problem, that is why I made a reservation. 

 The food is usually good, but this is the first time it was "meh". The guacamole which is one of my favorites, was just okay. I had the carnitas burrito and while the carnitas was cooked perfectly tender, it just had no flavor at all, the same with my mom's chicken fajitas, no flavor.  Sad that a Mexican restaurant has no flavor.

The service was decent but it was so hot that everyone at the table was sweating., I don' think I would go back.
