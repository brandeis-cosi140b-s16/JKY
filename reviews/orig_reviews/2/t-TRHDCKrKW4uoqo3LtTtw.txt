Can you say disappointed? We purchased the Groupon for this place since we've been meaning to try it out. We arrived and the location is great. Overlooking the strip and plenty of patio space if it's cool out.

We sat inside as it was pretty warm out and we ordered several different things to try. The buffalo chicken wings were quite delicious. I enjoyed them quite a bit, but everything else left quite a bit to be desired. We felt it necessary to order nachos since we figured they would be good in a place called Nacho Daddy's. This was unfortunately not the case. For $10.95 you'd think you'd get quite a few more than just a few chips strewn haphazardly on a platter with a small amount of melted cheese and dried out carne asada. See picture: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw&select=vvSCsR6z5ae2NEu_XkqxWQ. This was the epic fail of the night. Since we still had a bit more to spend on our Groupon, we decided to order a cheese steak to-go. This sandwich lacked completely in flavor. It was dry and the bread was hard. It just didn't cut it for me. 

Overall, I can see this place being nice for trivia, but since the food wasn't fantastic and it's not close to where I live, I don't see myself making a special trip out here without some sort of coupon or discount.
