I have come here once a week for the past 6 months, however I have reached my breaking point and will probably not be coming back. This isn't a one time bad experience but a 6 month string of some of the rudest employees. Phrank is the only employee who doesn't make you feel like you are doing them a disservice by being there. It's sad because the food is great but I'm not going to put up being treated poorly just for being a customer.
