I'm going to start off by declaring my love for tacos. I've had really amazing tacos when I travelled throughout D.F. and other parts of Mexico. Probably 9/10 street vendors were bomb, 5 stars, best tacos I've ever had to date. And I've luckily managed to find tacos almost as good in Los Angeles and in vegas (very recently). 

I've given tacos el gordo on Charleston a chance about a year ago, but didn't post my review as I didn't want to get stoned to death. 
I chose to give this new location a second shot for the tacos el gordo experience. 

Carne asada- 2 stars. I prefer some parts of my carne asada to have a char and prefer to have the meat more marinated or seasoned. This place is not my favorite. 

Al pastor- 2 stars. Pretty much for the same reasons, I did not enjoy it much. 

The plain fries for $2.25 were the highlight of my night, though it's probably frozen stuff.

The salsa bar doesn't have green and red sauce, so make sure to ask for it while getting the tacos. 

For those who are big fan of Tacos el Gordo, you will love this place. I had no lining up to do around 10pm on a Monday night. Wooooooo!!!!! This place will surely be poppin' as it's in a convenient location from a couple casinos (Encore and Wynn) by walking distance. Clean restaurant, with bright lights!! As for myself, I'll be sticking to other places for my taco fix.
