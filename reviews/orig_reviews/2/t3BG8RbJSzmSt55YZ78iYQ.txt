Food is decent but service makes this place a risk.  They often lose orders or screw up the orders.  So, calling ahead to save time often turns into waiting for them to fix or create the order you gave them 20 minutes prior. You'd think a neighborhood restaurant would care enough to get an order right.  Quality also varies greatly for order to order. Try Burrito Company instead.
