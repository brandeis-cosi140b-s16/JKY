I've heard good things about this place from a few people so after attempting to try frank and fina's Mexican Cocina (which was closes when I gt there) I decided to travel across the street to get my Mexican food fix taken care of. 

Decor is nice, authentic and the service was mediocre. Waiter was polite but it was one of those feelings like he was smiling his ass off through his teeth, hiding his horrible day and unhappiness. 

I'm not sure if this is a complaint but.. their menu selection made cheesecake factory's look like in-n-out's. Just.. Wayy too much. Strange that I'm talking about this but I had to tell the waiter about 4 times that I needed "just another minute". I ended up ordering a combination plate of a wet, enchilada style carnitas burrito, corn tamales and chile releteno. My friend ordered a chicken fajita plate. 

When I took a bite of my burrito, I felt as if they had microwaved something bought out of a supermarket. The temperature was way off, there were many parts of the inside that were barely room temperature. The tamale was bland, and the chile reletno was mediocre. My friends chicken fajita didn't even come out sizzling. He also said it was cold and the chicken was very dry. 

Would have gave a 2 star if the service was great and the prices were reasonable, but at almost $20 per person after tax and tip I was left extremely dissatisfied.

Maybe the other original location can do it right.
