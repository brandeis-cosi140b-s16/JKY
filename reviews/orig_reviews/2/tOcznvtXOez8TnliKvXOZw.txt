Another on bites the dust.  Visited Fajitas again and was very disappointed.  They have switched to small shrimp like you would find at El Torito.  They used to use huge shrimp.  I think they changed the seasoning also, just wasn't the same and the portion seems to also be smaller.  Not sure if I will return, I'm heartbroken!
