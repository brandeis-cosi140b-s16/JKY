My friends took me here for my birthday while I was visiting from California. As one other reviewer said, "At least there were no annoying birthday songs every 10 minutes."  When informed it was my birthday, the server just looked at me and said, "Oh, um, happy birthday?" and walked off. She could have at least explained that they don't do anything for birthdays. I wasn't too disappointed, but my friends were expecting them to say or do something. 

The food was okay, but I felt really rushed. We weren't even done eating when the bill was brought to the table. The place wasn't packed, so it wasn't like they needed the table. 

I definitely won't be in a rush to go back. It just didn't feel like a particularly inviting place.
