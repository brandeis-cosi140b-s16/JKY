Gave Cafe Rio a try after a friend recommended it. Tried the steak burrito enchilada style and two tacos: chicken and pork barbacoa, and ordered chips and salsa. 

The steak burrito was quite good. The tacos, however, weren't. The pork was way too sweet for my liking and the chicken was far too bland. The chips were ok, one of the salsa was heavily flavored with lime, to the point it was inedible. The other was decent.
