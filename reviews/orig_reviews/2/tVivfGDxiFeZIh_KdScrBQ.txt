Disappointing! My bf and I stopped in for a drink and light snack in between flights and decided we shouldn't order food based on quick look around... The place smelled like a dirty rag which was almost nauseating. We sat down at the bar for a drink and the dishes were piled up, occupying about 4 feet of bar space. We ended up leaving after our first drink and went over to the Pei Wei bar which had much better service.
