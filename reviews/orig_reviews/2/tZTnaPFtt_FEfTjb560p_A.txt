Cafe Rio used to be one of my favorites, but this location seems to have a plethora of problems. First and foremost they rush you through the line as fast as possible, slapping your food together like it owes them money. The employees do not pay attention to what you ask for, and throw whatever they like onto your requested item of food, which is bad customer service - and really, really annoying. I requested a chicken salad with black beans - no rice - shredded lettuce. What I got was a pile of beef on a tin with iceberg lettuce. When I tried to correct the order, I received huffs and gruff from the female employee and food thrown back into its receptacles. Wow.

The place is packed - every day. There seems to be no reprieve, and they have run out of items completely at least three times that I have been there. Any time I have ordered takeout, the order has been incorrect, items left out, and one time I even received someone else's order which I had to drive all the way back to the Restaraunt! Waste of gas, time, and money.

I probably won't go to this location again. It just seems as though the high school employees behind the counter couldn't care less about anything, including the cleanliness of the dining area. Not to mention the complete lack of customer service.
