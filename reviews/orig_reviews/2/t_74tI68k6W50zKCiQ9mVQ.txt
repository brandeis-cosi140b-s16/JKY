Not impressed. Staff wasn't that friendly, it felt like an inconvenience to ask for anything, and service was exceptionally slow. 

The food wasn't very flavorful and the margaritas tasted like they had some soda water mixed in. It took forever to get our food & my friends was cold. 

The sopapillas are more crunchy than soft and fluffy. Was very disappointed.

Won't be coming back.
