I just so don't get the hype around this place. The only thing I even sort of like is the crazy potato but the last two times I've been I've even been disappointed in that. The only reason I've been a few times is because my husband used to like it alright and it's close to our house but last time was the last time we'll be going. We both we just disappointed one too many times. The two stars is just because they did such a good job designing the place and they have glass bottle sodas that are of course delish. I'm glad they're having success, but it's not our cup of tea.
