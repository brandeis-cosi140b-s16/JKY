We stopped in here for a couple drinks and a quick bite. We ordered a taco salad, which was REALLY boring. It was mostly iceberg lettuce with a sprinkle of cheese, tomatoes and beans; pretty disappointing for the price because this place is NOT cheap! Waitstaff were not around much. Overall, we would not go back again. 

Bottom line: the drinks were alright and although the food was super basic and overly priced, at least it was somewhat fresh so we didn't get sick.
