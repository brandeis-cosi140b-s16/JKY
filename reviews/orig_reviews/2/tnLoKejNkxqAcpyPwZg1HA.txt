We were disappointed in Backyard Taco after seeing so many great reviews of the place. We went to dinner last night and my wife and I both had a 3-taco plate. She had one each of chicken/pollo, pork/birrea, and steak/carne asada. All three of mine were steak/carne asada. 

My wife's favorites were chicken/pollo and pork/birrea. She did not like the steak/carne asada, and neither did I. We both thought the meat was tough and of below average flavor. The salsas were good, but they don't make a meal. 

Staff were friendly, and our food came pretty fast. We sat at a pleasant outdoor table, and generally enjoyed the energy of the place, which was quite busy. 

But we most likely will not go back.
