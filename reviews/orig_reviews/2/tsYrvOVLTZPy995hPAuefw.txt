As far as Chinese food goes, they're making an effort. There's the "kitchen" in front that you can watch through a window from outside as a few chefs who given their appearance are most likely direct Chinese imports, acquired to boost authenticity both visually and gustatorially. There is the real kitchen that you don't see though, and most likely all the food that isn't a steamed bun is created back there by who knows who.

Fitting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, the digs are stylish and interesting and modern. Service is excellent and the menu has great variety, but prices are steep. I was surprised to see that they had rou jia mou on the menu, being somewhat obscure here in the United States to the average person, but I didn't order it. My friend did, and my initial reservation about the price to size assessment were correct. A typical rou jia mou is something like sauced pork in a flatbread sandwich about five inches in diameter (to simplify the explanation). This one was sized accurately and slipped into a protective waxed paper pocket to keep fingers clean. $8.88 is much too steep for such a "snack," even in the somewhat stylish surroundings. The meat in the rou jia mou had the same shortcomings that I've seen in other restaurants in the same dish and in beef rolls. The sauce is correct, but the meat is flavorless-if it is done properly, the sauce flavor permeates the meat instead of just covering it.

I had the dan dan mian, the noodles being very good, but the sauce had no kick, no spice. That seemed to be a re-occuring theme throughout our table's dishes- weak flavor.

I'm tempted to return simply because I hadn't explored the Mexican side of the menu, especially because that is one thing that this country does "right" more often, but my reservations continue to be about price. Perhaps if I'm in the casino again and flush with winnings, I'll return. Otherwise, there's much more culinary turf to explore in the city.
