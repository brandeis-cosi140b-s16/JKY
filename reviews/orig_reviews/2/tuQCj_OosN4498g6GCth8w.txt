We  have been eating at Carlos Obrien's since they where on 16th street next to the bank.  It appears they have taken their eye off the ball.  The food today was flat dry and tasteless.  Not like the old Carlos.  
The kids waiting on tables where also very slovenly, argumentative and really  to busy visiting to wait on customers.
