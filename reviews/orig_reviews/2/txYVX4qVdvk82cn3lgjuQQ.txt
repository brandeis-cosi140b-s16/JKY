I was looking forward to having a new neighborhood spot that served something off the beaten path but I left feeling frustrated. We went for a nightcap and I had a pretty decent glass of Tempranillo. We ordered a bottle of Pellegrino and when we got the bill we were shocked that they charged $10 for a 24oz Pellegrino (medium sized bottle). This is absurd and when we asked the bartender, she agreed that the pricing for bottled water there is off the wall. It may sound trivial but I feel that I was completely ripped off. This pricing is not fair in the least bit and needs to be re-evaluated. 

I have not eaten there yet so I can't speak of the food quality but I honestly might not make it back in because of the ridiculous pricing issue.
