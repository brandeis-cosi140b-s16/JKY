Okay people, you're all on crack!  I would take a double double anytime over this place, it's just an average burger joint...nothing special.  

Here's a tip:
For $1 extra to add cheese on each burger you order, just do yourself a favor and order an extra burger and put on the cheese yourself at home since the burgers are small.

A successful business makes it by word of mouth, value, and customer service...
not by jacking up the prices!
