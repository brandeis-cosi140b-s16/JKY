Overrated and pricey!  I wanted chinese noodles but got soup instead.  The mexican dishes were very bland.  I immediately got a stomach ache from the food.  Paid close to $90 for four small plates for dinner.  My feelings hurt more than my tummy.  Gave this two stars because the service was good at least.
