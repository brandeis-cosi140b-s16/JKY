I had heard how thwse tacos were so amazing and convinced the hubby to try something new.  Cute, tiny restaurant with a friendly man at the counter.  We ordered 7 tacos, a quesadilla, a side of beans, chips and drinks.  For everything,  our bill was nearly $40.  I thought that seemed pretty high,  but waited to receive our food to see if it was worth it.  The food was edible and had decent flavor.   However,  the portion size was super tiny.  The tacos did not have much meat in them and the quesadilla was made with about an 8" flour tortilla.  Tiny.  Chips were thin and crisp with tasty salsa, but the hot salsa needs more heat.  Also, they are NOT FREE!!  The tortillas are store bought, which by the prices, I was hoping for homemade.  Overall, I was dissapointed with the lack of value you receive.  Even though the food was decent, I would not return.
