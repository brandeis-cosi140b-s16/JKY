I was very impressed with the tacos. The best I have had in Las Vegas. However VERY Pricey. The first time I tried this place I went to the drive through. Prices showed on the banner for a taco was $2.50 so I thought ok not bad I have heard good things about the food here, so I ordered 2 Carne Asada tacos . The cashier asks, "would you like everything on it" I reply "Yes". So she tells me "that will be $9.90" I think to myself there has to be a mistake, maybe she heard me wrong, $10 bucks for 2 tacos that's crazy!. So I pull up, I pay, she gives me my receipt. I was charged an extra $1.50 per taco for the everything on each one, the sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. I paid it, but I totally think that is a total rip off. Especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner. Not being very honest if you ask me. 4 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising.
