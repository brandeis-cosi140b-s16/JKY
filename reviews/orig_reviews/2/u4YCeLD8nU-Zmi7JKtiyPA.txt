This place is very meh. The food is old people food: bland, saltless, flavorless. The service was not bad, but mediocre at best. 

The tables weren't very clean and the bench seats were very uncomfortable. Even my kids thought the seats were uncomfortable and they can sit on almost anything. 

The salsas and bean dip were pretty good, but that's the only good I can say about this place. For its location, I'm surprised such a mediocre place can compete against the better places around here.
