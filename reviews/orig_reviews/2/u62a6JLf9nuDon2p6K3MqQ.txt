As many have mentioned in other reviews - don't go here for the food!!!

It is truly that bad...  It probably gets 1 star for food quality.  Forget about the prices.  For 10 dollars, you get two small tacos, and 8 dollars get your two small flautas.  Basically serving sizes are smaller than Taco Bell dollar menu - in all honesty I rather have taco bells tacos.  This place makes Chipotle seems likea  Michelin star "Mexcian" establishment.  Overall, there is much to be desired....  

However, the staff is really nice, very receptive and attentive.  The ambient is pretty decent, which makes drinking enjoyable.  It gets about 3-4 stars in this aspect. 

I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and the drinks, but definitely not the foods.  Eat somewhere else then go to this place... or just bring food from somewhere else to eat there.
