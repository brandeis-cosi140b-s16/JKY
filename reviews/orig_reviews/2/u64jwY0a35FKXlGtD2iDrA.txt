Stayed at the NY NY Hotel/Casino - 111 F outside.
We were NOT going out for dinner! Ended up in the
"Village" downstairs - saw a gaggle of mediocre 
restaurants, wandered into Gonzalez Y Gonzalez.

Boo. 

FOOD: Ordered 2 steak nachos, a plate of boneless/
skinless chicken and a bean and cheese burrito. 

Steak Nachos were TEENY TINY!!! We had literally 10
chips each with beans, cheese, 2 small strips of steak
and a jalepeno pepper baked on top. They were placed
around in a circle - fancy like. To their credit, the meat was
very tasty but damn... come on... give me more than 10 
chips for $12. I was expecting a plate of nachos. Plural.

Bean & Cheese burrito was also small. Taco Bell makes
bigger burritos. No bullshit. $5 for that.

The chips and salsa are endless. Verde salsa was decent.
Wait, our chip basket had a handful of unbroken chips and
then the rest of the basket was FULL of chip pieces. WTF?

Whatever. The waiter came by and asked, "Everthing ok? 
Can I get you anything else?"

We lol'd.

SERVICE: Slow. TVs all showed the same lame golf channel.

PRICES: Fair. For Vegas. I guess. $48 for 4 of us.
**soft drinks are not bottomless.**
**cocktails are weak**

2 Stars for the 20 nacho chips we had to share between us
