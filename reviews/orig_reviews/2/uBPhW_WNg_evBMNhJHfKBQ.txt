So expensive for such small portions...they must be high! That was the least filling $120 lunch I've ever had. There were 4 of us and it came out to $30 each.

Chips and salsa: I appreciate the warm chips. The salsa had and ok flavor, but lacked some freshness. Maybe it needs cilantro or onion.

Tacos: We ordered 3 different of their tacos(pancita, cochinita, and barbacoa). Nothing special in the way of flavor. Every taco had a chunk of fat in it. And at $9 for 2 tiny tacos that adds up. 

Lamb potstickers: meh, not really anything better than you would get in the frozen bag. They were light on flavor. We asked for some sort of sauce and the waiter obliged, but reminded us that that sauce doesn't normally come with the order. The sauce added sssooo much. If it weren't for the sauce I would have had a hard time eating it.

Gazpacho something: a fruit salad. This was very good, but again a very small portion.

Tuna ceviche: I didn't eat this because I don't like tuna, but from what a heard one of the better dishes of our lunch.

Shrimp mojo: recommended by the host, it was pretty good, but really oily. 

Overall: I wouldn't go back.
