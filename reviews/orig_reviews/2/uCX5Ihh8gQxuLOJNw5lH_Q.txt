Best thing here was the salsa. Bland run of the mill mexican food. You can get the same thing at filebertos for a lot less. Ordered the beef fajitas. No seasoning, very bland FLAT grilled meat. My fault for assuming "grilled" meant flame not flat. Condiments include an abundance of sizzling onions with some bell pepper mixed in and a few slices of avocado (no guac), beans and rice and 3 tortillas. The hotter salsa was actually pretty good. Good flavor, nice heat.  Maybe there is better selections to try off their menu but the fajitas were terrible.Service was sparse and slow. Just a dissappointing experience all around.
