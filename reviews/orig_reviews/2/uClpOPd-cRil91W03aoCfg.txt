Why all the hype? I am still pondering why people rave about this place after having lunch there last week.. The location is not in the best part of town, the dining area is pretty dirty (see attached pictures) and the service sucked.

We ordered a beef chimichanga, which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tiny (like 4 bites and you're done tiny).
A bean and cheese burrito (good, but nothing spectacular) and a chorizo tostada, I will say the chorizo was excellent and I am glad because I had to fight for it. 

The place was packed when we arrived so it took us about 40 minutes to order and get our food. They call out numbers for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number calling and the speaker was really loud, it was pretty annoying. 


To pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it. They gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when I took it back the guy asked me for my number to prove I ordered it.. This was the same guy I gave the ticket to when I picked it up originally. I told him this and he sighed heavily and started picking though all the receipts in the stack... A few minutes later he locates it, rolls his eyes and hands me a new tostada..

The food was average and the service sub par. I won't be returning... And there are Panderias on every corner so being able to buy home made tortillas really didn't impress me that much..
