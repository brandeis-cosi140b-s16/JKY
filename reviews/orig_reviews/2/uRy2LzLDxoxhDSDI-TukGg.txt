Two stars because if you're going to do New Mexican cuisine it better be good. We are in the Southwest and we expect better than this.

I had the burger because I LOVE green chile cheeseburgers. 

The Good: meat was flavorful and a good size. Cheese was melts. Bread was better than a regular bun you get when you give up and order a burger at a restaurant. Spicy. 

The Bad: fries were really sad looking, flavorless and undercooked. Guacamole was meh. Salsa tastes like stores bought salsa with a few chopped up chiles thrown in. Beans definitely came from a can.

I would have enjoyed my meal much better if I only ate the burger. It was pretty good. 4.2 out of 5. Everything else was so underwhelming that it dragged my entire experience way down.
