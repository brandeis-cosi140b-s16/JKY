I initially found out about this place through a coupon service. The 1st three times I got the fries smothered in red chiles and a breakfast item. I dined in once and remembered that the service was pleasant.
But tonight was eye opener. I called to place a pick up order and the lady I spoke to had a very bad attitude plus she took down the wrong order. I ordered a combo burrito and she took it upon herself to charge me for a Carlito's burrito which is a dollar more. She urged me to make up my mind about beans and rice because she had a line of people. I'm sorry but when I asked if I can place an order over the phone, and she saying yes, was guarantee that I was a paying customer, just like everyone else. If you don't have the integrity to treat all customers as customers, then don't take phone orders.
I arrive 15 minutes later to pick up the food and when I arrived she was behind the cash register. She looked at me and then walked into the dining area to bus a couple of tables. So, as a customer who is present, now the empty tables are more important than the customer. I see the problem now. She is discriminant towards particular customers in an inconsistent manner. She had a tip jar that was filled, but to be honest with you, if she treated everyone like she treated me, that jar would have nickels and pennies. The whole transaction had no greeting, no thank you or appreciation for business and couldn't even muster up a smile. I had like 13 cents change, and that tip jar was not deserving of a penny. 
The 2 stars was because my friend liked the burrito, and the fries I ordered had flavor. 
I don't know how Zagat grades these businesses, but if they send secret shoppers they will see what I'm talking about.
