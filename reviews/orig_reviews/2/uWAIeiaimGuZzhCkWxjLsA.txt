I am constantly looking for good street taco options everywhere I go.  I decided to try this place out since I was in the area.  Just average.  Meat portions on the street tacos were very good, but the carne asada steak seemed to be lacking flavor.  The pollo asado had some flavor and wasn't bad, but then again, it wasn't great.  The salsas are as thin as water.  Service  was great though!  

I usually like these "hole-in-the-wall", iPad-register, mellow-rock/reggae type restaurants, but I won't be coming back to this one.
