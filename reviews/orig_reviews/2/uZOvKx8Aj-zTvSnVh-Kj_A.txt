Love the decor and the Johnny-on-the-spot waitstaff.  The concept is interesting and the menu is mouth watering.  Celebrity chef.  What more can you ask for?  Unfortunately, most of the dishes were not impressive and in fact, pretty disappointing.

I have to give props to the salt air margarita.  At $12 it's small, but it tastes great and the salt foam on top is a really nice touch.

The 20 vegetable fried rice is famous here because some dude on TV said it was the "best I ever ate."  At $18 for a small plate of fried rice, all I can say is it was "the biggest ripoff I ever ate."  C'mon, you can't be serious!  Fried rice?

As for the other "Chinese" food, very disappointing.  The BBQ pork buns were not good.  The pork was too saucy and the buns stuck to the wax paper so they completely fell apart when you pulled the paper off.  The hand-cut noodles in soup were nicely al-dente but the broth was tasteless.  Shu mai were run-of-the-mill.  Can you spell B.O.R.I.N.G.?  Lettuce cups with chicken were ... alas, not very good.  Where's the flavor?  Where's the kick?

The "Mexican" dishes fared better, I think.  The duct tongue taco was great.  The weird taco of beef tendon and raw kumamoto oyster was ... weird, in a good way.  The most amazing thing about that taco was how freakin' small the oyster was.  Wow.  I almost had to ask the waiter for a magnifying glass to confirm that an oyster was indeed present.  Horton?  Did you hear that?  I do have to say that the tortillas were really, really tasty.

Two stars is generous.
