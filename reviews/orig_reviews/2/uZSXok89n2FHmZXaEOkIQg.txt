This is a cool place to hang out with friends and have a drink if you're willing to wait.  I've been there when the place was dead and when packed; either way, I have had to wait a lenghty period of time to have a waitress come take a drink order, and then wait a long time to get the drink, and then wait longer just to have my order taken.   

The atmosphere is fun, and on some nights they have live music, but plan on waiting for service or just get the beer yourself from the bar.
