Not as good as we were expecting.  We are from New Mexico and are familiar with the food. Giving some latitude here, but overall as one other reviewer said it's not bad - but not good either.  Drinks are way overpriced and the mixed drink one of us had was actually undrinkable - not sure how that happens. Service is pleasant, but a little slow and we could have easily been out of there in half the time; if you go expect that.  Based on the price and quality we won't be giving this a second shot.  Bit of a disappointment.

Noting comments from the Restaurant - Thank you for responding.  Would agree that yes, the food and prep does vary from region to region; this was just very different.  We should have been more forthcoming if we felt the food was not as expected.  Be happy to stop by and try again.
