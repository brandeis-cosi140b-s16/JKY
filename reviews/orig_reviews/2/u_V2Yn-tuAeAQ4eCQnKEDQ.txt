Just went here for lunch yesterday because hash house a go go had a 2 hour wait, the menu seemed interesting and our group of 4 wanted margs so we went. We arrived there at 12pm. After being told there was a 35min wait, we walked around and waited for the table to be ready. We walked back 30mins later and it was ready so that was nice. Though as we walked in and got seated we noticed that the restaurant was nearly empty. Why the wait we don't know. Our waiter seemed nice and got our drink order, we got our pitcher of margarita which tasted only like marg mix with no tequila. We got our margaritas at 1pm, it then took 40mins for the waiter to come back to take our order. We didn't get our food until 2:15. We shouldn't have waited over an hour and a half just to have our order taken. The food was good, very pricey as you may expect in Vegas. Overall terrible service awareness for a relatively empty restaurant and not a good experience. We should have just waited for hash house a go go. 

TLDR; just go to hash house a go go.
