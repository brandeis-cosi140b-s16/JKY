Fair try, overall service was just ok but this modern mexican cuisine leaves a lot to ask for. There was good and bad throughout. Salsa came out super cold and bland and did not complement the warm chips well at all. 

Their version of guacamole is nothing more than mashed up avocados with lime and salt. We had to ask for extra pico, cilantro, jalape√±os, and added salt and pepper and made our own guac with their ingredients.

We ordered the tacos, well done. I just wish you would give me a small lime wedge so we didn't have to bother the 'runner' yet again. The side of charro beans were a joke. Nothing more than boiled and dried up bland pinto beans, please pass the salt again or pass this place up altogether.
