I dined at Z'Tejas last night (12/19/13) on Bethany Home Road. This was my third visit to this location. My prior visits were excellent, however, last night was not good. I will say the food was excellent but the service was not. My friend and I arrived at about 5:40pm. We were greeted promptly and we ordered our cocktails, appetizer and main courses all at the same time. Our drinks arrived and then our appetizer shortly after. Great we were happy. Literally 2 bites of the appetizer and our main courses arrived. I was shocked. When our waiter came over to see how we were doing I told him that I not thrilled that our main course arrived just about on top of the appetizer ( we ate the appetizer with our main course) the waiter laughed it off and said gee when you want the food in a hurry it doesn't come so go figure. Here is the best part of this ridiculous dinner: we arrived at 5:40pm and we were done eating by 6:15pm. How absurd is that? Think of the revenue the restaurant lost - I was ready to have 2-3 glasses of wine during my leisurely meal yet I had barely drank half of my glass of wine by the time I finished my meal. I should have complained to the manager but I was too irritated to do that. While I really like the food there I will hesitate to go back. That is a shame because my prior experiences were very good but last night their customer service was awful.
