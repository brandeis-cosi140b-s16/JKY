Went there Monday 4/20 at about 8pm with friends, place was dead empty.

Decor-wise it is much more a bar (a Bama bar) than a restaurant.

Order the tres enchilada platter ... completely ordinary and forgettable.  Oddly when I ordered it the waitress asked if I like heat; I told her I did but after eating my dinner I cant imagine why it would matter. On a scale of 1 to 10 the heat was 1 at best.

Probably won't go back any time soon.
