The food was good and the price was decent. The only problem I had was that there were three cooks (a fat taller Hispanic man, a short Hispanic, and a white bald guy) at the end of the bar cussing up a storm and pulling liquor off the shelves and drinking Pacifico's like it was their own private bar. The Asian bar manager didn't seem to mind either since he helped them pick some of the tequila they were shooting up.
