My friend and I ate a decent lunch here. Although, it wasn't the best or even second best taco place I've been too. Taco Tuesdays only refer to one taco on the menu, that being shredded beef. We ordered four shredded beef tacos, two fish tacos.

 Tip: you may order soft corn tortilla tacos instead of the hardshell for the shredded beef. I preferred the fish taco over all the dishes I tried. In the end, I just picked out the meat and veggies and did not eat the rest of the soggy tortilla. 

We also ordered the house margarita. It was very satisfying! As it was a hot day, it did quench the thirst. Other than that, I'd say I would only come back for happy hour or if everything off the menu was half priced
