Saw this place driving by and wanted to try it since I grew up in NM. After we were seated it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. Ordered our food and a margarita which I had to remind the waitress of since another 15 minutes had gone by after that order and still no drink. After that we were starting to get a but frustrated. The margarita finally came and tasted like what I can only imagine a hair salon full of aqua net tastes like. We waited about another 10 minutes and our food came. My plate had the wrong kind of beans and was not very hot but did taste good. My wife's fajitas looked and sounded like they had stopped sizzling a while ago. Isn't that the whole point of fajitas? Coming out crackling and popping so we can be told not to touch the plate because it's hot? They also forgot the tortillas with them. when the waitress decided to make another appearance I mentioned the tortillas but by that time my wife was over it. So all in all not impressed at all.  Most of the time when I've had a bad experience at a restaurant it's not really the wait staffs fault. Usually it's food not cooked right or drink not made well. In this instance it was the pure lack of attentiveness by the waitress.
