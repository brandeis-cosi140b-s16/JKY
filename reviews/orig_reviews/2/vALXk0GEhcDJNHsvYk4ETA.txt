I was invited to a dinner at your Henderson location last night and once again I attempted to order the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow for $20.95. The waiter looked at me and said are you sure !?!? He asked me 2 times, again making a scene out of a very simple request. I pulled out my phone and showed him my previous YELP review showing that I was refused the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow. I told him to just please just place the order. I had to assure him that I would not return the item.

When he picked up my plate he made a rude and racial comment that I was the only "gringo" that he has seen finish the meal. He said that he had 3 "gringos" order it and not finish it before me.

Also we ordered 2 margaritas and 1 beer that were never delivered. We where not charged for them so we did not complain. 

All I want to do is to place an order for an item on your menu without a hassle. What is the problem with your severs ? You lost $30 in liquor because they were too worried about the "gringo"'s order.

You should just take this item off the menu if you are unwilling to serve it.
