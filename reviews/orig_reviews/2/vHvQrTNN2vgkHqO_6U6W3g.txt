Decided to have dinner here since it's so close to home plus a co-worker of my wife "highly recommended " it. 
Service was spotty.  Took 5 mins or so before our drink orders were taken. We had to ask for water with our chips n salsa. 
Blue margarita was good the michelada (sp) was ok.  
Dinner arrived before our ceviche app. Wish we'd ordered the small one because the ceviche was bland and boring. Lacked salt. We left 3/4 of it uneaten. 
Wife and daughter ordered bean n cheese burritos and they were good but it's hard to mess that up. I ordered the fish filet in culichi sauce. Very small filets in a watered down version of culichi sauce. I could even see tiny bubbles in the sauce that verified it had been "reduced". Bland but edible. 
Flour tortillas were supposed to come with my order but they never materialized. At that point I didn't even ask for them.  
If you want a really authentic Mexican seafood meal go to Mariscos Sinaloa in Mesa. Yelp it, it'll come up.
