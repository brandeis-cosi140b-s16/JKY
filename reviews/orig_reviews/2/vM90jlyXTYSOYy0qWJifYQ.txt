Aweful service. Look, I get that it's a cheap fast food style restaurant. But that shouldn't excuse poor service. I don't expect cheers when I walk in the door, or even a "hello" really, but they sometimes flat out ignore you! Once, I went there to pick up a quick dinner for my girlfriend and I. I stood there while the girl working mopped the floor and ignored me. Of course I understood she had a job to do, but when I was younger and had jobs like that, I was always required to at least acknowledge a customer and then usually stop what I was doing to assist that customer. You know? Anyway, aside from their aweful service they constantly got our order wrong or left things out all together. The ONLY reason I kept going there was my girlfriend insisted she didn't know any other place to get decent Mexican food aside from a sit down restaurant. I will say I did like the "Chili Rojo Burro" and shredded beef tacos though....
