OK.  Some of you wonder "So Warren, are there better fish taco's available?"  Yes, most certainly.  Here's a photo of 2 tacos, each going for $1.75.  When I compare this to So-Cal, well, there is no comparison.  Yes, there are better fish tacos out there, and they certainly aren't in downtown Gilbert.
