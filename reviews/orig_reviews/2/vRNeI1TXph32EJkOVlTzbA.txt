Our family has been excited to try Panchos. We were not disappointed with the ambiance. It is obvious they have invested a lot of money, which they are trying to recover with their ridiculous menu prices. I had the Camerones diablo, which was 25.00 for four shrimp floating in a bed of oil. I did not enjoy it at all. The views from the others dining with me were mixed on their food, but all agreed, too pricy. The service was excellent-very attentive, but does not make up for extremely expensive mediocre food.
