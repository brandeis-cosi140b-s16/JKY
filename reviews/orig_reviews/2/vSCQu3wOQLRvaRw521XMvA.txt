Cantina Laredo has been open in our neighborhood for some time now.  My husband and I finally had some free time to dine there.  Reception was fine, waitress came and offer drinks - that was fine.  Everything seems normal.  Nothing superb.  
We each ordered a Margarita, then our entrees.  The waitress came by a few times to see if every thing is alright while we were eating our dinner. Then, the waitress just came and slapped down our check without us asking for it, and also without her first asking whether we wanted dessert.   
Meanwhile, a special Tequila dinner announcement was enclosed with our check (which we did not asked for).  The food looked interesting and I asked this waitress whether we can have the dinner without Tequila.  Guess what she said? - ?."You don't have to come!"
We were completely stunned at this point having been very nice and cordial to her through the whole time we were there.
We will give the food 3 stars, but the attitude 0 star because she was too mean for us to imagine the management philosophy behind her actions.
