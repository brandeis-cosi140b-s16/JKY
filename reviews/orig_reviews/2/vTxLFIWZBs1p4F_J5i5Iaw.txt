I went here with my coworker Jared......I don't think we will ever be back....

I have a hard time revisiting a place that has visible bugs?  I am sure all places have problems, but when you have to kill something to finish your meal its not on my list to revisit.  Food did not standout to me so I cannot recommend it, still have tingles down my spine thinking out creapy crawlers.

I think I will stay away and get my mexican grill somewhere else....
