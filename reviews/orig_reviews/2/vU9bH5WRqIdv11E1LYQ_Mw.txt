Got seated and right on the table was part of the ceiling. Apparently no one noticed. I'm not sure but I don't think the menu can be printed any smaller. Even with glasses I had a hard time reading it. The place was not very busy, service kinda slow. Ordered the 3 chicken tacos. I swear the menu said the chicken tacos came on corn tortillas (again the menu super tiny so.....) they came on flour. Dripping grease with a little lettuce and radish, no cheese. Kinda disappointing. The server was pleasant but seemed a little flustered. Over all not impressed at all
