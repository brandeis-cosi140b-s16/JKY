I'm always excited for locally-owned restaurants and was really enthusiastic until the food came.  I'm really only giving them 2 stars, because the service was fine, the patio was nice, and the salsa was good.  However, the food was both bland and barely warm.  I read on their website that the owners are part of the Someburros family, so I thought it would be good.  I was willing to pay twice the price for good Mexican in a higher end atmosphere.  My husband joked that the person who recommended Isabels owed us $40 and an apology. Lol!
