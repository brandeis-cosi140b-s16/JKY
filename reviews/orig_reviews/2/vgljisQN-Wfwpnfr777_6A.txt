I do not understand the rating this place gets. Although you get your food quickly, everything was cold within minutes. The asada is decent, but nothing great. Being from SoCal, this place has nothing on King Taco. The tortillas are fresh, so that is the reason for the 2 stars. I will not pay this place another visit. Maybe I got a bad batch of tacos. The guy that took my order also forgot two of the tacos, but after taking one bite, I was actually glad he did.
