We came to this place based on a recommendation from a family member who has been to the original location. We went there for happy hour but when we asked the server what the happy hour specials were, they didn't exactly know. It ended up being $3 for a 24oz. domestic draft, which is pretty good. There were no happy hour specials on food, but we ordered the Mary Lou from the appetizer menu. It was a quesadilla with red chile con carne. It was pretty good and definitely very filling but nothing spectacular. Overall, I would say that this place is just kind of forgetable.
