I really like the food here. Only thing is they are kinda expensive. The waitress was nice and attentive. I also like that they make fresh tortillas to order for the fajitas. But here's where it sucked. I paid and  I wanted to box my food and take my leftovers home. I asked for another side of pico de gallo and she said I would have to pay for it. Are you serious! It's a tiny cup like for dipping sauce. I agreed to pay the 1 dollar. At least she brought it to me and said she wouldn't charge me but next time she would. Probably realized how stupid it is to open another check to charge for it.
