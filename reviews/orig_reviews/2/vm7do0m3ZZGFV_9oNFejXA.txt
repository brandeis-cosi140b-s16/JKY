i was excited about trying Carolina's as the reviews were great but I have to say I was really disappointed.  First, it is not a restaurant per se but a fast food place where one orders from the counter.  Oh well, that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation (tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc.).  I ordered the beef enchiladas but to begin with I was really put off by all the styrofoam, everything was on styrofoam, the drinks, and the meal even if you were eating inside and then plastic forks.  No chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam!!  Then I had to take it back as they gave me chicken enchiladas even though it was marked correctly.  With that, I was looking forward to the meal but it was just 'blah', it was OK, nothing was wrong with it just not very flavorful (maybe it was the styrofoam! JK).  On the pro side, they were busy but got the order out quickly and they were nice enough.  However, if you are looking for a 'restaurant', this is not it, and you can pick up something on your lunch hour quickly and take it wherever but certainly not a dining experience so go with that in mind but there are too many good flavorful Mexican restaurants to go to than to hit Carolina's except for quickness and grab and go.
