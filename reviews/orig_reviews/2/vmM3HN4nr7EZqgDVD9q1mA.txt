I came here for lunch last weekend and I wont be back. There's nothing special about these tacos. I've had better asada, lengua, & cabeza tacos. The adobada tacos are pretty good. 
The concept of ordeing your food is pretty cool but it sucks because your food gets cold by the time you sit down to eat. You have to stand in one of three lines to order the tacos. The adobada ones are closest to the door so we decided to get some because there was no wait period & thats what we did wrong! By the time we sat down to eat them they were very cold because there was a long line to get the asada ones. It was about $20ish for 6 tacos, 1 mula, & a drink! :/ . . . Go next door instead!
