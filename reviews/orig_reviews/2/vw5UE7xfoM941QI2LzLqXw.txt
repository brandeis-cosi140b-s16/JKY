It took 45 minutes for our food to come out.  With an 16 month old in tow- that was just unacceptable.  All of the tables around us got their food before us, whether they ordered before us or not.  By the time our food came, our kid had had it and we were forced to eat in shifts.  Also, if you love your health... you won't love their food.  Don't get me wrong- it's tasty... but you'll hate yourself after eating it.  Lot and lots of calories.  So bad for you.  If anything- order one thing to split two or three ways.

We won't be back.
