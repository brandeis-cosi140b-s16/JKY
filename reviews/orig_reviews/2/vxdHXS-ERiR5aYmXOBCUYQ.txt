I saw so many people in this place...

Thought it must be somewhat good right?

went upstairs, their customer service sucked

bartenders doing their own thing taking their sweet time..

too many flies..means not very clean...

typical loud music...

I just ordered the nachos...pretty big, tasted alright but nothing memorable..

took way too long to get my credit card....is slow service something people enjoy at this place?

I should of just went to Mcdonalds or something...

well then again, It is like right next to the monte carlo which is a crappy place to stay at anyways..I should of figured... =_=
