The best thing about this place?  The DJ.  Seriously, she's super, plays great old school hip hop, and gives the place a party atmosphere.  The emcee is also fun, and gives out free shots from time to time.

The service is pretty bad, though, and both the tacos and margaritas are mediocre.  The nachos, however, were pretty tasty.  It's fine if you happen to be at Luxor and need someplace to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
