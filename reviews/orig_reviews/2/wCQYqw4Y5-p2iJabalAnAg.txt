I've noticed some of the more current reviews are low like mine, perhaps something has changed since the DDD review.

I'm a native Arizonan and was back in town for a short trip.  Having been to many taco shops I was excited to try this one after the DDD episode.  My family all came along (yup we were able to seat 10 people there), and we all agreed that Carolina's right up the street is far better.

We had their tacos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, el pastor, carne asada, and beef chimichanga.  Nothing was awful, but it certainly is not the best Arizona taco shop food.  

If you really want to try some great taco shop food, I would recommend Los Compadres on 7th Avenue between Camelback and Indian School, or Carolina's further up Union Hills.
