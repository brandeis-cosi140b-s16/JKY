This is overpriced Mexican food and it's not even good. My husband and I went on a Sunday evening around 6:00. We were sat immediately. Our waitress wasn't horrible but she wasn't great either. She definitely had other places she wanted to be. We ordered guacamole which was mediocre at best. It's served on a huge bed of shredded lettuce so that it appears that there's more in the bowl than actually is. It makes it very difficult to eat. 

I ordered enchiladas and my husband ordered something that looked like taquitos. We could have gotten the exact same items and quality (not good) from any cheap Mexican restaurant in a shopping center for half the price. 

Needless to say we were unimpressed and won't be back!
