The taco was the size of my palm... For being $2.39 I expected much more in quantity and in all honesty, flavor. 

The Carne asada burrito at $6 was also incredibly small in portion and although it had decent flavor the "spicy" version I ordered could maybe be considered spicy if it was your first introduction to spice but anyone wanting a bit of zing won't find it here. 

The chips and salsa was ok. The chips were decent but very thin so they broke fairly easily. The salsa was their mild version and in my opinion tasted like they just pur√©ed tomatoes and that's about all. 

It was my first experience here and after reading how it was the highest rated in the valley I guess my expectations were too high. They gave me several small containers of various salsas. One was orange - no flavor. One was green - sweet and had a decent flavor if this is your type of salsa preference. The 'guacamole' they gave looked like it had been dispensed out of a toothpaste tube and tasted average at very best. 

The bottom line is the food was decent, not great. The prices were high in relation to quantity and flavor. If youre going to eat here go on the weekdays when the tacos are $1 not $2.39. 

If you are like me and tend to visit places around the valley that have been raved about and set a decently high expectation u will be let down. If u eat here out of convenience because of proximity to campus it's decent.
