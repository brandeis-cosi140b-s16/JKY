We came up here from Rock Hill and we were hungry and love Mexican food, so we thought we'd give this place a try. It did have a "chain feel" even though there are only 2 locations. We had the fajitas.
I was not really that impressed at all. The fajitas were just okay, we've definitely had better at chain restaurants in California like El Toritos. Someone here on Yelp said the chips and salsa were good - and I would strongly DISagree! They were passable and the salsa was NOT. The salsa was pretty much for local gringos, not at all for California gringo transplants - we LOVE good Mexican food, and I don't think I will return here. If you want good authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you want "americanized" Mexican food, then this is a good spot for you.
Our service was great, top notch, so nothing lacking here for us other than our tastebuds.
