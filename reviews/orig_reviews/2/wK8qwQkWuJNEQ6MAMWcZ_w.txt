This is a horrible restaurant!  I believed the yelp reviews and wanted to try this place...  "Tiki bar"?  The drinks here are over priced and GROSS.  I ordered a bean burrito -  no cheese, wanted some salsa on it.. they put pork all over it!  Seriously?  If i order a burrito with beans only I definitely do not want meat on it!  Also, ordered some chips and salsa... salsa SUCKED, the hot salsa was ok, but the regular one was just tomato sauce, yuck.  No wonder the place was vacant! Never going back here!
