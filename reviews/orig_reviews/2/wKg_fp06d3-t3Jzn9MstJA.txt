Overall the quality/taste of food is good. My cripe is the staff..you could 3  customers in line ,but you will have 8 EE's just standing around doing nothing. Including the manager (s). But my biggest gripe and this not just restaurant
It the entire staff speaking Spanish in front of me. I personally feel insulted.. That itw
