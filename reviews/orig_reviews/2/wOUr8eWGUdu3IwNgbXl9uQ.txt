"brick of a burrito" - that says it all. 

When I first had Chipotle it was in Dallas, TX before The Pixies show. As you can imagine, the food was great, and I was thrilled at the concept of build-your-own-burrito. With that said, I don't like Chipotle. Or, perhaps, saying I'm not fond of it is more accurate. Who am I kidding, I can take it or leave it. 

This location is a royal pain. Don't go - whatever you do - during lunch time during the week. That's just asking for trouble. Sure, you can call your order in ahead of time, but you still have to wait in line to pay for it and get it bagged to go. Not worth it. 

Last time I ate 1/2 my brick burrito, it made my tummy hurt after wards for the rest of the day. Needless to say, I haven't been back.
