I think my expectations were too high when I tried out this place the past weekend with my fellow food critic, Marisa. We found it on yelp and we were encouraged by the good reviews, but it's possible that these were all written by past Chandler high grads with nostalgia in their heads. We arrived on a Saturday at two pm to avoid the school crowd and were greeted with a line and a full house. This gave us time to peruse the menu and decide on a combo plate. We both got the burrito and I got the strips and an extra taco. The strips are regular tortilla chips with cold grated cheddar cheese. Not what I expected from the reviews and not satisfying. The taco was in a hard shell that was freshly made and defintely benefited from the packet of red sauce thrown in the bag. The burrito with verde sauce was very spicy, very runny, which made it hard to eat and enjoy. The beef inside was good but I still had a hard time eating it. The girl behind the counter was very nice despite the constant interruptions for refills and more customers. She happened to be elmers daughter, so it was nice to know that we were supporting local business. Fortunately I'm not in Chandler much and have access to other local Mexican food restaraunts in phoenix.
