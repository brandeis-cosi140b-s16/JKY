It's dark in there!

Honestly, I walked in last Saturday and it was like trying to see where you are going right after you turn out the bathroom light at 2:00 am:)

The last time I was at one of the Burning Embers/Richarsdson's Family of Restaurant offerings (Richardson's, Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway, as I understand it), I told myself I wouldn't be returning...I had listened to the boss (the owner?) screaming at an employee, over some error, for a solid 3-4 minutes as the Beautiful Carin and I tried to eat a nice dinner at Richardson's:(

It was like watching Hell's Kitchen, up close and personal.

And not what I expect in a dinner house, quasi fine dining establishment.

However, I got roped into a post squash tournament group brunch/retox with my buddies from the Village.

They all wanted to go to Dick's, so I was outvoted...I could have gone home, but that would have been impolite and no fun:)

As I stumbled over the threshold trying to adjust my eyes from the arc welder intensity of the Phoenix noon hour, to the eerie dark wood, leather and no light world that is the Hideway, I told myself "well, I didn't darken their door again...the door was already darkened":)

Would I have gone back on my own...even to score a coveted review for Yelp? 

I'm going to have to say "No"...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking, I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(

But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be "Donnie Downer" so let's start with some positives from the brunch the other day:

* There was no screaming, whatsoever:)

* The service was outstanding...no really, our server was excellent  and friendly, as well as knowledgeable and competent:)

* They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)

* They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)

* The menu is reasonably creative:)

On the other hand (oh, you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn't be that everything was great)

* The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the "signature" dish, as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry, the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good, though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done, I could see this dish being a solid choice:)

* $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don't like to complain about prices, generally, but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti's at oh, say AZ88, yet they cost more. That doesn't make me happy:(

I just haven't had the best of luck with places named "Dick's" anything...Dickey's BBQ is just a pit and Dickie's Dog's apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.

The Richardson's Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front, so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.

But I probably won't be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell's Kitchen and want to catch up:)
