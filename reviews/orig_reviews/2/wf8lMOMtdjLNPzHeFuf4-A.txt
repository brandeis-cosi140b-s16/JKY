Located in Terminal four on the corridor for gates A1-A15, thei Fox concept restaurant is surprisingly like the restaurants on the outside, down to the prices being charged for food and drinks. Service was friendly, including offering recommendations for local beer. 

The food left something to be desired. I ordered the pork tacos, with rice and black beans (no choice in beans at this location.) Rice was mushy and not much better than out of a box.

Flour tacos were small, but were hot and good. The pork had little evidence of green chili flavor, and the pico and lettuce did not add much. The meat was moist but just unexciting. I would return, but definitely choose a different menu item. I was not offered chips and salsa.
