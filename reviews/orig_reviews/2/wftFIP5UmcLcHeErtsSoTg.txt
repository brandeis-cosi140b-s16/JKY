they lied.

the tacos were not half price, even though that is what it said on the wall AND on the menu. nope. we were charged full price and 6 little tacos, although tasty, are not worth $15. 

when i asked the bartender what the deal was, he said they got rid of that deal. i pointed to the wall, and he says, "yeah, i know." and that was it. 

plus, a fight broke out behind us and it wasn't even 8pm (we were there for happy hour). entertaining if they would have let it go on, but the guys were so drunk they could barely swing. (heavy on the sarcasm).

we used to go here a bunch a few years ago, but now it's just bad cougars and people that like to fight. awesome for some, but not for me.
