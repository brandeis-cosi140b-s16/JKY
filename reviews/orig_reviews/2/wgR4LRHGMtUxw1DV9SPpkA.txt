This place gets two stars not because it sucks, but just because it's very "meh". I heard alot of hype about this place from friends and my Hispanic friends as well that kept calling this place the "Mexicans' Mexican restaurant". Well, if that's the case, then clearly Mexican cuisine leaves much to be desired.

I ordered a flauta dish that was large in portion size and skim on flavor. Like most Mexican food however, I felt like I was busting at the seams after I was walking out of the restaurant. One good thing I will say about this place though is that their chips and salsa are pretty good. In the end, I really don't know what was worse: my deflated expectations or my burning intestines the next morning.
