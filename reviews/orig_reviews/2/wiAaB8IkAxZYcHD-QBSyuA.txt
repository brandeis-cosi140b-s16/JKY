This is a very busy place on Friday nights and they don't seem to be capable of making the proper adjustments to adequately serve large numbers of customers.

The service was generally slow and inattentive, though it did improve once they became aware of us.

There is also an unrealistic expectation that patrons will automatically know to seat themselves upon arrival.

I have nothing good to say about their food.  Their carne asada burrito was bland, watery, and unappetizing.  

Their chile relleno made me gag.  It was by far the worst.  The chile itself was hard and difficult to chew and I had to spit out the seeds.  The taste was disgusting.  I pushed it aside immediately after choking down the first bite.  

The chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and tasteless.  

I literally left half a plate full of food uneaten.  Our waitress kept asking if I needed a box, to which I repeatedly declined.

Their only saving grace is the chips and drinks.  My margarita was fine.  No complaints.

In sum, if you want to punish yourself and have a miserable experience, eat at this restaurant.
