I think I am giving up on this place the food is good but the ordering process is to chaotic. 

They really need to simplify the multiple lines. It's really confusing. 

I went with 3 other people. All of  us agreed that  it really wasn't worth the wait. 

Plus their salsa bar was mostly bare and was not replenished during our entire excruciatingly long visit.
