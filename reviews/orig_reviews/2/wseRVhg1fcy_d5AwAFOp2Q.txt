Second trip to the Sandbar today and it was exactly like the first - Meh.

I will say, the chips and salsa are excellent.  A nice spicy red salsa and a nice spicy green that looks more like a pesto.

First time I tried the veggie fajitas - just ok, the tortillas were a little old, veggie mix was different kinds of peppers and onion ( I ordered it without mushrooms) not a lot of flavor and, FYI their fajitas do not come with rice & beans.

Second time I had the cheese quesadillas, too greasy and heavy but the taste was ok.  I went with a group of 9 and no one was impressed by their dish. 

Servers are cute but service isn't very good.  Cool setup with sand and a big bar that opens to the patio.  If you went there for couple of beers and some chips and salsa you would probably enjoy yourself.   If you looking for good Mexican food and/or good service - keep driving.
