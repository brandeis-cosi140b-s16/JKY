Who knew that Arriba brewed its own beer?  When I walked in, I immediately noticed a growler in a display case.  Looking around a bit more, I found a room with steel tanks and brewing equipment.  Arriba offers 3 homemade brews.  I had the Pilsner and it was so-so - not worth taking a growler home.  Still, I'm intrigued enough that I *might* go back just to try the other two.

The food is okay.  At least the place is kid friendly.  It's hard to go wrong with quesadillas and the kid's menu has several options that appeal to children.

I like spicy food but didn't find that here.  Even the "spicy" salsa failed to live up to its name.
