I love Mexican food. Its hard to disappoint me when I know I'm going to eat this food. Yet this place did find many other ways to make that happen. First the host placed me and my wife at a booth that would fit 8 people. The window was facing the afternoon sun and she never asked to lower the blinds. After a few minutes of sitting in the direct sun and starting to sweat, I asked we could be moved. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. " No, please just seat us at another table or booth".  She did as I asked. Even though the table she took us to was clean on top, you could have filled a waste basket with the food and chips that where under it. She grabbed a broom and did sweep it out. So I started to look around. The place was a complete mess. Tables with plates and food still on them and the floor was a complete disaster. Ok, lets just eat I told my wife. The waitress ask for our drink order. Great time for a margarita. Not really. Time for a lot of sweet and sour. The food was just middle of the road. I hope your experience is better than mine.
