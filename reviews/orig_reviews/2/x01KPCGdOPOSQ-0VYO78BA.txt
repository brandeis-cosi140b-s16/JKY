Service was pretty good, however they have Pepsi, boohoo! Salsa was tasty but the chips were stale. They ambiance was bright, colorful, nice patio...food was a 3 out of 5, however it's a Lil pricey for what you get. One beef taco with rice and beans is $11. Steak fajitas are $17. Would I try this place again? Eh probably not.
