Honestly I wasn't all that impressed with this place.
Pretty limited menu, the portions are tiny, and they charge for salsa (which was mediocre).

The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley.  Not sure what valley they are talking about, but definitely not the best in phoenix.  Although it was good, I would put it at about average for carne asada.

The location was great and the building was kind of cool, but the seating was very limited and there seemed to be some wasted space.  

All in all, I thought the food was okay, but overpriced for what you get.
