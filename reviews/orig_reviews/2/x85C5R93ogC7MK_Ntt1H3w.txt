Got a recommendation from the bellhop that this was good, reasonably priced food. Having grown up in CA I guess my expectations were too high. The only good thing about the stale chips was that they were free. They didn't bring them out until after we had ordered and were finished with our first round of drinks and brought one basket for a table of nine. Salsa was decent, especially the verde. I ordered the dorado lobster tacos. Very little lobster which was under-seasoned. Beans were bland as was the rice and they wouldn't let me substitute soup or salad which was what I wanted anyway. Pretty average. Staff was friendly but distracted. They comped my friends meal without her having to ask when she found a hair in it. Service was friendly but distracted. They clearly need a dedicated bartender and not a waitress that has to bartend for all her tables. Did I mention they put salt on my mango margarita?
