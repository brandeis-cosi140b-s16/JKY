This is about College Night every Thursday. 

If you want to be thrown into a crowd of strangers consisting mostly of boppy eighteen year olds' who actually have the chance to come into this bar on this day only, then this is the place for you. 

I mean, I went because I have a lot of 20 year old friends, so I like to take them dancing from time to time until they reach the age of opportunity here in Las Vegas. For the most part I had a great time because my goal of the night was to dance and we did. I did not buy any drinks because, that night, the only 21+ was me and I was driving... how does that happen, not sure, but it was OK. I did purchase a tiny 12 oz water, twice, because it was HOT in there with all those people. However this tiny bottle of water does not do justice to my hydration process, and it was $4! I mean I would be OK with a regular 16oz bottle being $4, but not this tiny little thing. 

The first DJ was OK, but the midnight DJ's were awesome. They are called the Bombmakers and they play at other clubs, so it was cool to see them there. The music for the most part is good, it was just that first DJ did not know how to transition at all.. fail. Bombmakers..win! 

This will probably bet the only night I will ever go, until those friends reach their 21st birthdays. I do not find it cool to just grab a drink.  It is 10$ for gentlemen and ladies are free (another good thing about being a girl), but in reality I would never want to bring a guy friend because it wouldn't be worth that $10 fee. 

Like I said, good for those not of age here in the fabulous Las Vegas and it is at Town Square which I love that place, but that is all it is.
