2 stars seems harsh. However, 2 stars is I've experienced better, and this qualifies as 2 stars. My service yesterday was HORRIBLE. Apparently, I was bothering the bartender while he was flirting with some guy. He made me one of the worst margaritas' I've had. So, what drives my scores on Yelp are 3 fold. Service, food and prices.
Service = awful
Prices = strip prices, waaaay to expensive
Food = in this case, DRINK, not very good
I suppose since I still sound like a Nyer, he assumed I wasn't local, and therefore, he could be rude to me. SMH, this is why I really dont do the strip. Local bars and restaurants always treat you so much better.
