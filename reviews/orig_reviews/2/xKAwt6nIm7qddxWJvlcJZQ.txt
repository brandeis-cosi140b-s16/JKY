I'm afraid this is one of those "I wanted to love it, but..." reviews. 

We had an assortment of tacos and burritos.  They were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever.  Yes, they were authentic Mexican tacos (i.e., not Taco Bell) but is that really supposed to be something special in Arizona for cryin' out loud?   It's not like we're in Canada here, people.

I saw the piece on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives where they made a big deal about their variety of salsas and how people came from miles around to buy them.

Seriously?  They had exactly two salsas.  Again, they were fine, but nothing special and nothing at all like what we saw on TV.  We ordered chips and salsa and got a small little french fry tray of chips with no salsa.  I asked the girl at the counter for salsa and she pointed to the same two bottles. Ah, ok.  Woo hoo.

I would happily stop there if I was in the neighborhood but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.
