Meh is right.

It's always ridiculously crowded. It's in that generic Cali Tex Mex restaurant chain style where quantity matters over quality. The drinks may be large, but the tequila they use during happy hours is borderline mezcal. The food is mediocre and overpriced. Service is VERY uneven. Dim lighting probably hides a multitude of sins. 

Be sure to carry multiple IDs if you are not American. I had issues getting in with my passport. Yeah, are you freakin kidding me?  I guess that's typical of a place where many underage kids try to get in. However if they don't let you in, that might be doing you a favour.
