Went here on a Saturday night for dinner. The menu looked great but the service was disappointing. The drinks and food took a long time and the waitstaff wasn't attentive. They brought the wrong food out and were very slow on drink refills.

The ambience is great especially outside and the live music was great. The staff was good about taking the wrong food off the bill and was accommodating. I'd recommend going on a week night and maybe service would be better when it's less crowded
