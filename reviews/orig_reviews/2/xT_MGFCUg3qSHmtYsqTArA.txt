It pains me to give Leticia's such a low review because the food is incredible. However the service may not be the best - pretty hit and miss depending on whom you get.

Today, however, closed the deal for me not to give this restaurant my business. We wanted to celebrate a going away party so I called for a reservation for 10. The hostess was ok but from the get go gave me the impression that she was not happy with reserving for a party that size. After putting me on hold and asking the manager she told me that they would have to have a $150 deposit which would be not refunded if I do not cancel at least 2 hours earlier or if at least 75% of my party doesn't show up. That would mean that if 2 people cancel last minute, not only they would get the revenue of 7 people, but they would get an extra $150. Since when are local restaurants turning into airlines??

Regardless I said ok here is my Amex and exp, but then they wanted my security code. Say what??? For a reservation guarantee?

I told them that if they are adamant about getting my code I will take my business elsewhere and their answer was ok, I am sorry.

Too bad, the food was good.
