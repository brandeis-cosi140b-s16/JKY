Meh... its okay.  I give it a 2.5.  Decent food, a bit over priced, okay atmosphere, okay service, good location.... I seriously doubt I will be back.  There just wasn't anything that made me think I wanted to spend my time or money here.  I mean if someone wanted to go here I wouldn't run, but I certainly would never suggest we go here.  Lots of other, better places to spend your time n money.  Just my 2 cents.
