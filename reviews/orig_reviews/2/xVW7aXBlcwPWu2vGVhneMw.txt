Art work and outdoor murals were awesome, although the food was not authentic mexican food like we thought.

I think my wife and I had expectations that this place was going to serve typical "barrio/authentic mexican" food, frijoles, arroz, etc.  What we received, was what we ended up calling "Retro Mexican" or food that one would find in a posh, trendy, upscale yuppie neighborhood. I about spit out my iced tea when one of the other customers asked for "Mexican Wine Juice".... WTF!   I looked at my wife and was like what is "Mexican Wine Juice"? 
Its called Sangria you DA.

Don't get me wrong, it is good to see that the ghente running this place are doing well, but it just wasn't what I expected.  The area was nowhere near sketchy like one of the previous reviewers posted, but then again if you are used to or are from Beverly Hills CA, Cherry Creek CO, Scottsdale AZ or any posh area it might be for you.

As for the food.  I had the Torta de Filetito.  The filet was cooked perfect but the spices were lacking something, Some spicey chile maybe?!  The iced tea was good, and the steak fries dipping sauce was different. Kind of like a lazy attempt at spicing up the ketchup.  The portion size was enormous and was a bit pricey. 

The good thing is, is that price evened out to two meals had I gone and bought dinner that night.

The waitstaff was awesome and on-point.  As one of the reviewers below stated this place gets stars for all the little things murals, waiters, artwork, etc. but the food is definetly not reflective of the "Barrio".
