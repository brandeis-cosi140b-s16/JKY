Huge after work meet up for drinks and dinner. We get there and it's empty -- literally not another table there. It took almost 10 mins just to get menus and someone to take out drink order.

I am going to make this quick and to the point -- I don't plan on returning to this hot mess. The service is incredibly incrediblyyyyyyyyyy slow and sloppy. The food sucks -- delivered cold. I would have complained but after delivering the food we didn't see the waiter for like 30 + mins. 

To sum it up -- our waiter was also the bartender. Bad move on the part of the restaurant.

Food and services were terrible -- will not return.

Oh AND a couple at our large table left early. So when we went to pay our bill they told us that that couple never paid and asked if we were going to take care of it.  We called our friends to ask what happened -- they texted us a photo of the paid receipt!!!!!!!!! This restaurant is extremely poorly managed --- double charge??? Keep it classy Macayo's !!!
