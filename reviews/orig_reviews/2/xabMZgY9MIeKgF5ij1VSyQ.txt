I live next door to this place so I eat there from time to time. Everything is overly deep fried, I get horrid heart burn after I eat there. The chips and salsa are really good though, had a good fresh taste to it and solid hotness. I'd stay away from the tacos though, they were horrible, reminded me of a taco bell hard taco, very plain and generic. Their hot sauces were watered down to the point that it was noticeable and not very hot or tasty. The rice and beans are also sub par in my opinion. I guess for a small taco shop this place is nothing more then OK, but their are better options with in a few miles.
