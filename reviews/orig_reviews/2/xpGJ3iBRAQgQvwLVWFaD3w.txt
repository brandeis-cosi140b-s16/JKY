Simple: Let down. Highly anticipated a great taco dinner, and was greeted with disappointment.  Asked for hard shell, soft shell was brought out. Chicken torta was ordered, but chicken tostada was brought out. Also very slow.  Go to Yard House it's at the end of the Linq and their swordfish tacos are awesome.  (Compliment: The ambiance is very hip and inviting,  bar has purse hooks for the ladies and knee pads up against the bar wall for the men when they slouch to watch the game)
