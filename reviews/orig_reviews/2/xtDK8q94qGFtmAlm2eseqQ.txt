Food is excellent. Ambience is okay. some interesting art work on the walls and outside. Not a big fan of most of the art work.
Lots of choices and the waiter was very informative.But he must have just gotten off of his other job as a car salesman. This guy was slick willy. Trying to steer us to the highest price items on the menu.
The food was excellent though. Everybody enjoyed their food. 
The waiter decided to charge us a 20 percent gratuity even though we had three adults two little kids and a baby. we only ordered 4 entree's. 
It's too bad there so gung ho about jacking you for max money there. It's not a bad place otherwise.
