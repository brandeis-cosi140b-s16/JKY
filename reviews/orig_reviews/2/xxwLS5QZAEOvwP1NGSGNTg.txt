We spotted this on Yelp, and the ratings looked good!  So we stopped for lunch.

They offered us samples, which was cool.  The chicken was fine.  The beef was good.  And the pork was really good!  So my wife got the Monday special (taquitos) and I got hard-shell tacos.  I was immediately concerned when I saw how little meat goes into the tacos.  They literally put in one little scoop.  It should have been two.  It really should have been two.  Then maybe I would have tasted the meat.  As it was, I couldn't taste it at all.  It may as well have not been there.  Very surprising given how flavorful the sample was.

The taquitos were OK.  Nothing special.  Just OK.

I wanted to like this place, but this was just sad.  Note to self:  don't order tacos or taquitos here ever again.  

Staff was friendly and solicitous.  I'll give them that.

We may try them one more time, and if we do we'll order the burritos.  If they just put one tiny scoop of meat into those, it will be the last.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  Given all the positive reviews I could be convinced to try once more.  But to say "I've experienced better" is an understatement, I'm sorry to say.
