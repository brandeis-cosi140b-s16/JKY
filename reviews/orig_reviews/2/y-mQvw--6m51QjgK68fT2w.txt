I was in Scottsdale with a group of women a few weekends ago for vacation and we booked a reservation at Distrito for brunch.  The weather was horrible all weekend so we were really looking forward to Brunch on Sunday before our flights left since the weather was finally nice.  There were 4 of us (all women, mid 30s, corp America Professional, dressed nice).  The moment we sat down our server had an attitude.  The restaurant was busy but nothing too terrible.  He made it very clear from the beginning that he didn't work the morning shift so I'm assuming he was called in last minute.  We were there for over 2 hours ordering foods and pitchers of margaritas and his attitude was so poor to us, that we would take turns for asking for something because he would basically yell at us when we did.  During this time, I saw a few people get up and leave before ordering food as well.  After 2 hours of the mental abuse, we got our bill which was well over 200 dollars, tipped 20 percent, and left.  However, I'm still just extremely upset about this.

Here's the thing; we all have bad days, I understand that.  But that is no excuse to ruin someone else's day because of it.  My girlfriends and I had been planning and looking forward to this trip for several months.  I work very hard as well and this weekend was one of the very few days I've had had off in months.  It was our vacation.  He literally just ruined an enjoyable afternoon for my girlfriends and I for absolutely no reason at all.  Instead of us spending the afternoon catching up because we hadn't seen each other in YEARS, we spent it being scared to order more drinks, coffee, or food because our server was so mean to us.

I just can't believe how horrible this experience was.  I want my vacation day back. =(
The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is because their food and drinks are good.
