This is the third review I've left here, but this is the only one you'll see. The first one I left was bashing security, who treated me like a criminal as opposed to a customer, which I wrote in my first review, while I was still there. While still at the location, the manager walked up and asked me to change said review, which I did to placate him making it a now dishonest review to please him, so I didn't get kicked out with my friends. Going back to my first thought; the atmosphere was great, the waitstaff was friendly, the dj's were fantastic, but the prison mentality of the security ruined my whole experience, and poisoned my good time. I will not come here again. Bummer...
