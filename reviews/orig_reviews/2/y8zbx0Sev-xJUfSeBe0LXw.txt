Rosita's
tisk tisk
there is nothing to really say 
it's not even that rosita's is bad, it's ...well...i guess i expected more on account of it's lifespan. The food here is mediocre, the service slow but friendly enough, and the ambience is purely no frills. I can't think of one single aspect of Rosita's which could distinguish it from the million other restaurants just like it scattered all thoughout our metropolis of strip malls like so much pollen in the wind. The only reason it gets 2 stars is cause i hate giving a bad review, and it's a local buisness and you gotta support your roots
