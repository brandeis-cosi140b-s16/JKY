While on the southeast side of town, I happened across El Palacio. It looked enticing enough from the outside, and was cute and clean inside.  I did happen to notice that it was all booths and smaller tables, so I wonder how they would be accommodating larger groups.

The menu offerings seemed sparse and odd. One should make a mental note when the "Chef's Special" at a Mexican restaurant is a burger.  I reluctantly ordered the Queso-Dilla , which was like a quesadilla wrapped into a burrito with meat inside. It was actually really good, and in good proportion. My husband had the steak fajitas, which he said "were good". I don't know what that really means.

The bathrooms were unclean and had no TP, a huge no-no in a Mexican establishment, no? The service was good and the server friendly and attentive. But if he hey bro'd us one more time, I was going to give him the Bruce Lee one inch punch.

Overall, El Palacio was edible and underwhelming. We would probably pass it by in the future.
