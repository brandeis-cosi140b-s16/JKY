I live a block away and the food is always good. I often come for menudo on saturday mornings. I would rate the food a four star because I don't think they make everything. I highly suspect my menudo is from a can but I like it. I give them 2 stars because the service has consists always sucked. The wait staff always seem to not know what is on the menu. The only saving grace is one particular bartender, where I now usually sit. I love my neighborhood as I can walk to 10-15 five star eateries. If another real Mexican restaurant opens up anywhere close I would quit going to sylvias.
