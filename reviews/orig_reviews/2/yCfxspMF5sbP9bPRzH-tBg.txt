What a hot mess of a place. 
The outside facade and the entry way are one design. Then you walk in to what reminds me of a college cafeteria- salsa bar, soda fountain, and random loud music blaring. And I mean RANDOM- from Ginuwine's Pony, to Coldplay, to Tejano. 
The lines to order were a bit confusing for a first timer even with the signs. It was hard to hear the servers with the enormously deep counters. And the counters were so tall that I had to stand on my tippy toes and yell and point at the food that I wanted to order. 
The bar is so tiny and it holds like 4 stools. Not a place to sit and unwind with your friends.
The total for my 2 gran tacos and a water was $12. Now that is not a good deal in my opinion. 
It was just too much for too little. Not my ideal spot for a meal.
