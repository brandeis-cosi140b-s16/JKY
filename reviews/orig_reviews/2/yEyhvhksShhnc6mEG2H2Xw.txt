Went for lunch on Cinco de Mayo and was surprised there was no specials. We ordered the fresh guacamole that's prepared at our table. We instructed the waiter "NO onions," he nodded and we thought we were clear but when we took our first bite there was a whole lot of onions. Not pleased. I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious but messy. Our food took way to long to prepare and we could not figure out why as there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at 11AM. Usually the food and service is really excellent but not at this location. I prefer the Henderson location.
