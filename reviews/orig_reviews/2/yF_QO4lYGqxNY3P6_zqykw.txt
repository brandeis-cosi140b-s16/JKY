The queso is amazing and the salsa really fresh...but the service SUCKS!  Seriously, customers are more confident that their orders will come out right when you WRITE. IT. DOWN. 

Get it together, Nacho Daddy's!  My order was wrong, my husband had to remind the waiter what he ordered long after it should have been put in, and then it took 15 minutes to get our check AFTER my to-go box had already been delivered...clearly we were done.  

I can forgive bad service in exchange for an offer of free dessert or no charge for a meal that was brought to the table wrong, but to not accept responsibility for the mistakes is poor service all around.  

Great food.  Fix your service.  The waiter wasn't wearing a nametag or else I'd include his name here.  Metrosexual, young 20s, hispanic, and a really bad memory is the best way I can describe him.
