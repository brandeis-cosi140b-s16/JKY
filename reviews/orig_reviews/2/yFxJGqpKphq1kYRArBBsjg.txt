I had really high hopes for this place. The service was super slow and took quite a while to get our food and it wasn't that busy. 

I had the carne asada, Baja and crispy fish taco. The crispy fish taco was actually pretty good, but the other two just didn't taste good at all. They pretty much lacked flavor and had no substance. The tortilla was also pretty bland. I can't really recommend coming here if your a big taco fan.
