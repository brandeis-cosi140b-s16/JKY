Way overpriced for average, at best, tacos. We were in a bind to find a somewhere to eat since everything was fully booked.  I had high expectations because I the associated chef's name, but clearly this is a perfect example of throwing a famous chef's name on a restaraunt to boost sales but not actually generate food representative of the chef's talent. The flavor of all the items we tried was lacking. Never mind the missing expected complexity in flavor, they didn't even have a basic salty spicy flavor. What gives? For these prices I expect something better than average, and that's why the rating drops to 2 stars.
