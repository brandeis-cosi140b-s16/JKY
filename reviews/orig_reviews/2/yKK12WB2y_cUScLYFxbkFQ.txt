After reading some of the other reviews, I see that my mistake when visiting the Havana Grill was that I did not drink that evening. You need to drink the mojitos if you come here. Drink several before you order. Then perhaps you will not notice that the plantains are hard and cold, and that the service staff, though very courteous and amiable, are poorly trained and don't really get the basics of how to provide restaurant service. Maybe it was just the night I was there.

The atmosphere is lovely, though. Except for when the busboy was vacuuming the entrance way.
