So my gf and I yelped a bunch of new spots to try this time around, and since this place was on restaurant.com we thought we'd definitely give it a shot. Oh well, they can't all be winners!

We ordered the nachos, fish tacos, and sopes. Everything LOOKED good, but didn't taste it. The fish tacos were the best thing between everything we ordered. The nachos and sopes were just bland. Prior to the food, they bring out chips and salsa. The chips weren't bad, but the salsa was straight marinara sauce. Borderline sweet! No bueno! 

The service was good, and the atmosphere isn't bad. All in all though, there are WAY too many good food spots in Vegas to ever want to come back here. I don't know HOW I missed Burger Bar next door, I saw it as we left Hussong's, I wanted to kill myself.
