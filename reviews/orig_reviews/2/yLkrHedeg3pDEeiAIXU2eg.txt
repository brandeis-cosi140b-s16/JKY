Food was okay. Price okay unless you want a premium meat product. Place looked clean. Decor was nice. Reminds me of a Chipotle without and organized prep line.  Rice had a bitter taste. And the beans tasted a little flat. I think I expected more based on the reviews. I'll have to come back and try something else and see if it makes a difference.
