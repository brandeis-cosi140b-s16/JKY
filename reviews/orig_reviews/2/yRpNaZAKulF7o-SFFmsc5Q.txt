Some say third time's the charm ....

The first time I patronised El Segundo Sol -- or tried to patronise 'The Second Sun' -- they quoted me an insane wait time, even though the whole place was empty. About-face, and, go next door. 

The second time I patronised El Segundo Sol -- I immediately thought --
What is this shit?

Hostess was nowhere to be found. Literally, not on duty. 

There were actually patrons this time, so I imagine the wait time is going to be three hours or something -- based on my first visit -- but, instead, I am immediately seated (once a random waiter showed up to perform the duties of the hostess).

Where is this hostess? 

I browse the grossly overpriced menu items and select the carne asade entr√©e.

I suppose I am not distinguished enough (looking) to be asked how I wanted my asada cooked, because they just cooked it however the fuck they wanted. Literally, not figuratively. Rice was crap, frijoles were crap.

The meal was mediocre -- as expected -- and, yet I have managed to get on with my life.

The hostess was there when I left, and, I initiated the farewell greeting. Pay It Forward.

The third time I patronised El Segundo Sol -- wait -- this never happened, because I am no masochist.

Two-stars because I am nice. Not recommended: don't come here. Gracias.
