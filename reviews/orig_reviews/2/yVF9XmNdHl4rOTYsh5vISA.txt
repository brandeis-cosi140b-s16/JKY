The food is overpriced for what you get. Our waiter charged us 3.00 for chips and salsa but never told us it wasn't free. My sister's 2 tacos (for 7.00 and no sides) were so small they could be considered appetizers. My burrito for 11.00 was a decent size but does not come with any sides for that price.The service was okay but not great. I won't be rushing back there.
