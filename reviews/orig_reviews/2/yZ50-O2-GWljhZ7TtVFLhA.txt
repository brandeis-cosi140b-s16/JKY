I had the carnitas and enchiladas.  the carnitas were fine but no better than what you can get at trader joes and the pancho's enchiladas were just plain bad.  they had no flavor, and the tortillas were hard.  the chips were unique, seasoned and sweet potato, but the salsa was no better or worse than a dozen other Mexican places I've been to.  I'm from California so maybe I'm a little spoiled when it comes to good Mexican, but regardless this place fell way short.  oh!  and I asked for no onions and the plate was covered in them!  poor form.
