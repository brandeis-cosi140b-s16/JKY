It wasn't what I was hoping for.  It was Tuesday so naturally I wanted tacos and chips with guacamole. Pretty disappointed with them. When I walked in there was a guy sitting on the bench watching TV and reading a newspaper. Two guys were out front chatting about whatever. Not a single person was in there during the 25 minutes were in the place. After a few minutes of looking at a menu at the counter the bench guy got up and asked if we found them on yelp.  We said yes. Took our order. Then the outside guy came in to cook our food. Bench guy talked to us like we were stupid.   I ordered two tacos one potato,  one veggie. Come to find out its the same just veggie has beans on top of the potato. My husband got a fish taco (which he said was the worst one,  even though it is their specialty), chicken and pork taco. He said the chicken and pork tasted the same. Maybe we missed what the hype is.  My guess is since the guacamole was out, it must have been the magic we were missing.
