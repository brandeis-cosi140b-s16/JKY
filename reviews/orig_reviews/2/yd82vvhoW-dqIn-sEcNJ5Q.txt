We went due to a friends birthday celebration. 

The waiter was a young man he wasn't horrible but he wasn't good either. 

They fee is several bowls of chips before we got our orders. Two of the people In my group said their food was not hot it wasn't even lukewarm. I tried a piece and it seemed as the prepared the dish and let it sit there for minute until the rest of the orders were done. 

Ordered tortilla soup, liked great presentation wise but once I had of realized it was 98% tortillas that we're soggy and hardly any broth or soup in there. 

It wasn't my choice to go here but the least this establishment could do is put effort into their service and efficiency and kitchen staff needs to be re educated or trained.
