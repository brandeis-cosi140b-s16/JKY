Came for a family birthday and were seated in the Santos room.  The decor and ambiance is nice, the temperature was much too warm with what felt like no AC, just a small electric vertical fan.  The service was mediocre .  Took a long time for drink refills or needed to ask more than once.  Of our party they forgot to take the order for two people .   
Chips tasted stale and like old oil, salsa was ok .
