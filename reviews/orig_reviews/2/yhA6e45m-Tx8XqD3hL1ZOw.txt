the waitress was nice but then again what waitress isnt 
when your in vegas.
the food was pretty predictable
bland salsa & guacamole :(
no refill on chips at all you gotta pay again for more chips!?!
thats not cool.
and almost everything besides the side orders are expensive
snd over-priced.
i ordered the baked potato and it was very good for it being $4 
cant beat that but dont expect a ehole meal at a decent price.
