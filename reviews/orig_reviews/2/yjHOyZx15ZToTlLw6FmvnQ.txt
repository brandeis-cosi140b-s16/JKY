Food was 3 Stars, but service was just really slow and I had to keep reminding the waiter to take care of us.   We went on a Wed, and the restaurant was essentially empty.   Despite our being a party of 13, the restaurant only assigned one waiter.   I had the feeling the guy had received some kind of battlefield promotion (and was a busboy who was filling in) and had never waitered before.
