My girlfriend and I are always on the search for good and truly spicy food, and when we saw the living social coupon for Jalapeño Inferno, we were pretty intrigued.  Unfortunately our experience was very underwhelming.  After a long wait before seeing a waitress, we ordered a couple of their "premium" margaritas, which we both thought were just okay, a little on the sour side, and overall, lacked balance.  We ordered the smoked pork quesadilla and the Texas style enchiladas to split for dinner.  It always bugs us a bit when something is listed as "not for the faint of heart" due to it's spiciness, and it comes out medium spicy at best.  The management is super nice, and offered to buy us an app for our initial wait.  One of the managers also recommended a puréed hatch child sauce which made things much better, and had a nice kick, but we felt this should have been somehow infused in the dishes.   Ambiance was kind of all over the place, and we would have liked to have had some more traditional Mexican type of music as opposed to the pop channel they had on.  Service seemed to be good around us, but I think that our server was just over sat, and forgot about us after our food came out.  Over all, we wouldn't recommend this for spicy food enthusiasts or authentic Mexican food connoisseurs, but we think that it'd probably be a good place for families.
