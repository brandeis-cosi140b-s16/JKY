the food was good, but not great. the horchata; however, is one of the best i've ever tried. i could come back just for that. 

the real reason why this place gets 2 stars instead of 3 was how the manager dealt with our issue. my friend ordered the filet mignon taco plate and the menu clearly said it was 15.99. We got our bill and it says 21.99. So we asked why and she said it's because they changed the menu. Well.. not the 4 menus that we were given. Instead of fixing it, she argued with us and tried to find a menu with the new price. when she couldn't produce one, she said she would need to call the owner blah blah. seriously?! and then she takes another 15minutes talking on the phone with the owner, I'm assuming, instead of dealing with her waiting customers. left such a bad taste in my mouth. in the end, she changed the charge to 15.99, to which i left a $6 tip and a scathing note on how they can have their money back. we will never return to this place.
