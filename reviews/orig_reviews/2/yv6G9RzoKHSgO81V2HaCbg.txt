Thought this place was drive through - it isn't but you wouldn't know that by the set up and drive through window.

Wanted to pick up some rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole for my daughter and Filibertos was to far out of the way.

It took FOREVER.  Was EXPENSIVE in comparison to what I usually get her and she didn't like it.  Barely picked at it.

Even though the location is convenient I won't be back.
