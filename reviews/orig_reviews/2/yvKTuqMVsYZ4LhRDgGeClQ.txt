This place used to be so good.  Something was lost in their quest to rapidly franchise.  Restroom is so unkempt that the smell fills half the restaurant. The outdoor seating is rickety and unsafe.  The meat just tastes.... odd.  I miss what America's used to be. Everything on the menu is ala carte so good luck putting together a meal for $, more like $$.
