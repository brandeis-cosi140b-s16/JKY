Location on Eastern:
We recently moved close to this location, and have been coming here frequently. Had good service, and decent food every time. Used to be our favorite restaurant because of the service alone. They recently stopped serving tofu as a vegan option, which drastically reduces the number of vegan options. Our toddler always ordered a side of tofu for her main dish to go with rice and beans. We will not be returning to Nacho Daddy, because of this. Other VEGANS beware! This place pops up on multiple search forums for vegan food in the area, one of the few in Henderson, but is now much less accommodating!
