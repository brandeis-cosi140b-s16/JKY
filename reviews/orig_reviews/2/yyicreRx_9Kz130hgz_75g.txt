Easily found parking out front. Always seems to be cars all round, figured the place might be popular. Seated in a near empty restaurant in the back by bar. Waiter came over every few minutes to ask if I was ready to order- with menu open. The food came in about 4 mins after I ordered. Just an assembly line I guess. Margaritas were mostly the pre-mixed sweet and sour. Man took away chips and plate before we were done. The push to turn over the table was keenly felt. The tamale was tender, chips store bought, table salsa ok. Beans were good, but it all needed a lot of heat. Did not feel like a $30 dinner.
