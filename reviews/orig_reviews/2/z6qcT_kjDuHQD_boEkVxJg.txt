Went there with some friends Nov 16th because their Facebook said it was open. We didn't seeing the big "private party-open Nov 18th" outside. Got the big 'no service' polite hustle out even after pulling up the Facebook page and showing the owner the green "open" on FB. Very sloppy planning!! 

Owner reluctantly gave us a $5 chip after that. I gave it to one of my friends that night and I live 2 blocks away. I remember when this was a Korean Methodist church.

Decor: cheap looking 'Christopher Columbus' italian border on the former church's inside. Big plasma tv sets by bar. Bad use of such a amazing space!

Food: friend noticed only soft tacos on menu, no hard. My espn says the goal of this is makin $ not good food.
