My gf and I had a drink here after our show and it was an okay bar/restaurant. It doesn't have the same feel as the ones down in Mexico and the drink prices are very over priced even for a regular sized cup. Even the shots they brought around were $3 and I'm not sure how strong they were. Granted this place is in the TI casino, but it still shouldn't be that expensive.

The staff was friendly and the band that was playing that night was entertaining, but  the music was just too loud that I couldn't even hardly talk to my gf. I saw other couples switching seats so that they could also talk to each other.
