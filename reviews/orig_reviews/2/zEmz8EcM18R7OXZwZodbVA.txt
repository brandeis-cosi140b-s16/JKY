The food here is good enough if you're very hungry, want something inexpensive, and want a large portion.  The condiment bar has some nice items (carrots, radish, lime wedges, various sauces, etc) but when you watch the way customers try and pour a sauce into a tiny container, you get a bit concerned.  Often, they end up spilling it right back into the bin, after it's touched their hands.  They may have to come up with a different system.
