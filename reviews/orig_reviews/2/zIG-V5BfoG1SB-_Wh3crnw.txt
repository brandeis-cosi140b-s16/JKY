BOO!

I'll give it 2 stars only because the chicken in my burrito was flavorful.  However, I think the only things I really got out of my meal were a stomach ache and a horrible "morning after bathroom raid".  

Our service was terrible - I am not sure whether our server was actually very busy, or he was just a little high strung and had too much caffeine in him, but everything he said was quick to us in a breathless type of manner (think post-marathon), he never really stopped over, and we waited at least 15 minutes for drinks.

Ack.
