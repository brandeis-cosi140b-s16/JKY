I used to LOVE this place (which is why I'm even giving it two stars).

We went at about 7 to the upper deck area on a Friday for drinks and snacks and sat down and NO one would help us. They had absolutely no customers up there and the wait staff was just standing around. One person even looked at us and then looked away.

It was super odd and uncomfortable. Weird place, I wouldn't recommend it. We actually ended up going into the high end steak house inside (Brand) and got great service and great drinks--so go to that!
