AWESOME PLACE! JUST DON'T  ORDER THE FOOD!  Love the atmosphere.  Love the service (Shout out to Ron! You are THE BEST!).   Love the gaming.  Love the music.   Love the picking my own utensils from the Mason jar.  But the food, AAAARRGH!  TOROS - I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED BUT YOU NEED TO STEP UP YOUR GAME WITH THE FOOD!!!  The reviews about your food being lukewarm and bland are absolutely true! The only thing you have going for you now is a captive audience (i.e. those of us who live nearby and appreciate a place close to home where we can hang out on a weekend night).   I tried you when you were new and the food was, well... lukewarm and bland.  The service was okay.  I held off on writing a review and decided to give you a second chance a few months later figuring you needed some time to work out the kinks.  The service has greatly improved, but the food... UGH!  How can you mess up CHICKEN?   I ordered both the Saffron Chicken and the Roasted Chicken.  They were horrible.  I took them home and fed them to my dogs.  That's expensive dog food.  As I write this review, I am stuffing my face with a bag of popcorn from Costco to get the "ewe" feeling out of my stomach.  Anyway, the lukewarm and bland food will eventually drive people away.  You've got one more shot, Toros, before I throw in the towel.  Don't get me wrong, I'll still show up occasionally to gamble, drink Sangria, and hang out with Ron, but I will NOT order any food.
