The phrase that best describes this dining experience can only be. "Aggressively mediocre." Our drink orders and meal orders were extremely slow and incorrect. Our check was not adjusted to reflect the corrections. We asked for salt and hot sauce that never came. We all described our food as "okay." All in all, a disappointing experience that took about an hour longer than it should have .
