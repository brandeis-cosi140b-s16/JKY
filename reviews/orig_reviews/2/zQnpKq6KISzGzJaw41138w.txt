We originally went waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out here because of a Groupon. The Tapas were AMAZING and thoroughly enjoyable.

Of course, they got rid of Tapas and went with a new "Mexican" menu...because if there's one thing Las Vegas needs more of in the dining scene it's less diversity and more Mexican food. Everything sounded great, but every single thing we ate felt like it was missing one ingredient. They tried to get all "artsy-fartsy" with the menu and it turned into SWING AND A MISS. 

The first batch of chips we had was not just "salty" it was more like OH MY GOD, HOW CAN ANY HUMAN BEING PUT AN ENTIRE ROMAN CENTURION MONTH'S WORTH OF SALT ON ONE BASKET OF CHIPS?!?!?

The head waitress was adorable and very wonderful. She's the only reason they get two stars.

If you're the owner of this place, GETTING RID OF TAPAS WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA!

Feel free to let us know when you reinstate it, then we'll happily give you more of our money.
