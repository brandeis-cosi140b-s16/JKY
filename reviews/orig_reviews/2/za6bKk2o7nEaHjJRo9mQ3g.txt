We've generally gone to La Unica in Indian Trail at least once per week since they opened.  We've always been happy with the food and service.  But last night's experience was enough that we may not go back.  Since they remodeled, their service has been worse.  I've thought perhaps it was because the restaurant is so much larger now.  But we're always having to ask for more chips and salsa whereas we used to never have to ask.  And I know they've always wanted the entire party to be there before they seat you.  But last night my wife and I arrived but my wife was in the parking lot right outside of the door to the restaurant talking to her parents that were leaving at the time.  I went in, said 2 for dinner and the hostess looked around me and said is the 2nd one here?  I said yes and pointed to her through the glass door talking to her parents and said she would be right in.  She said I'm sorry but I can't seat you until she's in the building.  I couldn't believe it.  I said "But she's right there" and the lady said she still couldn't seat us.  So I opened the door and told my wife she would have to come in before we could be seated.  As I say, we've been there many times and generally love the wait staff, particularly Victor.  But we may not go back after being treated so rudely.  And the hostess knows us because we are there so much.  I think the rule is ridiculous when one of the party is literally within feet of their door!!!
