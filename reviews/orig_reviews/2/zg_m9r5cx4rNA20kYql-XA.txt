Worst service ever. And they tried to bribe me with a horrible chocolate cake.  I was staying at the Boulders, Waldorf Astoria with my family.  I heard this restaurant was great so i called to order take out. 20 minutes of calling no one answered.  I decided to go and order in person.  Once was there the host was great. Nice and polite.  
My bigger issue was that they messed up the order and didn't include several items in my TO GO order.  Once I was back at the hotel, sat down with family, and was unwrapping dinner I noticed they forgot a few items.  Already 20 minutes away I had to get ready and head back to the restaurant where the host was nice enough to take quick action. Severa minutes later they came out and gave me my correct order. 

My gripe is that on to go orders, restaurants need to be more exact.  I think forgetting "to go" items is the worst next to spitting in the food.  Also the food wasn't great. The hotel bar food was better. I should of just ordered room service.  It was that bad. 

Dear spotted donkey: no need to bribe your customers... Just get it right the first time.  Have some quality control.
