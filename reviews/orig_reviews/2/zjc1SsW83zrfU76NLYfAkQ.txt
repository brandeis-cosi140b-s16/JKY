Eh, the first time i went here i was pretty drunk, and my last memory of it that was sooo good. I thought how? im vegatarian i dont even eat meat, but they have grilled cactus and i had a sope of "nopales", guacamole, cilantro and cheese. Now that i went back sober, it wasnt as good as i remembered, but then again this is from someone who has not tried all their tacos, adobado fries or asada fries which smelled painfully good.
