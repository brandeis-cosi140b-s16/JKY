Everything was just subpar. The sauce on the cheese enchilada had a weird taste, the chips were ehh, the salsa tasted watered down and had no flavor. The chorizo and egg burrito was very bland. The place looks nice and was very clean, but not worth it to come back with all the other Mexican food competitors  around.
