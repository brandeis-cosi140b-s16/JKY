After walking around Mandalay Bay looking for 20 minutes looking for the Border Grill, we finally found it tucked away near the Shark Reef. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the restaurant itself is very very nice. The chips? Terrible.  It comes in a tiny tin jar so you can't even get a good amount when you dip the over-cooked chips. The water they give you tastes exactly like tap water (maybe even toilet water- not that I would know). The main course I had was cheese enchillada and I have honestly never had an enchillada that looked like a pancake and tasted like throw up- until now. The rice that they provide (OH WAIT they actually charge you $5 for the rice but don't tell you) tastes like it was Uncle Bens that was made in a microwaveable pouch. The alcoholic beverages are also tiny and over priced (but was probably the highlight of the meal)

Needless to say $85 for a crappy meal isn't worth it
