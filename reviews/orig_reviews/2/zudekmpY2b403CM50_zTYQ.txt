Eh... no. This bright colorful restaurant is kind of cute, but the food leaves much to be desired.

The cheese crisp should be skipped. It's a fried tortilla covered in Velveeta (or some other processed cheese). There's no flavor. Salsa tastes like it's made from canned tomatoes. Chips were fresh, on the plus side.

I think the entrees were better. Chicken chimichanga was OK. The rice was fine, too. Carne asada tacos had a decent tomatillo sauce, but the beef was tough. Black beans seemed canned, but the mixed vegetables were actually pretty good and well seasoned.

Prices were high relative to the food you receive. I don't think I'll be back.
