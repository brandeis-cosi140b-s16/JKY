The decor in the place was pretty nice, and I found the 10% off "worst table" to be pretty hilarious, but the food was meh. I bought the six taco platter, and it tasted okay... I was mostly mad about the drinks. I bought a horchata coldada which sounds god damned delicious, and it was, but for $14 I didn't expect that the size of the cup would be so small. We're talking small coffee here. For $14, I wanted one of those giant globe cups that you can't see me sitting behind. The bartender didn't seem to have much weight to their hand at all.

But I suppose the prices are what you'd expect in Vegas, still it was an experience I won't need again.
