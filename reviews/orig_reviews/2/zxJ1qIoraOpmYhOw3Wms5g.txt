Went to Joyride for dinner last night to give it a shot for the first time. They have a simple menu but pricey for Mexican food; they will nickel and dime you to death on sides that you would ordinarily get with your meal at other Mexican food restaurants, so make sure you ask before you get your bill. My $12 burrito was nothing to write home about and the "refills" for their aguas frescas (no alcohol) are not free (it would be nice to know ahead of time). What you are really paying for is the ambiance, the décor, loud music, their indoor outdoor concept and their cool hip staff which provide good service. I felt fleeced when we received our bill for almost $50 for 3 tacos a burrito, churros and our $10 agua fresca.  In my humble opinion, if you still care about the food and want great value for your hard earned money Nando's Café is still a hidden gem in Gilbert.
