Carlos O'Brien's is perhaps the largest restaurant in the world (overkill? Maybe, but it's still a pretty big place) and there is this strange swing hanging from the rafters in one part of the restaurant.  I really wonder what it used to be.  But, now it's Carlos O'Brien's.  If you are dining in, order the queso dip.  It is delicious! But that's really all I would recommend.  Everything else is mediocre and super cheesy.  However, if you are using them to cater, I say order the mini chimis, mini tacos and mini flautas.  Great price to feed a large party at your house.

Also, with the size, there is never a wait.
