I had a hard time deciding between three and four stars for this place - I think 3.5 would be perfect.

Pros: nice modern feel, good margaritas, decent salsa, interesting menu. Cons: the tacos came on flour tortillas, the food was on the salty side, and the service wasn't very attentive. I feel like this place has potential, but as it stands now, it's not what I was hoping for. I would consider going here in the future to hang out at the bar and sample their extensive tequila list.
