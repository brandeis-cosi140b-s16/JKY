The warm salsa is a delight to the pallette!!! You defineately cant be a gringo though. But what have you done with the charro beans.... they are now frank n beany what happened to the delish spicy jalepeno flavored charro beans? The ribs are the bomb but dont be fancy n cut each riblet they dry out chef!!! Been going hear since opening dont screw up the original menu. The music on the weekends is great.
Put the beans back n dont cut the ribs n u get a 5.
