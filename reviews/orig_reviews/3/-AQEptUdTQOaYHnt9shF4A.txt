Ordered: 

Enchilada Nachos, Carne Asada Nachos, Spicy Shrimp Nachos, and 1/2 Shrimp/Mahi Mahi Tacos. 

Enchilada Nachos were just regular nachos with enchilada sauce. Carne Asada Nachos were decent. Pretty basic comparable to to nachos I've had in CA. The shrimp nachos were good, but the shrimp wasn't cooked very well. The jalapenos were clutch though. The tacos were pretty good with mango salsa and served with rice and beans. 

It was decent food, didn't stand out too much from past Mexican food I've had before. But if I'm ever craving nachos, this is where I'll go.
