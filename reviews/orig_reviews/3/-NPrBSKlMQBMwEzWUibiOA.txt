Not impressed. Big Daddy Burrito with chicken and green sauce. Sauces $1 extra, burrito had too much rice and was difficult to eat with a fork. Rice and beans on one side, meat on other side of it. It would fall apart when you cut into it. Atmosphere would have been perfect if it hadn't been for the odd shows they had on the TV screens. One was a turtle eyeball being surgically worked on and the other was a show of idiots performing painful stunts and making fools of themselves. Definitely not what I wanted to watch while I ate.  We probably won't go back with there being so many other choices in the Las Vegas area.
