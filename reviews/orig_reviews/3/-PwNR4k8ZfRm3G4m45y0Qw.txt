Food was pretty good, however DO NOT bring your kids to this restaurant.  They would do better to just put a sign on the front door telling you that small children are not welcome (I would have appreciated that much more)  No kids menu, and nothing really on the menu that you can work into a kids meal.  no booster seats, not even a straw for the beverage.  All and all, a very unwelcoming experience.  Might try it again when it's just the two of us.
