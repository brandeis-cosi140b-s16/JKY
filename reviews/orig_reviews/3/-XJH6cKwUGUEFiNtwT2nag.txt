I was kinda disappointed after reading all the great yelping on this restaurant.  We were in two weeks ago on a Sunday.  The inside is nice with a comfortable ambiance.  I ordered the Camarones al Mojo de ajo...sad to say, nothing special nor did a I get that great garlicy flavor.  If anything there was mostly bell pepper as filler, I didn't dam order fajita style so what's with so much bell pepper and onion???  Rice and beans were good, but just a doppling of both, really??!!  I also ordered the shrimp ceviche as an appetizer, again it was just meh.  Nothing really stood out, other than the limey juice and again, it was more of pico de gallo all mixed in that was another filler.  Maybe it was just an off day, but nothing special.  I still love San Carlos Bay on McDowell Road.  I have been going there since the early 90's and the have the best tasting seafood dishes.  Only down side is that they are cash only.  My daughter ordered a shrimp cocktail, hoping it would taste similar to those in Rocky Point, she told me that it was nothing special.  My niece ordered chicken enchiladas and nothing seafood, but said they were the best enchiladas she's had.  Go figure!!
