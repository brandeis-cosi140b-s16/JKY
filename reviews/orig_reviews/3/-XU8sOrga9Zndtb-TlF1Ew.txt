My bro had been talking about this taqueria so we decided to attack it as a family! We ordered Al Pastor, Cabeza (head) and Asada. Our favorite were Al Pastor and they actually put pineapple on them! Excellent Salsas and good Horchata. We want to go back to try other stuff. You do get the TJ feeling in there!
