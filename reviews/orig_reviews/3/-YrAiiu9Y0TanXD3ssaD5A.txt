I came here for a friends birthday party.  I wasn't expecting much as far as fod goes due to the fact that it is an on the strip Mexican spot.  The food however surprised me!  I had a Carnitas, Pork Tamale, and Cheese Enchilada combo which was great.  It could have been more spicy but the flavors were on point.  

As with most places on the strip, drink prices were steep.  7 Bucks for a beer?  12 for a margarita?  Good thing there were free refills on Ice Tea!  The group I was with ordered drinks anyway and seemed to like them well enough.  

I didn't have room for dessert but will probably make it back here sometime.  The food was that good!  Heck, maybe I'll even come in during their happy hour so I can try some of the high dollar drinks.
