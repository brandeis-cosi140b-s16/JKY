Very good food for the price.  My only disappointment were the Spinach Enchiladas.  The menu said the ingredients included potatoes & zuchinni - but mine were only spinach and cheese.  Tasty, but I would have loved the additional flavors to off set the cheese.
Great service, good prices.  I would go again, but would clarify ingredients with my server prior to placing my order.
