High marks for their Margaritas, served in a proper glass. The food shows flair, not your typical Sonoran style food, that means some items are good while others, like their chicken taco appetizers, are greasy chicken puffs that are terrible. The service was good, and the atmosphere excellent.  While a bit pricey, this is a good place to take guests and not be embarrassed by the food like a few other places in the area. Ask for their hot salsa, the regular one is very mild.
