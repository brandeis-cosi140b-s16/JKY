We drive by Nacho Daddy all the time, and finally decided to stop in last night.  We were seated immediately, and our server came over and took drink orders.  The food was good and service was decent.  Our server was very friendly.  Menu looked a little overpriced for the type of place it is, so we ordered burgers.  I ordered a house chardonnay (usually around $5) and was shocked when I got the tab to see they charge $9 for a house chardonnay!  My fault for not checking the menu for the price, but I have never paid so much for a house wine in this type of casual restaurant.  I had two glasses, which totaled $18 which pretty much doubled the bill.  The bartender gave me a little bit of attitude when I inquired, telling me I should come back at happy hour.  Other than the wine incident, the rest was fine.
