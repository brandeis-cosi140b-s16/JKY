Not the best mariscos I have ever had, but far from the worst.  The tostada mixta was off the hook and I appreciated the fact that it wasn't swimming in juice because I like to taste the seafood and not just lime.  The michelada was eh, and the shrimp cocktail was average.  The food is pricey, but then again they aren't next to the ocean so I can see why they would need to cover their costs.  The service is good and they have live mariachi/banda on Sunday's.
