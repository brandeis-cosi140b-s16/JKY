I have been here twice in a week and was hoping for a better experience my second time around. They just recently opened and still have kinks to work out, but I totally get this. My first visit I had the watermelon Margarita and it was way too sweet. We had the Brussel sprout nachos and they were good, probably the best item I have had on the menu. My second visit I shared the Tulum Poke on coconut rice. I was disappointed because I love poke. The fact that they have 3 different options for poke they just pour the sauce on top of the poke instead of it being marinated in the sauce. It was lack luster in taste and small portion of Tuna on a heaping mound of rice. We had the street corn dip which was good but not hot enough in temperature.  I had the chicken green chile taco and shrimp taco. I felt that everything is just under seasoned and I am not a huge salt fan. The plethora of sauces help liven up the tacos. I had the coconut margarita, it came in a cool mini coconut, but I feel the coconut water does not go well with the margarita mix. The atmosphere is adorable and I really want to like this place. I will come back in a couple of months to see if they have worked the kinks out. I really hope so!!
