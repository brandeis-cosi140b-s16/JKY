We just returned from having lunch at Spotted Donkey Cantina and it was pretty good, except for a couple things.

The lettuce in the little salad that came with my enchiladas had obviously come out of a bag because it tasted terrible.  I had one bite and regretted it because it ruined the taste of my bite of enchilada.  The lettuce even had brown on it.  It wasn't good and would cause me to think twice about returning.  My husband had the Cascabel-Chile Marinated Carne Asada and it had good flavor but the meat was over cooked somewhat.

This restaurant does have a nice atmosphere and would probably be fun when there are lot of people there.  It was very quiet when we were there for lunch.
