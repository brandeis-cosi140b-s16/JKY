It's a chain. Tastes like chain. Server was friendly. Prices were reasonable if you go in knowing what you're gonna get. Love the check in Rita ( which was stronger than the specialty drink I had). Try to get a seat by the ledge so you can people watch. We went after dark whole folks were heading to the clubs and that was the best entertainment of the night!
