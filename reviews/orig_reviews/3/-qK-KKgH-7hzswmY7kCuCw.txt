This place used to be a hit for me on east blvd, but no longer does it for me with the new location.

The previous location had more of a fancy, small location type of feel to it.  The new location is definitely more accommodating, but has lost what was previously mentioned.  Now it feels more like a big, open, casual, and loud atmosphere.

I can't help but compare Cantina to Paco's Taco's down in South Park, which at this point has Cantina beaten in pretty much every meaningful way for me.  The food is tastier, the vibe is classier, and dollar for dollar it is cheaper.

Also, no more duck tacos?  Why remove such a great thing?
