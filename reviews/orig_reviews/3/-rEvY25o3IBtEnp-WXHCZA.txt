It had been 3 years since our last visit so I was looking forward in anticipation of a good Tex-Mex meal at this upscale restaurant.  We started off with complimentary blue and corn tortilla chips plus a pair of tasty salsas and a mediocre bean dip.  Our entrees were shrimp and crab stacked enchiladas - Dungeness crab with Mexican white shrimp, sweet corn-guajillo chile enchilada sauce and micro-greens.  The enchiladas were very good, but a bit overpriced.  I used a Groupon certificate.
