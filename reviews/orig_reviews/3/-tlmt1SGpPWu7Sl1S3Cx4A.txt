Just ok. 

I went through the drive thru and ordered a chicken bowl with rice, veggies and guac. 

The size of it for $10.... Way to small!!! The chicken was so salty and burned !!!! I ended up taking a couple bites and throwing it away. The amount of amount of guac was at the most a tablespoon and a half. I really wanted to support this business because its something different. I do have to say they are very friendly. 


I didn't try the bark but I'm not sure I will. It was real expensive to try but at least now I know.
