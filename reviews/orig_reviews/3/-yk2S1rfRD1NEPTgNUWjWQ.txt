The food is standard taco stand fare. The tacos are ok, the margaritas are ok, the chips and salsa are ok and I think you get the drift. Is it nice to have tacos while hanging out at the pool? Yes. But would I expect better tacos? Yes. We did see Dana White the night we ate there so the scene is one of the few reasons to go.
