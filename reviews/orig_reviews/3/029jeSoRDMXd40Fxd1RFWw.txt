Brought a large group for lunch.  Had high expectations based on Blanco.  Food was good, service was a let down and overall experience was disappointing.

Start with good - Food was original, tasty and plentyful.
Now the not so good - No soda.  I am not a big soda drinker, but most of my party was.  Only tea and water was available and refills were slow and without ice.  Food took over an hour to be served.  Chips and salsa helped, but the crowd was hangry.  

Product, service and decor were lacking which are usually signs of a new business.  These guys have be open for a while and have experience with other restaurants.  Disappointing.  Won't return.  Sorry.
