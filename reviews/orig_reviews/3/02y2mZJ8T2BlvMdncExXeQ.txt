I was eating some delicious food, namely the Naco Torta with over easy eggs, when I started hearing loud banging and screaming coming from the waiting area. Apparently they have a band that performs at 7PM on Wednesday evenings, and apparently that band does not do sound checks before their wailing.  Hey they may be great, but the screeching and banging overshadowed even my food.
