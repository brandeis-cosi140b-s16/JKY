I liked the outside seating although it is too hott for me to try it. Free chips and salsa with checking in over yelp was nice, the server wasn't the most impressive as she had a serious case of resting bitch face. Shared tacos during happy hour and they were really good. However 8.00 on a happy hour menu for three small tacos was a little ridiculous.
