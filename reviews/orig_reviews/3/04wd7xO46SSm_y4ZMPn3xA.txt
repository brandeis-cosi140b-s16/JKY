Yummm!!!  I got two tacos, Mexican style, which was just perfect since the tacos come with large portions of beans and rice.  The chips are homemade and AMAZING.  I could just eat chips and salsa here and be happy.

Why only three stars?  The happy hour "special" on margaritas was $9, and they weren't very strong.  I've had much better elsewhere in the burgh.

But since Las Velas is so close to me, I'll be back for more chips and salsa...and next time I'll try the sangria.
