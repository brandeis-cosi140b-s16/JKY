Top notch place I would say.. I love the ambiance,  love the chandeliers, super prettty. Nice set up, except there's a huge dip next to entrance,  I almost fell and broke my face. Lolz. Smh.

Appetizer;; the guacamole was too salty. So I had to mix it with hot sauce/salsa.

Entr√©e;;  I got the portabello mushroom taco, it was so salty. Our waiter came over and saw that I didn't touch my tacos, So she suggested the gorditas, and yuppppppp, the gordita was fantastic! I sure finished that. Haha

Drink;; I got the 360 mint lemonade,  omg. Extra friendly they made :)))
