I admit that was scared away from the habenero burger by the warnings on the menu. Fear of blindness of any length will keep me from ordering any item.  I did order a cheeseburger expecting similar love and taste to be put into this burger. Not true. Burger was dry and boring.  My wife ordered a turkey wrap with jalepeno bacon, which she loved. 

The building looks like a modern Scottsdale building outside but a cave inside. Pretty cool. Service was good.
