My first experience with Cafe Rio was in St. George, UT and I loved it and my Mormon friends are constantly raving about it, so I was really excited when one opened here in AZ.

I've been to the Gilbert location several times and my experiences have all been pretty consistent. I love the food. Love it. My favorite is the pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style. It's SO good (especially if you like your barbacoa on the sweeter side like I do). Also, their tortillas are made fresh in front of you and they are so delicious.

Here is where they lose 2 stars for me...

The way you have to order is complicated. My first time there I was totally confused. It's somewhat set up like Chipotle as others have said. However, the counter is too high and you can't hear the guy on the other side, nor can he hear you. The menu needs to be simplified for that kind of ordering. It's not a sit down place where you can go over the menu. People are waiting behind you so there is pressure to order fast and you really just can't with that menu.

Also, each time the customer service is mediocre. They rush you through and seem annoyed when you don't know exactly what you want right away. For example, I said no beans so they asked if I wanted extra meat. I said no. When I went to check out, they charged me for extra meat. They either didn't listen or misheard me, but I think that could have been avoided had they just slowed down for 2 seconds. There was no one behind me.

Furthermore, it is overpriced and you will pay extra for every.little.thing. Side of guac? Sour cream? Enchilada style? $1, $1, $1...it adds up. I remember one time before I knew about all the extra charges, I walked out paying $12 something for one burrito. That is totally ridiculous.

Nevertheless, the food keeps me coming back. Plus, it's a very family friendly environment. The place is always packed with Mormons and their kids so I always feel very comfortable bringing my 3 and 5 year olds.
