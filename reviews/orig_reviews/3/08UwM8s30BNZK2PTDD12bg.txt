MMy mom and i stopped in here for dinner one evening. We had a friendly waiter. He asked us what we wanted to drink, and my mom and i debated weather we were going to have soda or Margaritas.  We eventually chose to have a pitcher of margaritas (poor guy had to stand there almost a whole minute because we couldn't make up our mind. Like mother like daughter) anyway, he came back & took our food order. I got a Taco. He came back & gave us our food. We asked if he had forgotten our pitcher. He said sorry and thought we decided not to order it. We clearly did and even told him we wanted strawberry not plain. We had already gotten our food by then and said forget it. He was apologetic. He came with the check and told us we had a little discount. My mom looked at it and found out he gave her the senior discount. Ha ha! My mom is 40 something and def doesn't look like a senior, but that was his way of giving us the discount. My mom was kind of like wtf... Lol but didn't mind the discount. It was a good effort on his part but she has a thing with her age. Anyway my moms dish was delicious. My Taco was okay. I've had better. It was just boring. Chips and salsa were good too. And i love free anything! Our waiter, bless his heart, was friendly and educated about the menu. It was fairly priced. The decor is kind of meh. it definitely needs a remodel. I hated the booths, the springs were broken in some spots. But if the food is good, I can over look all that. I will probably sit outside next time. It has a nice little patio area with tv's. The parking lot is ALWAYS crowded when I drive by, unless It's closed. Great sign, that's why we stopped in. I will have to go back to try the drinks and some other items on their menu. U wasn't very hungry when we went, that's why i only got a Taco. But I love some good Mexican food and def want to try other stuff. Place was busy when we went but had good and fast service. I'll be back and update this once I try more food!
