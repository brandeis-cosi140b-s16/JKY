Arrived for early dinner approximately 4:30pm.  Place was relatively dead, not that I'm complaining.  Service was excellent, except for the hostess.....she decided to put everyone that walked in right next to us when the restaurant was completely empty.  Would have been nice have had a little more of an intimate dinner.  

Food was above average, although the portions were small for the price you pay.  Margarita was delicious! Chips and salsa were about normal, except for the green salsa!!! That stuff is AMAZING! 

I will dine again.
