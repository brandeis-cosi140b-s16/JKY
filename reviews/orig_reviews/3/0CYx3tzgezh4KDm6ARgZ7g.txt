This joint is decent.  After spending a fun-filled couple of hours on the Mandalay Bay pool I decided to walk the strip and came across this place.  I had like I think one or two shots of budget brand tequila which was ok, but that's really all I had so I can't comment on any other drink or food.  

There were a ton of people in here and it seemed like everyone was having a great time.  Of course you're on the Strip so there's potential for entertainment.
