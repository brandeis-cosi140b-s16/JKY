The food was ery average not as good as you would expect. The drinks were pretty delish and quite strong so no complaints there. If you are looking for atmosphere and are indifferent as to how great the food is this is a great place, however, if you love food as much as me I would much rather go to Blancos- their tacos are 100 times better.
