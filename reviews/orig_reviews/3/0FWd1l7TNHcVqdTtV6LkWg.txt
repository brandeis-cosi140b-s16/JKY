I liked this place if you're trying to avoid going to a buffet or a club. We started our night here and it was fun. The food has huge portions, so it maybe expensive but just know you're getting a lot of food! the chips and salsa come with three different salsas and it's about 4 dollars for it, but it's very good! I shared the shrimp taco plate with a friend. They come with three small tacos, with rice and beans on the side. The tacos were excellent, a lot of lightly breaded shrimp. The beans are a little spicy but still very good as well as the rice. I liked this place because they have happy hour every day from 3-7pm. They spin a wheel every 30 minutes so different drinks end up being 3 dollars! it's a great place to start out the night, and i definitely recommend it!
