I'm not a college student anymore, but I love coming to this place. It has a really grungy atmosphere with some crazy decor on the walls. 

The seating is waaaaaaaaaaaay too close, i dnt' want people listening in on my convos.
The food is so-so, really greasy, and a lot of it is deep fried, but for the most part i come away satisfied.
The service is usually pretty dismal.
The atmosphere is great, the drinks are reallllllly good!
