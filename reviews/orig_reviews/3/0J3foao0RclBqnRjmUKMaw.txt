I've only ordered nachos and tacos here and all I have to say is try and pick up your food to go, especially if it's busy. It's faster and you don't have to deal with the forgetfulness and slow pace of the servers. 
When I sat here to eat, the server forgot about our waters, brought out food separately, and didn't acknowledge that she was messing up. It was not even as busy as I've seen this place get. 
I'll probably come back before or after I hit up Rehab again but definitely ordering to go like the first time I came here. It was quick and they got the order right.
