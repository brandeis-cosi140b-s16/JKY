Sorry, but I just don't get it. Yes, it is fusion but it maybe my taste buds or the things are made. 

Walked into the door, and yes, the service was exceptional. Greeted right away and sat right down. 

Ordered their tacos: beef, chicken and pork belly; & nachos with spicy pork. I have to admit, it's kinda weird because I'm used to eating Korean food -- Korean way not mixed with Mexican.

I do have to admint that the pork belly is worth getting. 

One more thing, this place has an odd smell. Maybe it's their cleaning supplies? Just cleaned the area where I sat?
