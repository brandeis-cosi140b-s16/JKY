The Tee Pee is a Phoenix institution started by the Duran family almost fifty years ago.It is a casual and informal tavern with a small dining area.Phoenix powerbrokers when entertaining President Bush chose the Tee Pee as one of a few local restaurants to entertain him.While perhaps not among the best of Phoenix`s Mexican restaurants it is very good.Among the dishes they do well is their chili relleno.Also noteworthy is their chimichanga.Chips and salsa would rate as average.It has changed very little in the last few decades but that is what makes it endearing to their regular clientele.
