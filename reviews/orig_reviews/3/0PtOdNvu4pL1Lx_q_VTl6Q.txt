Probably the first Mexican restaurant I ate at upon moving to the East Valley. I'm a bit of a connoisseur now since I've eaten at a hundred other joints since then. Great carne asada. Probably in the Top Ten. Burros are fab and their chips and salsa are way yummy. 

The place is kind of small and can get crowed when there's an event at the Mesa Arts Center seeing how Subway and Jack in the Crack seem to be the only other real choices in swanky downtown Mesa. But they do have a nice little patio out front. Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are too!
