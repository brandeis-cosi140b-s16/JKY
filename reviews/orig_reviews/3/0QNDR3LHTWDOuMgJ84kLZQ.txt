My co-worker, who's having her baby soon, introduced me to this restaurant a couple of years ago.  I wasn't really all that impressed with the food the first time I went there.  It was just your mediocre Mexican food menu.  My first time I ordered Enchilada with chicken and beef.  Nothing to be impressed about since it tasted like any other.  

My co-worker loves this place.  So we've been coming here from time to time for lunch.  I have to admit, the reason why I keep coming back is because of what my co-worker orders, Flautas.  These are so good.  As we keep coming here, the food kept getting better.  Maybe they fired the old cook, or the cook is getting happier and happier.  Getting laid maybe?  Okay, that was inappropriate.  But, the Flautas are awesome here.  The crispiness of the wrapping combined with the tenderness of the meat is something no one should miss out on.

Something you can do without here is their guacamole and chips.  Chips seem like they're re-used.  What I mean by that is if there are left over chips from a table, seems like they'll put it back in the chip bin, reheat it,  and put it in another bowl for another customer.  The guacamole is too smoothie like consistency.  I like 'em chunky.  

As for service, it's just like any other restaurant that have monotony to it.  You sit down, they'll bring out water.  Then they'll ask you if you want anything other than water to drink.  After the drink, they take your food order.  When you get your food, they'll give a courtesy walk by to see how you're doing.  It's very monotonous.  No personality really.  Maybe I'm just being picky.

If I'm gonna eat there again, it would only be for the Flautas.  If I lived around there, I would just order the food to go and eat it at home.
