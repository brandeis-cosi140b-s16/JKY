I like this place, but I don't love it.  Went here for dinner on Friday and we were sat on the patio right away which was unexpected.  Our server was very personable and timely; she even turned on the heater for us because I was a little chilly.  The margaritas were great, a perfect blend of ingredients and not too sweet.  The best part of the meal was the red menudo; I hadn't had a bowl for years and this was really great and spicy.  The tacos were itty bitty and a little dry, I would have liked some sort of sauces on them.  This place is overpriced in my opinion but I had a nice experience.  I would recommend coming here for drinks and apps only, you can find better entrees elsewhere.
