This is a compromise review rating. In terms of food (at this price point), this is a 2-star restaurant. In terms of cocktails and atmosphere, this is a 4-star restaurant. 
I really hope they kick up their food a notch and earn a 4-star rating because I really want to love this restaurant. 

So onto the details. I went for brunch this Sunday after drooling over the well-written brunch menu. However, I was sorely disappointed with the food. I ordered the french toast which was dry and way too bready, with barely a smear of bland jalapeno cream cheese and served with a cup of generic maple syrup (i.e. Aunt Jemima). I accept and understand artificial maple syrup at a mediocre diner, but not at a place intending to have good food. My husband's eggs benedict was definitely more successful, but the "guajillo hollandaise" might as well have been made with red bell peppers it was so mild and sweet. Maybe the chef is pulling punches because there have been complaints about spice in other reviews but when you order something with guajillo, you have to expect some spice.

Now that I've whined about my mediocre food experience, I will give credit where it is due. The brunch cocktails are inventive and delicious. They use a clearly home-made (and very spicy) bloody mary mix. They use fresh citrus in the margaritas. They shake the cocktails well. I look forward to returning for one of their well-advertised happy hours and enjoying more of their cocktails or perhaps a tequila flight from their extensive selection while sitting at their gorgeous modern bar. After a few of those drinks, I might even learn to appreciate the food. 

In spite of their short-comings, Verde clearly has a good following - with most of the tables indoors and out filling up for brunch by 11:30 on Sunday. This is a happening spot and has a lot of potential. Let's hope I have the chance to update my review soon.
