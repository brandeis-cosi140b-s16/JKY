A solid 3.5 stars for Vida.  I went here for a friends birthday and we sat on the patio area.  I loved seeing the views of the city and enjoyed the location.  It is a bit hustle and bustle, but I love that atmosphere.  For apps I had the guacamole and cheese dip.  The guacamole is so incredible.  I also had a cheese quesadilla and it was decent enough.  The margaritas were on special here and it was nice to have a good drink and sit back and watch the views.  I think the guacamole and service were great here.  Its not your typical mexican fare and I think next time I will order something a little more special to Vida!
