Walking in, you can see by crowd it must be good. We were there kinda late too. 

Menu is simple, which I love because, not many choices leads to fast ordering. 

I didn't order, and let my boyfriend order, because I am not good at Spanish, and would be embarrassed if I said something incorrectly. I was not familiar with a few things on the board, so he wanted me to try the tacos first, and then if I didn't like them, we had a second option to order something I know. 

He ordered the Tacos and asked what else I would like as a second option. I asked for the quesadilla, and asked do they have chicken? The guy cutting the meat, gave me a mean look and bluntly said "Does this look like El Pollo Loco? Where does it say Chicken?" My boyfriend just defused the situation and just asked for some meat and we walked off to get our order. I was so embarrassed. I do not know why he had to come off so mean... Right there, I felt out of place. I just wanted to take our order and leave.. 

The food was good and I didn't even need the second order because I loved the Tacos. They look small but they are filling. 

Will I go back? No. To embarrassed I guess I can't read.
