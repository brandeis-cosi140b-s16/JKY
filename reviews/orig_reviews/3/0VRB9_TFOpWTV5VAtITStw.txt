Was surprised that the jerk fried rice was not as spicy like the first time I went here. The portions seemed smaller than before and barely filled the round foil container. The food was still tasty and satisfying. I recommend the black beans over the refried since they have more flavor. Service was good and prompt. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our choices. The order paper is a bit confusing and the staff is there to explain to the newbies but it still takes a couple of times of doing the paper before you get the hang of it.
