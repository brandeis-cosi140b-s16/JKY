I haven't been to Z-Tejas' restaurant for years. My wife loves the restaurant and I must have had a bad experience at the one in Tempe. I don't remember the reason, but I've always bypass them. 
SInce it was three days before Christmas and it was my turn to choose a restaurant, I chose Z-Tejas because we had to return an item to Macy's. 
Our server, Crystal, was very polite and keep our glasses full, even checking on us every now and then to see that we were enjoying our meal. 
We thought about happy hour, but decided on the full menu. I had the Pepita Crusted Chicken and my wife had the Chicken Enchilada with Black Beans and no rice. 
My entree looked very appetizing with cilantro pesto chicken breast sliced in half and ayered with sweet potato hash, spinach, artichokes and mushrooms, served with roasted poblano sauce.  There was too many chopped carrots surrounding the entry  to give it color. But it was tasty. My wife's entree was also delicious and there was a lot of black beans which covered half of the plate.
We ended the course with the Multi-berry cobbler served in a cast-iron skillet. It was really sweet and the ice cream helped by cutting the sweetness of the dessert.
Now the question is will I go back. I will, but not in the near future.
