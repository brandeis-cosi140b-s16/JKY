Grabbed lunch here yesterday and the food was pretty bland as I doused my tacos in more sauce and salt than I should as the meat was pretty flavorless. I ordered a two taco plate, chips and guacamole along with some salsa. I also ordered a horchata and churro. I had to add salt to the salsa and the guac as well. Why?? The churro and horchata were delicious though! I enjoyed both!
