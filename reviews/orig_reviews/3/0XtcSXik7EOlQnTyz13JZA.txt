This place is not my favorite. It's overpriced, and the food is just ok. The atmosphere could be interesting, but on this occasion, the floors were dirty and that started off the evening on a low note for me. 

I was looking forward to chips and salsa because I LOVE salsa, but I found the chips to be on the greasy side, though they appeared to be homemade. The salsa was good, but good salsa needs a good vessel!  I generally don't eat my salsa plain. I had a margarita, which was good, but for $9, it should have been better.

We had the grits and patatas bravas as sides, and they were both delicious. I wish I had just eaten sides for my meal. The potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the chile sauce of the grits was delicious. I had the the santa cruz fish taco, and it was okay, but for $8, I was expecting much more. Perhaps I'm just a Smoke snob.

Overall, I would suggest Smoke, or even Round Corner Cantina if you are in the mood for delicious tacos.
