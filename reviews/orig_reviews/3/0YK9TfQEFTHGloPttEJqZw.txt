Not bad...overall.  Not the best Mexican food we've had in town.  In my wife's words, "I wouldn't mind going back," but we won't necessarily be in a huge hurry.  

Food was decent - my wife had the mahi-mahi tacos, I had fajitas.  We split a tortilla soup to start with.  We were both pretty satisfied.  The chips and salsa we had were tasty too.  Wish they would've refilled them.  My mojito was made well too - I've had plenty that were not.  

Service was friendly, but slow.  We waited quite a while for our food on a seemingly slow night.  Atmosphere was kind of dark overall.  Some sections were completely closed off with all the lights turned off, which gave the space kind of a dingy feel.  Being a teacher..... C+/B- in my gradebook!
