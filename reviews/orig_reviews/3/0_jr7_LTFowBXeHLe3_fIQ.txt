This place is like Chipotle or Qudoba, except  not as good as either one.

I only had the salad there and nothing else so this review is based on that, but I could still see everything everyone else was getting and it didn't look too much better. 

They make fresh tortillas which is nice, but it is sort or counter to the store bought type consistency of the guacamole. 

I prefer Chipotle, Qudoba, and Gadzooks to Cafe Rio.
