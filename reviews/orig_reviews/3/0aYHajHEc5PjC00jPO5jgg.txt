I was expecting to be a little more blown away by Cantina especially since its one of Charlotte's more established Mexican restaurants but I found it be all right.

I joined my friend for some margaritas on a Saturday evening (the place wasn't busy at all at 5:30ish). We started with the complimentary chips and salsa - both excellent! nice crunchy, slightly salty chips and salsa with a little bit of a kick, just the way I like it! We also decided to go for the tableside guac - nice and chunky but could've used a tad more salt/lime. 

I decided to go with the Pina (pineapple) margarita and my friend had the strawberry. Both deliciously strong!! I went with the two taco combo: fish & pork tacos. I was slightly disappointed in their refried beans and rice. Neither were particularly indicative of traditional Mexican beans and rice and the portion was teeny tiny! 

I don't know if I'll be rushing to go back as I can always count on my trusty Paco's to make an even better marg and taco but I won't count out Cantina
