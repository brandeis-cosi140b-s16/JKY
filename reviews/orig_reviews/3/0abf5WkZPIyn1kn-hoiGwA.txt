Los Tacos has a fast-food feel. They offer carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, pollo, head and tongue. Tacos are $3 each, they are a bit bigger than those at Tacos El Gordo and other taco shops. Just watch it when you say yes to everything (pico, bean, cheese, sour cream and guacamole). It's an extra $1.50. Each of our tacos were $4.50.

Carnitas were a strong favorite. Al Pastor was a weak rendition, very disappointing. Carne Asada was pretty good with everything, however, not worth $4.50.
