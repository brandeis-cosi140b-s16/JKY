Well, I can see how some people wouldn't like this place.  Everything is fancy, tables, decor, food presentation, BUT the food quality is not fancy.  However, that doesn't mean it isn't good.  

It really just seems like a half ass'd effort honestly.

The food was just as good as any other nice Mexican place with less on the menu and comparable pricing.  i had the Enfrijoladas from the lunch menu, pictured bellow, i thought it was delicious.  Other reviewers are complimenting on the proportions and it is true.  For the same price elsewhere you can get the same thing WITH rice and beans.  All said and done, i had a plate of chips with some really good guac, the meal, and a water for $13.  I would eat there again, but only if i was going with someone to a fancy dinner.  This will not be my first choice for Mexican food when i'm craving it.
