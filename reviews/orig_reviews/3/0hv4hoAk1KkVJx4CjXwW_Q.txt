This is an ok optional for a casual lunch. The service was ok as was the food. The place is deep and narrow with a long bar on one side. The decor is ok.

The chips and salsa they bring out is ok. The chips were crispy and the salsa had ok flavor. For my meal I ordered the steak stacked quesadilla. You get a good sized portion. It should fill up most people, especially after snacking on chips and salsa. I would have liked the steak to have better flavor. It certainly could have benefitted from some seasoning. The chipotle aioli inside does make up for the bland flavor of the meat. None the less, the meat should stand on its own if needed.

Our server was ok. She came around with good frequency but made a few small mistakes with the orders. Overall it was an ok experience.
