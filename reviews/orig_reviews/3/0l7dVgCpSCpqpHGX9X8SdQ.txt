Service was fantastic and prompt

Food was just ok. Enchiladas and Burritos seemed to be runny. No better way to describe it. Food came out very fast. Almost felt like it was pre assembled and then just reheated quickly. It tasted ok, but the consistency was off.

Also a bit pricey for what you get compared to other Mexican restaurants. The quality is definitely not worth it.
