Good tacos but definitely overpriced. Cucumber jalape√±o margarita was very yummy.. But again, I expected something a little larger for the $13 price tag. Was surprised it came in a little tumbler glass. I ordered the barbacoa tacos.. It came with sweet pickle on them.. Not my favorite. But it wasn't horrible. Overall this place is just average.
