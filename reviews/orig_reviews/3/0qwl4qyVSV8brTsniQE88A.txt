Mediocre... Is the best way to describe my experience with los sombreros.  We have been anxious to try this place for a long time.  It had pretty good reviews and a friend of our recommended it for a late night happy hour.   
To begin our waiter was a snob, he acted like we were lucky to have him, and at one point he actually rolled his eyes at us... seriously.   The guacamole looked fantastic coming out of the kitchen, so we started with that.  It was good, but it and the chips needed salt and there was none on the table.   The menu was not vegetarian friendly unless I wanted to order an appetizer salad.  They had a special on the board called "Mushroom Quesadillas", so I asked the server what was in them... trying to make sure it had no meat.  He said basically mushrooms and cheese.  So I ordered those.  What I got was  essentially a mushroom and cheese tamale deep fried, No tortilla! It was okay, but I would never have ordered it if I knew what it was... which was why I asked.   Getting anything out of our server was like pulling teeth.  
The only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 2 was the chocolate cream pie dessert.  I think we may try it again for a reverse happy hour if someone invited us, but the prices were a little high for the food quality and service.
