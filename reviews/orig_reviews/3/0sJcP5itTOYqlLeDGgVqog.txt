I normally love Cafe Rio.  The he food is always consistently good, both in the state of Utah and Arizona,  but today I went out of my way to treat myself and my order got all mixed up because she couldn't understand me I couldn't hear her and instead of getting the special I got charged the full regular dish and when I told the cashier she didn't offer to fix anything so I just found out that there's another location that will get my business and I will not go back to the Gilbert one if I don't have to.  Very disappointed in the service even though I know the food's  good.
