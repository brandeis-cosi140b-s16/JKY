The first time I went to a Macayo's, I was with my best friend and we were like 10 years old.  Needless to say, it's been a while since I last ate at one of their locations, and my tastes have expanded...slightly.  The husband and I came here one weekend at like 2 so it was fairly dead inside.  We were seated in the weird as can be bar area and were inundated with cheap looking hookers writhing around on a beach on the TVs.  Not the best accompaniment for Mexican food in my opinion.

Anyway, I went off their new Mex and Match portion of the menu.  It's a great option for those of you who want to try more than one thing or aren't really sure what to get.  The options are all reasonably priced too, staying well under 10 bucks.  I got a cheese enchilada and a beef tamale with refried beans.  The tamale was very tasty and the beef inside was very good.  The enchilada, I was not too impressed.  The cheese was bland and there were lots of onions in it.  Eww.  The red sauce on top was pretty tame, even for a lightweight like me.

Honestly, I won't be back.  I don't really care for Mexican food, but if I'm in the mood, I think I will go somewhere with a bit more flavor.
