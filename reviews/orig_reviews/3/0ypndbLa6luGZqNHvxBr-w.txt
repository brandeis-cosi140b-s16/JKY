We ate here last night, and wasn't really impressed. Everything is made with lard, and smothered with cheese! Since losing weight, I have tried avoiding everything unhealthy. Unfortunately, my friends  wanted to eat here.  I really wanted to like this place, but they just don't have a lot of options. I ended up ordering the Spinach Enchilada which was okay after scraping off the cheese. I also did not touch the fried beans and fried rice. The dish just didn't look edible to me, but to be fair. My friends raved about this place, and they really enjoyed their dish.
