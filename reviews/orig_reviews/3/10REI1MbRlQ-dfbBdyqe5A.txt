Nice place, friendly staff but I gave only 3 stars due to food and beverage. I order shrimp and scallop with garlic white wine sauce. And my food came out like a soup. I asked the staff later and he said it shouldn't came out like this. He was good and offer me to change the new dish but I already ate all the scallop so I told him it was ok. On the other hand, scallop and shrimp cooked perfectly. That's a plus! 

Their lemonade was really really sweet. 

However I will come back again to try Wagyu beef taco! Let's see how it will turn out.
