The establishment is gorgeous!  Very colorful and clean. The women's restrooms are clean as well. The food was average.  Which made me sad because I was expecting the food to match the decor.  I ordered the carne asada with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were very good. Nice flavor and not over cooked. The carne, was bland. There was no flavor, literally.  I have eaten plenty of carne and I'm pretty sure this is not what it is supposed to taste like. That being said, the mariachi's were a nice touch and our server was attentive and professional.  I would come back one more time to try another dish and a margarita. I also tried a bite or two of my mother's plate, chicken mole. I thought it was tasty, but my mom thought it was too sweet. The sopapilla was okay, not that it was bad. I like my sopapilla with confectioners sugar and honey only.  It tasted like they added some extra ingredients.
