I felt very scatter brain when I was in here. 

I was obviously lost in the mix because I had someone come up to me and ask me if I needed assistance.  My hubs had been here before and said his co workers like to frequent this place.  I love me some mexican food so I was down to try it.  

Me, I totally thought it was a Chaotic environment.  You know how you order food back in high school, pick a line of the food you want to purchase?  Well that's exactly how they do it here.  My hubs said that's how they ordered back in Cabo, but I've never been.  HINT JESSE N.  This place is very hip and they have been featured in some of Las Vegas' foodie magazines.  So yes, you still should give it a whirl.  

I like variety, so if I have to stand in several different lines to get my variety, I know my food will be cold.  That is part of the reason why I gave my 3 star score.  I also still left hungry after eating 3 tacos and a corn.  hahaha, this small girl has a big appetite.
