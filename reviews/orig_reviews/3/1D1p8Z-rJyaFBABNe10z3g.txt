I didn't eat there so this is going to be sweet and short people:

If you find yourself thirsty and craving a beer while around the Venetian, this place is worth checking out: during happy hours (5-7 pm), Dos Equis drafts are $3 and margaritas (loaded with ice, but stil) are $5.

Sit down, unwind and enjoy the fake Italy surrounding you. It's not that bad when your expectations are rightly set.
Repeat, and leave to get dinner somewhere else.
