I really wanted to like this place : (

Hubby had tacos (lengua, asada y pastor) and he said they were the best tacos ever.
I did not have any because the extra taco I had ordered for myself... was not actually in my order, so disappointment number one.

Service was OK but not particularly friendly.

2 - We ordered, sat to wait for our number, and people were coming and going... they seem to pay more attention to people with to go orders than to the customers in their dining room, which is a big turn off for me as a customer. Even a person in a neighboring table made conversation and asked what we had ordered, because he thought we were waiting for a while. 
Hubby got impatient and went to ask (they were like 10 numbers over our ticket number) and he was told the delay was because of our 'big' order... yeah, 3 tacos, a bowl of menudo and a drink.

Well, the menudo was super hot... (are there any regulations about food temperature?  hehe) and in fact very tasty, but super stingy with the meat, I think they were leftovers and honestly they should have said 'we run out' instead of selling me a bowl of hominy. Well, I would have taken it at a discount, but not for regular price.

So, it would have been great if it was a regular portion, but it was like 90% hominy, 10% pancita, so that is a big no-no in my book.

We don't live anywhere close to this place, so I do not see ourselves coming back. Unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days.
