We come here alot on Wed nights for family night, it is super cheap like half price cheap for a OK Mexican meal. They use way to much cheese on everything and it can be quite heavy as Mexican can be. This place is not my favorite but my husband LOVES the chips and salsa so we come often. when we leave I always say " we are not coming here for a while" but we always return so he can get his fix. I am from Cali and they do good Mexican there so I have never found my holly grail Mexican restaurant in Phoenix but I am hopeful and keep trying  thanks to Yelp I just might find it.
