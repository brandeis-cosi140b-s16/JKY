I dont know if it was because it was late but the girl who took our order didn't seem happy to be there. Had the steak Torta. $7.99, for this price they could put a lot more meat. It tasted great, but no one wants to eat just bread with a lil smeer of frijoles. The decor is great. I will give it another shot and see if experience is different next time.
