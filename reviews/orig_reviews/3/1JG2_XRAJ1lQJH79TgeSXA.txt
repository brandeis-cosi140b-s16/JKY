I hadn't heard of Wahoo's before we walked in here.  Someone later had mentioned it was a chain.  That's ok... I still wanted to try it.

We didn't know how their restaurant worked as far as sitting and ordering or order before you sit.   Well, you order before you sit down and they bring it out to you.   We decided to split the Outer Reef Burrito and the Nachos with cajun chicken.   The burrito... eh.  It was ok but I wouldn't run back to have another one.  I think I had better tasting burritos from Taco Bell.  Bummer.   The nachos were pretty good.  The cajun chicken on top had a great flavor with their blends of melted cheese.   

The service was good too! The cashier was friendly but didn't understand a few of my questions.  Oh well.  The waitstaff who brought out the food and cleared the plates were great! Very courteous and polite.   

I just wish the food was memorable.    It was fine but I probably won't hurry back to be a 'regular' here.
