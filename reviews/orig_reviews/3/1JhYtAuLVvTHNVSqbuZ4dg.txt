Have been too  this "chain" restarurant eons ago, and have stayed away from it since coming to vegas 8 yrs ago. Well last nite gave in a re-visited it. Well in 10 plus years they have made some major improvements in their menu. I was amazed . Have no doubt some of the standard items probably taste like they came out of a can. However the salads were great, gucuamole was fresh, helped w/ a twist of lemon. Chicken dishes are varied. Price is good, much better than a competitor down the street I won't mention (intials LM). Can't comment on the table service, since we ate at the bar. Bar service was very good. Desserts...hummm a yogurt place has just opened across the street...head for it...For dinner give this place a try.
