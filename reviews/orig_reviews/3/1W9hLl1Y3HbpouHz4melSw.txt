Margarita was great! The chips and salsa was good! my husband loved his dinner but I had the fish tacos and for me it was just ok. I  decided to go out of my comfort zone and try something different and this choice I wasnt pleased with..I will go back and try something different but I wasnt so pleased with my choice! 
The waiter was great and helpful..
