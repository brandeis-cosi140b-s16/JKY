This was our first stop after checking into the hotel after landing. We were starved and Mexican food sounded great.

The music was so loud in here that even tho the wife and I were only about 1 foot apart we could still barely hear each other.

The server was really good and went over the menu for us. We got a pitcher of mangoritas (stellar) and both had the quesadillas. Those were yummy too. Our bill was over $100. I know it's Vegas, but it's still a sticker shock for lunch at a cheesy Mexican restaurant.
