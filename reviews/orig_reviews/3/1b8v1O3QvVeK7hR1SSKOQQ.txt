Great place to go if you want to sit in the bar, get a Lone Star, some chips and guac, and a couple tacos. The tacos aren't knock-your-socks-off delicious, but I wouldn't push them off the table, either, and there are some interesting combinations to try. The atmosphere is a lot of fun, and I always miss Texas a bit when we come here.
