Overall this place was fun.  I was in on vacation and like most out of towners I assume, my friends brought me here.  It was a good choice because it's one of those atmosphere's where you're pretty much sure to have a good time.  I did notice the d-bags in their man blouses and all the fake/plastic chicks, but not enough to care.  When I move to Phoenix, I'm sure we'll be back, but I won't be frequenting this place every weekend.
