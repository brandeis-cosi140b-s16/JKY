Pork is really good.  Highly recommend!  The girl who took my order was really kind and helped me with my order.  I ordered pork salad, chips and guacamole, and coconut bat.  Problem was they forgot my dressing as well as my guacamole.  I called them 2 just let them know.  The gentleman who answered the phone said the dressing is in the salad?!?  How is that possible?  They never asked me which one of the dressing flavors I wanted.  They also forgot 2 give me my guacamole.  The gentlemen said it happens at chipotle and quadoba.  But I don't care about them!  I care about this restaurant that owes me guacamole!!!  He said well we offer good food at good prices.  My guacamole and chips were $4 and some change!  They didn't offer 2 give me another order of guacamole.  They basically said oh well and maybe we'll see u again ??!?  Well if that's your attitude, I probably won't see u again nor recommend u to any of my friends, family or coworkers at the casino..  Too bad cause u guys have a unique taste.
