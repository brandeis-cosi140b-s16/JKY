Wahoo's is pretty decent.  Their service is top notch but I feel their fish taco's can use a little more kick -- perhaps a little acidity and spice to the fish.

Their mild green sauce is pretty good but I really enjoyed Mista Ree's sauce the best.  It tastes like the main ingredient is Korean hot chili paste.  The cajun and grilled fish is pretty mild, so I would smother the sauce all over the taco's.

The taco platters are huge.  You get a big heaping serving of rice and black beans.  Seriously, you can probably share the meal with a friend.

Their chicken tortilla soup was also very tasty - very homey with a little bit of heat.

Overall, Wahoos serves fresh ingredients and huge portions of food for extremely reasonable prices.  I just think the taco's could use a little more to kick it up a notch.
