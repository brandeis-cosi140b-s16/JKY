I'm from California, where there is no shortage of tasty Mexican food.

With that being said, I really, really enjoyed the Roja enchiladas.  Deep, rich, savory sauce really ties the dish together.

The other enchiladas I tried were so-so.

It would be best to pair the enchiladas with a tasty Margarita (or cold Mexican beer) and you have yourself an afternoon delight.
