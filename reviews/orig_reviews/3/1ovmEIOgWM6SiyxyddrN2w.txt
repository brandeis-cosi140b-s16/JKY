I only came here because I saw their huge billboard ad with "We Hate GMO!" I loved that. I'm anti Gmo and I wish more people were aware and cared. Anyway, I ordered the veggie burrito with a few adjustments. It's was okay, just not enough salt. I don't even like a lot of salt but they were very light with it. They get huge points because they have vegan and vegetarian options and they are GMO free. The chef is very nice. He came out and introduced himself. Also they are open 24/7...which is weird to me. Apparently they accommodate to the strip club next door. I just hope they don't end up losing money. One last thing, I wish the waitresses didn't have to dress so, *clears throat* traditional, to put it nicely. Do I really need to see all of that cleavage? It looks uncomfortable.
