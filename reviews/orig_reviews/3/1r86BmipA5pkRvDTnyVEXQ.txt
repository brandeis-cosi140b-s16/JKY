Been going for years for lunch.  Food is consistent and good if a little high.  Of course, I think all mexican food is usually overpriced.  We always ask for Elizabeth.  We can call ahead and tell her we are coming and we don't even have to order; she just knows! The bus ladies know us and keep us filled with chips and salsa.  (my boss is a salsa pig and hogs it all so they bring us extra)
