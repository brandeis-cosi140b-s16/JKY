Los Olivos is what it is - a basic, larger Mexican restaurant that doesn't pretend to be otherwise. Competent, inexpensive and not at all pretentious. Remember, this is in an area that doesn't know about small, family-run Mexican restaurants. Inexpensive lunch, as expected. Just don't expect fancy cuisine. That's not why you go here - it's to avoid a drive downtown or to the west side.
