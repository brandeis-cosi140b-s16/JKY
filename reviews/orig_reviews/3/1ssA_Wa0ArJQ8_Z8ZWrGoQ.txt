This is an interesting concept for a restaurant.  One side they make Chinese style food and the other Mexican. 

The food is interesting but not the best in Vegas.  The pot stickers were just s little better than ok, but the tuna ceviche was pretty amazing. Highlight of my visit was their French press coffee which I will never forget.  

I want to say that they could double the size of this place and it would still be crowded.
