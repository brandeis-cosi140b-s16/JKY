Great atmosphere, food was good but did have a major problem. We ordered nachos with shredded chicken. As my child took a bite there were sharp bones left in the chicken. It hurt my child but he ended up being ok. Management came over and addressed the situation professionally. I was happy with how they handle it but hindered our experience there. I will give second shot as everything else was good.
