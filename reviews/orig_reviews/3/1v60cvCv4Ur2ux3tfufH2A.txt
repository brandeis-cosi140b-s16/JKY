I give Frank and Lupes a solid A-OK. I go to Frank and Lupes when the patio is open which is during the peak season and before it gets too hot out. The patio is kind of like a patio in Mexico with the beach in the background. This patio might not have the beach, but it has everything else to the equation, including pitchers of margaritas and a great atmosphere for a weekend meal of decent Mexican food.

This isn't fine dining. This isn't even kind of fine dining. But this is a fun option for Mexican food and it's a couple levels nicer than a Mexican bar in town. So if you go into it with these expectations, you'll have fun. 

I like Frank and Lupes for a casual night out that involves margaritas and guacamole, but especially for their soapapillas. Their soapapillas are really good. Their guac is decent but creamier rather than chunky. I prefer chunky guac but can handle this creamy one. For the entrees, everything is pretty generic Mexican food but the item that stands out most on the menu to me is the #8, the Poblano Creamy Chicken Enchiladas. It has this creamy green sauce to it and the meal definitely stands out from all the other normal Mexican food dishes. 

So now I've shared my secret spot for a beach vacation to Mexico when I can't quite find myself to the beach itself.
