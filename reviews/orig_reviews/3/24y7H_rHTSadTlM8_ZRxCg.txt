I'll be honest. The only reason we came here was because the line for Hash House was INSANELY long. So making our way out of The Quad toward The Linq, we saw this place and since we were all starving (& trying to recover from the night before) we decided to try it out. 
We were sat right away and greeted with ice waters (which was amazing given it was 109Â° that day) and chips and salsa. 
The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal. The salsa had a good kick and the chips had a spicy seasoning and a nice crunch. 
We ordered their guac and pork rinds to start with. The portion of guac for the price was just sad. Like a baby scoop of ice cream. Totally a bummer because it was decent! Had a nice little tang to it from the pomegranate seeds and paired with the pork rinds made it very unique.
The boys ordered fish and carnitas tacos. The carnitas were bland and dry. The fish tacos, as per the Hubs, "were solid." 
I had the Avocado Corn Chopped Salad which was full of flavor and texture. It had hearts of palm and cactus- two of my favorite Latin food flares. I ordered it with chicken, but it would've been better with a different meat option.
Like most of the restaurants in Vegas this place was way overpriced,  especially for lunch.
Would I come back? Yes, but only for tequila and the mechanical bull, in that order. 
Giddy up!
