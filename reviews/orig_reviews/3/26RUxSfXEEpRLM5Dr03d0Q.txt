It's alright. They've got good hot wings. It's got a bit of a party atmosphere, which I don't fine appealing. As well as a bit of a sexist atmosphere and decor. On our last visit we were completely ignored by one of the bartenders. When we sat down, he was having a convo with a couple next to us. Never glanced our way and walked away once he was done talking to them. Another bartender, from the other side of the bar, eventually came over to us. Their happy hour specials are bit meh. Their margaritas aren't all that well-made. But they do have sort-ish cool ones, like a jalapeno one. And the margaritas are decently sized too. It's not so bad during the day when it's less crowded and frat house like. Meh. I guess it all evens out 3 stars.
