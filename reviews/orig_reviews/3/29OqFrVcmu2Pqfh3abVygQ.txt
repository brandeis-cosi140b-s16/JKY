Staying at the Arizona Grand for a meeting we chose to eat here for lunch one day.  The food was good.  I had the fish tacos which were pretty tasty, not the best I've had but fine.  The service was great.  The outside seating was nice.  I can't complain.  A little pricey but being on a resort that was pretty much expected.
