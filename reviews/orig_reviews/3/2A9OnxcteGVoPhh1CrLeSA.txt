Judging from the reviews I read about the service here, I must have come on an off night, (it was Friday night), because the service was decent. 

We got seated right away and the server took our drink order. Chips and 3 different types of salsa came a few minutes later, along with water. It's pretty art-deco looking for a mexican restaurant - overall the vibe was ok. For appetizers, I was curious so I ordered the Avocado Fries. Not bad, but to me, it seemed to be missing something. For the main entree, the wife and I both ordered the Shrimp & Crab Enchiladas. I liked it - it had the right amount of spiciness from the poblano chilies, but mi esposa thought it was a little too salty. For dessert, order the Helado Frito (fried ice cream). It was nice and crispy, like it was made fresh. We both enjoyed it. 

It was a good dinner for me, not outstanding, but definitely not negative, and hey, at least the server kept our water glasses filled in a timely fashion. I may visit again if I ever go back to the Silverton.
