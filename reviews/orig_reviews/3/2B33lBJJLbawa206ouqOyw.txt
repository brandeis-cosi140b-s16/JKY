My wife and were excited to come upon this new place when pulling into grab a bite at Blue 32.  Always looking for killer upscale Mexican near our house.  
We have eaten here twice in the past couple of weeks.  

First the good stuff.  The red salsa they serve first off with the chips is outstanding.  Also the beans (all of them) are off the charts good.  Tortillas are killer as well. The staff is on top of things.  Not sure how they would do if it got busy however.  

I love the space and the decor is ok....I would have done the place more rustic adding more wood, iron, and candles.  That seems to be what they are going for with the upscale Mexican menu.  They keep it way to bright in the evenings.  

Now for the not good.  
The entrees are just not good.  We've tried 4 different entrees in our two visits and found none of them all that great.  The pork carnitas were some of the driest I've ever had.  
They have they're entrees priced way too high for the quality of food coming out of the kitchen.  
Also the drinks are priced too high as well. $7 for a 12oz bottle of beer... $5 for a draft beer...$9 for special drinks. I don't see folks in Gilbert paying these prices.  

I really hope this place makes it, but it seems to be nearly empty most times when we go there or drive by.  

We will go back, but only for happy hour.  Bring on that salsa.  

Hopefully the owner reads this review:

1. Bring the entree food quality up to what it should be.
2. Lower the prices on the menu $2 on most near everything starting with the bar. 
3. Tweak the decor and lighting for better ambiance.
