The food is always great here and service is usually good. We ordered our dinners. I went to ladies room and when I returned my date said they brought his food but not mine. The waiter ASKED him what did I order!!!
My date refused his food until mine was delivered.
The waiter took my order for a second time. Another 15 minute wait.
No apology or even asking if the food was ok.
I was very disappointed by that young man.
