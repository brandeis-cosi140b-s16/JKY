3-stars for the food, 4-stars for the service. 

We hit this place last Wed because we had a gift certificate and walked into an hour wait. Seeing as that we had a sitter and don't have that many date nights, I wasn't willing to waste an hour of it, sitting with spring-breakers in the lobby. After explaining that we were leaving, due to our limited sitter-time, the manager sat us. Immediately. Nice move, sir.

We had great service from that point on. Almost to the point where it was too much, but I won't complain about the attention. 

The food is just okay and it always has been. Obviously, if you want real mexican, there are loads of better places to get it. The tacos were decent, but not original and the fundito dip is also very typical. It's like the chefs cater to visitors who don't know any better, when it comes to authentic mexican food. And that's fine, but it's not good.

The drinks are okay. Apparently everyone has to have a blood-orange marg on their menu, right now. However, the one at The Mission-- WAY better, FYI.

My biggest complaint about this place is the fact that it's just typical. And in a city the size of ours, we locals don't have to settle for typical. Unless you have a gift certificate.
