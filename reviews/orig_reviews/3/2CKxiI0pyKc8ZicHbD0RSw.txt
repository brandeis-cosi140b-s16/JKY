A co-worker and I found ourselves in downtown Phoenix trying to catch a view of President Obama leaving the Phoenix Convention Center after his speech to the VFW convention.  After just missing the president leaving, we wandered over to the Arizona Center and settled on Mi Amigo's for lunch.  The service was excellent. Our waitress was Rebeca. The food was so-so. There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, and this one doesn't top the list, but if you are in downtown Phoenix, and confined to that area, it's not bad.  Another Yelper complained about the salsa being weird, but if the standard salsa is not your choice, ask for the smooth hot salsa.  It's excellent!! You have to ask for it.
