I really love the food here but there is a need for improvement. The flow of how they process orders and get them out is not good.  They need more than one person taking orders for sure. 
If the cashier is going to handle money and pass out food..then they NEED to wear gloves or sanitize their hands in between touching money and the food. Not to mention wear a hair net. 
I've seen a red headed employee grab money from tip jar then turn around a grab a burger on a tray with bare hands. I'm sitting here now waiting for my food and seeing this. 
Service and sanitation need help!
