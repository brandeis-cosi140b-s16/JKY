I've only tried a few of their tacos and here goes the breakdown...
CARNITAS: Definitely my favorite of the three.  Good flavor and texture
CARNE ASADA:  Least favorite.  The meat was chopped up into tasteless bits.
FISH:  Average... nothing more to say

I did really like the rice that came with the tacos.  

Margarita hit the spot.

I will probably try it again because it's close and convenient to where I work.  I would not go out of my way to try it again.
