Overall we like this place. The food is good but service is not so much. We have NEVER had a friendly server here. We go at least twice a month, and it always seems like the servers are angry. Never had anyone with any personality. The food is good though and a affordable. We always split an appetizer and then share the combo platter. Plenty of food and your out for a good price! We will continue to go!
