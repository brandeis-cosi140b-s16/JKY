I was not happy at all with the food I had here, however the service was wonderful and the drinks were tasty.

What I had:

Sangria- this was very good and refreshing...however it was a small glass that was mostly filled with ice and tons of fruit..and was $8

Prickly Pear Margarita- this was the best prickly pear margarita that I have had, but at $10 a piece...me no likey : (

Cheese crisp- this was awful...it tasted like burnt cheese...and thats all it is just cheese, melted and crisped, for $7 I thought this was WAY overpiced

Carne Asada taco- meat was good..at least the parts that weren't burnt and char-coaled, $2.50

Pork taco- this was like a spicy BBQ flavored pork, it was ok...except I bit into a very large piece of fat and gristle that made me gag, $2

Halibut taco- this had the best flavor, but the piece of fish was sooooo small it was barely 2 bites worth, $3

The tacos are very small (street tacos) but they are cheap at $2-3 a piece.
The atmosphere is like retro/modern and I really liked the inside.

I would like to return another time and experience their happy hour and also would like to try their breakfast ( served all day )
