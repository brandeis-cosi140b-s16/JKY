Although decent not the most authentic or best tasting Mexican food restaurant you can choose from in Phoenix. The tortillas are a bit rubbery and the chips and salsa are not memorable. We had the chorizo and eggs plate and the chorizo and eggs burrito. The eggs were overcooked, chorizo was mediocre, the beans and potatoes needed seasoning. Don't think we will return. On the positive side, the rice was decent, they offered sodas in the bottles and we dug the nostalgic black & white photos lining the wall. Hahaha! I know, odd thing to mention but they were quite cool.
