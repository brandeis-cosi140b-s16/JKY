This is an okay eating establishment.. Maybe great depending on what it is you're looking for in Mexican food.

I gave them stars for having a really nice location, full bar, and friendly staff..
It's not actually the business I have an issue with.. just the food.

It's okay..
I ordered a chicken quesadilla with mushrooms.. it was super greasy.. not sure why, but I mean.. really greasy.
Not to say that it wasn't still very tasty.. just didn't feel very good after.

Another thing that bothered me is the lack of a salsa bar.. I had to buy a cup of each just to sample them and find which one I liked the best.. which leads me to my main point of a 3 star review..  THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULARLY DELICIOUS SALSAS!

Here's my rankings for salsa:

On the Border
Baja Fresh (Salsa Molcajete)
Chili's
Rubio's (Mild)

Little piece of advice Wahoo's:
Mexican food customers come back over and over again because they love your chips and salsa!
Give it some work and let me know, I'd love to bump this to a 5-star review with a good fire-roasted salsa and a quesadilla that doesn't slide through my fingers when I go to pick it up.
