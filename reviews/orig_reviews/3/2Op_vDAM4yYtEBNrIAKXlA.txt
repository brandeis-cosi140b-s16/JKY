We only had drinks here, but I wanted to acknowledge how great the staff and management are. We were attended to right away but our server got slammed and forgot the second round. After 20 minutes we asked to cancel the beer and bring the check. The server profusely apologized and took the extra beer off of our check. The manager also came over and apologized. We appreciated the make up for the mishap!
