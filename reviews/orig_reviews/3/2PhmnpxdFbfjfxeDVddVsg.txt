I did not want to write a review based on my first experience but now that I've gone twice I have to put in my ten cents... First off, I love the decor and love their bar. I'm a big fan of Upward Project but this place isn't my cup of tea...the first time I went it was opening week. One of the owners spilt a glass of water on me but they compensated by giving our table a complimentary appetizer. We had the ceviche and am glad it was complimentary because it did not taste that great. I ordered one of the burritos  and asked for enchilada style...the sauce was sweet. How can chile sauce be sweet?!? The rice was not cooked and the beans were bland....since it was opening week I decided not to judge the place by my first meal..

We decided to give it another try. The food again was lackluster. And the service was great at the beginning but after they dropped off our food we never saw our server again. Thank goodness they have other options that I enjoy. Just wished Joyride would was more authentic with the flavors...
