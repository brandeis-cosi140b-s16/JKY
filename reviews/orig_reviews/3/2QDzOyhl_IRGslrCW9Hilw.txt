Roberto's taste different depending on the location. Personally, I'm not a fan of the taco shops near gas stations...seems so unsanitary. 
Anywhoo, this location is cleaner than the rest. My sister who came to visit swore this place had the best breakfast burrito. It was way passed 1 AM , she was drunk and hungry. I did have to admit that cold winter night the burrito was good. 
Then we tried to recreate that moment couple months down the road..and the verdict was quite the opposite. 
Something happened to the cheap magic of the breakfast burrito. It was awful this time around. The meat and potatoes were so overcooked and salty. You couldn't taste the fluffy egg. The whole thing was a flop. Will not return as it was simple a one hit wonder.
