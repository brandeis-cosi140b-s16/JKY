One of the few places in the area to offer a vegetarian dish. While the vegetable tacos left some to be desired, their unique take on an urban street taco was filling. The hand-spun shakes are decent, and the service, sans one employee, was top notch. In fact, my cashier was one of he friendliest emotes I have ever encountered in a fast food joint. 
The ambiance is inviting; the small space had a very urban, beachy vibe. While I am unsure as to if I will purchase the tacos a second time, the shakes will have me coming back.
