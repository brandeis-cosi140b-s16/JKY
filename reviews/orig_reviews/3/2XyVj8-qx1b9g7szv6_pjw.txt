I love to come here in the morning and have tacos and get fresh made tortillas.  But service us starting to go down. There are some employees who avoid you when you ask for things and try to shove you off to ask somebody else. There are some still good employees but very few. 
I would give more stars cause I like the food but the service needs to improve
