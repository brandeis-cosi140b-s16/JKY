Here' s the deal with this place, I've been here several times so I know I'm not full of shit. They are SLOOOOW and really disorganized. Don't go here lookin' to get in and out for your work lunch. It's not gonna happen.
That said, the food is pretty damn good. It's original for Las Vegas. Some hit and miss experiences but overall good.  To have this many reviews and maintain this high of a rating you gotta be doing something right. 

They just need to get their kitchen in order for how popular they are.
