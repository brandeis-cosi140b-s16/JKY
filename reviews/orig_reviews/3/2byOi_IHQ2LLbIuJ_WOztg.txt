I read the yelp reviews and had high expectations. Great social setting and really good ambiance. Nice selection of margaritas  which is a must for a good Mexican restaurant. The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It was dry from the long smoke which means the meat was not wrapped or injected. Apps were good to very good and the guac was very good. Nice blend of jalapeños, Serrano and chipotle purée. Overpriced but at least every dish is made to order.
