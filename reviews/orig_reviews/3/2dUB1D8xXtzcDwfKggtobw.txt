Coming from San Diego, I'd have to give their tacos and A-OK. The vibe is great and the salsa definitely needs improvement. I would recommend this restaurant but I think they can go from good to great with some revamped salsa and perhaps a quick trip to SouthBeach restaurant in San Diego. Then, they can nail it.
