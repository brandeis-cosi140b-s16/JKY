In a strip mall right across the street from the Hard Rock Cafe, this place looks like it's made for locals.  Lots of TV's on the walls and airbrushed walls with stickers, signs, banners, ads for a Ro Sham Bo tournament, it's a lot to take in.  The bar looks good, but we were there for lunch.  The pork tamales were ok but had cheese in the sauce, which was unexpected.  The salad came in one of those big deep fried tortilla bowls, which kinda contradicts the reason to eat a salad, doesn't it?
