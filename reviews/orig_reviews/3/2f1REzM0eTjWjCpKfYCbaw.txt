ok service was ok not as bad as other experienced but not the best Ive had.

Had Beef Taco, tamale, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  Taco was good despite it was a 'pre made' shell not my favorite and it wasnt shredded it was ground beef but was good.  Tamale was fantastic. enchilada so so. rice was  very good and beans were good not the best but good.  

Salsa was very good had a little kick to it  and I believe made with roasted chilli's  chips were fresh and very good.

Will I go back  not likely  we have great choices for mex in the area, maybe it I had a coupon or they had a lunch special.
