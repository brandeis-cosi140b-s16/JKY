While I can't bring myself to give Los Reyes a full 4 stars, I can't say this place doesn't deserve the mad bum rush of hipsters who are flocking to it. Apparently some show came here, ate a torta, and now everyone decides that tortas are THE thing to eat.

The good:
- well, they build the right kind of torta. Not your flimsy bolillo, Los Reyes uses teleras which we all know is the only way to build a torta. 
- AMAZING milanesa. How amazing? I don't even LIKE milanesa but it was ridiculously good. 
- huge plates. By huge, I mean Goliath would eat one of these plates and definitely get the 'itis. 

The bad:
- weak horchata. It's not homemade. Well, they might make it but it tastes like the pre-packaged kind. 
- Carne asada torta is not made with arrachera. If you're going to give me cecina, tell me. Don't call it arrachera and give me tough steak. 
- location. Where in the world is this place? I was in Phoenix? I might as well drive to Gilbert. No, nevermind, no one wants to drive to Gilbert.
- no alcohol. Don't advertise a margarita and then tell me afterwards that it's alcohol free. 

I always start out with 5 stars. I took one off for them messing up my order (I asked for no avocado and they gave me extra avocado), and one off because the carne asada steak wasn't so great. It should be half of one but blame yelp. 

Will I be back? Whenever my little aztec warrior princess stomach needs milanesa, I might just drive up here for it. It's that good.
