A second visit to Tex Tubbs still left me feeling "meh" about the place. They claim to be an Austin taco spot, so I hold them to Austin taco standards. That being said, they fall short. 

Their salsas are much better than most places in town. The guacamole is good. They serve Lonestar, Shiner, and Tito's Vodka, which is cool. The tacos, however, just lack the flavor profiles of a great Texas taco. 

Good margarita specials on certain week nights.
