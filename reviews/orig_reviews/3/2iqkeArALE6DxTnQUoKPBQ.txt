We were seated pretty quickly as a table for 7 at 7pm without having a reservation by two very hospitable staff. After 4 days in Vegas, the first positive vibe I picked up on was that the front of house staff were very humble, gracious and genuine - a welcome change to the a few of the other restaurants we ate at. 

Despite the warm welcome, we were left sitting without a visit from a server for at least 10 minutes. And at most restaurants, this would be fine if not just slightly annoying. But here's why it was a much bigger problem at China Poblano: the menu and how/what you should order isn't easily decipherable without a bit of guidance (or having been there before). 

I'd suggest to the managers of CP to have the staff who seats you stick around for an extra :15 and give a one or two line spiel on how the menu is divided, portion sizes, what's shareable/not shareable, and recommended quantity of order per person. We all started to confuse each other and actually started to discuss leaving to go to somewhere that was a bit easier on our we're-in-vacation-mode brains. 

Our server came by just in time before we left and explained how it all worked, but then left and proceeded to give us another 10 minutes to ponder our life as well as our food order. He didn't take a drink order. So in the end, we sat for 20 minutes before we even get a drink order in. It's almost impossible to sit anywhere in Vegas for that long without being offered a drink. 

Orders go in and the food starts rolling out pretty much immediately. Highlights for me were:

- Queso fundido
- Lucky 6 Siu Mai
- Gan pung ji chicken (table fave)
- Carnitas taco
- Chipotle salsa

Lowlights:

- Viva china taco
- Lamb pot stickers 
- Guacamole (tasty enough, but poor value)

There were a few mix-ups with the service - some people didn't get their tacos till the rest of the table was pretty much done their food. I chalked that up to the shared-plates approach, but a bit more attention could have easily saved one upset and ignored diner. We were also missing a side of the "monk chilli sauce" which was ordered because we were - and still are - very curious as to WTF it would actually be. 

Loved the decor of the restaurant and felt that the music was very well selected. Not really sure about the choice to project a picture of Frida Kahlo up at the same time as Chairman Mao. When you take into account his political decisions were responsible for like 40-70 million unnecessary deaths,...  Maybe it's art or irony, I dunno. It certainly sparked a conversation at the table where we concluded that the designer was probably more into the superficiality of the icon of Mao, like Che, rather than the politics and the fact that he's pretty much one of the greatest modern mass murderers. And we're looking at him while eating. In Las Vegas. Ok, maybe it is irony. Unintentional irony? Moving along...

TL;DR version: interesting spot, food was generally tasty, I found it priced pretty reasonably with a few exceptions. The menu could use a bit more explanation - ideally, immediately upon arrival - and the table service could be a bit tighter and attentive. 

I also think this menu would benefit from being slimmed down by a few items, and then perhaps divided by portion size.
