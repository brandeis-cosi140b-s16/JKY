Barbacoa tacos were amazing.

We have an Asian fusion restuarant in Minneapolis that fuses the 2 cuisines a little better than this place.  C.P. has 2 distinct menus for the regions, not as much of a hybrid as I'm used to.

Great decor, free wifi, and rewards on your Identity Membership :)  We were trashy and even brought our OWN drinks in since we were gambling downstairs and got them from the cocktail servers.  Didn't seem to phase our server though, so it was apprecaited.
