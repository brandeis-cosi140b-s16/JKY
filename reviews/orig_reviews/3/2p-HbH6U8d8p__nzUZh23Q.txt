I haven't been in for a couple of months and just went by last night to discover they've reconfigured the bar area, yet again. Now it's blocked by a big buffet/cabinet, you have to go around it to get in the bar, and the tables are tightly together in a row, making for a very cramped and narrow walk to the bar. I don't know whose idea this was, but it is a BAD one! It was much more open and customer-friendly the way it was before. If Abby at the bar wasn't so fantastic (as always), I'd probably head somewhere else.
UPDATE: They have changed the bar area, again. No more large buffet, but they also got rid of a nice seating area that had a couch and a couple of padded chairs. And the experiment goes on.....
