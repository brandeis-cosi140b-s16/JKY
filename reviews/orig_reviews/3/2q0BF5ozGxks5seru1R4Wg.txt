For a Tex-Mex place in the middle of a casino in Vegas, Yolos was better than I expected (which was nothing). 

The first time I went, I was grabbing a quick drink with my husband and a friend. Ended up ordering the chips and salsa as well. The different salsas were surprisingly tasty and the drinks were cold. Our waitress was beautiful with an attitude. 

The second time we went was at about 1am. There were more of us and we were all tipsy and peckish. I sort of had a crush on our cute waiter from Brooklyn. We all ordered drinks and some chips and guac. Again, everything was just fine. Prices are reasonable. Music is super duper loud. 

If I were staying at PH I'm sure I would grab a snack here again.
