I just had to give this local spot a second chance.  The 2nd time around I knew what to avoid and asked the waiter/bartender for suggestions.  He didn't lead me astray!  I had the Carnitas Platter that was packed with a plentiful serving of moist flavorful pork (actually about 3 servings).
Their tortilla was scrumptious on its own and the rice & beans  were simply irresistible.  

My hubby's chicken burrito with red sauce was a little too hot for even this fire breathing dragon. Again, you need to know what to avoid on this menu.

I'm not a fan of the decor here, I think they need a make over from the original Va Bene design so, I strongly suggest a Carnitas Platter with extra tortillas to go!
