Canonita remains one of the better values on the strip.  We started with the pork empanadas. Then we had 2 salads, the Spinach n Manchego and the Mexican Chopped. Then we shared the Pork Loin Entree that comes atop a mixed mexican style vegetables with a spicy corn bread muffin served in baby iron cast skillet.  In short, food was great esp for vegas pricing and portions are super solid.  Problem here is service is so so at best, crappy at worst.  Servers here make less than their counter parts at other Venetian eateries and seem to punish you for it. Go for the food and prices, if ur server is crap from get go, ask for another server.
