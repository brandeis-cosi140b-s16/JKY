I stayed at the Hard Rock Resort & Casino for 5 nights and this place was a regular stop during our day! The food is not to authentic but DELICIOUS!  I will agree with previous yelpers that the service was decent.  Every one of our servers was very nice, and made adjustments when necessary. 

Some things to note:

-plenty of seating
-seated us fast every time
-our food was delivered fast
-bathrooms are right across from the restaurant
-ask for water ASAP because it takes forever otherwise!
