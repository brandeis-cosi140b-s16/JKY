Tried a Breakfast Burrito with Green Chilie. Due to the hash brown patty in the burro, things didn't soaked up enough like it would with real potatoes. The has brown thing was too greasy in its own right. Green Chile had a kick, but eggs could have been cooked more and would have like bottle of sauce option in burrito, not just an actual Creen Chili. Perhaps you need to get it smothered for that effect? Calabicitas on the side was good, not great, but Sopadillas were a nice touch, although I should have eaten them right zway instead of waiting 15 minutes to get home. It's like getting a bagel outside NYC, you just can't recreate that New Mexico cusine outside of the city it was born into.
