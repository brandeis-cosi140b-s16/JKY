We went late on a Sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials. Three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds. I got the steak, shrimp, and chicken tacos. The steak and chicken were really good, the shrimp taco was good too, but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite. My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too. I wasn't too impressed with the salsas. The green one was my favorite. The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too! I can't wait to go back and order a margarita! I love the simple, straight-forward menu and the extremely reasonable prices. Our server/bartender was very nice too!
