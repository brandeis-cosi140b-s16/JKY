ISLA is an "upscale"  Mexican restaurant and Tequila bar at Treasure Island.  I guess you could consider it "upscale" Mexican cuisine because of the prices although the food isn't as fantastic as I had hoped.  Living in SoCal, I have become spoiled with inexpensive authentic Mexican food so eating at a restaurant that calls itself "upscale Mexican cuisine" and having it be anything less than awesome is a bummer.  The prices are not super expensive but I have had better quality food-even chips and salsa at several other places.  The entrees we had were average and below.  Stay away from any of the usual Mexican items like taco plates, enchiladas, etc. and  try the more creative entrees instead-a little pricier but you won't be as disappointed.  Nothing we had was spectacular but the margaritas were good and their tequila selection is killer.  Service was quick and our waitress was friendly but I don't think I will go back again-maybe for margaritas and appetizers but thats about it.
