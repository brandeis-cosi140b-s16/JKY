For a place with "tortilla" in the title, there really wasn't much there that required a tortilla for the eating of it.  There was meat loaf, pasta and mashed potatoes on the menu.  That's Mexican?  It was very weird.  I had  the quesadillas, which were filled with vegetables and very tasty, but they should have grilled it more since the cheese wasn't fully melted.  The portions were a good size, and flavors were good, but not fabulous.

The tortillas with butter are a bit confusing to me.  What am I supposed to do with it?  Eat it like a piece of bread?  I'm a Midwesterner, so you might have to explain it a bit to me.

Our server was fantastic (and adorable).  He checked on us just the right number of times, and was friendly without being overbearing.
