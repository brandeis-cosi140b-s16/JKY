I have been here several times now in the last couple months.  One of the times, everything was absolutely amazing and the other couple times were very mediocre.  I am surprised by the inconsistency in the food as I ordered the same tacos on each occasion as well as other items.  However, 1 out of 3 times they were off the charts great and seasoning and everything was perfect and the other couple times they were soo beyond salty and not even edible.  

Secondly, I have had great service here and I have had absolutely terrible service or a huge lack of service.  I want this place to succeed and do well but they certainly need to look at their business model and what they are trying to achieve here because inconsistency is terrible for business.  

I would love to recommend this place but hard to recommend somewhere you don't know if you are going to get good service or food that night.
