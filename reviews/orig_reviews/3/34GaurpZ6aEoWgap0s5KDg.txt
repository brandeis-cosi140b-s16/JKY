I had high hopes for this place.  We went on a busy Friday evening and we were seated fairly quick.  Our server was decent...that was about the extent of the good.  The salsa with the chips was ok but nothing special.   I wouldn't recommend the Carne Asada plate.  The meat was bland and had no flavor.
