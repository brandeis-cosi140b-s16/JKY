Went here for dinner last night, on the recommendation of my parents. I have never been to a ztejas with the exception of some catered breakfast meetings. 

I really enjoyed their chambord margaritas, which were on happy hour special. The table side guacamole was ok, not the best that I have had. Everyone was happy with their main dishes, which vary from Mexican, or tex-mex inspired. 

The service was ok, my parents commented that they have had some pretty awesome servers at this location, however our server seemed a little overwhelmed, she would run to the table, as us one thing, leave and come back and ask again. It took my dad three attempts to order a beer. 

I give 3 stars because the service was average and the food was good! I'll give it another try in the future though.
