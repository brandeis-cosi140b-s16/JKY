Sat outside in the bar area. The music is deafening. Went at about 2pm, so not even happy hour. The Ahi tacos are pretty much tasteless. Needs cilantro or something. The waiter never asked me if I would like chips. Just in a rush to serve, and a wait to pay. And yet another  restaurant that assists you with the tip calculation, based on total, including tax.  Not horrible, not good.
