As far as traditional Mexican food goes, this place is alright. Pretty standard decor and menu choices at an average quality. We came in on a Friday night for the first time and weren't blown away. Stood at the door for about a minute or so before someone saw us and pointed us to the dining room (seat yourself). That was the first bad sign. We got drinks, menus, and orders in fairly quickly, but if you don't order chips and salsa (not free, but only $1) you're going to be waiting a while. We were there at least 45 minutes before food arrived. I got a taco salad with shredded beef and no shell with a side of beans because that was the only healthy option I could see. Salad was subpar, just shredded lettuce with some tomato and shredded cheese, but the beans, beef, and guac were satisfying. My friend got a beef burrito with green sauce which was much better- the sauce added a nice kick. I'm giving three stars despite bad details because, honestly, if you don't have to order something healthy, there seem to be a lot of good options. I plan on getting the machaca if I return.
