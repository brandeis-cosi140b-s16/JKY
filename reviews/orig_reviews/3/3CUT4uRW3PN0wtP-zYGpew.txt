Pretty good little american-style mexican joint.

It's not authentic mexican, but not many places in the US are...but it's still decent grub. Not breathtaking! but fine.

The beans are good, meat is simmered and tasty, beer's cold, not many complaints to have.

I have only one gripe...the tables in the dining room are TINY! If there are more than two people sitting down, it is tight...just saying, it gets tight and you can hardly fit your dishes on top.

Everything else is fine, the bartender is a nice guy, servers are nice, it's not a bad place at all to come hang out. I like how it's a neighborhood spot, it's not pretentious or obnoxious, you just walk in, eat, and leave. Easy!
