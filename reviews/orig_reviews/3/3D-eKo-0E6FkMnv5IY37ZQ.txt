Best Service- Good Food - Bit Pricey.
For vegetarians it is a bit pricey. We eat out a lot, not huge eaters (large portions) but do expect not to leave hungry. If you don't eat the chips and salsa (we had a few, warm, salty and salsa a bit spicy) and free - nice, however the portion size on the veggie enchilada (if you don't eat white rice is a bit small ($20) tasty sauce, warm and full of calories! 

The waiter did suggest veggie fajitas (not on the menu $24) not too bad, great selection of veggies. I would say high end but again my husband eats once a day 6 feet tall, 145 pounds, works out a lot and eats a lot if veggies...had hoped for more.

We did decide to indulge in drinks, I had the St. Francis Merlot ($12) very full bodied and full glass. My husband had the margarita ($12) very full and good tasting.

They offer two desserts:flan and fried ice cream, we did the ice cream. Funny - this was a larger portion, lightly fried (not heavy like some restaurants make) ($8) - fun to share - can share with four people!

Music not too loud, artwork around the restaurant detailed (reminded me a bit of the streets under Paris with the bones of the dead) - the back wall you should check out.
