Ten Year Customers here in a great neighborhood restaurant. Si Senors goes up and down in quality as they hire and fire their cooks.  Sometimes in just ok and last night was simply amazing.  Their rates keep going upand prices and the little things they do to save money is annoying;  A.) They turn down the air. No A/C in bathrooms.  B.)  Hire waitresses that know how to wait tables C.)  No Paper towels in bathrooms?   Rates are same as Abuelo's and El Zocalo's. Their food is good but cheaping out on the little things make me wonder what things are skimping on that I can't see.
