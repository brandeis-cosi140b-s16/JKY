I've been here a couple of times and once was to try to defeat the big plate of nachos.  Myself and two other friends were unable to dominate this beast but we got close.  They also have a 3lb burger challenge if you're feeling like you have to redeem yourself from getting your ass kicked by a slot machine.  I've tried their baby rack rib dinner and the food is average, not spectacular tasting but they are large in portion.  Good for late nights if you're in the area and you want to munch on appetizers.
