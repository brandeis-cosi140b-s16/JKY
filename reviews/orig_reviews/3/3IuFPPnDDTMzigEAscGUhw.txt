Above average salsas with fancy salts to try!

Really good salads, we had the Diego Salad and the Pumpkin Seed Cactus Salad.

Braised short rib was developed with flavor and fork tender.

The sea bass veracruz had tasty cornmeal coated onions and a nice flavorful sauce. The fish was overcooked but still OK. I was sort of grossed out by the veracruz paper they made. To the the fancy veracruz paper was like skin of the top of a pudding but seasoned and made from chilies.

If you ask they will make you regular margaritas normal priced so you don't have to splurge for the $100 special one.

I found the patio seats uncomfortable. The seats are very high and when I jumped up to land, my cushion flew out and I had to try again a few times.

3-4.5 stars depending on what you order.
