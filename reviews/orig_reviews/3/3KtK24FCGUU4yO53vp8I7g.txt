Here's how they rate on the 3 items any review needs:

Price:  you'll spend more than you'd expect
Service:  they seem to avoid coming around
Taste:  excellent

My guess is that this place has a dedicated and proud-of-his-work chef, who is surrounded by a lackluster wait staff that looks at the clock and counts down the time that they get to leave.  I bet you'll see them in gossip sessions in the hallways and service areas.

Good Luck.
