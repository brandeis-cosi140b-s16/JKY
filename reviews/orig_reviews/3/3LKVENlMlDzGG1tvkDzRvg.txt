I'm one of THOSE people... I absolutely despise cilantro... I believe man found a weed in the ground and accidentally ate it, and hence we have cilantro.  That said..

Fish taco:  grilled fish, not deep fried.  Way OD on the salt (I swear I was crunching on salt flakes) but let's say that's a fluke and order it again.  No cilantro sighting.

Red burro + mini green burro:  liked the mini burro concept, while BF got the full sized.  BF is a red burro fiend and this makes it into this Top 5.  My mini green was passed to him, as there is an embedded cilantro taste... to be fair the meat was tender and juicy (not over cooked meat til it's dry and redunked in liquid). 

Rice & beans:  disturbing to see orange oil pool around the beans.  Flavors of either did not impress.

Really liked the tortillas, warm with just the right amt of chew.
