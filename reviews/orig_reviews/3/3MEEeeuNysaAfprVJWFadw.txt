we've eaten here 4 times now.  the service is pretty bad.  if the restaurant doesn't make it that's why because the food is pretty good.  the burritos are good and the rice is awesome.  the atmosphere is what really makes the place though.  the patio was busy last friday a few fire pits set the mood.  i'm glad this place is close bc we'll be eating here more as long as the service improves.  prices are a bit high but this is n. scottsdale so we're used to it...if the service was better it would be 4 stars.
