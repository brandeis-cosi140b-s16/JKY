Service was very good, our drinks stayed full, and the waiter checked on us to make sure everything was good. 5 stars for service

The avocado fries my husband liked, I thought they were blah.
Chips and salsa was plentiful, but salsa was watery and chips too salty.

We shared the fajitas for two. The chicken was really good, I thought the large shrimp were under cooked. I could've said something but just didn't want too.
Nothing exceptional about the meal other than service was up to par.

We will probably be back, had the tacos before and enjoyed them.
