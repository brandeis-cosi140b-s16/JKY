The service is always very reliable when visiting the Sam Fox concepts. The food is consistent too and although taste and liking can vary it's a descent spot for lunch.  Today I tried the guacamole, the enchiladas with red chile and the borracho beans and rice. 

The ancho chili in the enchiladas was definitely not my favorite.  Yes ancho is a very strong pepper but balance is everything with Mexican foods and this one definitely missed the mark.  Then top it with a sour cream and well meh.. Proceed with caution. 

The rice is cooked in milk it seems and I'm not a big fan of it. I really would expect a red rice rather than this stove top rice with cilantro, this doesn't make it Mexican.  

The borracho beans are the usual pork and beans mix.  I don't mind them actually but the black beans are better. 

Lastly the guacamole was okay, not 9 bucks okay as it's mixed in with sour cream and sprinkled with some cotija cheese. 

Overall I will keep this place in my lunch options list.  Although the food is not at the caliber I find at a Zin Burger or True Food I can definitely always appreciate good service and friendly staff.
