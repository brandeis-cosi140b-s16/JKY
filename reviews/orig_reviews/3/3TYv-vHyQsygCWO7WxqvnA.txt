The ambiance is that of a pretty run of the mill TexMex restaurant. Service came quick. This app got us some free nachos and the different salsa dips were very good. 

We didn't try the margaritas so no review there but I had the steak tacos with refries beans and rice. The tacos were pretty good and the steak was juicy. The refries beans were nice and creamy. The rice was some of the better rice I've had at a place like. There was corn and a bit of a spice. 

My wife had chicken tacos that had quite a bit of flavor but the black beans were kind of dry and boring. She had the same rice I did.

Nothing great here but a nice stop. We would come again and try some margaritas and other entrees.
