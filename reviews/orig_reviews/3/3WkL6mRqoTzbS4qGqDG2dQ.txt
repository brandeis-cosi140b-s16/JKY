A fan but not a huge fan. We went for happy hour and sat up at the bar. Except for an extremely over served patron sitting next to us we totally loved the atmosphere. We had the bacon guacamole which I didn't love but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy. What did blow me away was the lamb taco! I could have eaten a dozen of them. I highly recommend it and do to anyone who tells me they are going up there for dinner/lunch. I am sure we go back.
