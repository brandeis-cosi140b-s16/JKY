I came to China Poblano with a group of friends, we thought it would be cool to try because they offer tapas and it's nice to share tons of little things.

This place is very nicely decorated and the concept is Chinese and Mexican food.
To be honest, I personally think that the prices are way too high for just tapas.

Their chilaquiles were pretty tasty, but $13 for tapas size. Their fried rice is good, but also $20 for tapas size...it adds up. You need about 3 different dishes per person.

If you are not worried about prices, check it out. 
If you expect a good filling meal for $60 then there are other places that are much better, like Javier's at Aria, same upscale feeling, delicious food and even though is also high in price, you get a lot more for your money.
