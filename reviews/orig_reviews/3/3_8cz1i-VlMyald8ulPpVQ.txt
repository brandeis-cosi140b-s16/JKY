This place gets 2.5 stars (but I'll round up because I'm feeling generous this afternoon).  I come here with co-workers for lunch from time-to-time, and I have to admit that I agree with many of the other reviews:  the food isn't amazing.  But it's not horrible.  It's pretty inexpensive for what you get (they have a lunch menu with good prices and a great selection), and I think that the attentive and fast service combined with the convenient location are what make it keep coming up as a lunch suggestion again and again.  

This isn't anything that I would crave on the weekends, but when I just need to get out of the building for a sunshine fix on a workday and no one can agree on where to go for lunch....not a bad solution.
