I wish Yelp had half star ratings cause this is a 3.5/5.

I went when the club went up (on a Tuesday) to get that industry offer and we ordered a shit ton of food.

Ambiance and decor as Marshawn Lynch would say was cool, dark vibe to it.

We ordered:

Tocino & Sweet Potato Guacamole - Not bad, very sweet

Chipotle, Roja, Habanero Salsa - Ehhhh I've had better

Shrimp Ceviche - Ok ceviche

Queso Fundido w/ Short Rib - Bomb.com...just be careful if you let it get cold it reminds you of what it would be like in your stomach but this is a must get but heavy app.

Carne Asada Tacos - Good but nothing special

Chile Relleno - Shoulda read the menu cause I wasn't expecting shrimp in it. Ok Chile Relleno

Carne Asada - Bomb.com as it had great flavor and was cooked medium to perfection

Enchilada - These were cool but again nothing special


Overall the food is decent, nothing special but definitely not bad. Dope spot to have casual dinner...
