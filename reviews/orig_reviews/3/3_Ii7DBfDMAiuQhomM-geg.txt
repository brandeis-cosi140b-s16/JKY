Stopped in here with the nieces after a long day of family drama. We wanted fast food but not "fast food"! We had a short rib taco, veggie taco, cheeseburger and fries. We also tried the shakes. They had chocolate and I had salted dulce de leche. Agreed...shakes were fabulous! Shorty tacos had great flavor, veggie taco was dry. The sign says "burgerS" and tacos" but there is only 1 burger. It's a double stack cheeseburger with all the fixins plus their special sauce. I found it to be delicious and flavorful but similar to 5guys or In n Out. Fries were soggy by the time we got home (5 minute ride), but still good enough. The service was friendly and fast. I'd go back for the short rib tacos and shakes for sure.
