Had late lunch here yesterday. The restaurant was a bit dirty..weird food pieces on the floor near our table, waitress was very slow and not bright or attentive at all, and there was only one other couple dining in the restaurant .. the food was pretty good tho. We ordered arroz con pollo, chicken tenders, plantain appetizer, and the salmon. Three stars is for the food, if they could clean up the restaurant and get some better wait staff I'd give it 4 stars.
