Unique flavors in a funky location. Be sure to sit on the patio. The salsa and chips were okay. Salsa was more of a relish with corn, tomatoes, etc. It wasn't very juicy. We ordered the queso and it was a little thick for my liking. The tacos had great flavor. I was not a fan of the fried flour tortilla with them...I would prefer just a fresh tortilla. I was not impressed with my side (a rice with a mango salsa on top). My husband was also not too impressed with his garlic and jalape√±o mashed potatoes. Definitely try the Wahoo Taco.

Great service. Would go back for the people and the atmosphere. 

Check out the Women's Restroom....it had 2 toilets, side-by-side with no divider. It was a single room. Thought it was kinda odd!!!
