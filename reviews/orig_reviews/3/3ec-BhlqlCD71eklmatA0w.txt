PROS: Tasty food (that green salsa is awesome)
              Delicious Sangria!
               Friendly server

CONS: Pretty bad attitude delivered by the 2 high school(?) girls at the door. We arrived at 5:20pm and we were a party of 2, with a really sour face they told us food would begin at 5:30pm so we needed to wait, we agreed to wait at the bar but to our surprise, the bar area was super full and there was no place to sit down so we went back outside (it was 5:25) to ask her if we could get a table and wait the remaining 5 mins sitting in the restaurant area, she said NO, food starts at 5:30...really? by now it was already 5:29!!!!
Anyways...we found a table at the bar and we ate there. Food was overpriced but tasty and the server forgot to bring our an order of rice and beans not to mentioned that took forever for our food to arrive. there was absolutely NOBODY before us so there's no excuse of saying the cook was very busy or something.

Overall...3 stars and I may go back for the sangrias but that's about it.
