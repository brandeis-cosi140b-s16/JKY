As a rule I'm not a fan of chain type Mexican restaurants as I find them to mostly be exercises in mediocrity.  That being said the food here was actually good...not great, but good.

Ordered the chimichanga and a chicken enchilada and tamale.  Both diners were good...not great, but good.  Oddly I found the beans and rice to be really good.  A minor part of both plates but both were good...maybe close to great. 

Also had the house margarita.  In most cases I've found house margaritas to me overly sweet and lacking tequila.  In this case the tequila was present and the margarita mix was not overly sweet.
