This place is pretty A-ok. The food is fab and waiters are on top of refills like whoa! I wanted to order shrimp, (which a friend ordered and she loved it) and will def order it next time, but I tried the chile relleno and tamal combination. Everything arrived hot and delicious. My only qualm was that our party of eight was put into a bench/booth combination table that has a pillar in the middle...which made for awkward seating and when the rest of our party arrived we requested to move. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, why put a large group in an awkward table??
