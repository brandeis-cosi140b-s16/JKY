The basics about Mad Mex are well known around Pittsburgh: good margaritas (with good variety of flavors), great wings that can get very hot (if you're into that), and burritos that aren't finger food.

The thing about the Oakland location that really disappoints me is the seating.  I've gone probably 10+ times in the past year and every time I've went with one other person, they seated us in one of two VERY uncomfortable places.  One option is in the middle of the restaurant with people walking back and forth and knocking into your chair every two seconds.  The other option is at a 4-person table sitting next to another couple like we were together, which made things very awkward.  I understand the staff wants to get people sitting down and not waiting by the door but that doesn't make it any less uncomfortable for patrons.  It would highly recommend a new layout to open up some space, but at the end of the day it's a college town restaurant known for its drinks.
