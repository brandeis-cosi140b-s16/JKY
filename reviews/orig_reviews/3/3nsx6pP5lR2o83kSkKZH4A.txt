been here twice, first time threw up b/c i drank their "big azz" margarita too fast and second time just came for the happy hour margarita. the margaritas are pretty strong, happy hour is $7 instead of $9 but they don't let you sit at the tables unless you order a meal, not even just an appetizer. that was annoying. had my margarita and left.
