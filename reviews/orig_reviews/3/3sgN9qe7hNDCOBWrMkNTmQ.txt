Was here visiting friends and stopped here for libations.  Tasty and strong margaritas.  So strong that my friend could barely finish hers.  It was cold and the heater was awesome.  We had a fun time and the servers were very attentive.

Also, they had an inflatable snowman as a holiday decoration, and a drunk guy came up and punched it and then tried to get in the bar.  He was summarily denied access.  Good call, bouncer, good call...
