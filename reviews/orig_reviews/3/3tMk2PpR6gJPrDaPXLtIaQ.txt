La Casa Blanca is hidden off on the east side of McQueen which is nice because it wasn't stuffed to the gills with customers.

From the get go, I really liked the white adobe style architecture and the dirt parking lot.  These two aspects lent an escapist rural aesthetic to the experience contrasting the hot pavement and strip malls that bombard the senses in daily metro living.  The patio area also looked like a pretty cool place to kick back on a cool, southern Arizona evening.

I was seated immediately, given a daily special and regular menu and had my drink order taken.  Chips and salsa were on the table in a flash encompassing both a standard red, tomato based salsa and a warm bean dip.  In all seriousness, this might have been the best part of my meal.  I could see myself eating just chips and salsa with maybe a cheese crisp and a tall iced tea and being completely satisfied.

Instead I ordered a red chile burrito plate.  It was okay.  Nothing remarkable.  I like my red chile to be a tad thicker in the sauce department and this particular red chile was slightly soupy while relying on the slow cooked beef to carry the dish.  

For a ten dollar plate, I felt the burro was sort of small.  It came with beans and rice which were also decent but not outstanding.

They have all kinds of stuff here: tamales, tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, all the usual suspects.  But for my money and my palette, I usually stick with a red chile burrito as a basis for my standard measure.

La Casa Blanca is a nice spot and the food isn't bad.  It's just not outstanding for my tastes.  I can, however, see myself coming back.
