Well, I sort of expected this from Scottsdale.....What can I say? 
Very nice location with very nice outdoor area. 
Greeted with smile, promptly seated, and immediate waiter contact. 
Huge tortilla chips and salsa/black bean dip. Our waiter took his time and went over the menu with us. 
We went for the Coconut Calamari as an appetizer. It was different, but different good, although we couldn't really taste coconut. Nice big crispy pieces with a creamy dipping sauce. 
For entrees my wife went with the Hot & Spicy Ceviche. It was very nice and fresh, but still very simple. Served with sweet potato and beet chips, which were a bit salty. 
I decided on a Shrimp Taco and Taco Vampiro as suggested by our waiter. They were pretty good, but I feel like the shrimp and the steak got lost in the mix of salsa, guacamole, and cheese. Just not what I am used to having eaten as some great Mexican Restaurants. 
My wife ordered what was supposed to be a Pineapple-Serrano Margarita as we had a $5 off Coupon from our Yelp Check-In. It tasted like a simple Margarita. The Yelp deal is for a Don Julio Margarita which is some of the cheapest Tequila a bar will stock that isn't "Well" Tequila.  Our waiter said he'd see what he can do as this Margarita my wife wanted wasn't a Don Julio Margarita. 
Now for the rough part! Not like the Cost was a mystery, but moreso a reminder of a mediocre meal that was pretty expensive. 
Tacos were over $6(something I'd glady pay $3 for at a local taqueria)
Ceviche/Calamari, well seafood is expensive. I understand. 
The Pineapple-Serrano Margarita? $11.50+$1.50=$13 for a small margarita that was nothing special at all. My wife asked about the Yelp deal, he said he forgot. She also mentioned that it didn't even taste like pineapple-Serrano. He came back and had removed $5 and the $1.50(fruit upcharge) so Ok, $6.50 wasn't bad. 
Not a place I'd go back to, and if you're looking for great Mexican food there are 100s of other choices out there.
