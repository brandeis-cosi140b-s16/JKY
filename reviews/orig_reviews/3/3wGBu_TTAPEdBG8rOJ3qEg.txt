I was a little surprised to see Canteen go and El Hefe come in. Seemed like Canteen was always doing very well so I guess money talks. With that said, I've always kind of thought that El Hefe was a stuck up bar. Maybe this is after my experiences with El Hefe Scottsdale. It seems that the bouncers are all weird at any location, acting like you are unwelcome while letting their friends past while you stand there. Fair enough, I'm not a El Hefe regular.

Maybe I'll have to give it another shot and see if I an get in on some drink specials.
