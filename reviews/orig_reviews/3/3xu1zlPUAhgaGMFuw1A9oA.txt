I want to Milagro with a friend last weekend for lunch. It was alright, but nothing too special. We started with the (4$) chips and salsa...the salsa was nothing too delicious, especially not 4$ worth. I had the short rib tacos, which were tasty. My friend had the chicken tacos, which she said were just ok. I just feel that the food isn't as good as it is expensive. If I were invited back by a friend or something, I would give it another shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.
