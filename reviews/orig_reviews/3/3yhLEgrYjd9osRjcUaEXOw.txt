My mushroom taco knocked my socks off, but the restaurant struck me as pretentious. There is no reason any Pittsburgh restaurant needs a DJ in a full-on, club-style DJ cage, and music so loud that all dinner conversation devolves into a frustrating game of charades because speaking words is impossible.  Like Butcher and the Rye, the too-squished-together tables at tako intensify the awkwardness of the meal and difficulty of all communications with both your dinner partner and the wait staff.

I've enjoyed Deshantz's other restaurants, especially Meat and Potatoes, but tako seems more concerned with being trendy in da Club than with making a comfortable dining experience.
