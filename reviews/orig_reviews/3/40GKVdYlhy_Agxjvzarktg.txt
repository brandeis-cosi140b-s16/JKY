I think I'm gonna have to come back here for a happy hour.  I can't give it a five, because the tacos just didn't merit a five... that said, the chips and salsa were spot on, as well as the carne asada quesadilla.  I love the ambiance and decor, and the service was really good.  In regards to the tacos, the main factor for me is the tortilla.  You can tell they were made fresh, but they were dry and a little bland.  They were white corn, which was cool, but I think the massa needed a little something.  I guess it was just meh - and when your joint is named after something specific, you should try to knock that outta the park.  Will I go back?  Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.
