Have no idea what the food is like here, but I went up to the Cabo Wabo bar because I had spotted they had cheap margarita slushies to go. I'm not one of those people who wants to pay $20 for a drink in a souvenir cup (that I'll break or lose) so $5 for a drink sounds much better to me than $20. Of course the $5 drink special was only available for one flavour (mango), but I like mango, and it was a good deal. $5 for a boozey slushie to combat some of that Vegas heat? Yes, please.
