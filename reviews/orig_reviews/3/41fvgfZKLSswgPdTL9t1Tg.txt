The positive is the taco I had was good, beyond that the size is small for a $5 taco. This place is priced out of their league, for a McDonald's style eatery it is easily $25 a person to leave here full. Vegas is filled with Mexican restaurants that have good food, reasonable prices and waiters that actually wait on you, opposed to seat yourself and clean your own table mentality. Not sure what so many others see in this place, maybe I just went on half size taco day, a bit of a disappointment.
