Came here for a drink with a buddy working off my high from Ditch Friday.  Place is low key.  In terms of price, the drinks are about average.   The food did look really good, especially the salmon.  
Note: they have a dj playing around 10:30, BUT, place is still dead, so don't waste your time thinking its going to turn into a happening scene.
