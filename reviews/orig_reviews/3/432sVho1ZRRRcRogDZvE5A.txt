This place has amazing food.

Good happy hour.

Good drinks.

Nice staff.

Service is a little slow.

They have fallen into the ridiculous Vegas mentality that pumping bass helps a restaurant- Sunday's and Tuesday's.

They just started this trend.  It's a terrible choice in my opinion.  People were constantly asking for it to be turned down.

It is saddening that management has decided to fall victim to the whole Vegas idea of loud repetitive music rather than catering to locals like they used to.

It would be 5 star but the music is a serious deterrent.

Sad.
