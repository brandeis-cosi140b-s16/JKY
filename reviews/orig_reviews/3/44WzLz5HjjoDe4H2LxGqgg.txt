This place was just 'OK'.

Service (2 stars): There were no patrons inside, which was great! It was such a nice night out that everyone was out on the patio. That said, my expectations for immediate service was way up there (there goes wishful thinking). 

The young lady originally outside on a break came in to greet us. She brought us menus and politely mentioned that our "server" would be with us shortly. After about 10 mins, said server approached us and said he'd be right back to take our order. His name was Jared.

Hmmm...so we wait The young lady circled back and took our drink order. Shortly thereafter, she took our food order. Where is Jared and why hasn't he returned? 

No chip n salsa? Why am I paying $3 for chips and salsa?  This establishment os clearly listed Mexican, so I'm expecting chips n salsa...free of charge.

Food (3 stars): While it was awesomely fantastic it wasn't horribly bad either. I ordered Shrimp tacos at the suggestion of the waitress while the juvenile ordered Fish n Chips. My belly was full so no real complaints. Waste not, want not.

Establishment Cleanliness (3 stars): The bathroom had paper towels on the floor which meant no one was tending to it regularly. With the inside being completely empty (again, myself and the juvenile only) so I expected to see swept floors and wiped down tables. 

We sat at a table near what appeared to be the entrance/exit to the Cocina. Was NOT expecting to see trash bins barreled out past the table I was eating at. Aren't there back doors for that? 

Overall they get 2.6 stars, but since I can't rate in that manner I guess they get the benefit of a round up
