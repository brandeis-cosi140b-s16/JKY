Went here when it was Super Mex so we decided to try it out. Service was painfully slow....it took forever for our appetizer and drinks to come out. The server was very apologetic, even though it wasn't her fault. Mexican pizza was average, wouldn't order again. I ordered the carne asada street taco and it was good.  The del campo street taco was horrible. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. Chips and salsa and bean dip were average. Nothing special. Don't think we will come back.
