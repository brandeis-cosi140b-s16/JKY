Great place to get cheap drinks....which is oh so rare in Scottsddale.  It's a relaxed atmosphere, they have oversized games there to play... such as an enormous version of jenga and connect four.  It's mostly a (huge) patio bar.  highly recommend for those jeans and a tee,  'lets just grab a drink or two' nights.
