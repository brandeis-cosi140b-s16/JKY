Self loathing isn't for everyone, but it does work for me. 
Enter, America's Taco Shop. 

Yes, when I find myself between alcohol-fueled introspections and waking up naked in the driveway, I troll for food here. 
 
Chips and salsa are decent.
Carne asada burrito is above average.
Bean burritos will produce room clearing farts, like a horse fart or something. 
I have no experience with their bean burritos, this is merely a rhetorical statement, kinda like the sky is blue.

But you probably already knew that.
Anyway, if you hate your life, and are between interventions, try America's Taco Shop.
