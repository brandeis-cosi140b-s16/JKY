I enjoyed my meal here. I did not see any roaches like Arik claimed. I did however find the place to be old and somewhat run down. What do you expect from an old family style Sonoran Mexican restaurant. Their salsa is tasty, and the burrito enchilada style was great. I'd go back but It's not on my short list. It's just okay.
