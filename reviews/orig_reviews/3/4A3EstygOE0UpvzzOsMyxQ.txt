Service 5 star!  Husband loved the food 4 star ( although I think that's generous as I didn't like the food as much as he did).  Prices and portions are a little skewed.  This place is expensive & portions are not all that large (2star).
The Atmosphere is nice, especially outside.  parking Could be a problem if you go at the wrong time of day.
