After reading a few of the reviews written about this place I decided to share my thoughts on this Mexican chain food destination. I have lived here all my life and never took the time to stop in until one day my buddy and I missed the bus and were looking for a place to escape the heat. The one thing about this location that always made me want to try it was the shape of the building. 

It always reminded me of one of the Mayan pyramids built in Mexico. Anyways when you first walk in they have the usual set up, bar on one side with a few tables and a full dining section for the dinner and lunch crowd. We were seated right away and given a quick run down of everything half off(happy hour pricing). The beer selection is pretty standard and the price for a pitcher was kind of high as well but my friend was happy with having it all for himself since I do not drink.

The bite size tamale bites were good and the Steak Cortez was great as well. The only thing I would recommend is going before or after happy hour as it can get really crowed and it is hard to find a place to sit unless you are just having lunch or dinner. Also it can be hard to enjoy a meal with the loud sounds of people screaming at the T.V. as the dining area is really close to the bar area. Other than that I suggest stopping in the next time you are in the area. If nothing else you can take a cool picture in front of the building LOL.
