Husband and I shared a pitcher of beer and carnitas nachos, which were excellent, but such a big portion we couldn't finish.  Chips were super crunchy and fresh and salsa was decent.  Waitress was attentive and told us margaritas were excellent upon ordering but she didn't mention the restaurant claims it invented the margarita - I probably would have ordered one if I'd known just for posterity sake.  All in all a good mid day pit stop to keep going in Vegas.  We also ordered the tortilla soup which was mediocre.  I'd go there again for the nachos.
