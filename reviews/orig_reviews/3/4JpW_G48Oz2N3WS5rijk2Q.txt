A solid 3 for sure.

I am not sure what all the hype is about. It was decent food but not anything amazing at all. 

The black beans were way tasty.
The chicken fried rice was pretty bland and dry. 

The teriyaki chicken was wayyyy super tasty, I would get that again if we go back. 

The carnitas quesadilla was ok. The contents was not spread evenly, one triangle had almost no cheese or meat and one section seemed to have all the meat and no cheese. 

The Snickerdoodle cookie is seriously what would make me go back!! It was RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING! Seriously people. 

The place itself is very, ummmm, gross? Also they don't have a spot to leave a tip if you pay with a card, that's a bum out for the employees.
