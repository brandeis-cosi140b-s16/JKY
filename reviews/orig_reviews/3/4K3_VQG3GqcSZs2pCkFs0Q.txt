Stopped in for Happy Hour. Patron Magaritas at $4 bucks were awesome!! Carne Asada Nachos were seriously the worst nachos  I have ever had!! Chicken Quesadilla on the other hand was pretty good. The Guacamole was also pretty tasty.
I would say we always visited this restaurant  because it is truly beautifully decorated AND the patio is very inviting. The dinners were also pretty good and I always recommended this place. Just hoping today's lunch was a little off and will come back to see what's up in the near future.
