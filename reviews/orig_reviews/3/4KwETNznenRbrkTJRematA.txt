I think I might be spoiled just having moved back from L.A.  I thought these tacos were only okay.  I think they needed just a little more seasoning.  I was lucky, I hear there is normally a longer wait.  I had ordered the al pastor tacos and the quesadillas with beef.  Can't say I really want to go back.
