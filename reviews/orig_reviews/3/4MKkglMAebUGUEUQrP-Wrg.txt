Salt and pepper go a long,long way. When jerk fried rice is bland you have a seasoning issue. Egg foo young beautifully prepared but absolutely bland. Even my 85 year old mother had to douse it with a few packs of soy sauce. The jade red chicken was ok but again nothing special. The retried beans were excellent. Maybe I should have stuck to the Mexican side of the menu. Disappointed as this was the first "triple d" featured restaurant I've eaten at. Oh well press on..
