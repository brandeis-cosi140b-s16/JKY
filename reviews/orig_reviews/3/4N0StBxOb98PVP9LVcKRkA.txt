If you are in the mood for OK Mexican food this place isn't bad.  It's a little pricey in my opinion.  They do karaoke and were happy to let my 4 year old have a go at it. 
If you're really feeling good try their competition nachos.  You and up to 3 friends have 55 minutes to eat all 8 pounds of nachos, and it's free, otherwise you pay fifty something dollars.  We did it in less than 20 minutes and asked for more chips.  It was a great time.
