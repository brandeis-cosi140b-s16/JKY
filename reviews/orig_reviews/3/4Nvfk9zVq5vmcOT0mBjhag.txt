I sat on the deck and had an obstructed view of bellagio's fountain. There is mist for cooling off, and heating lamps (I guess for when it gets cold at night?) They play pop music on a loop through the speakers, which adds to the fun atmosphere. Food and drinks are on the pricey side, for what it is (which is why I gave it 3 stars). I had an app and one drink and the bill came to $25.
