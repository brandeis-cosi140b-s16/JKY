I found LuLu's by way of a Living Social deal.

I thought the food was good and the pricing was okay. The counter girl was really helpful and kept her cool with a over zealous slightly rude customer. (wasn't me)

It isn't located near where I live, so I probably won't return except to use the second  half of my deal. Had the food been better than "good", I would go out of my way.

I don't agree with the extra fee to use a credit card...
