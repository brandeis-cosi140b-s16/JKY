I was really excited to eat here since there were so many great reviews.

I was fairly disappointed.  To be honest, the food was a bit bland.

It is similar quality as Roberto's.  Those who go to Roberto's know that you go when you're drunk or high.  Or extremely hungry and it's right there...
Actually, I think Roberto's may taste a bit better than this..
