Javier's was a bit of a mixed bag:

Service: excellent, attentive service. Our waiter was friendly and always there the moment we needed him. There was never a shortage of staff running around. That said, our food came out pretty slowly, though it was a very busy night.  Also, we still had to wait 15min for our table despite having a reservation. 

Atmosphere: the decor was really interesting, including some fascinating wood carvings and a tequila tree. Unfortunately, tables were pretty close together, and it was almost too loud to even attempt talking. 

Food: Mixed. I had carnitas which were pretty good (if a tad on the dry side). My date's strip steak was overdone and fairly bland. The queso appetizer was super delicious though! 

Overall it was a pleasant meal, but I don't know that I would go back, especially considering it was a tad pricey for what we got.
