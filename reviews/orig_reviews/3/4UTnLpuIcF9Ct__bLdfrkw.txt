Good food, nice ambiance, so-so service.

Took my bro and his wife for dinner, they had never been to Gallo. I'm not sure about you,  but when I say a spot is good, and I take new people there, I really expect and hope that my guests have a great time.

Sadly, the service at Gallo isn't the best. They used to have this amazing woman from the UK there, in addition to being super cute, she was a great server. Unfortunately, she is gone, and my time machine is broken.

We arrived at dinner around 6pm on a weeknight, and the place was about half full. It took quite a bit to get water, and a server to take drink and app orders. I ordered a beer, which for some reason took over ten minutes to arrive. I looked over at the kitchen area, and it looked like there were five employees doing sidework, and stuff that usually happens when the place is slow/empty. That's totally cool, but you would think taking care of customers would come first.

The food was good, my brother had some tacos, sister in law had a burro, I had shrimp tacos. I like the food, my guests did too, except that the chips got no love. They are pretty uninspired, cold and thick. Perhaps a new kind could be tried? The salsas are good, but the chips are like dollar theater nacho style.

Overall, I recommended this spot, the food is worth it, and hopefully the service can pick it up a bit.
