Date night & craving margaritas and something spicy...  Los dos to the rescue.  Well, almost!

We parked in back and walked through the patio- we were nicely seated and enjoyed the casual atmosphere.  The seating options are quite low budget and I felt gross for wearing a dress that didn't cover the back of my legs.  Dusty wire chairs with plastic covers or cement yard tables fill the Christmas light patio.

The "kickass" margarita was not the best- please tell me why no fresh lime???  $14 dollar drinks while perched on a dollar store seat?  The cup does not fool me.

The chip guy was on point and brought us more green salsa- which was our favorite.

I had a combination platter with a beef taco and red cheese enchilada.  The taco was not so great the meat was stringy but mushy- not shredded beef at all.  The enchilada was good with a spicy red sauce and homemade corn tortilla. 

We continue to search for delicious Mexican food in a quality setting with a real lime margarita.
