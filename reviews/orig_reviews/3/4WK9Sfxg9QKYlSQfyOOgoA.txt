My first time at On the Border and it easily fit into the clich√© that a chain is chain.  The place was clean upon entering and my buddy and I headed straight for the happy hour at the bar.  

Everyday On the Border features a "themed" happy hour ( ex. Tijuana Tuesday).  For the theme; different drinks are discounted and a few apps are half priced.  We went with a pair of Margaritas (pre machine blended) and some steak nachos.  Everything was great, however, the nachos were individually made so they were all covered in toppings, but were limited to ten chips on the plate.  Regardless, I would definitely love to check out Modelo Mondays or any of their other happy hours soon.
