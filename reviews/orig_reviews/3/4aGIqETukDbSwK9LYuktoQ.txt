I LOVE this place!! However, the service is horrible. I get takeout often. Always the same couple of items I crave. The Otro salad with shrimp is so so good and refreshing! I just can't get over the crappy service. I ask for extra salsa because I order their chips but also want some for my dressing on the salad. I was given 1 red, 1 green. This is extra?? When you eat there you get an entire squeeze bottle for crying out loud!! Ugh! Not to mention that I am often treated like I am bothering them. I have had takeout orders messed up before and always go through to make sure I don't get home without something I paid for, they seem annoyed. They always seem put off by the fact that I am there to buy their food at all. I don't eat at the restaurant itself because the service is always poor. I am close to giving up on this place and their good food. I can't continue to give my money to a place that treats me bad. There are too many great places in central Phx to frequent. I will have to go elsewhere.
