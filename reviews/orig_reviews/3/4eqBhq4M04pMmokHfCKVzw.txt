Went on a whim today at about 1pm. Seated immediately, chips salsa and drinks right away, food delivered soon after. In and out in about 40 min, maybe sooner. Hubby ordered the burrito and I got a combo, both lunch specials. Both of us were pleased. I will return and recommend this restaurant if you are in a hurry...although, I have not been here for a lunch/dinner rush.
