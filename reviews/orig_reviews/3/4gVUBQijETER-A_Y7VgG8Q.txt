Food is excellent.  We had fajitas, chicken Caesar salad, tacos, chips and theit fabulous guacole The location is very open and breezy.  Next time I'll skip the margaritas unless its happy hour.  They are definitely not worth  $10. Service was a little lacking after we said no to seconds on the margaritas.  Waters we empty for 20 minutes and my   daughter had to request a box 3 times.
