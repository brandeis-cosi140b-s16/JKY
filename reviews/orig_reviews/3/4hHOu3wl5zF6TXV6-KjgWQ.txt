Favorites here are:  Hatch chicken Especial; White Sands Chimichanga and most of the daily lunch specials.  Nice place and the food is always the same consistent quality -- good but not fantastically spectacular -- but then again that isn't a bad thing over the years. Ditto for the margaritas.  Recent visit the food was as expected but as mentioned by others below, the place needs a good cleaning!  Sometimes a mop and a few rags just isn't enough.  I'll still stop though for lunch whenever I'm in the neighborhood and don't want to deal with the 24th/Camelback crowd.
