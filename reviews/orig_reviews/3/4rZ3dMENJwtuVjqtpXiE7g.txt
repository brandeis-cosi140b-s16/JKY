For food alone I would give it 4 stars!! Food was great --- it was just everything else that was bad :( ... Service was horrible and took forever. It felt like the AC was out ... It was a birthday party and they just wanted us in and out,.,,,,, As many choices as we have on the strip we will not be back....
