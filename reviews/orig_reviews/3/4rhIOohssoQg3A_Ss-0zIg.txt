Our go-to Mexican restaurant. This great family spot serves only the freshest if Mexican cuisine. Everything is good, but the specialties are to die for! My favorite is the molcajete fajitas with flat-iron steak and chicken. The sweet cactus that supplements this fun dish is a great substitute for the normal bell peppers in fajita dishes and the presentation makes for a great conversation piece. As far as the normal Mexican food selection goes, the carnitas is what I get when I am in the mood for the more traditional meal. Always great, but getting through the door can be a challenge. 40-70 minute waits are not uncommon. Hence the ding to 3 stars.
