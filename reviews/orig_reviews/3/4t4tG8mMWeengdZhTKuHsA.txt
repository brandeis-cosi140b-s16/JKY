Taco are the new fad of Cen Pho, I can name a burrito full of new tacos places with out thinking too hard. The same is true with Macho Mach taco as the rest. Two tacos are a bit small for a meal but at roughly $3 each a third would make it a bit pricey.

Out meal included a few chips however I do not think this was standard, if it were and unlimited it may make up for the lack smaller main course.

The Fish burrito was decent a bit heavy on the cheese, despite other great reviews of the burrito it was nothing special. 

The grilled veggie burrito is one truly unique item here as it even has humus in it.  

I did appreciate the salsa bar however more chips to enjoy it with were lacking.

Overall decent place but don't go out of your way to get here.
