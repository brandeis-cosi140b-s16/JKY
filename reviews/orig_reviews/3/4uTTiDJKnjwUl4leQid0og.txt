Normally I'd like to give these guys a better score than 3 stars. But the staff here is kinda slacking. Food is always up to par, just what your looking for if you've eat'n here before. But several times I've gone in to lines of customers that aren't moving because the staff is very disorganized. I've watched them hold up 10 customers while one girl worked on a call in order of 6 meals while other staff stood around talking. Then finally washed their hands and walked over to help. The cash register is also a bottle neck. 

So food is good, service not so good.
