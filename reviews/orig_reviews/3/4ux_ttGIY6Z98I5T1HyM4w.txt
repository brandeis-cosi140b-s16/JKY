Yayo Taco needs an intervention....
As someone else has already said, "I really wanted to like this place."

The amazing decor reminiscent of an open air snack shack on a tijuana beach, the counter style service, the PRICES, the great background music selection, the LIVE music, the beer selection...I could keep going. 
If these were the only factors this would be my go to spot any time I was in the UNLV neighborhood.
But...
The food...
This is a classic example of a place trying to do too much with a simple concept, and doing it poorly.

The $5 student combo is one of the best food values in all of vegas.
4 tacos 2 sides & a drink. Unfortunately I couldn't finish a single taco. I wanted to get a nice sampling so I got 4 different tacos and after a single bit of each I kept hoping the next would be better. 
But it wasn't.
They have great intent but poor execution
The tacos are small but LOADED with meat, but the meet is in large chunks that aren't really conducive to tacos, the seasoning and sauces are poured onto the meat rather than slow cooked into the meat, and there is just too much going on with each item and there is no balance.
Ask anyone who knows me...for me to not finish a taco there has to be something very wrong with it.
Also, a warning, the drink that comes with the meal is a can of soda...so don't drink too much of it if you decide to sample the habanero hot sauce on the tacos.

My advice:
Go
Drink
Hang Out
Listen to Music
but skip the food.
