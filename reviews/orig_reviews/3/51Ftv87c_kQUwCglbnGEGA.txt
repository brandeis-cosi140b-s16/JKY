If you took out the server's attitude it would have made for a better experience. It was not appreciated and did not go with the laid-back atmosphere. Our server made it seem like she was inconvenienced to take our orders...

Beyond that, the food was good. Definitely try the brussels sprout nachos-who would've thought?! I also had the braised pork taco, grilled shrimp taco, and plantain taco. Even though they are street tacos they do a good job of packing in the flavor and quantity of food in each tortilla. Highly recommend making resies.
