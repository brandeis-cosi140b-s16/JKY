They start you out with free chips and a variety of flavorful but not spicy salsas, which was refreshing. For my entree, I ordered the mushroom mulitas, which were very flavorful. These were mushrooms done well, which I think is tough to do. There was a ton of flavor, which pretty much masked the taste of the mushrooms. My girlfriend ordered shrimp relleno tacos, which she thought were awful. There were way too many sauces and competing ingredients, which did not blend well together. The tacos were so unpleasant she wasn't even able to finish half of her entree, and she is not a picky eater. At this price point, the food shouldn't be so terrible she is unable to eat it.
