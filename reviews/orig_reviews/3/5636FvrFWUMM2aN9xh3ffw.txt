Call me when it's Mexico's Taco Shop.  

The food is fair, not great, but definitely not bad.  I've eaten there twice and while I can see some love it I just think there are far too many other options in town for fantastic Mexican food.  

The thing I find most disturbing is this margarita on tap trend that I keep seeing.  America's Taco Shop isn't the only place I've seen this.  Just the most recent.  It annoys me.  How tough is it to make a margarita?  

I'll likely be back and won't bitch about going but definitely won't be driving going past some of the other great taco places in the area to get to it.
