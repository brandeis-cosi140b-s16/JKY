For all you nacho fans out there, you'd probably want to come by and try the nachos at Nacho Daddy.  Well, except the nachos they serve with mealworms and scorpions. I wouldn't suggest that one. 

The nachos they serve are really for 2 people-- portions are quite large. I ordered the camarones diablo nachos (shrimp with a spicy salsa and tequila cream sauce) was quite tasty. I can't remember the other types of nachos the 3 other people at my table ordered, but I do remember that we all could not finish the nachos. So much! Be sure to save some room for the jalapeno cheese corn muffins they serve at the beginning. Very tasty!
