First time I ate here couple of years ago it was 5 stars worth. I just came by last weekend and it's definitely not as good as it use to be. Made a big mistake of ordering the prefixed menu chosen by the chef and it was awful. Most of the food was dry and the chicken was rubber. 

Have no idea what's happened to this restaurant. The only reason I gave it 3 stars this time is due to Manuel (our waiter) and the great Margaritas. 

Not sure if I'll be back again.
