This is a New Mexico Mexican food restaurant. I liked hearing this when I first arrived. I personally do not care for spicy food and so it may not be fair for me to leave this review because just about everything on that menu did not sound appetizing to me. I did tell the server I did not like spice and was not given any alternative suggestions. The area we sat in was extremely cold all of us were shivering. Overall the food was alright. I did like the atmosphere. I'd go again but definitely would not be my first choice.
