I finally got to try GB the other day. 

I really like the space it was cute and comfortable. 

Since it was my first time there I had hoped the staff would have been a little bit more receptive and eager to explain the menu and offer suggestions. 

I decided on 1 pork taco, a side of guacamole with NO Onions, since they say it's made to order, and a quesadilla. 

While the portions were quite small so was the price, but not the flavor. 

Everything was really delicious, but it was sad that my Guacamole had a ton of onions in it that had to pick out.

 If the waitress hadn't of waited till the end of my meal to ask me how everything was I would have complained. 

I would like to come back again and try some other things and hopefully get a little better service so I can add another star or two.
