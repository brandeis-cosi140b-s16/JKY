I am absolutely shocked to have gotten such a great enchilada at a casino restaurant. I didn't share tonight as I felt a bit greedy as I missed eating lunch today to take the kiddos to see Santa at bass pro.  But wow I am trying to find mushroom enchilada recipes now.  Great flavor in the sauce and great flavor in the carmelized onions and sliced portobellos.  Also got a cheese enchilada that was set with a green sauce which was tasty not the best I've had but not a red either which was what I ordered.  Now the rice and beans were very boring.  However the salsas they provide are better than 99% of the salsas I've had from around town.  Again I am shocked at the food we got here.  Almost makes up for the service which was slow except when it came to the check it was brought the moment I was done, I was first.  It was a few single parents and we were pretty quiet considering there was a screaming baby not too far away.  I felt we were rushed out of there and considering they didn't refill the salsa for a third time it was time to go.  Good was great service was not but I would go back.
