(Really 3.5 stars.) My husband and I thought we would try this place - keep in mind that we have just moved from Dallas, TX where Tex-Mex reigns supreme. A little unfair of a comparison? Probabl, but oh well. I got a house margaritas on the rocks - too much citrus in the margarita. Needs to be balanced out with a little bit of sweetness. I also got the Mahi Mahi tacos - not bad but not great. Decor was a little over the top in it's Mexican spirited-ness. They do have a great beer selection, which may bring us back again. They also have featured breweries and beer specials every 5 weeks or so - this week was Brooklyn Brewery, a personal favorite.
