Was referred to this bar because it hosts UofA watch parties for football games. Place was pretty busy because of Halloween weekend. Layout is nice/unique, but it was pretty cold inside.

Television set up was adequate: a UFC fight was on the same night so they split the tv's between the fight and the game. They don't have televisions set up everywhere like a sports bar (if that matters to you), but it got the job done.

Me and my buddy ordered some nachos with steak (I'd recommend splitting if you order it) and it was pretty good. Then tried the carne asada and duck tacos: i'd give the slight edge in flavor to the duck taco. All the tacos are pretty small FYI.

Service was also OK, waitress was pretty nice. I'd probably go here again.
