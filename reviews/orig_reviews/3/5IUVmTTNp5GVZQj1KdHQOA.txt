I've been to Macayo's once before a couple years ago, and it used to be a lot better. I went on a saturday night at around 8 o'clock, and there was no one there, kind of odd. We all had margaritas, which were pretty good. The food was over-priced for what you got, since it was pretty mediocre. I ordered the same thing I did last time I came and I remember it being way better before, I think they changed the recipe, bad decision. Overall, I probably would not come back here again, unless they lowered their prices.
