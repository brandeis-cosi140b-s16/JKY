The food is ok. I've had better. Good customer service.   Don't order the Agua de Tamarindo. It is watered down and looks like iced tea. It doesn't taste like tamarindo at all.  The chips, salsa and bean dip they bring you when you first sit down are good. I ordered the huevos con nopalitos. They were a little bland. The rice was good.
