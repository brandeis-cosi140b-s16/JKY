I like this place, it's good American Mexican food in a corporate chain atmosphere, and given the crowds that mill about on the weekends waiting for tables when this is a little off the beaten path compared to the national chain restaurants located down the road.  The bar mixes great drinks.  My biggest issue is that the wait can be really long, but I can understand why.
