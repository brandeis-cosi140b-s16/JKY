I have a feeling I would've liked this place better before I stopped drinking; oh well.  Ended up grabbing lunch inside as it was a windy day.  Bottom line, food was really pretty good, no complaints amongst the group and I liked my Carne Asada Burrito well enough.  It's Vegas and on the strip so it's overpriced and all, but that's to be expected.  What one shouldn't have to settle for is poor or slow service.  Lunch took well over an hour, about 2/3 of which passed after our food arrived; the waiter just disappeared.   Additionally, they seated us at the table in front of the door to the deck, which would've been find except that remember we sat INSIDE becasue of the wind.  So every time they opened the door, it would slam back against the wall and the rush of wind would blow everything off the table, Took 3-4 instances of this and a few parties complaining before they figured out not to use that door and divert to a door closer to the bar.  Better values and equally good food to be had in the Miracle Mile if you find yourself at PH.

Also, although I am not a drinker, I did use the free Maragarita with a Yelp check in to score a drink for my buddy.  This seemed to confuse both the server and the manager ( the Yelp coupon, not the Margarita). Seems like it would be a good idea to  make sure your employees know your offers on social media!
