No complaints but no accolades.  Their food is just OK.  The beans are bland but they give them to you complimentary.  The spicier salsa was ok.  We had the chicken bowl, salad and a beef enchilada.  Nothing spectacular.  Good deal if you buy the Groupon.  Otherwise, stick to the lunch specials.  Not terribly authentic.
