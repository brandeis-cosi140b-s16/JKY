Tried it out for the first time this weekend. The drinks (Agua frescas with alcohol) and food were good. I ordered a couple of tacos, and my friends also enjoyed the good (tacos and vegetarian burrito). 

However, the service was blah. They forgot an item and drink we ordered, and they arrived about 20 minutes later. So late that everyone else was done eating. There seemed to be confusion over who was managing our table- different people kept stopping by to tell us the food and drink were coming, but we continued to wait. They did credit our bill, and I'm willing to give them another shot because I liked the food and drinks.
