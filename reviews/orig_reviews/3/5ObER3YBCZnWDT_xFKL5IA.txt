The food is really expensive. They won't let you have different types of flautas in one order. The steak in the flautas is too big so when you bite into the flauta the whole chunk of meat comes out and you are left with a gross hollow thing. I ordered queso fundito, and it was a solid hard thing, not a dip, yet it came with chips? It was like solid, with the pumpkin flowers sandwiched in the middle. They didn't warn us that the prices had gone up when we ordered ahead on the phone. There's nowhere to park. It has a teeny tiny eating area. It's right on campus, so it's overly crowded all day. The good thing is if you order guacamole you get a TON of it.
