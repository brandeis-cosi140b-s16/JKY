Mad Mex and I used to be very well acquainted, possibly too acquainted considering I spent two years living in an apartment above this specific Mad Mex location (both a blessing and a curse but I digress....) I have actually only eaten at this location a few times, but I have drank many more times here, and ordered a plethora of take out to the point where I think I have sampled 95% of the menu. After sampling the majority of the menu, I really can't complain. While it's hardly authentic Mexican food, the menu options are unique and typically flavorful. Portions are large enough to leave you satisfyingly full. My absolute favorite item to order is the Kristy's big sister's red velvet quesadilla (Marinated chicken, grilled zucchini, spicy spinach, pico de gallo and Jack cheese). It's (relatively) healthy And always allows for leftovers the next day. The Carnitas quesadilla (Pork braised in beer, garlic and ancho chili rolled up in a wheat tortilla with roasted green chilis and served with slaw, pico de gallo and Jack cheese) is another stellar option and packs a bit more of a punch when it comes to the spiciness of the dish. As weird as it may sound, the coleslaw actually tastes really good when put inside the quesadilla (don't judge lol). The thai curry burrito (grilled steak, chicken, shrimp, tofu or portobello, with toasted peanuts, pineapple and Thai curry sauce. Topped with bean sprouts. Sweet-n-sour slaw) is another interesting choice I'd recommend and it packs a punch flavor wise as well. The margaritas are amazing, as fellow Yelpers have already detailed. While it may not be the most authentic or best-tasting Mexican in Pittsburgh, it's still an A-OK option in my book!
