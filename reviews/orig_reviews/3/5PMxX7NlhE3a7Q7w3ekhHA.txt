We've probably come here have a dozen times or so and each time the experience is different.  The food is about the same.  Spicier than most Mexican food places we go to but there are indicators on the menu that tell you the spice level which is nice.  The service is different depending on who you get that day.  Today's service was great.  Personable lady who made sure we had extra napkins for the little one.  Even got us a non-spicy bean dip for our toddler.  I asked the first we went there if they  had non-spicy bean dip and the waitress flat out said no so I never asked after that.  This lady was nice - and courteous - that our experience was better.

Lunch time they have pretty good deals.  I would say their food is probably on the expensive end for Mexican but you can still get a meal for 2 adults and 2 child for under $40.
