Oh, Vegas. You're such a sleaze. The sleaze knees. You know how to make everything sound raunchier than it really is.

Like tacos. Pink taco..now if that isn't a graphic innuendo, I don't know what is.

One might take it the wrong way. As in...is this a "lesbi-honest" kind of restaurant...or is it open to all orientations?

One might also upset a family from Idaho if you pass them in the halls while talking on your iPhone saying "I SO want to eat a pink taco. Or maybe THREE!! Damn, I've been craving them ALL WEEK!!"

Settle down, people, it's a tex-mex taco joint. Take away the sleazy name, and all you've got is your standard mexican fare, where the only thing that's gonna get you hot and bothered is the hot sauce. :)

Anyway, so I order the pink tacos, because I rationalize that if they're going to name the entire restaurant on one entree, it must be the fucking bomb. Well, it was 'aight. I think it tasted better than it really was, because I was in town for a work convention and I was surviving off protein bars and almonds the majority of the time. You could probably just serve me refried beans in the shape of a taco, and I would have thought that was the best meal on earth at that very moment. 

But hey, I'm not complaining. It was way more affordable and much tastier than the convention center food. Not saying it's so good I want to come back kind of good, but it does the job, the servers are nice, and the place had a chill vibe.
