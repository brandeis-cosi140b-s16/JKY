First on service:  The wait was very long and we got the feeling that we were being skipped, but we may have just been paranoid.  Once we got in, the service was fantastic.  Our waitress and accommodating and anticipated a lot of our requests.

Second on the food: Two of the three things my girlfriend and I ordered were disappointing, the third was incredible.  Lets start with the bad:  the guacamole looked very manufactured.  It effectively was a scoop of avocado (clearly scooped from a large container) with a number of other toppings (jalapeno, onion, NO tomato) scattered on top.  It took work to mix it into guacamole and still wasn't that good.  The BBQ Mahi Tacos were drowned in a white mayonaisey sauce, which was way too heavy.
On the positive side, the Tavarua were incredible.  The Wasabi was perfectly proportioned and the taste was delicate and delicious.
