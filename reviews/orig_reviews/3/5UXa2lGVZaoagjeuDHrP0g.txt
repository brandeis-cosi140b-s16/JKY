Great patio, fun music, we love taco Tuesday!  Hostess super friendly, nice and accommodating to my 8 person party, but server wasn't as friendly.  I'll give him benefit of the doubt that he was having a bad day, so he could have gotten our order right wo the smile..... I won't order the Huevos ranchero again, kinda bland, but the ceviche was crisp & refreshing.  We just partied on....
