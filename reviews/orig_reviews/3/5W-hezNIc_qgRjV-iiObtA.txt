I'm going to go ahead and echo Tonya & Cathy's reviews...here's what I found at Loco Lime:

1) The menu is pretty standard...you won't see too many risks here. You want Americanized Mexican? They have that here and it's just fine. 
2) The portions aren't as gargantuan as other Mexican restos in Charlotte. And that's fine too - but occasionally I like leftovers!
3) The flavors are a bit bland overall. This goes for the chips, salsa and chicken fajitas. Where's the heat?! 
4) Service was spot on all the way through. Friendly, efficient and helpful for beverages, chips, salsa, orders and splitting up the check. Much appreciated! 
5) The space is great - huge, comfy booths and a spacious patio.
6) The drink menu looked pretty fab, so perhaps if I need to score a margarita this will be a sweet pick. 

Overall, A-OK is a perfect description for Loco Lime.
