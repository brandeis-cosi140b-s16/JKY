Mi Patio, Mi Patio, Mi Patio...where do I begin??  I hope that Fred M's review gets pushed down to the bottom so that I look super original when I agree that the food isn't the best Mexican around, but it isn't terrible.  

We'll start with one of my favorite parts of any sit-down Mexican restaurant - the Margs.  They are exactly what you'd expect when paying $3 for a pint glass - they taste like margarita mix.  I would recommend that anyone coming here flask a little Jose to help their beverages Man-Up a little bit.

The food was reasonably priced for how much you get.  I ordered the taquitos, which came out in tin foil as normal, softshell tacos - not sure if they mixed up the order or if that's just how they prefer their taquitos, but I'm not a complainer.  The chicken was great and the beans and rice were pretty darn good too. 

Several of my companions ordered gigantic Chimis which were also really reasonable in price and came with very healthy (not literaly) amounts of guac and sour cream.  

Service was great, and I think I'd come back here if I was looking for a step up above the taco shops I so normally find myself in.  Just don't tell the owner about my secret stash of tequila!
