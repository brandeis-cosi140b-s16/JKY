Imagine Mary Smith goes to Los Dos Molinos. She leaves there saying: "Oh my gosh Fred, that food was so spicy and I could barely understand that waiter. Let's go to Cantina Laredo because it's such a nice restaurant and the grilled prime rib fajitas with asiago cheese was delicious."

Yes, this food is completely tailored toward Mary Smith and judging by the reviews below, I think you will agree with me. The menu and cooking style truly reminds you more of a seafood+steak restaurant with a Mexican flare as opposed to genuine Mexican food. It's Americanized mexican food at its finest. Their guacamole and margaritas are great. This is a good place to go for hapy hour but don't go to this place seeking good Mexican food.

Nonetheless, it has all the features that make the Mary Smiths happy in this world. It's a clean restaurant with marble and glass. The waiters all speak English well and wear uniforms with ties. The food is not hot or spicy.  I think they will even sing Happy Birthday to you and give you a free cheesecake..who knows
