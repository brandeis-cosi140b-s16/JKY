I like the people that run this place.  Really friendly and it's almost like walking into your grandmother's kitchen.  Unfortunately the cooking's not as good as grandmother's.

I came in with Angela on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty.  We ordered 4 different types of tacos.  They were all just ok.  Not amazing nor terrible.  But they are pricey.  $2.50 a taco is really pushing it.  That's what you'd pay for a gourmet taco.  What's a gourmet taco?  I don't know but if I was ordering a gourmet taco it'd be $2.50.  So I wasn't too please with the price and honestly, this alone is enough reason for me not to come back though I'd have to try something else on the menu.
