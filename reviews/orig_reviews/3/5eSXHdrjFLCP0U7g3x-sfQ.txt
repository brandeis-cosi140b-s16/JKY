The shrimp tacos were really good here. The fried fish taco, not so much. First off the chips and salsa here are pretty good.  The chips come out nice warm and salty.  The salsa has a nice spice.  The waitress was nice enough to let me order a half plate of fried shrimp tacos and fried fish taco.  I wish i got just the fried shrmp. The fish was pretty dry and flavorless, it was small and i could barely get through it.

Price isn't too bad sort of a decent cheap place to grab a meal.

One wierd thing that happened was my coworker forgot something behind and we called to check if they were in possesion of it, they put hm on hold for like 10 minutes and then just hung up on him.
