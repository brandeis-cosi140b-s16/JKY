The Yelper in me had to try the food.

The first time I visited Fiesta Mexicana was for happy hour and I have to say the margaritas were absolutely refreshing. Not only are the margaritas refreshing at Fiesta Mexicana but they are very large, very delicious, and very deadly, so be careful!

Today, the "yelper" inside me gave  into temptation and decided to go to Fiesta Mexicana for lunch after reading all the positive reviews. 

Fiesta Mexicana is vibrantly decorated with beautiful, hand-painted booths and table tops.  The menu at Fiesta Mexicana has a variety of interesting choices, so it was a challenge to narrow my selection to a single entr√©e. 

The service at Fiesta Mexicana was excellent.  Our server was fantastic. He was very nice, friendly, and  attentive.  He took the time to explain the menu to us and answered all our questions satisfactorily. My only complaint was the lack of chips that were served, the bowl wasn't even half full.  As I looked around I noticed no one was served a "full" bowl of chips. However, the chips and sauce were wonderful. 

The prices at Fiesta Mexicana are slightly higher then other Mexican food restaurants in the area, but  the portions just right. Today I had the beef flatas with sour cream and guacamole, and it was good. My lunch companions had  tacos, rice, chimi, enchilada, and they enjoyed their food. 

Lunch was enjoyable , I will visit again.
