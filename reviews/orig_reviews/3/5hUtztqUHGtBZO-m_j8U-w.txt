My first review as a part of the Yelp community! On to the most important part of yelp, the food! My girlfriend and I were craving Mexican food and decided on this place since it had good reviews. We went on a quiet Friday night and the restaurant did not seem busy. We were greeted by friendly staff and seated immediately. We received water with chips and salsa right away. The chips and salsa were tasty, but I didn't think they were among the best. Let's face it, they're free! Can't really complain about that. The waiter was friendly but he seemed to be in a huge rush despite the fact it wasn't that busy. Most places make you feel more welcomed. Overall, the service was good. 

I ordered the blue corn enchiladas and they were a simple yet appealing. Everyone has their own taste preferences but I didn't care for the black beans or enchilada sauce. The pork was slightly dry but the enchilada sauce masked it well. My girlfriend ordered the vegetable fajitas(vegetarian) and there were a few pieces of meat. We did not say anything because it wasn't a big deal. It happens! The fajitas consisted of onions and peppers, that's it! It wasn't my meal and I felt disappointed for her. I would expect a little more variety. 

To sum it up we were not disappointed but a few things could improve to boost the rating. I would not judge a restaurant entirely based of my first experience but an honest review I would give 3.5 stars to start!
