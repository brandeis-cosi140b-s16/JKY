I've stopped in here a couple times over the years and enjoyed myself at the bar.  The food is decent, although I'd say it's overpriced.  They're trying to do fancy Mexican, and the plating is fancy.  The quality however, is just OK.  They do have a decent tequila selection however, and their margaritas are pretty good for the price.  Not a bad place to grab a drink and watch some sports, but you could eat elsewhere and feel better about your dining IMO.
