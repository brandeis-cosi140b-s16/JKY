When we went the service was slow and food was forgotten.  We found out later that one of the employee's quit and the manager didn't wouldn't answer the phone so he could be nofited that the establishment was understaffed. The shrimp taco's were the only thing that were tasty.  The fish tacos were bland and dry.
