The food here is pretty good and the service is always spot on. For some reason the chips and salsa seemed a little off? Don't get me wrong, the chips were still nice and warm but they tasted old? If that makes sense? The salsa was a little more watery than I remember? I will chalk it up to an off night as it happens. I will say that their tortilla soup was great and had a nice kick to it ( although I could have definitely had a little more). The pina colada I had was decent although it tasted more like a virgin but it was still good. Will I be back, sure why not. Like I said maybe it was just an off night. :)
