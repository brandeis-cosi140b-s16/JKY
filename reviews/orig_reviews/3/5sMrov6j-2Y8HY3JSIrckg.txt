This place was cool, right off the old strip. I ordered the spinach artichoke nachos and they were out of this world. Green chips, Alfredo cheese sauce with artichokes and spinach. My friends daughter ordered hamburger nachos. This olace was very creative but mostly for happy hour or 21 over. Not family orientated.
