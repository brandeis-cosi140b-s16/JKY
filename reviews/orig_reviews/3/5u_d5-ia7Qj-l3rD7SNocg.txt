Dona Maria is pretty close to our house. I've seen a number of good reviews, and I've been wanting to try it for some time. We finally got around to trying it a few weeks ago.

The albondigas soup was pretty decent. The tortilla soup had lots of cheese but not meat. The chips and salsa were average. The chile relleno was good but not the best I've ever had. The guacamole was good but kinda runny. The chicken tamal was decent and the pork tamal was pretty good. The banana margarita was interesting/different. The chicken taco was fine as was the flan. (No, I didn't eat all of this myself. I split it with my wife and we had leftovers.)
