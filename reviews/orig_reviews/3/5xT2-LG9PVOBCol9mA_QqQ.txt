This was a great start to a night of drunken debauchery in Downtown LV. More info on that... never.

Everything here is pricey, and this is coming from the guy who was upset when Taco y Taco raised their prices at their original location from $2.00 to $2.15. It's $2.60 here at the entry level, unless you decide to try the cactus taco (I didn't). I just went ahead and did the $8.95 combination plate for three tacos (chose al pastor, adobada, and lengua) with rice and beans. I'm not quite sure if the chips were part of the deal or if we actually did get them separately for our entire group.

The food is pretty decent. I really did like the rice and beans, especially the beans. I thought the tacos were each okay, maybe the lengua being the best of the bunch. The al pastor did not come with pineapple, which was disappointing. It was also curious that there was only one tortilla per taco, not two as all the truly good places seem to use. They do offer beer, which is about par for the course downtown.

In a Container Park context, this place is most likely a solid choice. But in the Vegas taco scene, it really isn't worth making the centerpiece of your visit.
