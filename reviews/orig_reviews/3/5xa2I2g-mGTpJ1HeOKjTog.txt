As I write this review I am stuffed to capacity on delicious New Mexico Style Mexican Food. I came here after work to grab some food to go on the way home. While waiting for my takeout I was treated to some delicious chips and salsa and had an ice cold beer off the tap, the blue salsa was definitely a treat. I ordered the Chiles Rellenos stuffed with cheese served "Christmas Style." It was equally delicious and filling. I think I'll become a regular here.
