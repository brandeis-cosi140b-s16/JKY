Food is good, service is good. Is it great??? No, not really....
We had the shrimp taquitos as an appetizer it was good, I wish they had put more sauce on top.
I had the cochinita tacos, and one carne asada taco (free with yelp check in, if you order a drink)
The cochinita tacos were good, I didn't like the carne asada, it was so dry.....
My husband had the Fried Huachinango (whole fried fish), he said it was good, but had definitely had better.
