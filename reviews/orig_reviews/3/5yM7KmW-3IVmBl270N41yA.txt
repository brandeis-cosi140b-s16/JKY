I give it a 3 because it's hard to actually order something that will be good. I personally enjoy the nachos with the cochinita pibil meat. I have yet to order anything else because I've been told it isn't good. This is a place you go to when you want "Mexican" food and haven't found anywhere else. It isn't worth the price, especially since I used to get delicious nachos at vallarta for 5 dollars a plate and this place is in the double digits for nachos lol.
