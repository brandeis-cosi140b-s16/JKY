It's alright. I don't get the crazed collegiate love for this tiny taco shop. Granted it's only been open for a month or so, but since it's their third location I doubt the menu will change any time in the future and that's really my gripe. 

Carne asada and al pastor pork. 

That's it. 

They'll serve it in just about any iteration of a "tortilla + meat" that Taco Bell has dreamed up six times over, but fact is you're stuck with either carne asada or al pastor.

Needless to say the meat should be mind blowing to carry such a limited menu. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out. And I'm sorry, but $2.25 is pricey for one bitsy taco. I could almost get two tacos for the same price at my other taco dives.

The elote was also disappointing. I understand that it's "America's corn" and their spin on it, but there was zero chile or lime flavor to the corn. It was very tender but totally slathered in mayo and powdery cheese. I added some lime and chile spice with their dipping sauce, but it was still just so-so. 

I'm a taco fiend so I'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt with three stars (when I really want to give them two). And even though I'm at ASU just about every day of the week, I can't say I see myself coming back.
