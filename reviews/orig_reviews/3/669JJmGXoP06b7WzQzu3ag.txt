If all you're concerned about is the food, then I would strongly recommend going. This place has excellent authentic Mexican cuisine at an incredibly reasonable price. It was even named by USA Today as one of the Top Ten Authentic Mexican Restaurants in the U.S. So the food is great!

If you're going for the whole dining experience, I would have second thoughts. The place isn't very nice, definitely a dive, and there isn't much seating at all. The waiter struggled with English, not that there is anything wrong with that, it just makes it difficult to get a good recommendation. Last but not least, the place isn't located in the greatest area, there is limited parking and they don't have a full bar.
