This place is ok, its better than most of the other Southpoint restaurants. I'd go there again but I wouldn't be all excited over it either. The food and service is ok, acceptable to good. Never excellent in our experience. Typical Mexican fare, nothing to go out of your way for.  I heard some items do not have free refills or are too expensive so please ask all questions before ordering and do not assume anything. The lunch special is worth it, dinner isn't worth the extra cash you'll be paying.
