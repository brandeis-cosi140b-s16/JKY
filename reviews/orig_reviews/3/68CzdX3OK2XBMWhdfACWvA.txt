Our first visit, Sunday afternoon on Memorial Day weekend was excellent.  Hostess asked us if inside was ok as the patio was full and then proceeded to take us to the very back of the restaurant.  I asked if we could sit at an empty table just inside but with a nice outside view.  Our server greeted us right away and told us about Happy Hour and returned with two cold beers and took our order for Gorditas and Carnitas.  Both arrived promptly and were delicious.  Our table was the perfect spot to watch the Memorial Day crowds pass by and our server looked after us with efficient enthusiasm.  We had such a good experience that we decided to visit again two days later for Happy Hour and bottomless chip and salsa.  The second visit was the exact opposite of the first.  The hostess seated us in almost the exact spot where we proceeded to wait and wait for our server.  Waiters/waitresses, busboys and even the manager buzzed around us for almost fifteen minutes chatting and socializing amongst themselves before one waitress asked if we had been served.  She took our order for beer and chips and salsa which arrived shortly and then disappeared.  It was obvious that she took pity on us at the start and served us although her  section was clearly in the back of the restaurant. Service was terrible and it would have been easy to walk out without paying. No one would have noticed.  So for food, alcohol and atmosphere we would recommend a visit although service might be hit and miss.
