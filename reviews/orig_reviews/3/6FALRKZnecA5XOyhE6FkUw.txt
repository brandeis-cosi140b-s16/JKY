Food average. 
Service average.

We came in on a friday night thinking happy hour was until 7pm. It was a quarter after 6. I guess it actually changed to 6pm but the manager said in a tone that sounded like he was a little annoyed by us that he'll give to us. Yet, on all the table signs it said 7pm... Maybe try removing your old signage before announcing the new times? So that made things a little awkward. 

The waiter was nice. He kept up with our orders and requests. The food on the other hand...Let's just say if you've NEVER had tacos before in your entire life, Urban Tacos would probably be a decent place. If you have had authentic tacos before, only come here as a last resort. The tacos looked pretty but tasted ehh. The octopus taco was good, a bit chewy. I couldn't really tell the difference taste-wise between the pork and chicken. Actually, it tasted like all the meat was cooked the exact same way so it all tasted very similar (I ordered one of each street taco). I'm glad we got the HH price be cause I wouldn't pay a penny more. Also, how the heck can this place serve tacos and not have REGULAR red or green salsa????? It's crema this or Chipotle that. No.
