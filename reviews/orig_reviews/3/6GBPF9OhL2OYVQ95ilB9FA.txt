The crowd here is definitely on the younger side. It looked to be filled with students, recent graduates, and young professionals. I think one of the main draws is the roof-top patio. It seems like a pleasant place for warm weather. In the winter, the patio is tented with space-heaters throughout preserving it as a cool place to hang out.

The guacamole and chips were okay. These days, everyone is a self-proclaimed guacamole connoisseur, so it's hard for restaurants to make guac which pleases every customer.
