This was totally unexpectedly delicious!! I ordered the fajitas and now I crave them all the time!! Anytime my husband or I get fajitas anywhere else, we compare them to Baja Joe's. So far none of them have lived up to them! My mom and husband didn't love their meals, but they both loved my fajitas. The atmosphere is definitely casual and has some interesting wall murals. I would've eaten outside, but there was smoking allowed on the patio.
