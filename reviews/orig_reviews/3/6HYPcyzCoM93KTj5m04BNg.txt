Picked up the carne asada fries here.  First time I have ever had this Mexican fast food delicacy.  They were pretty good!  The portion is very large, they use shredded cheese (not nacho cheese sauce), and the ground beef is seasoned, though it's a bit chewy/fatty with some gristle occasionally.  The fries were hot and crispy.  Dining companion got the chimichanga combo and said it was good.  I've only been to the Chandler location before, so it's good to know this Tempe location is okay too.  The atmosphere is pretty nonexistent, and there aren't even any booths (but there are a claw machine, Pac-Man, and sticker coin machines) but that's okay.  The food is what's important!  I did notice that the prices are much higher than I remember the prices the Chandler one had a few years ago.

Stomach was a little "ugh, that was greasy" feeling after, but could've been much worse.  Debating between two and three stars and going to go with three for their hours and order accuracy (I've had to get my order redone multiple times at Los Tacquitos so I was very happy it was correct the first time here).
