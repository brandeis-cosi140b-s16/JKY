Nice Mexican restaurant

The vibe seemed authentic inside the restaurant. The staff was nice

The food was decent but not amazingly delicious.

I had the Queso Fundido which was interesting because it had cactus. It tasted like green peppers

The Carne Tampiquena had shrimp that was overcooked and did not taste good.

The camaron al mojo is the sirloin, it was decent but not too special.

i would recommend someone to come if they haven't had Mexican fishes before. But for someone who has Mexican food often, I would not recommend.
