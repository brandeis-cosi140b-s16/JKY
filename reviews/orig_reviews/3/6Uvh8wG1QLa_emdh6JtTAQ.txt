My first International Supper Club!
I think we overwhelmed the kitchen - everything was just a bit off.

Granted - it's not a huge restaurant - and I think having a group of 20 something people arrive and order at once would throw any small, independent restaurant off. 

Service was as friendly as could be - but it is difficult for 2 servers to handle 20 hungry and thirsty patrons. Arrival of dinners was poorly spaced - by the time the last person got her plate, the first people were done. Sides and tortillas came very late. The food itself was somewhere between decent and good. I have no complaints, but wasn't really wowed by anything I tried.

I can see the diamond in the rough quality here - and I have friends that love it - so I will be back with just a small group (4 tops) to see what a "normal" dinner is like.
