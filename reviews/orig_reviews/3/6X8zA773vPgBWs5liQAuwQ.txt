We hadn't been here for a couple of years. The couple we went with hadn't either. We were all a little disappointed. We remembered it fondly and it didn't meet our expectations. Time passes and things change... 
The hostess was very friendly and helpful in getting us seated and equipped with menus. An assistant dropped chips and salsa immediately.   After a few minutes a waiter came by to ask if we had been helped and took drink orders when we said we had not. We then waited for what seemed like a long time for beverages, including water. After we received our table side guacamole, one friend asked for more chips. The waiter first moved my chips across the table but after that move we did get another basket. I ordered a glass of wine to go with my entree. It arrived several minutes late. In fairness to the waiter, I don't know if there was enough staff for the 40 or 50 diners who were seated in the half hour after we arrived. He did check on us after we got our food. 
I ordered the dish I have ordered several times in the past ten years. It was "hotter" than in the past, hard to eat. One friend couldn't get through her meal due to heavy handed use of chiles. My wife wasn't impressed with her entree salad. The guacamole is always good. We didn't have dessert. I had the CasaRita and it was as good as I remembered.  The wine list isn't long but is adequate. Prices seem a little high but are not up too much and this is a nice restaurant.
