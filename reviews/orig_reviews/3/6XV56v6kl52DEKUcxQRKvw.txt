So I had lunch here today. I guess I was not disappointed, but at the same time it was not overly memorable. I just cant get my head around going to a mexican restaurant and paying for chips and salsa.... I also dont like colored chips.... Call me traditional.... I had the pork tacos.... average.... I dont know, the place is not terrible in my opinion, but there are too many good restaurants around here to spend $25 a head to eat average tacos and chips and salsa.....
