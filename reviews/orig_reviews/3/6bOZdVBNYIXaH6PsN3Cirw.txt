WOW! Asian Mexican restaurant. ..who would have ever thought of this? Well it is what it is and it's ok. . Had the Jerk chicken and something else for a reasonable price. ..nothing to write home about that's for sure. .. you get to choose Asian or Mexican dishes and even combine them if you wish but for all is worth it ain't much to get excited over. .. just another hole in the wall place hasn't been remodeled since the day they opened I guess
