--Make sure that if it's your first time in the restaurant, you need to tell them so.  They will give you a free sampling of their various ingredients to help you decide on what you want to order.

They have various asian and mexican inspired meats and rices, which you can order in various ways (i.e., in a burrito, quesadilla, a la carte).  Their jade chicken and black beans are really good.  The other items that I ordered were just OK.  The food is pretty greasy and unhealthy, but it will fill you up and leave you satisfied for sure.  You even get a free cookie with your meal which is a nice touch.

The building itself is located in a tiny strip mall which isn't very inviting, and the inside is a little dirty, but don't let that scare you away.  The place is so unique that it is still worth checking out at least once.
