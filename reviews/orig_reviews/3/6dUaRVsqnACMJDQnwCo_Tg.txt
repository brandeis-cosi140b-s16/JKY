My mother loves this place.  She's 71.  'Nuff said.  But seriously, this place is okay.  I don't mind eating here when my mother asks me for it, but I highly doubt I would come here of my own free will.  Although the food is okay, it's not something I'll crave on a regular basis.  Still, good eats with mama is always nice.

When we eat here my mother raves about their chile relleno.  I'm more in to the whole fresh chips and salsa (which is free) with an order of queso fundido.  I also stick to the pork tacos with their hot salsa.  That's always fine.

Not bad for an uber-Mexican themed restaurant.
