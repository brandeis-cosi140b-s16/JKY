Located in the old Round Corner Hotel at the corner of 38th and Butler in Lawrenceville, the restaurant has an ambiance that would be impossible to create in a more modern building. The space is something of a maze, with tiny room upon tiny room separated by tiny staircases and finally culminating in a large outdoor patio. (Think the Seinfeld episode where Kramer built the levels in his apartment.) The decor doesn't seem to have changed since the hotel's heyday, but in a good way, with ancient floral wallpaper and creaky wood floors creating a romantic, mysterious atmosphere.

Outside the ambiance is more cantina and less film noir, which is appropriate enough, Round Corner being a Mexican restaurant and all. The place is a veritable hipster paradise where the drink menu is twice as large as the food menu, everything is served in mason jars, and two tacos cost less than $10. As far as the quality of food, the guacamole is fresh made and out of this world, and my companions liked their tacos well enough. Unfortunately I ordered the enmolidas, chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, and they were basically inedible. I have never in my life had anything so salty. It was bizarre and truly disgusting, and so disappointing, since everything else about Round Corner is great. Let this serve as a cautionary tale: go to Round Corner Cantina, get some guacamole and a margarita, DO NOT under any circumstances order the enmoladas!
