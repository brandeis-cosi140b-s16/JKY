I really wanted street tacos and I didn't think that I had been to Los Favoritos before so I stopped here on my way home a few nights ago. I walked in and the person at the counter was taking a call so I patiently waited for a few minutes. I had a change of pace and decided to get a burrito instead of tacos with some horchata. Waited not too long and I got my order. Once I got home and started eating, I realized that I didn't think that I had been there before because it's pretty forgettable. Maybe I'm not getting the right thing? But I can think of a few places that are better for the price.
