As a huge fan of Dan Maldonado's Tacos Atoyac, I was very excited to see him open a new shop. So today I tried Mucho Macho Taco and came away very disappointed. 

Parking is definitely an issue here. If you're not lucky enough to snag one of the few spots then you can park across the street at Sylvia's as their lot is semi-empty (for good reason).

I tried the bacon, braised brisket, and crispy fish tacos and a side of super tots. Why haven't I had a bacon taco before?!?!? It was wonderful with thick crispy and chewy chunks of bacon. The brisket taco was good but runny. The fish taco was a huge disappointment. I'm not sure if it's the same farm-raised basa that Dan used at Atoyac, but the fish in my taco was overcooked, small, and flavorless. And it had shredded yellow cheese on it? I love cheese but not on my fish taco please.

I also got a side of the super tots. Who doesn't love tater tots? These were very greasy and had a little shredded cheese and maybe a tablespoon of pico on the top. Will not order those again.

I will definitely go back to try other things. I like that they have a self-serve soda fountain, salsa bar, and you actually get chips now. Big pluses. 

I sincerely want my next rating to be 5 stars. Dan is such a nice guy. I hope my experience today will be the exception and not the rule.
