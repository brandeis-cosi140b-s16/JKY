would be a 5 star if this was review was soley based on their $3.50 margarita happy hour specials! Pretty good prickly pear margaritas however a tad "syrupy" for me. The mexican pizza is enough to feed an army....seriously not your Taco Bell small pizzas by any stretch of the imagination!! Good chips and salsa with a bite!
