Like many of the Las Vegas out door eateries I find that I'm drawn towards them like moths to flames.... tall alcoholic flames....(if you think about it, that's really dangerous)... 

I spend a lot of time at the PH and I've never been to Cabo Wabo, but I think that I'll be coming back here more often because their food is really really good. 

The thing I didn't like is even though I was outside I still had to yell at the people I was with to have a conversation... It's a restaurant NOT a club, and no amount of loud music and skimpy outfits can make it so...well maybe more skimpy clothing maybe....

Check back later to see how many check in's I actually have on it as well as a re-review in June after the Miss USA beauty pageant comes through.

Enjoy!
