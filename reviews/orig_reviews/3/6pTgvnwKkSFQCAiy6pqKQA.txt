This is a review of the bar only. 

The margaritas are good, handmade with fresh lime juice, which I like. My husband and I are not fans of the syrupy store bought mix margaritas. The only downside is the price, the margaritas are good, but they are not that good! I love a bar that serves up great drinks, but when they price gouge, it's kind of buzz kill!
