This places goes a good job in terms of appearance; a colorful memorable place in the middle of a desert city.  It really stands out on Camelback as a unique tourist stop and I've always wanted to stop by.

Well, many visits later and with many other people. I really like coming here for the food and convenience of easy entrance and exit. I order the same tacos all the time.  Although my food choise is very limited, it does taste consistent. The tacos are a bit on the salty side. The ingredients used are natural and a cabbage tasted like a cabbage; doesn't have any of those voodoo science chemicals or extenders or enhancers, like at those corporate chain places.... Each 2 Hippie Place in Phoenix seems to have it's own theme of in terms of menu focus; this place being Tacos and Mexican food and a very low price...

This place's food offering does meet my expectation. A low key, relax place to enjoy your food. The product design of the place says it's ok to have food that is not the most spectacular. A salty taco is not a disappointment to me at a place like this, although it will be at a place like Ticos....

I like the fact that they have a very focused menu selection which I think is a strength for a business(like INNOut). If I wanted hamburgers, I can go their other "Hippy" spot a block way. But I like to see the place surprise me by possible making some improvements on their focused menu by refining their food taste. The place looks more slightly attractive than the food...Form over Function...
