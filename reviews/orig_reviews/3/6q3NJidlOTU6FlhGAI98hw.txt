You know, I like the food and the salsa here.  Chips come out very hot and the salsa is yummy.  The bummer is that their margaritas are terrible.  We ordered a top shelf margarita and it was one of the worst I'd ever had.  Their prices are really very high for what you get and I'm really surprised its as crowded as I've seen it.  I'm wondering if its the fact that President Bush ate here?  Does nothing for me but maybe for someone else??

If they had better margaritas, I'd probably go back but truly nothing out of this world...
