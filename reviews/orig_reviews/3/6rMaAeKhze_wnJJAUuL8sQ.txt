Read all the mixed reviews but decided to give it a try.

The steak quesadilla was pretty good, it did require the use of the fantastic chimichurri sauce and with some of the habenero sauce it was quite tasty.

The steak enchiladas missed some how, lacked much taste, the rice was ok, the beans lacked any flavor.

The Habenero Chicken really missed, the suace it self was fine but the chicken was cooked without any seasoning at all, just plain chicken covered in sauce.  Once it was salt & peppered and covered in the chimichurri sauce it was ok.

All in all too expensive for tasteless food.  Ambiance was good so maybe I'd go back for drinks but not to eat.
