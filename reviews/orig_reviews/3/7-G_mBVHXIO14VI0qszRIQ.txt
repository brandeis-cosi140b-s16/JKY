This place is all right. I really can't complain; food was decent, our server was amazing, knowledgeable, and had good and obviously heartfelt suggestions for both our table and another.

The prices are a little high, but I think it's overhead (given the fancy interior, Scottsdale location, full bar, and number of employees). The food seems to be high-quality, as well. All I'm saying is that you can get comparable food (Mexican) elsewhere for cheaper.

Still, a good place.
