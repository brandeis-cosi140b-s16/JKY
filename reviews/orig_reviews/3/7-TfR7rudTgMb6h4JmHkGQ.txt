I think I need to give this place another try. From all the fantastic Yelp reviews I expected to LOVE it...but service and some mix ups with our order kinda put a damper on things. 

Our waitress was admittedly brand new and had only tried 1-2 things on the menu, so she couldn't really anwser any of our questions about the dishes. 

A few minutes after putting in our order we were told the kitchen ran out of bolillo rolls for the Torta Ahogada. We ended up substituting it with a Portuguese roll (tasted very similar to a bolillo). When our food did come out the tacos were on flour tortillas (yuk) and not corn like we asked for and the torta was NOT ahogada (drowned) like we specifically asked for. 

However everything tasted great! Drinks were strong and delicious. Guacamole was fresh and a great price. The Mahi had a great flavor and I really liked the pickled veggies that came with the torta. 

Like I said I will def give this place another try! I think we just had some bad luck with a new server and the kitchen not being prepared for busy weekend.
