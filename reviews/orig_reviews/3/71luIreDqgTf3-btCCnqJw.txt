One of my must stop at least once places when I visit Vegas.  It is located in Bally's casino, towards the restaurant area past the 'Indigo Lounge' area.

NOTE:  My review only covers the all day $2.00 specials for the Tacos, Margaritas, Modelo Drafts and Tequila Shots

This place can be full and very busy depending on time of day, etc.  I always have a few of the $2.00 tacos, which come either in Chicken or Beef with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and cheese.  Don't expect some crazy gourmet tacos that some of the other reviewers seem to be expecting, this is Vegas after all.  For my expectations the food I have had from the specials is good, and very filing.  I have had the chips and salsa from the menu, the salsa is spicy but can be salty as well.  The $2 margaritas can be sweet, and the $2 Modelo's can go down pretty fast.  

The service can be up or down depending on if it is busy or not, I've tended to visit here mid afternoon.  Overall, I can't complain, the food specials are inexpensive and the drinks are cold, this is a good place to grab a bite to eat before heading out to explore.
