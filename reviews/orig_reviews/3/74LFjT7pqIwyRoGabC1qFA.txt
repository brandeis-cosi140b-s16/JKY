Went through the drive-thru for a solo dinner and got the carne asada tacos (3 street style soft corn tacos) with rice and beans. The woman at the drive through spotted me the few cents because my bill was uneven which was very nice and unnecessary.
Everything was very good and fresh, though the meat was a little spicier than I anticipated with chunks of jalape√±os. There was also fresh tomato on everything if you're not a fan like me. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped from the great reviews but it wasn't bad. I guess I'm just a 'bertos kind of gringo when it comes to fast Mexican food.
