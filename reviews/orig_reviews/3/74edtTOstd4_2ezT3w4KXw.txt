We decided to check out ISLA for happy hour. The bar area had a good share of seats at the bar and a few lounge tables.  The drinks were decent - $4 Modelo drafts and $5 margaritas. The happy hour menu had a a nice array of choices all for $6.

We opted for 2 margaritas and an order of guac.  The guacamole was fresh and the chips were warm.  It doesn't look like much, but it was delicious.

The service was decent and the atmosphere in the bar area was nice.  My only complaint is that the lounge seats are up against a divide which looks out to the casino.  In general it's fine - but a small tour group came by and stood next to our table and oogled at our eats.  Not cool.
