I went to Moreno's with my family around 3:00, hoping to avoid the busy rush.  The food was great.  No complaints at all.  However, the wait staff were horrible.  Some of the staff must have gotten off.  The took up two of the four booths to sit and talk.  They were distracting the other staff that were working, they were loud, and were playing videos of a screaming infant on their phones that were so loud they were distracting to the customers.  Until the end when one of the new in coming staff waited on us, we were pretty much ignored.  Then the last waitress was very attentive getting us refills on our drinks before we even requested more and very friendly.  If the owners would not allow their staff to hang out in the dining area after the get off, would likely earn them two more stars from this customer and her family.
