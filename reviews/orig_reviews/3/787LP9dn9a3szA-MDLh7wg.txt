drove to the hood today (washington and decatur)  to try komex. upon arriving i thought it was a fast food joint but realizing it was actually a sit down place. my first thought was this place is classy. Food i ordered and tried was bulgogi, chicken and pork tacos. my favorite was the bulgogi my least favorite was the pork. the flavor of the tacos were good just wished the tortilla was a little bigger. I also tried the bulgogi french fries. the fries were ok...its just basically soggy fries, cheese and bulgogi. and then korean sauce poured all over it. i definitely wouldnt get them again. i dont think id drive to komex unless i was close to it. if i did the only thing id order again is the tacos.
