Tasty Mexican street cooking but I have to take away a star for the pasty canned tasting beans, and the not-so-fresh fish tacos. I can say that Rubios makes a really fresh taco surprisingly for a fast food type place. The rice was moist and had a really peppery taste which I preferred but you may not. The fish tasted oily like it had been sitting aside in its cold, oily fried batter and then fried again in not so very fresh oil. 

Since I have been cooking this type of food since I was 5, I can safely gauge that this was acceptable Mexican food but that's it. I would probably return here to try something else, perhaps fish tacos are not their thing.
