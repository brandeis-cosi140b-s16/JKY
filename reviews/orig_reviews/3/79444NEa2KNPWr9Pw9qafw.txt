My boyfriend and I have eaten at this place a few times now.  We usually sit at the bar and enjoy a pitcher of margaritas.  The service can be hit or miss.  Our first time in we really enjoyed out service and the next few times we were a bit disappointed.  The Silverton is very close to us, so eating at Mi Casa is an easy place for us to stop in... we love to enjoy our food, although we do not always have huge appetites, we usually start with an appetizer to share followed by one of two small street tacos.

Overall, this is a convenient place to stop in, the value is good, the restaurant is clean, and plenty of tv's for watching sports.... we will be back to visit!
