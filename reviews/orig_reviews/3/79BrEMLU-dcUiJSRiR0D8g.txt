Went there about a week ago on a Saturday night with a party of six. We had to wait around 30 mins or so for a table.  Although the food took a long time to reach the table, the server was very good and checked on us frequently.  Management stopped by to apologize too.  We were having a good time so the wait wasn't a big deal. It was extremely crowded. The chips and salsa were good and picante. The food was just ok. Nothing special. I had a roasted chicken burrito.  Chuy's is a good place if you want to hang out with some friends and have something to eat  but if you want a good Mexican meal, look elsewhere.
