I decided to meet a friend for an evening gab fest and since the new location opened I hadn't had the chance to check it out. Faux mexican food is not something I tolerate well and after trying to like the food at Mad Mex it was always a big fail for me. Chips and Salsa are about all I can handle here. IMO the food has way too many chillis in the sauces so there is a lack of seasoning because all I can taste is the heat. I am a big fan of spicy food but this is different.

Location, location, location! This place was filled to the brim with the Shadyside crowd! Highland ave has all sorts of little furniture stores and an art gallery to window shop at while walking up. 

Luckily I had already eaten before so I wasn't hungry. Just because the food doesn't do it for me, that doesn't mean they can't get me in the door with their Giant margaritas and Happy hour specials! Blue salt and a little too sweet but oh so refreshing after a long day!  I asked the bartender if it was always so busy and she said since they opened they are "slammed" every night. Stupendous people watching! 

The best part about this new spot is that it will have a rooftop deck! I'm so excited and so close to my house! My group will be regulars, I can guarantee. I bet Cinco de Mayo will be a crazy time! Viva la Vida!
