Would have gotten 4 stars if we hadn't had the least attentive waiter in existence.  The food was really good.  I got the special Chicken empandas.  My dad got the skirt steak.  The empanadas had a good flavor, but the weren't as crispy as I had hoped.  My dad's skirt steak was fantastic.  The waiter did not pay attention to anything we said, and was inattentive to fill up drinks and take plates away.
