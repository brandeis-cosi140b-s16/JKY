I ordered the tortilla soup, it was delicious. The food is very pricey, but this is to be expected in Las Vegas. Only go here if you first purchase the coupon from Restaurants.com. 

There were four of us, we each ordered an entree and one alcoholic beverage. The total AFTER the coupon, which included the tip, was 84 dollars. After the coupon... Yep.

The only reason this place did not get four stars was because the server seemed very awkward, she was unsure of what certain ingredients were, she kind of just stood there and stared at us for extended periods of time. Then she came back and asked if she could bring us some chips and salsa while we waited for our food. We saw several other tables with the chips and salsa and assumed it was a courtesy, free, item.  It was not, and the server did not specify this, we were NOT pleased. It is generally expected in restaurants that serve chips and salsa that they are complimentary. Chevy's as well as any other Mexican or Tex-mex style restaurant I've ever been too - they have been complimentary. Luckily, the coupon included the tip to the server because the amount I would have given her dropped significantly after I saw that on the bill. I noticed other reviewers saying the chips and salsa were complimentary, that must have changed because we were definitely charged for them.

Either way, the food was good, just make sure you know what you're getting "offered" when you go in there.
