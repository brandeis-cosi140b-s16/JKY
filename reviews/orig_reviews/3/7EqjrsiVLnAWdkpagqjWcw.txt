I wanted to be blown away by a gourmet taco shop, but sadly I live in Southern California, and when you live there being amazed by tacos take A LOT. I definitely recommend this place, but it doesn't have the WOW factor.

The Pros:
Awesome Salsa Bar - about a dozen delicious salsas. The regular Mexican salsa was flavorful and spicy. Some nice rare options too.
Service - Our server was very nice and attentive.
The Al Pastor - I tried the premium carne asada, fish taco, and al pastor. This is the only one I would go back for - great taste and tender pork.

The Cons:
Price - Like double the price of what I'm used to paying for any kind of taco.
Pepsi brand soda - Hells to the no!! and they didn't have Mexican coke either (they were apparently out).
Bleh on the fish taco - again, I am spoiled because I only eat fish tacos in Baja, but the batter was very soggy and bland.

Small place and tight parking but it wasn't crowded on a Sunday.
