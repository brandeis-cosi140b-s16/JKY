I take exception to Brian P's review below. While he is indeed correct as to the abhorrent state of the chicken, this place does a disservice to the sacred Arizona cheese crisp. The "cheese crisps" come folded, lowering them to the pedestrian level of your run of the mill quesodilla. 3 out of 5, would not cheese crisp again.
