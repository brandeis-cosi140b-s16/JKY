Great Concept! Great Atmosphere! Great Food! Service can be hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, Täkō is one of my favorite restaurants and for a lot of other people as well. They problem is, some of the wait staff know that. There's this short little man that works the door and suffers from little man syndrome. You can tell he enjoys telling people that they're all booked up, or some other thing that allows him to go off on a power trip and if you call to make a reservation the rarely answer the phone unless it's to tell you there all booked up. God forbid they offer the next available date that's open. TIP: book your reservation through Yelp so you don't have to deal with the door man or the condescending hostess on the phone. If you can request a section, I would recommend Katie's or Ryan's section. Brandon can be a hit or miss, sometimes he's very friendly and other times he can really throw a world class temper tantrum at your table. If you do get in and you mange to make it past the little man up front, I'd recommend starting off with a drink. The Oxacan Old Fashioned is my favorite but the spicy cucumber is a big hit as well. For apps the Mexican street corn will blow your mind. Always pay attention to the specials menu they give you when seated. The menu changes all the time but by far and away my favorite Taco's have come from this menu.

When some new places open up and Täkō's demand goes down, and the staff turns over a bit, this place will be unbelievable.
