New Mexico cuisine is world class.  if you haven't been to Albuquerque and eaten stacked enchiladas you're missing a truly awesome culinary experience.  Chile Addiction is the best New Mexico cuisine in Las Vegas (sorry Carlito's).  That being said, the chile could use some tweaking.  The red has good chile flavor but it could use some Mexican oregano, cumino and a little more salt.  It may be worthwhile to upgrade from bueno too.  No big complaints with the green and, in fact, the pork verde is very good.  The pinto beans also suffer from a lack of seasoning.  I like a few cloves of garlic thrown in while they are cooking and finished with lard and plenty of salt.  Sopapillas are very good.  Can't wait til they get some beer in there.  Service can be a little "scatterbrained" but it just adds to the authenticity.
