I ordered a taco salad and was surprised by how huge the portion was. It's a typical taco salad tossed with shredded nachos, Chedder cheese, and guacamole..nothing extraordinary. But if you're looking for a quick, non-fast food and inexpensive place to eat by the Strip, this would be a good place to stop by.
