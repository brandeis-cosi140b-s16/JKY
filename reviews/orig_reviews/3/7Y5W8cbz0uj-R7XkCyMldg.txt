The place overall is not bad. Service was great which you usually don't see in Eastern European places. The restaurant really has identity crisis though (serves Russian, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, and even has edamame on the menu and Spanish matedor pictures on the wall). Based on decor, name, and staff, they gear towards Russian customers but have very limited Russian menu. We mostly ordered Russian food. It was good but not great with meat in pelmeni a little chewy and not as tender I like. I could go on but all else would be gravy...which likely could be found on the menu
