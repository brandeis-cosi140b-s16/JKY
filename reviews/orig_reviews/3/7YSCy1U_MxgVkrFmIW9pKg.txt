Looking over the other reviews, I'm the odd man out for once. When we sat down the table and the menus were sticky, like a margarita had spilled and only been half cleaned up. I guess I can over look that, but things didn't get much better. 
The people working were so so so so nice! But the food was disappointing. Inside felt like a classier TGIFridays with a sombrero. 
I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, having grown up in the southwest I consider myself to be kind of a Mexican food snob. I've even been to Mexico City, but I don't remember food like this. 
I enjoyed the salsa. The special was pretty nice, 2 drinks (non-alcholic), 2 salads, and 2 entrees for $20. But I don't think I'll hurry back.
