This is pretty decent Mexican food. You have to remember, this is a chain restaurant, so if you're looking for authentic Mexican (though I must say, most authentic stuff I have had wasn't anything to brag about), this isn't the place for you. But if you want to get a taco and beans and a margarita, stop on in. The back patio is nice when it's cooler out.
