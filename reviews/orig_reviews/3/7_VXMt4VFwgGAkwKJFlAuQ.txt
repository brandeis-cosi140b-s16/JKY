One of the first things I must do as a new Las Vegas resident is to find the best burrito in town, and after visiting KoMex, unfortunately, I will have to continue the hunt.

While the fusion quesadilla is one of the best I've had, the bulgogi burrito, while unique, lacks enough meat and is overstuffed with rice and veggies. Even with tampering with the ingredients, I still feel like it's missing something...
