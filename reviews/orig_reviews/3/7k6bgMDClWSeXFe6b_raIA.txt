If I could give El Hefe 3.5 stars I would. This bar seems to be one of those places where you can expect a certain type of crowd. It's like a middle ground between The Lodge and Dos Gringos. 

On a regular Friday or Saturday night El Hefe is a good place to get a quick drink or to just hang out. There always seems to be somewhere you can sit down or hang out at this place, unlike some other bars. 

I also went here on NYE and it was very fun. Paid a cover charge and then drinks were a penny all night. 

The vibe of the bar is half undergrad Spring Break, half an episode of Miami Ink. However, the service is good and the drinks are strong. Don't let the D-bag outer layer deter you for giving El Hefe a shot. I have yet to try the food, but I am doubtful with all of the options in Old Town I would ever choose to come to El Hefe for their food.
