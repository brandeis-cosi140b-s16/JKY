We went to dinner here the other night. I'm giving it a generous 3 only b/c the mango salad and the desserts were amazing. 
On he other hand we weren't very happy with a couple things, but we made the best of it. The guacamole was good but was too heavy on the onions. The meals themselves were ok but not great. I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It was not very good bc of the mole sauce. The waiter told us that the mole sauce was sweet and that's why we got the entree, it was not sweet it was just blah with no real flavor. 
As I said the desserts were really good and amazing, we tried them all. Unfortunately before we left we used the restroom and it was very dirty and a mess. One toilet had (a mess), there where no toilet seat protectors and there was paper towels on the floor buy the sink. 
We wanted to try this restaurant b/c I read good reviews on it and my family wanted to go. So we tried it, but we will likely not be going back. With all of the restaurants choices especially around in that area we were hoping for a little more.
