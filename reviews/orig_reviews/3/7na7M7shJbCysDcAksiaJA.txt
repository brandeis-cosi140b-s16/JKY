Tacos on Tuesday tour continues at this place normally frequented mostly by tourists and hotel guests. Not really my price point at most times, but the tacos were priced right. They don't let you get steak, so it's either fish, mushroom or chicken or pork for $2 each. The chicken was tinga style, but they did not drain the liquid and the sauce saturated the tacos since they were only dealing with a single corn tortilla. The radish on top was not needed really, but overall if they would double wrap the tacos, it could be a solid Tuesday spot. The chips and guac were 6 bucks and the exciting part was the silver bowls that were angled and could stand up facing the person eating. This was a solid version of guacamole and sprinkled with Oaxaca cheese made it even more tasty. The patio is nice, but the hostess stand is on the other side in the hotel, which is confusing if you enter from the opposite side.
