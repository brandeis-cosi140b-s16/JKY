When I came to Pepe's I was undoubtedly hangry!  I just got off of a plane from Colorado and was headed home.  I've seen Pepe's on the way home many times but this was my first time here.  The restaurant is an order at the counter and sit down kind of place.  It was early in the morning but they were serving everything which was already a plus!  I ordered 2 tacos, one carne asada and one el pastor.  The meal also came with complimentary chips and re-fried beans to dip it in. These are more street type tacos so don't expect a large tortilla with all the fixins.  Each taco came with meat, onions, and cilantro.  The carne asada was juicy and had a great steak taste to it.  The el pastor was seasoned to perfection but like some have said it was a little bit dry.  I haven't tried much from here yet so I'm going to give Pepe's 3 stars for taste, price, and aesthetics of the location.  I'll have to come again and try something different.
