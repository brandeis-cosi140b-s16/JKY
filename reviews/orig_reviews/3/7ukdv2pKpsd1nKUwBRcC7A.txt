This is 1 of my sister's favor8 places but not quite mine. She luvs spicy, me not so much (a li'l kick does me fine, but more than that kick's my (_y_) & there's not much 4 those like me 2 select from off their menu). Most everything including entrees & appetizers has their sign8ture hatch chili's in/on it which is just 2 much 4 me.

   Last time we went here 4 her B~day celebr8ion she didn't touch anything on her pl8 but took it home 4 l8r. She was more focused on nursing her gargantuan margaritas so her fascin8ion may also b w/ the drink specials.

   I ordered some breaded mushrooms, a side of guacamole 2 go w/ my chips & had the spinach enchiladas w/ a chile rellano side. The chips w/ guac & bean dip were actually the best of what I had. Mushrooms were ok but over~fried & bland, the enchiladas were good but WAY 2 Salty & the rellano was drenched in sauce that tasted kinda fishy 4 some reason (perhaps cross contamin8ion) which was unexpected & not the most complimentary flavors 2gether but still decent.

   Our w8er kept missing details & tho I know he was busy & seemed nice 4 the most part, he still could have made things a bit better knowing we were there 4 a special occasion. We ordered a special sopapilla churro dessert they were promoting 4 my sister because we wanted 2 c her @ least eat (instead of drink) something. It showed a large mint green choc chip scoop of ice~cream pictured in the center w/ choc sauce drizzled over but she got a small scoop of vanilla in center w/ no chocol8 topping. I don't trust sending food back (especially after seeing the movie Waiting) so I asked him 2 pls bring the correct ice~cream in a small bowl which was the 5th detail he missed while w8ing on our small party.

   So overall not good nor bad, so it'll most likely stay a place I go 2 only when it's my sister's B~day choice as I really don't care 2 spend my hard~earned $$ on average food, service, &/or experience in a somewhat outd8ed interior. Maybe that's why they push the enormous drink specials so much cuz then no1 would care but I hardly drink~like 2 experience things in their entirety so here's my take...
