My friends and I used to love this place but the recent changes have been unfortunate. The menu is smaller and more expensive than it was in the past and the food is extremely overpriced for what it is. Staff is always friendly and talkative and the location is great. Their patio dining is one of the best in north Scottsdale and the surrounding area is beautiful. Overall a good place for happy hour or a nice dinner but be prepared to pay for it.
