I like this place would go again for sure I had a good experience... Place seems fun and people are pleasant the bartender I had was super nice and knowledgeable abt tequilas we wanted to try, they have a day happy hour which is nice :) salsa is really good had couple different tacos they re ok only reason I gave average rate is because I ve had better tacos at blanco down the street other than that everything was great and worth going back for the service and happy hour
