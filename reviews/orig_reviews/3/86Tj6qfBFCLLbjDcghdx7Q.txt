Burrito was great and the breakfast quesidilla had a nice flavor.  However the customer service was extremely poor.  All I asked for was some salsa for the burrito and she told me it cost extra but I'll bring to you in a few minutes.  There was only three customer in the restaurant at this time.  I ask again, and she say you want the chips...  Finally a lady comes out of the back with the tray of squeeze salsa for burritos etc.  Register lady didn't seem to understand me. She cancels the chips lol.
