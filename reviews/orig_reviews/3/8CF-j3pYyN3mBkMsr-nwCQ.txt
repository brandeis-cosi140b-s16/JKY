Someburros is one of those places that gives me pause. I've had poor food here before, but it seems to be specific items (their chicken), as other items are quite good.

This is definitely a gringo place. Everything starts bland, but you get a very nice hot sauce to put on whatever you like. They make a perfect quesadilla, but they call it a folded cheese crisp. (This is a nitpick, sure, but a cheese crisp should, I don't know, be crispy.)

Every meal comes with chips which are tasty. Their enchiladas can be greasy, but I'm not sure if that is a complaint or a good thing. I enjoy their ground beef and potato tacos, but again they are hella-bland. Keep the hot sauce handy. The beans and rice in the combo platters are solid winners.

This location uses ceramic plates and honest to god metal cutlery, but the Tempe (Mill) location uses foam plates and plastic cutlery. In my mind, this says a lot for the location. Neither method of serving/eating food impacts the flavor, just the atmosphere. I imagine the Tempe location may save a little money on washing dishes/cutlery as a result.

In the end, Someburros is good if you want Mexican food, at a good price and are in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Though when looking for a bargain, I have gone a little out of my way for the Tempe (Mill) location.
