i saw this place on Man Vs Food. i've been to numerous restaurants that Man Vs Food and Diners,Drive-ins, and Dives has been to. the place looked great on the show. this is a small, very crowded place. i went during lunch. i have mixed reviews. the food was very authentic and good. i was very disappointed that they don't serve salsa and chips and you can't even buy them as a side. they have a large, extensive menu, but it was somewhat aggravating to read because it was a giant mish mash of foods and pictures and most everything was in spanish. so, yes, go for the food. it's cheap. authentic. no chips and salsa at all. i didn't order anything alcoholic, but the margaritas were huge. everyone was drinking some kind of fruity mixed drink and they are all very large. would i personally go out of my way to go here, no. good, yes.
