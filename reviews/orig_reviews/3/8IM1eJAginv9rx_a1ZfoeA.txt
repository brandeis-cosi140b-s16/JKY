Came here for lunch yesterday and the food was pretty good. 

You walk up to the front and put in your order and then go find a table. We came here before noon and it was pretty busy. It actually died down after noon. It takes about 10 minutes or so (maybe more) for your food to come to your table so don't come here if you're in a rush. 

Some of the orders come with beans and rice and others with just chips. And they bring a green and red salsa to your table. I had a carne asada burrito with chips and it was just enough to fill me up. My boyfriend's enchilada meal came with rice and beans. The horchata was pretty good (I've had the homemade stuff and nothing compares), but not as good as the ones you can get from a Betos place. 

The guy taking orders said their carnitas and blackened chicken were their specialties so I'll have to try one of those next time I stop by.
