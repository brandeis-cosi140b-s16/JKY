Found El Dorado Cantina on Yelp! As it is ranked the #1 Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Since we are transplanted Texans, we're Lways on the lookout for good Mexican food wherever we go.
So we went.
#1. It's in a really sketchy part of town; it's actually attached to the Sapphire strip club although you can't see or hear any of the noise from the strip,club inside the restaurant. So the decor is "used to be a strip club" garish...but interesting at the same time. FYI: if you go, tell your cab driver to GPS the name of the restaurant, not the address, our cab driver couldn't find it with the address so we had to type in the name of the restaurant.
Anyway. The food is good. Very much legit Mexican food, although it wasn't "Tex-Mex" to me (so I take exception with the reviewer that says this place can stand with any Mexican place in Texas) but it was good. I had the carnitas street tacos and my wife had steak nachos. Very good; fresh jalape√±os so a little extra zing. That's a good thing, because the salsa was just so-so. Chips were good. Service was excellent. Crowd was eclectic.
All in all a good meal. Detractors are its a hassle to get to and the salsa wasn't all that.
