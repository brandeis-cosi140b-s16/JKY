For a fusion place...not bad.

Minus major points for their take-out service: I have NO IDEA why they restrict the takeout menu, and why they were out of so many things.  Unacceptable, especially for dinner.  And the menu restriction is a total cop-out.  

Lamb Dumplings: had good flavor, but VERY haute gourmet Vegas portions (meaning the dumplings are SMALL!)  It's what I expected, so no loss of points there.  

Tacos: ordered a few of them as an assortment (they ran out of duck tongue...VERY VERY disappointing).  The tacos were pretty spot-on; nothing incredible though.  

I'll have to dine-in next time.  Maybe I'll update with more stars if the other menu options are better.
