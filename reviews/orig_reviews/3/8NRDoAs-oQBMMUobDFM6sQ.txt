Solid joint. Grabbed some green pork tacos for lunch and I was pretty happy with both the quality and portions. The preparation is simple and fresh, not overloaded with crap like some other taco joints. Ask for the green tomatillo salsa, its very good and went great with the green pork. My friends got burritos which were huge and a few other items which all followed suit in terms of quality and size. I will definitely head back for lunch.  

Cash only but they do have an ATM inside if you forget
