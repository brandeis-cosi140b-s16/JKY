Went here while visiting Phoenix as it was advertised in every magazine I opened.  While this place had some delicious food, I am not a fan of pretentious Mexican food trying to be something it is not.  Also, prices were extremely high for all drinks and food.  It seemed very much like a yuppie spot for hip 20 somethings to eat outside and drink overpriced booze.  So while everything tasted great, I am not heading back here any time soon or possibly ever again as I do not live in Phoenix.
