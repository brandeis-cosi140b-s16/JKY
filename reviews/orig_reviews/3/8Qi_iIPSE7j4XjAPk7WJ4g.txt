This place would have gotten 4 or 5 stars if they didn't bomb out on their chicken enchiladas. It was like straight boiled chicken wrapped in a corn tortilla with sauce on top and cheese. Not too flavorful. I also tried the 3 tacos dish which was really good. And the prickly pear margarita was delicious I had to get another. A bit pricey but I'd go back for happy hour and get some more margarita action.
