Came here and was impressed by the party, mardi gras atmosphere that the place was shaking. 

We ordered some drinks (which were a more than a few bucks) and tacos. The pescado tacos were filled with a little more than a fish finger which was disappointing. I wanted something hearty to fill me up. I wouldn't feel so bad about the meal but it wasn't cheap and we went somewhere else to get more sustenance.
