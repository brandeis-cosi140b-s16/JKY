Had dinner here with some friends on Cinco de Mayo.  We made reservations but arrived early enough that they really weren't needed.  Still we had a nice booth right by the window and that was very pleasant.  The dining room is quite large and did seem to get pretty busy as the night wore on.  Our server, Jose, was very patient and attentive.

The food was pretty average.  We started w/ chips and salsa, pretty average there but served with 2 versions of salsa.  The cheese queso dip was ok, but a little too Velveeta cheesey for my taste.  Jose kept us supplied in chips.  I had enchiladas veracruz w/ chicken & spinach.  Came w/ a side of zucchini was really quite tasty.  Not so much for the bland rice.  One companion had the chicken enchiladas.  He said they were ok but they sure looked unappealing to me covered with a white sour cream/cheese sauce topping, so pale on the plate.  Our friends enjoyed their margaritas and at $5 seemed like a pretty good deal.  

We spent a long time after dinner visiting while still seated in the booth and did not feel rushed to leave.  That might have been the best part of the experience.  This is pretty typical chain food and there are so many better, unique Mexican options in the area.  Nothing about the meal made me want to rush back but if the occasion calls for a return, I would be agreeable.
