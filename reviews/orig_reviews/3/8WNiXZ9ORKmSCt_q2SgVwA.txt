This place was ok,  I'd like to try it again to see how consistent they are or try something else. I ordered their house special carnitas plate. It was good, they serve it with little pieces of chicharones which was different.  Rice and beans weren't bad.  My girlfriend got some rice bowl type of thing that came with barbacoa.  Also decent, her complaint was that it was salty, which I would have to agree, overall food was on the saltier side, so maybe avoid if you have high blood pressure. Overall not bad for vegas standards, which are terrible for mexican food. Still better than tasteless Lindo Michuacan that every is crazy about here...white people I swear...
