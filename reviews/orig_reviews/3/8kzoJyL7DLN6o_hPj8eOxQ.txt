Hit and miss! Been a few times now because my friends rave about this place but each time we've left a little disappointed. Good guacamole and margaritas but entrees not great, authentic mexican menu is good but the quality has been hit and miss every time, burnt taco's, too much american cheese, long waits etc.

We will try it again but with lower expectations on the way in.
