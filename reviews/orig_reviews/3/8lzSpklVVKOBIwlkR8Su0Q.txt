What do you come here for?  Fantastic frozen margaritas and the patio on the lake.  Other than that, the food is fine and the service lacks.  

We hit this place up on a Sunday night about 6p.  We had to wait about 10m and then were seated at booth inside with a view of the lake.  Our server was MIA for a long time and then all of a sudden she almost popped around the side of the booth and asked for drink orders (She never really stopped and stood and talked to us, just popped in and out). At some point a basket of chips with salsa and bean dip came out, which was great because it took FOREVER to get food - we ate every chip! 

I had the chile relleno, black beans and rice.  It all tasted fine, but it had no spice, good flavor just no heat.  Oh and another thing about heat, it must have sat back there awhile before the waitress could get to it because it was warm-ish.  So it was all fine.  Not bad, not great. A-OK seems about right.  

The only thing I can rave about was the frozen margs. They were a perfect amount of slush and booze!  I would have had more if I my waitress gave us more than a couple pop ins!  Oh well, give it try, may you will like it!
