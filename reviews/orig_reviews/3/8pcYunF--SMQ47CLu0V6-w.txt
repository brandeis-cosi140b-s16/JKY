I've been eating and drinking in bars all over the US and Europe for twenty years now. I often order soda water with my meals, and never have I ever been charged for it; not at least until I visited the Blue Adobe Grille. Not only was I charged for soda water from the tap (I may have understood $1), they charged $2.45 for it! The burger I ordered came with wizened red onions, and my burger bun was a little flat. Maybe their entrees are a little more up to the quality that would warrant the use of the old English form of the word grill, using an E, but I didn't experience it. For now, Blue Adobe, I'd call you a grill, not a grille.
