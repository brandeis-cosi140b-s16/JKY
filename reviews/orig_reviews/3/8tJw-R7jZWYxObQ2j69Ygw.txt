So every other time I have been here, it was at night, in a drunken stooper, and well...not much of a recollection.

This time, was during the day while out shopping with a girlfriend.  

The place was PACKED.  I was pleasantly surprised by how attentive and nice the staff was.  We sat at the bar and my gf knew what she wanted to order (fish skewers, something about man overboard is what I think they are called).  I had one. Great.  Really different.  Mahi Mahi breaded on a stick but didn't taste like fish sticks=definitely recommended.

The tacos we okay, nothing too out of the ordinary but definitely good. 

The happy hour prices are pretty good too.
