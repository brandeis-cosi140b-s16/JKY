This is a solid three for me.  We went for happy hour last thursday and had a couple of margaritas, the tune appetizer, which was very good. We also had the shrimp tostadas, this was not bad, but neither exceptional.  It was just competent.  The prices during happy hour are great.  The service was not that great, though.  When we got there, we sat at the bar.  There were a couple of servers/bartenders? at the end having a conversation.  I kept making eye contact and they saw us, but kept going on with their talk.  Finally the other bartender who was there got to us.  All in all, this is a good place to go when you have some time to kill during happy hour. We used to come here a ton a few years ago.  I guess when you are single this is one of the spots to hit.
