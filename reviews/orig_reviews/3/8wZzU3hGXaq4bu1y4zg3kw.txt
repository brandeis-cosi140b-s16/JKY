My love affair with Paco has come to an end. It is not as thrilling as in the early days of a new restaurant. The chips they used to have were light, thin, and they seemed freshly made; I couldn't keep my hands off them. The last time I was there they had the thick corn that was seemed like it was purchased in bulk. In addition, the flavor that once kept me coming back for more, seemed more muted. 

Granted, the food is still okay and the service is still friendly. Perhaps "it's me, not you."
