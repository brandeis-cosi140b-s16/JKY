I took a friend here and she didn't like the tilapia with veggies around it, but I did.  Different strokes I assume?  Pretty place, but looks like a hundred other I saw in Houston.  Food was good but not great.  Would I go back again?  On my own?  Probably not.  It was good--just not that great or different that I would make an effort to go back.  It's just too commercial looking for me I guess.
