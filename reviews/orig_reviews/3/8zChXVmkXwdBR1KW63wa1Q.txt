Found this place on Man v. Food website.  Definitely had to try it out.  Torta is huge.  We ordered Torta del Rey & shared it.  Great flavor.  Huaraches De Cameron was also very yummy.  Plenty of shrimp. Again we shared. Fresh made tortilla.  Delicious
Okay so here's the downside... NO ALCOHOL!!! I don't know about you but when I eat Mexican food I like to enjoy a nice cold margarita.   My spouse wanted a beer.  Bummer. Would've been perfect. 
Service was great.  Everyone very nice.  Food was hot and came out fast.
