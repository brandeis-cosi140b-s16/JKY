Some good - some not so good. Guacamole was very good. Tuna ceviche had some amazing flavors. Tacos (langosta and carnitas) were just okay, Dim sum was not very memorable.  Very friendly service. I'd say they do the Mexican much better than the Chinese.  I realize you are going to pay more for on-strip, in casino dining -- but wasn't that impressed for the price. Many other better restaurants.
