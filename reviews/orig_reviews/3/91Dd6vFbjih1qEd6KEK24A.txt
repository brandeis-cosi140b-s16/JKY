Two great things:

-The cocktail named Harmony. Has ginger liqueur and I forget what else, but it was delightful. Not very sweet, no overwhelming alcohol flavor, just a perfect cocktail.

-Guacamole. I was heavily craving guac and voila, there are 2 choices on the menu. We opted for the latter option, with pumpkin seeds and chipotle adobo or something like that. I thought the pumpkin seeds added an interesting, smoky flavor and a cool complementary texture to the all-too-familiar guac experience. As I was starving, I carefully cleaned out the bowl. NO GUAC LEFT BEHIND.

Other items were less noteworthy. 

Do not get the chorizo-cheese item. It is strange. We had a hard time pulling apart the lump of cheese that came in a bowl with sparse bits of chorizo lodged within. Then you have to put the cheese on tortillas. It's just complicated, greasy, and heavy. 

The masa cakes were interesting. There are 3 different ones. My favorite was the chicken, but that might be because that was the one I had first. Maybe it was just diminishing marginal utility. 

We also got the tiger prawn ceviche, which comes with a huge portion of chips and salsas. It is unfortunately, unremarkable.

The best part about Isla is their TVs which show sports games.
