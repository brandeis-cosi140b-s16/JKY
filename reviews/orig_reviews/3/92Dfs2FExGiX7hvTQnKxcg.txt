So we went here for dinner and we thought the food would be really good, but we were disappointed. So we ordered an appetizer and their fresh guacamole; the queso fundido and the chicken quesadilla was amazing so we couldn't wait for are main entree. The entree looked really good but as soon as we tasted it they weren't that good as the appetizers. My boyfriend and I ordered Carne asada burrito with no black beans inside and the meet didn't have any flavored and inside of the burrito is mostly rice. And the rice also didn't taste like anything. The service was good because we had three server. But overall the food was disappointing.
