The food is good at Casa Don Juan and we've been coming here for years but they have been incrementally raising prices, sky high for Mexican food in our opinion.  When we went on 8/3/13 the new menu had their meat quesadilla for $14.99.  That's crazy.  All of their other prices are very hight too.  Again, the food is good, but the value is terrible.
