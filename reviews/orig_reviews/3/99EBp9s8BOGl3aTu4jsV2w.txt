Solid brunch. But doesn't quite measure up to the other culinary delights that Vegas has to offer. 

Pros:
Delicious empanadas
Awesome fruit salad with chili powder - refreshing, spicy, fun
Bottomless mimosas for $10 in 8 different flavors? DELICIOUS - the lemon cucumber was my favorite.
Chicken and Blue corn waffles were pretty great.

Cons:
The rest of the food was pretty average. It tasted good, but nothing really stood out. The eggs benedict came in a huge, dense biscuit that wasn't really conducive to trying lots of small plates. The red velvet pancakes were a little dry. 

Don't know if I would go out of my way to go again, but wouldn't put up a fuss if someone else wanted to go.
