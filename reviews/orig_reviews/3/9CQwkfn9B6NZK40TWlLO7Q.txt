Not the best, not the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Clean place, good ambiance, friendly staff.  Not bad for a quick bite and just on par with the other chain Mexican joints in my opinion.

Definitely wouldn't avoid it, but it's not a 5 start dining experience.  Left full as the portions are big, especially for the price.  Good bang for your buck.
