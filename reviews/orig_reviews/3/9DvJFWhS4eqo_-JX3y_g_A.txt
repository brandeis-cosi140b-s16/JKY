My boyfriend loves this place, he ordered a bowl for me and the rice was delicious. There are vegetarian and sea food options which I appreciated. The chips and guacamole are delicious, however the qua smile had a slight kick so be wary for your younger children. It is a bit loud and overwhelming with the chefs cutting the near but I got used to it. Overall I enjoyed the experience.
