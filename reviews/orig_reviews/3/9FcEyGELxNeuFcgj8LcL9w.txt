I wish I could give them 3 1/2 stars, but I'm a tough critic. First, the positives - the service we had was excellent. Quick, friendly and attentive. As other reviewers have said, the soup is delicious! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The portions are pretty large, the chips/salsa was good and fresh.

Now the negatives - the flavor of the food is just okay. Compared to Cantina Laredo or the now closed Agave, it's a 5 out of 10. The chicken in my enchilada was a little dry. There was too much cheese in the chile relleno. I like cheese, but it overpowered the dish. The beef taco was a bit bland.

All in all, I was satisfied after dinner, but it didn't leave me counting the days until I go back.
