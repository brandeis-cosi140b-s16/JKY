Just came here a few days ago.  I was expecting a lot better.  I wish the rating score would also do 1/2 points because if it did this review would be a 3.5.  I ordered 2 tacos de adobada (spicy pork), 1 tongue, and 1 tripe.  I ordered my tacos with everything which is cilantro, onion and salsa.  The adobada tacos were good.  I was not a huge fan of the tortillas.  They somewhat have a flavor that regular tacos do not have, not even tacos in Mexico.  The tongue taco was ok.  The tongue was just not too flavorful (probably not seasoned enough with salt).  The tripe taco made me disappointed.  The tortilla to this taco was warm because they had just warmed it up but the tripe was kind of cold :( which was sad because these are my favorite tacos.  The color of the lard was white with clearly shows also that the tripe was cold.  My tacos came with grilled onions and peppers.  These were good. Up to now, the best tacos in Las Vegas are still the ones on Lamb and Bonanza.  Las Taquizas.  I am trying different tacos in Vegas to see if I find any better but so far those are the best.  If I am ever in the area, and really wanted tacos, I would give this place another chance.
