Came here today for lunch.  Not impressed at all. We sat at the bar.  Bartendar was accommodating but not friendly at all.  The hot salsa was good.  Not too much of a kick but tasty. Mild salsa was watery and not much flavor.  Chips were good and thin.  Started out with the house margarita.  It was awful.  So,  I got the Cadillac margarita which was much better.  I got the shredded beef burro enchilada style.  It was edible but lacked flavor.  My friend got the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale.  She said the enchilada was bland and the tamale was extremely sweet.  Won't be returning here on my own free will.
