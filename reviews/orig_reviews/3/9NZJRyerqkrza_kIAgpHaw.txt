OK, First time here and maybe the last. We sat outside which was a little more intimate. Standard chips, salsa, and bean dip was better than average. I ordered the Chile Relleno. The batter was fluffy and the cheese was still semi-solid and flavorless. There was a tomato sauce on top that did anything but complement the already failing dish. I tried my friend's beef enchiladas with red sauce. He said they were dry as in not enough sauce and the sauce tasted bland to me. The beans and rice were a little salty. I am not impressed. Next time I will go to Abuelo's by the Chandler Mall. For a few dollars more I would have actually enjoyed my meal!
