I understand this is Vegas, but damn this food was pricey.  The menu is enormous and overwhelming.  I got the carnitas quesadilla and it was fine but not worth $35 or however much it was.  The atmosphere is cool except that the smoke from the casino floor is constantly blowing in your face.  Drinks were great and food was fine but probably won't be on the top of my list next time I come.
