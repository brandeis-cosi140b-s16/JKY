We stopped at this place for a late breakfast on Thursday morning. I had the chilaquiles. Definitely not what grandma used to make but it was good. It came with eggs, beans and i ordered a side of potatoes. The service was sloooooow. I had a problem with that. It wasn't even that busy and there seems to be plenty of staff.
