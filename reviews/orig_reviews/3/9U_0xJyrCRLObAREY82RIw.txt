They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing.
