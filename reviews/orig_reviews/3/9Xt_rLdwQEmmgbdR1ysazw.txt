I'm splitting this right down the middle with 3 stars.  Things I really enjoyed...the patio, location and chips to start were great.  Things we didn't love..again, the patio was insanely loud, and the food was just ok.  For southwest food it hit the mark but wasn't my favorite overall.  And my street tacos were just ok, the tortillas being soggy, almost like they weren't cooked all the way.
