Been here twice, one for dinner and once for lunch. Seems to stay pretty busy around the clock, pros ~ Multiple seating areas, very friendly staff, huge portions, cheap prices and the agua frescas are a must try, soo delicious. 
Cons  ~ low quality meat used in the tortas, no chips and salsa (potato chips only) and no alcohol.
In my two visits I tried the steak nortena which was really good, and the Del Ray which was just foolish on my part, left feeling completely defeated. All in all ill def. visit again, I'll just be very selective of my food choices.
