Hubby and I went to this place a couple of weeks ago, and I have to say that I wasn't very impressed.  I don't know who told these people how to make tortillas, but the ones my daughter bought were extremely large, limp, and thin--not at all like the authentic Mexican tortillas that I have gotten at many many other places.  Flour tortills are supposed to have some substance to them, and they shouldn't be tough and hard to tear, like these were.

The place is a dump--I fully expected to see roaches crawling up the walls.  I didn't see that, but things like access to the ladies room by walking behind the beverage dispenser are totally unnecessary and not very appealing.  I ordered tamales--they were just okay -- not as good as the frozen ones I buy at CostCo!  The beans were fine, and the unlimited beverages is a plus.  

I didn't have the ability to give this place only 2.5 stars, but would have if the ability had been there.  I know that this is the "home base" and "original" of this chain, but I felt very uncomfortable in the neighborhood and the restaurant, and I believe that the owners could clean the place up and turn it into a more appealing building/eatery.
