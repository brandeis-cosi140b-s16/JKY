Really enjoyed Cantina 1511. We went a few time while we lived in Charlotte. Pretty good guacamole- made tableside. Decent margaritas. Best thing on the menu is the crab/avacado quesadilla with the mexican chopped salad as a side. Love love love the chopped salad. Pretty good menu with a huge variety. Definitely recommended for anyone looking for decent tex-mex food. We had a really nice experience every time we've gone.
