The food was pretty good the tacos were OK not the best I've had. The table side GUACAMOLE is to die for but that's about it. the service was okay but seems like the waiters are either drunk or on something especially Chico.. I think it was very rude that waiters were surrounding themselves around groups of woman who came in and it took 20 minutes for us to get water because they were talking to these women. we were also stuck at a very small table againest the wall where everyone was walking by and going to the restroom. One of the managers was very rude I don't think we will be going back here at all.
