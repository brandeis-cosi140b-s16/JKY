I was really looking forward to this place because I read good reviews. I have to say I was not impressed with the ambiance. They played techno music, would of been better if they had Latin music instead. Their tacos were excellent and service was okay. I was surprised that they did not have salt at the table. They also didn't have hot sauce :(
