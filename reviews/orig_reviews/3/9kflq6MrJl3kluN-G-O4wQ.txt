I am a firm believer that if you're going to Yelp than you should give a place at least a second shot but I'm breaking my own rule here...but we most definitely will go back again for good measure. If not for our friendly, amusing and just plain cool server, Allison, we may not have continued to wait for our long-over-due main course...a single entree of 2 quite delicious enchilada, of which we shared. Appetizer of queso dip was....well...not the usual queso.  Thick and creamy, the concept was good, but it lacked that little kick that, in my opinion, makes queso, queso. It took a long time for our main entree to come out of the kitchen...and if I had to guess it's because the kitchen seemed tiny compared to the mass amounts of guests this place could accommodate leaving the kitchen "in the weeds" as industry people say.  Until I go back and this place can get my food out w/in a reasonable 20 mins or less, I'm sticking w/ 3 stars. Just don't go on a Saturday night. This place opened 4 weeks ago and I think they need more time to figure it all out. Next visit...Happy Hour.
