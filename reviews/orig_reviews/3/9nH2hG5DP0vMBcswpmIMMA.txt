This restaurant is located on the second floor of Luxor, the hotel we stayed at for 4 nights. My friends and I were craving tacos and so went here for lunch. It was a Saturday and that featured a mariachi band! The friendly three men dressed in festive Mexican attire came to our table and offered to play us a song. My friend suggested backstreet boys, "I Want It That Way" and they knew what it was and played and sang it really well!  I was impressed with the vocals and guitar playing. At the table next to us they even played the ratchet song "Wiggle Wiggle" which was funny and great. The atmosphere and decor was also very nice. 

Moving onto the food, I got one of the brunch specials that included two scrambled eggs, chorizo bits on top, and potatoes. We also had free chips and green + red salsa as an appetizer before getting our food. I loved the crunch of the chips and the salsa was also delicious. I enjoyed my dish and it was the perfect amount of food. It wasn't anything great, but it wasn't bad either. I also tried my friends' food, which were tacos and the appetizer platter and it was only mediocre. The tacos were very expensive and not worth getting. Me and many others agreed.

As for service, it was not very good. It took extremely long to get our check and change, and our waiter was not friendly. He also didn't seem to really care about serving us. One of my friends asked for jalapenos and pico de gallo and he said yes and that it would be free. Later, she was charged $2 for each extra thing, but all the checks were mixed up when we had asked before hand we wanted to do them separately. All the drinks and sides were not on the correct bill and when we asked for him to correct it, he made an excuse saying, "well, there is just too many things to remember." That is not very professional.
