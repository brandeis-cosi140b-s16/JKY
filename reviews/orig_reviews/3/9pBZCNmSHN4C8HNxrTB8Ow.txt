Lively Friday night just enjoyed good Mex food. Chimichanga was really hott had to wait to eat it  :-( taco salad had strange lettuce like Arugula...not very mexi in my opinion. Inside lighting was like a living room kinda strange. Sit outside next time. 2 meals and a drink under 30 can't complain too much! Would return.
