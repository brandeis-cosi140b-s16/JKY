My boyfriend and I had a $150.00 gift card to spend here from some "Time share thing" We attended. Right away there was 2 hostess didn't greet us or anything basically ignored us until they were done with their conversation. We sat outside which I loved weather was hot but it was nice. Our waitress was awesome! Her name was Melissa, and she took great care of gave awesome service! We got drinks I ordered a "Gummy Frog" which is a shot and it was good then ordered a 29oz "Bahama Mama" and that was good too. They had a special buy one get one free so that was a plus. For appetizers I ordered Tortilla soup it was so so I liked how they give you all kinds of fixings for it but I had  better. My boyfriend ordered wings nothing special. For our entrees I ordered fish tacos which were ok but the cole slaw they put in it for me kind of killed it. My boyfriend ordered the beef chimichanga it was huge he said it was good not great and the rice was not all that. So basically drinks and our waitress were great!
