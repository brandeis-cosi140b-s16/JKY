I loved the chips and salsa, the tacos were great but I honestly can't remember anything else about this place.  went here last week and it was fine, not over priced but cool casual spot.  I did like the noodle thing they have as a side dish, I know others don't have the same thoughts but I added a little salsa and beans and it was quite tasty :) I think it's worth going at least once, but I personally am not planning on being a regular.
