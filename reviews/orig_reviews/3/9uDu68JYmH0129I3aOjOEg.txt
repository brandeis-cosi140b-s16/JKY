I have never been to Carolina's because I always thought it might be a mass production machaca beef fest...and I was right.  Never been a fan of overly braised beef stuffed, fried, or folded into a tortilla.

But, I must say it's pretty good... Fresh tortillas are a big plus...salsa isn't too bad...beef tastes fresh...enchilada sauce is pretty good...rice and beans were great...chips are fresh, saw them frying them up out back...really pretty good food, helps that the price is right!!

Come around 11am or after 1pm, lunch is packed, seating is limited, or just take it to go....they always package it that way anyways....
