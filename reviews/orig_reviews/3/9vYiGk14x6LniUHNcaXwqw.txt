The interior is awesome!!  The salsa and chips are really good.  I got the pork adovado and my friend had the al pastor.  Both were excellent.  I wasn't impressed with the beef or the tres leche and the service was so-so.  If you're going for lunch during work, expect to stay a while as the service is pretty slow.
