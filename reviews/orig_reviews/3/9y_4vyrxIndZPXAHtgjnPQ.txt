This place is expensive, the back deck IS incredibly beautiful in the spring/summer, it's always crowded with a very strange crown, and no one there is very friendly.  My first experience there, the food was bad, my waitress was completely RUDE (she spent the evening ignoring our table of 8 people, and couldn't even get our drink orders earlier than 30 min after we sat down).  It's over priced, over hyped, and completely boring.
I've been back since my first time, multiple times.  I love the pickled vegetables.  The taco's are okay but not really my favorite I've ever had.  
The back patio is pretty much the best thing about this place.  They have a lovely brunch.  I will say, again, it is expensive for what it is and for the LONGEST time they didn't have the price listed for pitchers.  We bought 2 pitchers of sangria and I think out bill was $70?  We were alarmed to say the least.
