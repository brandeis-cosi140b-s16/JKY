In town for a few days and excited to eat at my childhood favorite spot. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. After ordering online and picking up according to the schedule they set, my food was cold, the meat was overcooked and I could barely swallow it. Additionally I got all the way home and realized there was no hot sauce in the bag. How am I supposed to eat tough taco meat without hot sauce? My boyfriend liked his salad though good thing it was supposed to be cold.
