Food is ok and not terribly overpriced for a airport (in Vegas, at that). Service was great, good margaritas. But the music... Maybe it was because of the time of day we were here, just before 10am, but they had 90s hits being poorly covered. And not just one or two bad covers, all of them were horrible! Give me Mexican music at a Mexican restaurant, or if you're going to play 90s hits, get the original!
