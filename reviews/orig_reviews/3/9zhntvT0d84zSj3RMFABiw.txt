We came to phat phranks for some Mexican food, more like a 3.5 star restaurant. We ordered the huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and some flautas. The huevos rancheros came with either red or green sauce, I picked green because it has pork in the sauce. The dish was really greasy for my taste, the beans, eggs and the fried chips were swimming in grease. It wasn't a traditional huevos rancheros. The fried potatoes were delicious And the dish was okay, just too greasy. The flautas were crispy and tasty with fresh guacamole. The service was good.

I had to give it 3.5 stars due to the greasy meal and also, we were charged for tap water. I'm not sure if that is a Vegas thing, but it was a bit unusual for me to see that.
