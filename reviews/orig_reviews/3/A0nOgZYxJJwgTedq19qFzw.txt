Good lunch spot. I like that they have  a choose two option - so you can get tortilla soup and salad - and it has just a small amount of rice and beans. Perfect serving size for lunch.

You can also choose two items like a taco and an enchilada - which is also comes in a lunch serving size with small rice and beans. 

The only problem is the chips - why do we have to eat so many chips!!!???
