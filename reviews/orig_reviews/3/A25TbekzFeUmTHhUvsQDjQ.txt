This was truly a unique experience for me. I was just happening by on my way to the airport from N Phoenix and saw this listed on "Yelp Reviews" for restaurants around me and though I'd check it out.

I was well received and the climate of the staff was very pleasant. My food came within a reasonable amount of time although I was the only one of two seated in the restaurant.

I ordered a watermelon juice (real watermelon juice) on ice which was sweet and refreshing to begin with and the waiter recommended the lunch item that was a top sirloin skirt marinated, ride beans and some kind of layered tortilla bake with cheese and tomato salsa. They also brought out 3 ramadans of  Pico De Giulio, a smokey chipotle and tomatillo sauce. 

The steak was tender and all the sides were unbelievably delicious.

Lastly I ordered a vanilla Ice Cream Crepe covered in caramel sauce and it was one of the best deserts I have ever eaten.

With everything including the tip my meal came to $25.00 for lunch.

for the quality of the food it was worth the price if it were a dinner, but 25.00 lunches are for me a little over the top.

So although the food was terrific, the pricing was not.
