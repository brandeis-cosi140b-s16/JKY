Flavors are excellent but the organization of the restaurant absolutely detracts from the food. By the time we figured it all out and sat down, all of our food was cold and mushy. 

Also, with meats and fish this good, please stop putting so much sauce on things. You develop wonderful flavors, and then throw sauce all over them. It's like buying a Rembrandt painting and allowing a 3-year old to "decorate" it. 

Same for mole fries. Great sweet potato fries but with way too much mole sauce and cheese. It would have been the same as putting cheese and sauce on a wet paper towel. 

Service was hit or miss. Pork guy was nice, burrito/vegetarian guy was not, bartender was nice. 

Good for a quick bite but not a comfortable spot to eat slowly. And DO NOT DO TAKEOUT. IT'LL CERTAINLY BE COLD.
