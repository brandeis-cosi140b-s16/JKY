This place is just ok. I'd stop by again if I was in the area maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. They didn't melt the cheese on our nachos and we had to walk through a cloud of several employees smoke when we walked out. I don't know why places don't realize that employees should smoke out back.
