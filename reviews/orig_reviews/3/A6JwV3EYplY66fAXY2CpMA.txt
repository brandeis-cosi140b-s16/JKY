This is a hard review to write but all the more necessary. We legitimately enjoyed the service, food, and margaritas we received; however, we were taken aback by the additional charges to our bill. In short, we had additional charges totaling $26 that we brought to our server's attention which he rectified by giving us two free margaritas that equalled $18. We ate the difference but were conflicted after we were: 1. Charged for an extra drink we didn't order, 2. Not comped a drink that was promised by our waiter after we had waited over 15 minutes for it, and 3. Charged regular prices on 2 margaritas that we ordered during happy hour. Overall, we will likely return but plan to be much more vigilant with regard to our check.
