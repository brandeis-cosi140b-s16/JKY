I have been here a couple of times and have decided the chorizo burro is the way to go. The tortillas tastes homemade and the chorizo is good and spicy. I prefer my burro without the potatoes which sometimes will make the egg to chorizo ratio a bit on the heavy side with chorizo. For lunch, I've had a red chile and cheese enchiladas. I didn't care for the enchilada sauce or the red chile. They keep their salsa at the counter in a tub of ice. In my opinion leave it there it's only so-so.
