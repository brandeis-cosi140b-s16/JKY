Pretty good food, better than Macayos. The parking sucks though, and it's right next to a windshield repair shop so parking is even tighter. The atmosphere is so-so, so if you are in the mood for Mexican I would choose this if you are between the 101/202 and the 60/alma school, but don't expect to be swept off your feet.
