The food was delicious but my experience with the floor manager Louis was terrible. He hid in the kitchen while he left a single bar tender out to contain the masses during a lunch rush. The poor gal was doing what she could but it was too much. Not once did he intervene.

When I confronted him on this issue as well as his kitchen staff eating while preparing guest meals -- he proceeded to call airport security on me. I'm the least threatening person possible and I never once used threatening tones or language -- even the security guards laughed at the situation. He was mad that I called him out on his lack of doing his job...

Bottom line, the food is great but if you arrive around lunch time, don't expect the management to manage the situation when and if they get short handed.
