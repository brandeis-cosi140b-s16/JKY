Wahoos was my spot in highschool so much so that I kinda went on burn out. Not only was there one close to my house, there was one near one of my favorite surf spots. I haven't eaten one in years and figured I should check it out. 

I got a grilled fish bowl which comes with a choice of beans and rice and a bit of pico garnish. Fish was a bit dry, they could have taken it off the grill sooner, beans and rice were standard and fine. The BF got a fish burrito and said it was alright.

Ask for some limes and sauces to dress it to your liking. They have sauces they don't really mention on the menu nor ask you if you want like their green sauce, white sauce, teriyaki or the Mr. Lees which is a spicy tomato paste sauce.

I feel like it was somehow better when in HS, but they've been in California for a long time. 

Apparently this is a good spot to watch sports, and there is a patio to enjoy on nice days. Full bar and drink specials are available too.

It's a A-OK spot, specially if you are looking for a inexpensive, somewhat healthier food option.
