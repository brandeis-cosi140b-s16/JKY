I've been here twice now.  My first visit was great.  The service was perfect.  I was pleasantly surprised by the chips and salsa and the special of the day was excellent.  It was a very interesting mix of Italian and southwest.  

My second visit didn't go quite as well.  My group was sat at the very back of the restaurant and the servers visits where few and far between.

Perhaps I should stop wearing my "bearded for her pleasure" shirt when I eat out...
