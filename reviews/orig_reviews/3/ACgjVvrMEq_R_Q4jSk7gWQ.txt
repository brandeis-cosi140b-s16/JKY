If its the end of your night and you have no idea what else yo do.. this place is awesome. Otherwise meehh...

It has a distinct smell of vomit. The mexican food is americanized mexican influenced stuff.. and the bar well I heard their margarita is cheap?

Not a huge fan. But I do come here on ocassion at the end of a night. In that case it never disappoints because it has that inviting chill atmosphere.  Super casual.. try it at least once.
