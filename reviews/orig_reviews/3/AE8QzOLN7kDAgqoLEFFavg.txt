Oh God. The first few months that I started coming here, I was obsessed. Their guacamole? Untouchable. But then I had one really weird experience and every time I returned it just kept getting worse and worse. Seriously. From getting ignored by my waiter, to being avoided afterwards, to only getting checked on once, to having luke warm, soggy tacos. After one horrible awkward experience to another, my bad experiences were to be expected. I would recommend going to their OTHER sister restaurant, Cresent Ballroom. Their bean and cheese burrito with the green salsa and chips are "to die for."
