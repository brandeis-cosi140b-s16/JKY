Diablo's has been open for a couple of month's now, but November 18 was my first time visiting the cantina.
My first impression is that the motif does not go with the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino at all. I understand that the Vegas pendulum is swinging over toward the sin city mode, but the "Red Devil Beauty" above the cantina just does not fit the Monte Carlo - but then Dick's Last Resort in the Excalibur does not fit with that hotel either- oh well.... 
Secondly - they have an impressive array of Tequila for your enjoyment.  There is a "friendly" atmosphere in the bar and dining area. We ate and drank at the bar on the upper level and I think this area will pick up with the party atmosphere when the weather    begins to warm up. 
I ate the taco salad, it has a very unique presentation and it was supurb. Others had the 4 cheese nachos and I would say that they tended to be fine on the edges but a soggy mess remained in  the center of the pile. The 4 cheese selection could have been improved. The Calamari appetizer  and the tortilla "bowl" was very nice, coming with an assortment of  salsa and tomatillo. Tecate and Dos Equis are on draft at the bar.  They have some unusual and quite average coctails on the menu, but all in all I think this is an enjoyable place to spend time while you are on this end of the Vegas Strip.
