Food was very good and atmosphere was nice though  hard to hear across the tables in a big party. There is a $4 upcharge  to make your burrito enchilada style though  your waiter probably  won't  tell  you it's an upcharge and offer it as though it's a regular no charge option as ours did to our table.
