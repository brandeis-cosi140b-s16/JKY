Yayo, Yayo ... I guess owner had a great idea to create a hip looking place where college kids can have few tacos for lunch and few beers for dinner :) but ... I stopped by for a late lunch and decided to try their 4 taco combo.
I ordered 2 regular and 2 of their 'fusion' style tacos.

- 3 out 4: meat was too dry (4th was a fish taco)
- rice ...it shouldn't look like a porridge!
- tacos ARE small. For this price ($1.50-$2) I get tacos twice as big at my regular taqueria.

Bottom line: Place looks cool inside but unless they figure out how to cook stuff right - I'm not coming back.
