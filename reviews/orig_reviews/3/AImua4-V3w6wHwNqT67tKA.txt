Fairly solid place when compared to the mecca (So Cal.).  We tried most of their meats, including brain tacos.  Everything was good if not great.  The ordering is a little confusing and one needs to be assertive to get the attention of an expediter.  The only thing that is sadly disappointing is the hot sauce.  They put a a couple of tablespoons on each taco, but if that doesn't suffice then you ask for more at the register.  The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served.
Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.  
It is in a mexi part of Vegas which is good.  I would return but am still on the hunt for more Mexi-Vegas places.
