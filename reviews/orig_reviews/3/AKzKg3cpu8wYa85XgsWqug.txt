Not my type of Mexican food.... Im from Texas and I miss my Tex-Mex so much. This place had no spice or flavor in anything my husband and I tried. We had heard from numerous people that this place was great. I guess their type of great is not our type of great. Still on the hunt for our Mexican food fix in Las Vegas...
