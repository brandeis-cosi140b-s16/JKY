I came here yesterday on the recommendation of a girlfriend.  She says she swears by the place, and you really get a good amount of tasty food for your money.  

The place was really colorfully decorated.  Vibrant colors, and lots of seating.  They have a fairly simple menu, but with a variety of choices.   I went with the enchilada with steak.  I think all the tortillas are made here in house? You can get different style beans, and the selection was reasonably ample.  

I liked the food here, but its not the greatest food Ive had.   Part of it I think was the fact that you order in a line, and sometimes I had a hard time hearing what the guy was asking me.   I am going to go back soon and hopefully try something spicier.  I ordered my food a little on the bland side.  Why?  as of lately either my food is way to bland and boring or its so spicy that I cant finish it.  I will be back, thats for sure!
