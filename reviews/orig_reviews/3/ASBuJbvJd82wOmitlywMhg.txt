Came to see Caseroloops, the Venezuelan Grammy-nomiated band. The band itself was good, but I can see the Havana Grill has taken a dive lately. I remember when this place used to be packed every weekend with live bands and a 'happening' atmosphere, taste appetizers available until late, and fruity mojitos. This time around, the atmosphere was dead (except for the band playing), the mojitos were expensive ($9 ) and watered down, and I believe the kitchen had already closed. I am not quite sure what happened.

If I had to vote this place thumbs up or down, it would the latter. I can't imagine going there and having much fun, given the stale overall atmosphere. Now I have to find another latin music spot.
