Dos Gringos is a nice option for outdoor seating drinks with friends but they need to step up their game. Almost half of the outdoor heaters are broken, there isn't great light and it just kind of feels dirty. The only server walking around seemed to be the Jello Shot girl. That being said, we went and had a nice time thanks to the great service of Tyler and choice mixes from the onsite dj. Opening up the floor to dancing or having a karaoke night would set this place apart. There's a lot of space there that could be used for some good times.
