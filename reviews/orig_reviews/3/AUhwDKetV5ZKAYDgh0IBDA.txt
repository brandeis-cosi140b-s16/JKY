Is has been a very long since I have visited this Macayo's.  Parking is shared with a few other business's but, still amble parking.
Very colorful inside, but, some places here are a bit worn out and could use a bit of sparkle.   We came about 5:20 and had about a 15 min wait. They were quite busy for a Tuesday night.
We checked it out upstairs, but it was freezing a cold up there. So we were glad we ate downstairs. We got a nice booth. we had a sweet server. She was very busy, but did her best to keep checking on us.
She refilled our salsa and drinks several times. The food was just so so. Not the kind of Macayos we know and love.
I had a steak Quesadilla which was a little light on the steak.  Lots of Onions though.
T got shrimp enchililadas. She said they were good but, both of us the rice and beans were a little flavorless.
All in all good food though, service was great! Thank you Nora!
