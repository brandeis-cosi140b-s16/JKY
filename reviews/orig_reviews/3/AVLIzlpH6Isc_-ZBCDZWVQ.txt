That was enough to make me not want to go but I kept an open mind and it wasn't bad. It looks like one of those trendy yogurt places. Small, bright colors and tons of people falling out of it.

To put this place to the test, I ordered their carne asada combo (comes with black beans and rice on the side) and a mango lemonade. I like the lemonade bar, that's a really cool idea. The space was small but we were able to grab a small table. I leaned back and noticed that the walls were lined with yellow astro turf. Pretty cool.

Our food came and it was presented nicely. I had my rice and beans in these cute square bowls. However, the beans were beans and the rice was not so nice. It was cheesy rice, topped with corn and tomatoes. Yucky and just didn't match the other flavors. Nothing Mexican about that. The carne asada burrito was my favorite. The grilled meat was tender and flavorful and the guacamole was spot on. My only complaint is that I wished they chopped the steak better. I've had to stop several times to pull a huge chunk of meat out of my burrito. 

It's good but not the best I've had. Nice try. And in true tradition of their other chains, overpriced for what you get.
