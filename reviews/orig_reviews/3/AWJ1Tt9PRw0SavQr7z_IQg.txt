This used to be my favorite place for burritos for YEARS. I'm talking 5 stars as far as taco joints go. Then last week, I saw the cook use the spatula to finish up my carnitas, right after he had just used the same spatula to put raw meat on the griddle!!! I have friends who are chefs and they would be FIRED for doing exactly that in most restaurants. Cross contamination isn't taken lightly by me and I will NEVER give Roberto's food to my kids.

** I've contacted Roberto's and they wrote back saying they'll take care of it. Whatever that means.

As for the food, they give you a lot of bang for the buck. Machaca burrito or torta has shredded beef with two fried eggs in it. It's loaded with guacamole and it's only $3.50. Their condiment bar is loaded with pickled jalape√±os & carrots, lime, green onions, radishes, cucumbers, salsa verde & roja. It's kept clean and fresh.

One of Roberto's sons once told me that this Roberto's is their busiest, hence it's open 24 hrs and is very clean. That's why I was shocked to see what I saw in the kitchen.
