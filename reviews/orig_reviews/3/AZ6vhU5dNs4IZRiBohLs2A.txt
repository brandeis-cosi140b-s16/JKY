I was excited to try this restaurant after nearly a year since trying it last.  But I think my expectations exceeded the results.  I tried the Taos Pork Tenderloin and was disappointed because the pork was cut into medallions, which I believe is the reason they were dry.  Frankly, I was happier with the side items: my mixed vegetables were good and cooked to perfection and the Jalapeno potatoes are awesome but apportioned too small.

My dinner companion had the Carlsbad Ribeye with which he was very happy.  I guess it was me who thought that the meal should be more balanced than this huge piece of meat (20 ounces) served with a tortilla smaller than my hand.

I remember the first time I visited, thinking that the waterfalls were an unusual touch, but the more I sat there, the more I found myself thinking of Gilligan's Island.  A little too corny for me, I guess.

Our service was great though; both the host and the server were really friendly.
