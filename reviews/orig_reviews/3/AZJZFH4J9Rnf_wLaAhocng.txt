Located in the Cosmopolitan is a bright great ambiance restaurant. Mexican and Chinese served together, tapas style . Earlier in the day i saw them making everything from scratch before the restaurant was open.

 Perfect for a group so you can taste a little bit of everything. Service is great we had our water up to the top the entire time.
There is a good selection on the menu so it's hard to decide what to try. We started with the chips with salsa. Chips have a great seasoning on them and the salsa was a chipotle type. (both delicious.) I ordered the Golden Pigs it comes four pieces and is a soft bread with bbq pork inside served with a side of condensed milk to dip it in.  Sounds odd but the mix is delicious, we had the cochinita taco and the chorizo fundido which comes with fresh tortillas The Quesidilla Chicarron was good too.

My one complaint would be the imported coca cola from Mexica at 5.88 in original bottle. 
All and all it was a great experience with delicious food and great service.
