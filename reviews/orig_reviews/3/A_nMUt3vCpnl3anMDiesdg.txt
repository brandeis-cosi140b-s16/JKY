I love coming here with co-workers for a nice hearty and spicy Mexican lunch. Basically everything on the menu is spicy so don't be too surprised if your mouth is on fire! I haven't been disappointed with any food options, but the service could use some work (hence the 3 and not 4). The same young lady seems to always be working and she is simply awful. Never smiles, cops an attitude when you ask to split checks, and NEVER checks on the table after food is delivered. Not sure if she has been there so long she doesn't care or maybe she is related to the owners? Plus side- if you check in on Yelp you'll get a free cheese crisp! Note: they are closed on Mondays.
