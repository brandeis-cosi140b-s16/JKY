Good food. Somewhat confusing concept. Ordered a chicken bowl. Assembly line is similar to Chipotle except the ingredients you can add were not explained very well. Missed the small type regarding $1.25 extra for saut√©ed peppers... Got pretty much everything in my bowl and it tasted like an Asian inspired rice bowl. Would probably come back again to try another type of meat.
