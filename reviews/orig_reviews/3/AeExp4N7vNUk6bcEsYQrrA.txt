I came here for dinner last night with my boyfriend, Lance. Lance has been to Cabo multiple times.. I've never been. My first impression was that it's awesome inside, laid back atmosphere. The beer he got was really good, but it had a funny name I don't remember what it was called.

The waitress brought over chips and the corn salsa that I read a lot about. It was dried out, and looked like it was old. Not impressed there. We then ordered a side of guacamole! THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I'll definitely recommend that.

Lance ordered the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos that were on Guy Fieri's show.. they were actually really tasty but a VERY fishy aftertaste. I've never tasted Mahi Mahi, so I'm not sure if that is normal. I ordered the Carne wrap which was just average.

Overall this place didn't really IMPRESS me as much as I thought it would. But I liked it.
