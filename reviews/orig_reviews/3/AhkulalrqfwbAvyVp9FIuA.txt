Maybe it was me not being from around the area but it was not easy to find the place to begin with. It is located in an interesting collection of buildings at the corner of an intersection and if there was signage out front I simply must have missed it.

We sat outside and service was great. I enjoyed the cactus margarita and despite the striking purple color. The 'shooters' were quite good and so was the Haas Avocado Guacamole. For the main course I had the Pulled Pork Chalupas which was a far departure from the Enchiladas I would usually go for on a Mexican outing.

Not being a fan of sour cream I forgot to pass on it when ordering but managed to work around it when eating. The bottom line was I found the food and service good but nothing above ordinary for Mexican/Southwestern fare. If that is all you are looking for this is a great place to go -- if you are looking for something more let me know what you find!
