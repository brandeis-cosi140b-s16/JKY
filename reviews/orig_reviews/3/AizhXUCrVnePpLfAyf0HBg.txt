I consider three stars a safe visit. Some people loved it, some people hated it.
That's life! 

It was a average restaurant. The chicken enchiladas were  OK. They didn't have a lot of taste. I didn't really like the beef tamale. It was too thick and lacked taste. The margarita was drinkable. I agree with the Yelpers...The salsa was DELICIOUS! You can't mess up rice and beans. My partner said that his chimichanga was OK.

If I lived in Tempe and lived close to there, I would probably go back. As a visitor, I won't go out of my way to go there during any visits to the Phoenix area.
