I entered the restaurant and stood at the counter for awhile before someone come from the back to help me. I looked over the menu and when with the Steak Taco and a Fish Taco as well as the special on the board a Green Chili Chicken Burrito... I rate the experience as followed.

The Steak Taco - B
Fish Taco - B
Green Chili Burrito - B+
Staff - C

I kind of wonder how a place like this can charge for a few chips but they do... All I wanted to do was enjoy some salsa and not get a dirty look and answer when I asked do you charge for chips... Spare me a few chips I just spent $14 bucks... But all in all I really enjoyed the meal I could eat a bowl of what was in the green chili burrito.
