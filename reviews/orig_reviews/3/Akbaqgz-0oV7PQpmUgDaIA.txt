3.5 stars actually.
I've been here before a few years ago and said to myself that I'd like to return and I finally made it back last week.
Sylvia's really does a good job with their chips and salsa-and after all, that's what sort of sets the pace for the meal.  You know the My Nana's tortilla chips you buy at the grocery store?  Same people!
I had the beef tacos lunch plate and they were good, nothing mind blowing, but good.  The rice and beans were not a complete afterthought like some places.  
I'm certain there are better Mexican restaurants but if I'm in the area I would go to Sylvia's again no problem.
