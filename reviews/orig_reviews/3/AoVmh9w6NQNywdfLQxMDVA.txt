This is a fancier, more expensive and slightly unhealthy version of Chipotle. 

Pros:
Food selection is good if slightly unhealthy.
Ingredients are fresh.
Decor is great.

Cons:
More expensive than chipotle and chipotle has more flavor.
Unhealthy sauce and cheese selections.
Food is somewhat bland and flavors are muted.
