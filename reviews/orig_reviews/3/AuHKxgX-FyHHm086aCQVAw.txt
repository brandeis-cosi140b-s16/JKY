After spending a long cold day moving my college student into an apartment,, we were hungry and thirsty (not necessarily in that order!).  Mad Mex was a few blocks away tucked away in the south oakland student neighborhhod.  After a giant plate of nachos,  and a tall margarita, the world was suddenly looking brighter.  In addition to the tasty margaritas, I was pleasantly surprised to find they had about a dozen craft beers on tap as well. They were running a special on Bells, $5 for 22 oz,   I tried the smitten golden rye, while my  IPA loving husband had the two hearted ale.  they were both exellent and went great with the food.  The food itself was decent if nothing amazing. I thought the nachos were a little dry, the burrito was good though.  the menu is huge and there are a lot of vegetarian options. would come back,especially for the craft beers.
