2 for 1 Happy Hour drinks after a long day at the ASD show. Nice atmosphere and food was okay. Waitress was nice but not generous.
I ordered the steak wet burrito which was yummy after a long day at a trade show and my sister ordered the tacos. We were famished and thirsty so this was good on an average level. We then ordered the hot wings to go for later since we knew we were heading straight back to the hotel room to .... sleep!
