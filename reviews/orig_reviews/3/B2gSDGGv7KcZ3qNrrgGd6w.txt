Was really disappointed. The place was messy the service sometimes there or not and the food was one dimentional. 

Menudo soup need the cilantro and onions that were on the side to give it some  spark.

The Platillo Guadalajara was good but easily be made at home better. Fresh items with not much herbs or spices added to them.

The only good thing was the Horchata that was perfectly sweet and spiced.

Hopefully just the items I chose. The nacho looked amazing. Steve L. better check them out.
