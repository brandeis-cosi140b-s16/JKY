I loved the turkey mole taco.  Basically it is gourmet street tacos.  At $3 per taco I would of preferred it wrapped better and 2 tortillas opposed to one for the taco. Yanquis right up the street $1 per taco gives me 2 & it's not falling apart when I pick up to eat it.  Also when I bring my $1 taco home it's not all over the box (see pix).  My wait was long I got there about 7:15 & it was packed.  I asked how long they had been open & the cashier said May.  I hadn't noticed the switch till recently but when I talked to one of the owners he mentioned they did their grand opening last week.  I got my 3 tacos at 8pm do the math (wow) which cost me $10 for what you see in the pix.  They where out of peppers at the condiment bar & running low on green salsa.  I asked owner who was running around cleaning everything  & he replied with they where out plus it was almost closing time (remember I got there at 7:15pm); next question what time do you close 9pm .  Overall tacos where good but make sure u place & tie up items before you leave.
