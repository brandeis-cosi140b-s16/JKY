Had credit from my diner's club membership with Lettuce Entertain You, which this place is part of, and was craving a margarita.
Red flag- chips and salsa are $3.95! What the deuce! Please, you gotta serve the chips on the house to call yourself a Mexican restaurant. 
No chips for me!
I had a prickly pear 'rita on the rocks which was muy tasty and generous on the tequila. The pork tacos platter was good, but hardly $15.95 good. The platter comes with 5 street taco sized corn mini tortillas and there was plenty to go on those. I requested the hottest salsa and it was hot and surprisingly not tomato based. Some yellow pepper...I think. Wasn't crazy about it but it went ok with the regular salsa. Service was meh, there were only a few diners where I was and my server never even asked to refill my marg! 
Can't think of a good reason to come back unless I need to use up some diner's club credit.
