I have been reading some the reviews about Pepes on here, let me say that I have never been ignored because employees were playing on their cell phones or any phone.  I have never been charged extra or charged for something I did not order, so I don't need to check my receipt, yes Justin G they do charge for using credit/debit, but so do a lot of other places........oh, and I'm white, so there goes that theory.  Now to my review. A few weeks ago I would have given 4 maybe 5 stars, however my last two trips were kinda not what was expected.   The asada burrito which was, in the past, busting with meat, now contains MAYBE half of what I used to get.  The quality is still there, unfortunately the quantity has disappeared, not sure why.  If this continues I may have to find another place to frequent, won't be Tacos El Gordo though, they don't do burritos.   Almost forgot, I have NEVER heard of or been told of any 30 minute time limit to eat!
