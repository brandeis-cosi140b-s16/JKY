We tried Modern Margarita on a weeknight and didn't read the reviews beforehand, but as many previous commenters have noted, it was So Loud! The music was way too loud for a restaurant. It wasn't a Saturday night at a club!

Besides the music, we had a pretty decent experience. The margaritas were good. We ordered a salsa flight, which was ok but it really seems they should offer complimentary chips and salsa. Alas, we had to pay for mediocre salsa and they were small portions so we had to pay again when we requested more. 

We ordered tacos and a salad and both were decent. I'm not sure this will become a regular place for us but we'll likely try it at least once more before we write it off totally. In the meantime, turn down that music!
