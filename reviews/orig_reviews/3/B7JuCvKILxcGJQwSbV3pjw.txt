Once again Yelp needs a half star rating because giving Mercadito a four is too high and a three is too low. 

I came here for industry night which offers 50% off the whole menu to business people in a variety of industries. It's a great way to give people in the industry who live near the strip a reason to venture out to the Red Rock area. 

When I walked up to Mercadito I was greeted by Jen the Marketing Manager. She was very personable and helpful. My friend and I ended up sitting at the bar outside because the inside of the restaurant was completely booked until hours later. I told the women working at the bar multiple times that when she had a chance I would like to get started with some appetizers. She took many drink orders from other people before taking my order. I ordered the mango guacamole with chile de arbol to start. It came out quickly and I appreciated seeing a different take on the traditional guacamole. The mango and chipotle went well together. For my main dish I ordered the carne asada plate. The epazote paired with the oregano gave the skirt steak a strong and salty flavor. Under the steak was a watercress-jicama slaw. The biter tang of the watercress and sweetness of the jicama slightly counterbalanced the saltiness of the steak but it was not enough. 

The decor is nice but the food needs some work.
