We wanted to try out Dick's Last Resort, but it was a little crowded, so we bee lined for this restaurant. I love Mexican food, just a heads up.....the Cadillac Margarita was small and not very strong, although made with fresh lime juice, so it's very refreshing. ($14.00) The chips are made with the tortillas there, you can tell, and they are really good......their fresh tortilla were amazing.....seriously some of the best I have ever tried. The Vegetarian Black Beans were great, the cheese is like a feta cheese, not my favorite, but my GF liked it a lot. Her BF ordered the Nachos, and they were just a huge portion size and very very good. The Shrimp Tacos were not too good in my opinion. Just difficult to eat, not a very good sauce and just not very good in general. The Fish Tacos, according to my friend were the best she ever had! My bean and cheese burrito was only $4.00 compared to their $16.00 meals, so I was very happy with it. Very filling, and just make sure you order it with Black Beans, cause I got the re fried beans the first time around and I didn't think they were very good. The salsa they have there is delicious. They are not cheap about it either, they keep it coming. The service was just OK though.
