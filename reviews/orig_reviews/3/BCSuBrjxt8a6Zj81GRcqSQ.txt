Well, I just got back from a trip to Vegas and have been craving some Mexican food. I came across this place and read a few of the reviews. It sounded great! 

I went to check it out, turns out that they were just getting ready to close, and there were a few customers finishing up their meal. The man at the counter seemed nice, but also seemed a little forced. I ordered the #3, 2 chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, and wanted to try the carne asada tacos too. Although the flavors were good and had a nice spice to them, I found some gristle in the chicken. I can over look that. Then the tacos seemed to be overly tough/chewy. I don't know...maybe I just came at a bad time. I'm willing to give this place another try, only I'll be sure to do it while they are not getting ready to close. I'll also post another review upon that time.
