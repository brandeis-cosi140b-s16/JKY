apas style with East meets... South? Chinese-Mexican fusion. Had the grapefruit vanilla Margarita which was light and refreshing for the warm weather. The chips and salsa are not that great. The chips are fresh though, and the salsa has a smokey flavor to it. 

I ordered the Silencio, the taco with duck tongue with lychee. It was a little on the salty side, but the flavors complimented each other. Definitely spicy!

Ordered When Pigs Fly, which was your basic bao (steamed pork bun). Nothing special really. Linda small to what I am personally used to back home.

The Dan Dan Moan noodle was noodles in a self-mix sauce noodle dish. It was alright. The sauce was kinda plain, noodles more doughy than expected. Not bad, worth a try.

Ordered the Ocean's Nest. Okay, it was Hong Kong style pan fried chow mein, with lobster. Still not impressed and definitely not worth $46.

The Empanada de Pollo con Mole Poblano was really good. The mole was complex, savory, rich, and authentic tasting. The outside was crispy, and the meaty filling was cooked just right.

For dessert, the Mango Sticky Rice was hyped up by our server. She described it as "light and refreshing," which it totally was. The rice was actually toasted rice krispies sprinkled on too of a coconut creme whipped topping. The mango underneath was so sweet and delectable, very nice finish to the meal. 

Overall, it was a great place to try. I personally like the Asian food back home. The Mexican food had a near modern twist, and the drinks were great and surprisingly strong. I give it 3 stars for food and price, it was expensive for what you get, but great service! Very attentive, sociable, and polite.
