I have visited Tex Tubb's approximately 3 times and mostly had success.  I need to break this review into two sections; food and service

So on the food side; the 2 times I was able to order food, the entrees ere great.  They are not the typical Mexican restaurant tacos; they have an eclectic variety of tacos and they all look interesting.  I like that you can order different tacos within the a two or three taco platter, or just a la carte.  I tried a chipotle beef braised, the tilapia, and green chile chicken and all were very tasty and I would go back for any of these again, or at least I tried to get them again.

As I said, I have visited this established 3 times, but only had their food twice.  I went in on a non busy Saturday afternoon about 3 weeks ago.  I was seated immediately, a nice small table in the front, and waited for service.  I watched one server walk by to deliver some food after about 4 minutes, watched her walk back towards the kitchen.  Waited another five minutes to see her walk by again with food and return to the kitchen.  So 13 minutes in, no water, no drink order, I asked the bartender is she could send the server my way.  5 minutes later another party of 4 came in, sat close to me and she waited on them, disappearing quickly with their drink order.  Time for me to go....

So, I will probably not be back as that type of service really irritates me.  But I cannot down the place completely because the food is good and unique.

I recommend you give it a try, but be weary of passing servers!!
