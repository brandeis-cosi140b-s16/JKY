Went here with my parents awhile back. They were very accommodating for our situation, as my brother is in a wheel chair so we needed some extra room.

Don't get me wrong, 3 stars is good! It was great! I enjoyed all of the food, but the prices were high. It is expected though, I mean come on you're in vegas and when are you going to have chinese mexican fusion? All of the items were delicious and our palates were satisfied.

I would recommend this place to someone as I want them to try the food out. Not sure if I'd come back again, but I'm glad I came!
