Although the location is a little random, connected to a hotel, and the front door was basically closed shut, Azteca was overall better than what I expected. The chips came out hot with two salsa, one more traditional and another slaw like salsa. The traditional salsa had a nice kick, however the other one was ugh, not really sure what it was. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas. The fajitas were steaming with onions, peppers and tomatoes and were good, nothing spectacular. The beans and rice, on the side, were also just okay, nothing extraordinary. The service was good and overall I enjoyed my visit.
