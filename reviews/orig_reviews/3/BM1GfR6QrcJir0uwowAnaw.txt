Margaritas are pricey but good. They let you pick your tequila which is nice if you know what you're wanting. Blue corn coconut shrimp appetizer was super. Only four but that's to be expected. The Drunken chicken nachos were HOT. I like hot but this was lips on fire hot and there's nothing telling you that when you order so my sis couldn't eat them. The chicken was kind of soupy so it made the chips mushy which I don't like. Also, the chips were bottom of the bag, small pieces. I've never had that even in the cheapest dives. Makes me suspect that all those fancy tequilas they're offering are probably one cheap, bottom of the barrel brand.
