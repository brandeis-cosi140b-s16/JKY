Hmm, I am kind of torn on this one. Big thumbs up to Upward Projects for the renovation on the building. The vibe and the decor are top notch. I only wish the food matched the building. The drinks are very good - Blood Orange Margarita was very good. Also, a few good Mexican beers on the menu. As for the food, I was not really impressed. The nachos were okay, but not great. The ceviche was overwhelmed by the lime. I had "The Beast" burrito enchilada style. It had an underlying sweet taste that was simply unappealing.

I am sure that there are great things on the menu; however, the items on that picked would not be on that list. 

N*joy
