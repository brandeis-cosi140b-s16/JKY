2011 update

Still a great place to start an evening. But I honestly feel the Vibe has been eaten by 15 year old punk rock homeless youth. Ladies Night is still a great idea. And as far as location its Ideal. But the food is not for me, maybe I've had it too much, it seams inconsistant. But a great place still to drop by for a bucket of beers.

***old review***
I have to put in a good word for my favorite bar that's actually a bar at all, but rather a cantina. Two happy hours every day from 5 to 7 and 10 to 11 make this place both laid back and dangerous. Their motto should be 'anything goes' as they have long put up with all types of drunken debauchery. The patio is great for long summer nights and the wood tables are free game for any would be artists. Also, one of the greatest pleasures in life is swaying in the hammock with a bucket of beer in easy reach. The beer selection consists of cheep domestics, many American Craft beers and a smattering of fine imports. Also the food makes for perfect fuel to power through a night of intoxication, I recommend the carnitas, vegitarian tofu or bombbay tacos.
