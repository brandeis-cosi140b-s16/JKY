Not sure why this place has 4 stars.  I will say the server was friendly and attentive, but the food wasn't memorable.  The chips were stale and the margaritas were too sweet.  My mom ordered the flautas and they were pretty bland.  My husband and I split the chimichanga and it wasn't bad, but not one I would crave in the future.  We likely won't be back as there are other outstanding places in the Valley I would choose.
