It's a cool place! More for the kiddie crowd. Everyone trying to be all like that! Cool, or "I'm the most beautiful girl in the world" mode! Wife and I started with the Los Nachos, This was my favorite of the night! Chips piled up high with black beans, chicken, pablabo sauce and cheese! I ordered their Al Pastor tacos, wife had their beef tacos. Al Pastor was just OK, if you ever had Al Pastor, you know what kind of explosive flavor it should have! This one didn't!! Wife's taco was actually better then mine! It had shredded beef that was soaked in its juice, in a fried shell. Very good taco. Tacos come with beans and rice. Rice wasn't that good, tasted like it came out of the box. Beans had no flavor, NOTE!! Black beans were a lot better!!! We also shared a prickly pear margarita, very strong! (glad we shared it!!) I have had better. We had a good time, service was great all away around! If I was back in the area, I could see myself going there again.
