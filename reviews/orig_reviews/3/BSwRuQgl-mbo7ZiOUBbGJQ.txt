We went there cuz it was close to Scottsdale Stadium and the airport on the recommendation of a employee at a local business.  It was exactly a she described it: good food [not fabulous] old fashioned diner decor.  We had excellent service from a young man who has worked there 14 years who was the only waitperson on duty until 5:00.  He managed to be quick, efficient AND friendly and did not make us uncomfortable because he was swamped.

Seems like there are many neighborhood regulars.

3.5 stars for me if possible.
