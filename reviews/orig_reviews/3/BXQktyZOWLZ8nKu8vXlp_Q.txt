My favorite part about this place is the chips they bring out for the chips and salsa. They make their own flour tortilla chips. Yes, flour. The texture is a fun and an interesting change from the typical tortilla chip. They do throw in a few regular chips, I think to fill out the bowl and satisfy those who like normal chips and salsa better.

Their salsa is good but I am not a fan of olives in my salsa. Seems like a odd addition, but easy enough to eat around.

If you go on the weekend they have a free chocolate fountain between 10am-2pm. The first time I saw it I thought it was an odd compliment to a Mexican food meal. But hey, it's chocolate... So do yourself a favor and have dessert first. You want to make sure you have room, right?

They do offer a free "buffet" during happy hour. It used to be better and more offerings years ago but it's still nice to have complimentary food to munch on during happy hour. 

Good food. Standard Mexican fare. Not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce, which I keep forgetting since I typically get a burrito "enchilada style". But I keep coming back for those delicious chips and forget I should get something different from my usual.
