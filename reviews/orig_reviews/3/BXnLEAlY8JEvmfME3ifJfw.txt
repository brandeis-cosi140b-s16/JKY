It was 10:30pm and we needed to eat ASAP.  We really wanted to eat at Wicked Spoon but sadly, we got there at 10:03 and they close at 10pm.  So we walked around for 20 minutes through The Cosmopolitan trying to find anything that sounded good.  We found this place and it looked and sounded decent enough.  And who doesn't like a place where you can order both Asian and Mexican?

After a short wait, we were seated and it seemed to take awhile to see our waiter and then get our orders in.  In the meantime, I ordered a salt air margarita.  It was super tasty but for $14, it was kind of teeny.  Especially when it seems the foam takes up 1/3 of the glass.  But it was a really superb margarita.

My friend ordered the fried buns with the condensed milk glaze.  I wasn't sure about them but they were actually kind of amazing.  I ordered the chicken poblano taco and the lobster taco.  The poblano taco was really good.  I should've just ordered two or three of those and been done but the lobster taco sounded so enticing.  Um, not so much.  It wasn't great and at $10, it was highway robbery.  All the other reviews are right.  These tacos are all crazy overpriced and they're tiny.

We ended with the sticky rice and mango dessert.  Not at all what I imagined but we still ate every last bite.

This place isn't bad, it was just a let-down.  I had high hopes looking at the menu and was a bit underwhelmed by the food and overwhelmed by the prices.  I wouldn't say not to eat here, just know what to expect.
