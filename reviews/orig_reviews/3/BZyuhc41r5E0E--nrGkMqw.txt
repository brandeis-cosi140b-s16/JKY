4:00 am tacos? check

Tacos el Gordo definitely has the right idea about tacos. Unfortunately, having had some great tacos in LA and south of the border, I can say they aren't quite top tier. That being said, they are one of the best taquerias in Las Vegas. I would come back, but if a King Taco ever opens in the city, there would be no contest. 

Pros:
-Good price, open late
-Lengua and cabeza held their own; both were cooked well, moist, and flavorful, if a bit under-spiced
-Their red sauce/salsa was great
-"insert meat choice" fries

Cons
-The adobada, which they are apparently known for, was chewy, dry, and pretty lacking in any flavor whatsoever (resembling styrofoam perhaps)
-The ordering situation is, well, a situation. Be prepared to wait three times as long if you happen to want meets from three different stations.
