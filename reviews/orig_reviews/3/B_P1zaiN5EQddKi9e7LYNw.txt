The Good: 
Pretty decent Taco. Some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh (not saying much? still saying something!) with numerous options and solid chips and salsa
The enclosed patio is fantastic. You feel like you're sitting in your charming hipster friend's backyeard
Decent Tequila/Mezcal selection and cocktails 

The Bad:
Tacos are way over priced. You'd probably expect twice the food for the price.
The House Margarita is baaaaaaaaaaaasically just orange juice

The Ugly:
Worst Service in Pittsburgh? Worst Service in the world? Current working theory is that they actually pay the waiters to be surly and mix up orders to contribute to the overall ambience. It once took almost two hours just to place our food order. Just get two pitchers of margaritas at a time, because you may never see your waiter again.
