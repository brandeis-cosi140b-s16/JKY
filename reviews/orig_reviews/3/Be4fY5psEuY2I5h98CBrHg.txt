Ate dinner here a couple times and was unimpressed with it both times.  Super Americanized Mexican food at Vegas prices.  

BUT I do go back every time for a dreamsicle.  By far, my favorite drink in Vegas.  You can just go up to the bar and order it to go.  They also have a branch in the mall next to Planet Hollywood.  The La Salsa outside of The Forum Shops does not serve dreamsicles though.  Sad.
