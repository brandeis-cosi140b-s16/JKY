Well where do I start. We were seated quickly and it took about 5 minutes for our server to even greet us. She asked if we wanted chips and salsa and assuming that this was like %99.99999 of other restaurants we said sure. Thanks for charging us for chips and salsa. I'm a chef and the cost of this is negligible and yet they nickel and dime you on this??? I'd advise bringing in a garden hose or a trough of water because they obviously don't get the concept of thirst here. I will say the short rib was awesome!!! The food was good and all but the service took away from the experience...
