I came here for a late dinner on a Wednesday evening with the hubby and an out of town friend in tow.  I was already in a good mood after beer tasting at the common market and I figured this would be the perfect time to try out Three Amigos.
I was already expecting a hole in the wall kind of place from all the reviews.  The dining area is set up much like a fast food restaurant with laminated plastic booths lining one wall and a few tables in the middle of the floor.  A quick glance at the number of customers gave me a boost of confidence that our food would come quick because we were all starving.  Unfortunately, the service was terribly slow.  It took quite a while to explain what we wanted to our waitress (she was baffled by the fact that I wanted a beer and my husband did not).  Once we came to an understanding we still had to wait for quite a while for our food to come out.
The food was pretty good.  I got some chicken enchiladas with beans and rice.  The ingredients all seemed very fresh and the dish had just the right amount of spice to it (I like it hot!).  Everyone at the table seemed happy with their food.
I want to come back and give them another try to see if the service is any quicker.  The quality of the food is definitely good for the price.
