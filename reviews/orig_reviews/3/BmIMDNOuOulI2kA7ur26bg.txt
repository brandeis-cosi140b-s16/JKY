Pretty hit or miss.  Cornbread was great, the place was really empty when we went, but/so the service was great, nice and conversational.  We got the salsa trio and the red salsas were great.

Other than that, the chicken tortilla soup, crab spinach dip, catfish tacos, and the stuffed poblano pepper were really all rather unremarkable and I can't say I recommend a visit.
