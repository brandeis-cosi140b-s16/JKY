The décor is great.... very chic and inviting! The food is outstanding, but the service needs serious improvement! 

I was meeting a few girlfriends for dinner, and two of us had arrived a lil early so we were waiting at the bar until our table was ready, it took 15 minutes for a bartender to even speak to us, and they have a tiny bar area that was not full. From what I could see.... they appeared to have a good happy hour menu, although we didn't get to sample any of it since the bartender took too long to acknowledge us.

We were then seated, and the bad service continued, not very attentive at all.

For food...my friend and I each ordered an entrée item so that we could share, we tried the filet mignon and the diablo shrimp. The flavors were great! 

This restaurant has so much potential, but the service needs some help to succeed!
