First of all, this place is VERY NOISY!! Is is also busy in there. Pretty packed. It is a somewhat small place & kind of cramped, but has very cool, artsy paintings on the walls, & the bathrooms are very decorative! The food is pretty good, not amazing, but not horrible, either.  The food did take a while to come out.
