I ordered a carne asada burrito, a margarita and some chips n salsa. My son had chicken strips and fries off kids menu, my mom had a steak and a fish taco.

They forgot the chips as well as the margarita. I had to go up and remind them of both before I got them.

Burrito came and asked for tapatio or hot sauce (typical at traditional Mexican restaurants). They advised me they only had salsa at the salsa bar (which is mediocre at best).

I will say the steak in the burrito was high quality and tender. Overall the burrito was quite tasty. The tortilla was very thin however and the whole burrito fell apart after a few bites.

If you don't mind average/slightly above average Americanized Mexican food and dodgy service then this place might be for you. As for me being Mexican American and somewhat of a connoisseur of fine Mexican food, I'll probably never go back.
