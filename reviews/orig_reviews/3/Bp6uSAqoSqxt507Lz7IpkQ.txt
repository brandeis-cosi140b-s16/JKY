We must have come at a bad time, Saturday lunch.  The food was good (a bit over priced), but the service was poor this time.  The waitress did not understand that the nacho appetizer was supposed to come out before the main course, but she did take it off the tab when we sent it back.  I had to basically track down a bus boy on several occasions for refills and clearing empty plates.  We will go back, I hope this was just an anomaly.
