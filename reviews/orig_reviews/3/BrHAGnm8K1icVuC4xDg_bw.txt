Came here for the Oregon Ducks block party. Nothing special about the food with the exception of the appetizer dips.  I tried the pork Chile Verde cheese dip  and it had a lot of flavor but got mushy since it was mixed with cheese and sour cream.  Good place for drinks but could do without the food.
