Cool decor & great mixologist who loved his job. Bottle beer was warm. That dropped 2 stars right there (Dear bar management, always get this one thing right...COLD beer). Mojito was excellent. Bartender created a watermelon drink for me that was really tasty. The place was empty so that detracted from the fun I was anticipating. Overall they could do a lot more with this place than they have as far as menu goes.
