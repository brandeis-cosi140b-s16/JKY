I've only been here once, but I had the burger and it was big and it was good.  I'm not saying it was the best burger I've ever had, but I'd much rather support this Old Town Scottsdale standby than a fast food chain around the corner.  The service was friendly, and I dig the 50's vibe they've got going on.  I'd definitely go here again.
