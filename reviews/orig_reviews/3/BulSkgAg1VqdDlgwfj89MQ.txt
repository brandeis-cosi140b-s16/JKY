If I could describe Barrio Cafe in one word it would be OVERPRICED. I told the bartender I wanted a margarita but not too sweet and he suggested the lowrider. The margarita was expensive but it was strong and one of the best I have ever had. It didn't bug me that they served bread and tapenade instead of chips and salsa. I found the change refreshing and the tapenade was delish! We ordered guacamole while we decided what we wanted to eat. I didn't like the pomegranates in the guacamole and I had to salt it up a bit. We also ordered some fundido dip that was almost cold when we dipped into it. We asked for them to reheat it and I noticed they guy sitting next to us sent back his seafood dish for the same reason.....wasn't cooked well enough. You shouldn't be having these problems when you are paying an arm and a leg for your meal. I ordered the surf and turf for $46 dollars. It came with filet mignon topped with chorizo and goat cheese on top of mashed potatoes and a lobster tail. It was good but they undercooked my steak and the lobster tail didn't taste like it was as fresh as the waiter described. He said they fly in the seafood fresh daily. Even though the food is really good it is way overpriced. I would rather eat at Gallo Blanco for half the price.
