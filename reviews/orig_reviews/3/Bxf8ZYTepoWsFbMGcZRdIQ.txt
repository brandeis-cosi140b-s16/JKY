When this place opened, I just had to try it. They've really expanded their menu since then and it reminds me a lot of Chipotle, but more authentic. They're a little bit pricey, and it's kind of hard to order because it's so loud in there. It's also a little bit confusing to order. I prefer other taco shops, more authentic and cheaper.
