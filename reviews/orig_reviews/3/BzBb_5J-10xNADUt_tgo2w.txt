I was in such a good mood to write something positive, after all it was 80 degrees, sunny and we were sitting outside on the colorful patio pretending it was summer instead of the 10 degrees we left back home in Minneapolis.

On the positive side our server stopped by our table right away with a huge bowl of crispy chips and two large bowls of salsa. We ordered two patron margaritas that came pretty quickly and were good, although clearly not made with fresh juice.

As for the food, its a bit on the mass market side in terms of taste and flavor and certainly not the authentic Mexican I was hoping for.  Perhaps I've just gotten spoiled by the number of great new places serving fresh exciting Mexican food.

If you have kids and are looking for something mild, then this could be the place.
