what does HUSSONG have to do with a Cantina?
I LIKE the music they play here, a little funky vibe! the service was great and the tortilla soup was g oo d! the tacos, umm not the best in town like they boasted, but not bad. any place calling themselves a cantina, should serve complimentary chips & salsa, thats all im saying!
