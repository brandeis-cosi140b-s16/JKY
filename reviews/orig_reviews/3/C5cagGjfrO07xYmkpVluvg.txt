3.5 stars actually. This location is HUGE! I mean HUGE! The area that we were in for my friend's party held a good 60+ of us with no problem. Although the service was great and the food was ok but the lighting was terrible. That was my only gripe. Where the food was set up for the party, was not in a well lit area at all. Could you see? Yes but it was VERY dark compared to not only the rest of the restaurant but even the area where we could sit and mingle. If they would have set this up in a different area, then I could easily give this a good solid 4 stars.. All in all great service considering it was a party of 60+.
