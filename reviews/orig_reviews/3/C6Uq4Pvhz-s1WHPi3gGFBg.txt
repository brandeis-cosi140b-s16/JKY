Weekday dinner. Tried the ahi tuna, guac n salad. They got the flavours right. Tuna was done just tight. Guac had a kick to it and salad was fresh. The churros were the best part with a crisp finish, sugary texture and an awesome chocolate sauce. Not bad for a work night! Didn't try any drinks though.
