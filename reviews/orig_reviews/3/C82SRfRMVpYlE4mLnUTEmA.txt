Convenient bar to kill some time at, grab a drink or watch bad karaoke performances (well on Thursdays at least).  

You may gasp at this, but for $13 you can order a "make your own margarita."  Where you can pick your tequila brand.  I mean, why you would pick anything other than Patron is beyond me, but to have a set price for Patron is a score in my book... and probably a "cheap price" in Vegas!

We ordered a nacho platter which was pretty pitiful.  I think there were maybe 10 chips in it and a spoonful of gauc.  Pretty lame nacho platter if you ask me!  

Plus, after midnight, well drinks are only $3.  Now THAT'S a jackpot in Vegas!
