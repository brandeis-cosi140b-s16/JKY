Drinks, chips, salsa, guacamole, and shrimp dishes were sublime.  The atmosphere is warm, pretty, and everyone we saw there was very nice, the service was great.  But, only three stars because this was just the first visit and we weren't over the moon. That said, I'll *definitely go back * to enjoy all the good stuff and retry a few dishes -- and it's about 1/2 hour drive for us across town, that is, it's worth the trip.
