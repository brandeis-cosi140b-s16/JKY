We eat here regularly and have been working our way through the menu. All of the shrimp and grilled tacos are excellent and the namesake Cabo Fish Taco is decent. They changed their menu around recently and the newly added carne asada taco is great--tender, juicy steak with nice chunks of jalapeno for some kick. The side dishes are inconsistent, but at their worst are pretty good. The only negative is that sometimes dishes can be a little sweet and... cinnamon-y? Especially the corn salsa and refried beans.

The service is laid-back and can occasionally be sloppy. At times, it seems like the staff can't handle big crowds, which is inexcusable for a restaurant that's consistently packed-with-waiting-list on Friday and Saturday nights.
