My very first time at Nacho Daddy was at this location, I had the spicy buffalo chicken nachos and they were seriously wonderful. :) 

My only complaint was that the water tasted like straight chlorine and the ice cubes were an unnatural white color. 

The decor also needs some saving, there's a million TV's but they need some warmth and decoration, the place has absolutely no character or vibe.
