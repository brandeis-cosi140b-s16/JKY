The food has always been great and their strawberry coconut mojitos are one of my favorite drinks.  Our only complaint is they have messed up our reservations a couple of times so we had to cancel or wait (and the wait can be very long.)  My husband lacks the patience that I have but since we both enjoy the food, I keep prodding him to go back again.  Any time we've had an issue, the staff are apologetic and do try their best to make up for it.  The atmosphere is very nice; I really love the steak tacos and pumpkin bread pudding (amazing!)
