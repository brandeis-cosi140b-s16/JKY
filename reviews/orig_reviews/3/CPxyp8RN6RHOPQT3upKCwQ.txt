Not a bad place, just not up to par with their other offerings like Windsor and Federal Pizza. I've been twice now, and tried several of their tacos. I think the Cochinita Pibil was my favorite so far, and the sweetness of the pineapple made it stand out. None of the tacos were bad, but no other ones particularly stood out.

On my first trip I had the Cucumber Serrano cocktail, which I quite liked. On the second trip I went with the house margaritas, which were pretty nice by house marg standards.

The decor was nice, and the service was good both times, so no real complaints there. But if you're in that area looking for a tasty, relaxing bite and a drink I think you'll do better at Postinos overall.
