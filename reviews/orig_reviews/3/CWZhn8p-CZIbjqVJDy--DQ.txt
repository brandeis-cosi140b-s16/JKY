I gave it a 3 stars due to the fact the staff is pretty nice, place is clean and I only had one item on the menu. With that out of the way here is my huge disappointment, I ordered a carne asada burrito for 7 bucks and it was a tiny burrito was my first thought ( had it to go so it was wrapped). I though well it must be out of this world good!! When I opened it it was dripping with grease the I had to dry it with napkins I took a bite and I felt the grease running down my throat, I don't know if they use grease to cook the meat with the veggies or it's the cheese they used... But it was gross. Couldn't really enjoy the taste because of the grease, my hands and I'm not joking; felt like they went through lotion therapy! Anyway based on that I'm not sure yet if I want to go back and try something else.
