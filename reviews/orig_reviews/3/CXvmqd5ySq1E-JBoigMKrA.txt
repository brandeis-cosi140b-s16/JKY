A Friday afternoon lunch by myself away from work landed me at Pinches.

I had heard and read the upheaval regarding the name of this establishment and needed to stop by at least once to see it in person. It is in the Container Park, which was nice enough, but considering I was on a lunch break and I just wanted to eat I was pleased to see there was not much of a line outside PInches (which, by the way - does not have its actual NAME on the restaurant).

The place is cramped, to put it lightly. However, the menu board is bright with neon colors chalked on. Select from tacos (of course), burritos, and even Mexican breakfast items. I will be back for you chilaquiles.

You walk up the line and finally get to the cash register and are unceremoniously cramped against people attempting to get to the ONLY soda fountain in the entire place. The place is just entirely too small. But, I ordered an al pastor burrito, with no cilantro, and a small drink, made my way out of the cluster-F of people and sat at one of the two tables they have to the side inside the restaurant. 

Al pastor burrito - comes with meat, beans, salsa, and rice. Meat was not super tasty the way al pastor should be. I was disappointed. Taco y Taco has better al pastor by a long shot. However, burrito was nicely done, ingredients dispersed. You get what you get - and guess what? This place is in a touristy destination, it's a tiny place, and you can't see the meat they're using rotating beautifully, being sliced before your eyes. So - there ya go. 

It is not bad, nor is it great. There are plenty of places around town you can get AMAZING food like this (and probably for less). I would suggest one of the many places on Charleston Blvd.

Anyway, I'll probably be back during another of my lunch breaks for the chilaquiles. If those are any good, the review may change.
