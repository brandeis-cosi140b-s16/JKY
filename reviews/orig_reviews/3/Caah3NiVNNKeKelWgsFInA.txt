CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: I can definitely sink my teeth into their vampiros again but everything we ate had a "but".  It was good, but...

THE MEAT: The restaurant space is large and yellow and very clean, greeting you with yummy aromas and shoulder bopping Mexican music.  They have an open kitchen and a veggie/salsa bar too.  We had the large Lengua Taco (the tongue was cooked perfectly, BUT it was bland, and it came with beans and equally bland guacamole so the whole thing was bland), the Nachos with Chorizo (this was good, BUT the guacamole was bland and the nachos itself were fried/very greasy) and finally, the Al Pastor Vampiros (this was VERY good but the meat was a little dry. Still, this was almost perfect, try it with another meat).  I regret not ordering the corn!  We were too full by the time I remembered. Sniff.  Will we go back?  Maybe for the corn and vampiros.

I'M STILL DIGESTING... that bland guac.  It needed onion, tomatoes, acid, salt and a lot of love.

WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-)
