El Dorado Cantina is a really interesting, weird little spot that I did enjoy the experience/service of although I think my expectations may have been set too high in terms of the food.  

To find El Dorado Catina, literally look for Sapphire as this restaurant will be right next to the entrance (co-owned? not sure).  I walked from Trump although the walk isn't exactly in the friendliest of areas so just be aware.  

Come in - the service was pretty quick at around 7PM on a Friday night.  My server was very kind and knowledgeable.  To begin with, there are free chips and a few different sauces.  The sauces were really delicious and you're given a ton of chips.  Although one of the sauces I thought lacked flavor, one of the green sauces was awesome with a good spice and kick.  I then went onto the friend grasshoppers as it was a free Yelp check-in item.  Again, you're given quite a plentiful amount.  As my server told me - it's a very peculiar taste and very salty like a potato chip.  Definitely doesn't look as appetizing as it tastes but pretty fun for the adventurous/those that are fans.  Then I got the chicken bowl which came with rice/some veggies/chicken/guac.  The bowl was okay - I've had similar tasting bowls at other restaurants and for cheaper prices so I wasn't too blown away.  The house margarita too was just okay - you're given a pretty big cup for about +$10 but the taste wasn't too unique/distinct.  

Perhaps I should have focused more on the other items on the menu or haven't found that one dish that really knocks me out of the park.  Either way, the experience was solid and I'll definitely make another visit to give it another try!
