Average food and average service. I like this place because it's close and will go here again, but I would not honestly think of taking a group or a guest here. Other places near here have more "must go" appeal. The Anaheim rellenos were pretty good and of course the fluffy chips are great, but I have never had a memorable dish here.

Although we have been here 5-6 times, we just noticed that they have changed  the decor and have a better tequila menu. So, I guess that means we never go inside... The patio is very cool when they have the guitar duet playing there, but I think that is the only reason I would come back.
