Came here on a Tuesday for the dollar tacos after reading some pretty good Yelp reviews and I wasn't really impressed. The chips were pretty stale and tasteless and my tacos had a ton of lettuce with very little meat. The atmosphere, crowd and DJ were good tho and my margarita was pretty delicious. Not a big fan of the food but I might come back for drinks one day.
