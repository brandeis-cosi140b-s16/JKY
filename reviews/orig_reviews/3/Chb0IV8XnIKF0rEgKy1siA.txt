We stopped in last night for dinner after hearing all of the hype and were actually somewhat disappointed.  The staff was very friendly and walked us through the menu by allowing us to try some of their most popular items - bonus!  The food was just ok...not overly flavorful and a little overcooked.  I tried the jade chicken with chicken fried rice and thought it was good, certainly not great.  However, I barely made it home before the food went right through me...not good!  This place is popular, so it is doing something right, but it didn't win me over and make me a fan.
