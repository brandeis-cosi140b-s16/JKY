The food here is pretty decent but the atmosphere creeps me out the most. 

It's pretty grungy looking on the inside and the people that walk in are usually bros who want some margs and wings. While they do have some good items on their menu like their hummus and the angry hippy quesadilla, I'm still put off by their cleanliness and the fact that it's so dark there I can't see my food.
