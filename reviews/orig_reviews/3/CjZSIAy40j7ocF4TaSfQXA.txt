Went on a Friday night and started in the bar area for drinks.  One of the bartenders seemed a bit new at mixing which resulted in my spicy tequila drink being mostly tequila.  I was a bit happy after that!  

We were seated about 30 min. later outside.  The service was nothing to write home about.  The bussers seemed pissed off and our server was neither friendly or rude.  She hardly spoke.  Moving on, we ordered our food and started with the guacamole and chips.  It was pretty darn good.  Next, I had the street tacos which were pretty small but due to the chips and guac, way too much food.  We also ordered the french fries- bleh.  The beer selection was pretty light.  I think there were only 3 or 4 beers offered, draft and bottled.  They didn't have corona which I thought was strange for a mexican restaurant but they did have tecate.  All good.

I'll probably be back because sitting outside in this quiet neighborhood was pleasant and the mixed drink variety was pretty good.
