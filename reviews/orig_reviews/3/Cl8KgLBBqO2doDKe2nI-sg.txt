The Linq, its Outdoor Mall stores, the High Roller Wheel    
is good for one maybe two visits by out of towners. Flamingo, Cromwell Casino is So So Tiny. Chayo is expensive. Think most Diners will face Big Foodie Hits or $$Disappoints. I liked the Steak Fajitas, pork rind with awesome AWESOME GUAC. Being that this is Vegas we can Blow this Dinner cost quickly on the Slots. Thus I feel on the good foods we had was 5 stars. The bad foods 1 star. The prices 2 stars. The Comfy interior 4 stars. The only sad thing is with our $70 for dinner we COULD HAVE WON $THOUSANDs on Slots. But thats Vegas. What happens in Vegas... Stays in Vegas. Would you Feel Raped? Can we say Happy. Ok. Chayo's, the Linq, its Outdoor stores Yelp Rated... 3.5 stars.

Oh if you do the High Roller Wheel this time of Year... you will freeze freeze freeze freeze your butt off.

Oh. What the Hell man. No Salsa came with our MEXICAN FOODS. At $70
