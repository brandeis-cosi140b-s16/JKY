Well....out of all the Michoacan family of restaurants, I would rank this my #3 choice, with Viva being #1 and Lindo being #2.

There's a couple of reasons for this -

1.) Viva gives you complimentary fideo soup when requested. If it doesn't come with an entree, Bonito charges you $2.50 for it. It's good soup but not worth paying $2.50 when it costs probably $.25/cup to make. 
2.) The customer service is off par from the rest. I experienced a rude, short tempered server today at lunch. When I advised my meal came out wrong, he refuted "well this is the way you told me you wanted it!". Well, actually that's not the way I told you and I wouldn't be telling you it was wrong if you just listened the first time. My last visit, when I asked the question "what is fundido dip?" I was treated like I was stupid for not knowing. It was off putting.
3.) The busser was kind but she was bad at refilling drinks. My one pet peeve is drink refills. Don't keep me hanging....
4.) The chips and bean dip that come out are bland. Do they use different chips & dip than the other Michoacan resturants? I'm not certain but they don't taste as good here. 

There are good things about the resturant as well - 

1.) They have an extensive Mexican themed menu with many options for even the pickest of eaters. My favorites are the beef chimichangas and the beef flour flautas. Their spanish rice is decent and their refried beans are good & consistent. I tried my friends carne asada steak today and it was juicy and yummy. Their homemade flour tortillas are delish!
2.) They run resonably priced lunch specials. For two of us, we escaped at around $20.00...not bad for a sit down lunch. 
3.) It seemed as though before our tushs hit the seats that there were chips and dip on the table. We were immediately asked what we would like to drink. Very speedy in this regard.
4.) Pleasant hostess staff, large restaurant seating areas and a full service bar.
