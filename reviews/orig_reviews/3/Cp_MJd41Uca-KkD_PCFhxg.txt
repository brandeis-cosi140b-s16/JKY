While I'd never discourage someone from making their own discoveries our food experience was borderline horrible. 

The cocktails (margaritas are topped with salted air which were refreshing and unique) and beers were spot on and the service polished and sharp. However the overpriced food was hit and miss. Sui mai should be avoided (weird spongy texture and off tasting) as well as the weird tasting Dan Dan Mian and the ugly Dancing Eggplant. 

Bright spots were the 20 Vegetable Fried Rice (awesome), Unruly Monk, Guacamole, Rou Jia Mo Sandwich and the Queso Fundido. Tacos are 2 bites and are $5.50 for one which I couldn't swallow the price tag so we skipped the tacos. Bill was $240+ tip for 3 people. We left buzzed and full but we'd have a hard time going back except for drinks and maybe a few of the bright spots mentioned above.

If you want killer dumplings and regional Chinese food go to Chinatown. For Mexican food there are loads of more affordable and tastier options off strip.
