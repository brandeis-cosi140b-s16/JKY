The margaritas were delicious that night.  The tequila rolled over my tongue with a sexiness I hadn't felt in a long time.  God, I miss margaritas.  That's what I get for being on weight watchers.  That even after only two my body was revolting on Saturday morning.

The music was a little loud, perhaps.  The waiter was a bit too happy, perhaps.  But this IS Vegas.  And the cheesy chicken thing I had was delicious.

I believe that if I cared more about seeing and being seen, I'd like this place a little more. But I could care less and really just want good drinks, good food, and good service.  So, I'd say that Pink Taco adequately fills the bill.
