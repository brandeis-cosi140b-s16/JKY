Egg and steak burrito, minus the cheese and tortilla. Overall not bad, portion was good and potatoes crispy, steak was a little tough. Only issue i had was kitchen staff with facial hair were not wearing facial hair nets. Don't know if that's a food handlers rule or not but I found it a little gross.
