Oh you Senorita, somehow you are a strange antidote the end of a week. When I decided to plan Happy Hour for my co workers we were looking for someplace casual and low key with Margaritas and snack. I was also personally hoping for a little volleyball. So off to Silly Senorita, I mean Salty Senorita we go.  Yup they have a volleyball court , chips and yummy guac  as well as powerful house margs.

Now I haven't been much of a happy hour person lin the last couple of years but I was surprised how unhelpful and slow there staff was at 4:00 pm on a Friday , were they waiting for more waitresses to show up ? Were they overwhelmed by the 2 people sitting at the bar? Were we sitting too far away with our group of fifteen to be noticed? Whatever.. The drinks were cheap and strong ( insert joke here) and my co workers with toddlers felt comfortable to bring their kids ( yup Amber )   It's way casual  you could smuggle just about anything into the place. With service so slow I was thinking of bringing my own ice chests next time.   I 'll be back becuase it was so easy and outside and cheap in a good way.  Happy Hour anyone?
