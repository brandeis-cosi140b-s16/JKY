I was not very impressed with Casa Don Juan the first time I went there. However, since I had a Groupon, I had to go back. I am glad I did. The service was much better this time, and our food was actually served hot. I got the chicken fajitas. They were literally sizzling hot. The portion was quite generous. The fajitas were flavorful. I might actually go back, even if I don't have a Groupon.
