Good food, bad margaita, so-so patio
It was my birthday and I wanted to start the day out with friends having a relaxing lunch with plenty of drinks before shopping at Scottsdale Fashion square. We're big fans of Blanco Taco at the Biltmore so we cane to the Scottsdale Road version and we're a bit disappointed. The food was just as good, but atmosphere and service were not.
Food-wise, you can't go wrong at Blanco. This trip was chips and salsa - fresh baked and plenty salty with a mild salsa you can't beat. I moved onto the Crab and Shrimp ceviche and was delighted by the creamy avocado and freshness of the tomato and citrus dressing.
Classic Margarita was a sour mess - why bother.
Atmosphere - the patio seating has large lounge chairs - too large in fact. They're the kind built for 6-foot tall mutants, so if you're 5-2 like me, you can't lean back and relax without folding your feet up or leaning back like a pre-teen girl without a sense of posture. The umbrella coverage is so-so which would've been fine if they'd invested in fans or misters. 
The patio is also out in the parking lot and not well shielded. Put up some plants and screens people!
Service - our waiter was below average and seemed annoyed to be there. His shift was ending, but our celebration wasn't which didn't matter to him. Total buzz kill.

With plenty of choices in and near Old Town, I won't be going back.
