We've lived in Phoenix for several years now and haven't found a good Mexican food place we really love.  It's all been OK.  Being from Texas, I'm wondering if it's just the style of Mexican food as I'm assuming most place I'm used to is probably TexMex-type and me not actually having had "real" Mexican food really don't know the difference.  Anyway, This place was OK.  Nothing to write home about.  The tamale I got wasn't smooth and melt-in-your-mouth like I like 'em but it was OK.  The enchilada wasn't too bad.  Service was decent.  I don't think I'd come out of my way to come here but maybe if we were in the area I'd come back.  I will say though, the line was busy so you should probably at least try it for yourself!
