This is a Mexican food restaurant that seems very popular with the Chandler crowd. It serves tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other typical selections that Americans have come to believe originated south of our border. The food tastes good, but then again, I'm a sucker for most things covered in sour cream and cheese. It's definitely a step closer to legit Mexican food than some other places, but there's really not much here that you can't get anywhere else.

I will give a thumbs up on the happy hour. Great deals on appetizers and drinks make it worth the stop if you're in the area. Give it a look see.
