--LOVE the all-day sunday pork taco station. all you can eat!

--smoky and spicy red sauce. i'm glad to have it as often as possible. perfectly prepared.
--fois gras on a skewer? i wasn't sure it could work, but OH yeah, it was awesome. with juicy and moist bites of beef it was delectable.
--guacamole prepared tableside. it's a bit of a spectacle, but fun.
--i finally understand it. chicken and waffles. with maple syrup dip. i just needed it to be made properly. and it was. MAKE IT YOUR MISSION to eat this dish here. if you didn't get it before, you will.

i've seriously had this place on my list for years. Finally i made it. wow. great seeing some folks from zinc down here. smiles all around.

i can't wait to go back.

# but i asked the fried egg for the torta to be SLOWly-cooked and instead it came brown and hard at the edges. sorry. can't cook eggs is a dealbreaker.
it's the same problem at zinc on their croque madame.
guys, you've gotta slow down and lower temperature on fried eggs. they are so delicate! don't rush them!
