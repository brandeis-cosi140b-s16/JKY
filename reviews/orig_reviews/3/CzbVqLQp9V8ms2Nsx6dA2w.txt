Menu items tried: Lobster & Steak, Carne asada salad, alma tequila flight 
Pros: atmosphere, service, scenary (mountaintop view of the city), New York strip steak was perfectly cooked medium, I tried the cognac sauce on the side (mushroom, onion, sweet taste that reminded me of a Thai coconut sauce), tequila flight, garlic sauce on the side for the lobster (similar to shrimp scampi seasoning)
Cons: carne asada salad was prepared better at the Desert Inn Lindo's location. The  carne asada was not seared on the outside at the Henderson location, the lobster was over cooked (very rubbery texture and required a knife to sample) I sent the lobster back to the kitchen with the message that it was over cooked and they cooked the replacement the exact same way.

The Desert Inn location is my preference.  I will definitely try the Henderson location again for the view and atmosphere, but avoid the lobster.
