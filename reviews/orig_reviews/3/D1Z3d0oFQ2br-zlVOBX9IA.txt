Ambiance- great

Food- great (try the Canteen fries, not on the menu)

Drinks- great. I didnt know what I wanted one night so Kat made me an oatmeal cookie (normally a shot) martini.

Bartenders- great.

Wait staff- awful

It also turns into a club after 10, no thanks. There are much better clubs I'd wait an hour in line to get into.

Come for lunch, happy hour, or dinner.
