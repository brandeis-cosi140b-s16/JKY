The art was the best thing about the restaurant. We had a very accommodating waitress A reasonable wait for the food and apparently a very well respected selection of tequila and some foo foo drinks. The meat in the Chili Nogada (for me) was overcooked and the roasted corn in appetizer menu tried  a little too hard. Not a fan.  

  Bar far  the best thing I tasted was the five dollar happy hour  Chili  Verde absolutely delicious and- and a generous portion,  at that.  All in all  the restaurant seems to b favored  by by lots of nice looking, well scrubbed folks
