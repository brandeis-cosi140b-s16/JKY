3.5 stars. Came here after the Jabbawockeez show because there was a long line posted outside, and we figured that it spoke for the food and drinks, so we decided to try it.

I ordered the guacamole -- which was delicious. In my opinion, I think they should cut the portion in half and charge half. It was $10 for a bowl of guac the size of my head. Perfect for a group of four, not so much for a group of two. It's easier to order more portions when bigger groups come through.

Anyway... I ordered the fish tacos, which came in a set of three alongside rice and beans. The tacos were lightly breaded and the white fish was tasty, flaky and good. I took one bite of the rice and beans and didn't really care for the rest. My sister ordered the shrimp tacos and didn't like them as much. She complained that it just wasn't as flavorful as she had expected.

The service was great and very courteous. Food is pricey, drinks are pricey... but it's Vegas. Is it worth it? ... mmm ... No. I definitely felt jipped afterward.
