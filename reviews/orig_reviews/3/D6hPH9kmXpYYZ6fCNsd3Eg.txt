I had been to Agave before with work and had appetizers, which I remember being quite yummy, especially the ceviche and sangria!
So, I decided to take my husband since he was craving Mexican and it was Saturday night & all.  Chips were good, like stone ground white and black, they give you 3 salsas which is fun.  Guacamole was different but good, they mix a lot more tomato almost like a chunky pico de gallo salsa with the guac.  A little expenise and good portion (kinda of a waste for 2 people) but that is at every mexican resturant.  We both had taco platters. I had the rock shrimp ones with a yummy coleslaw type.  He had the sampler.  The carne asada ones have a spicy adobe type salsa if you like spicy.  The carnitas one he enjoyed too.  Their rice is a little bland, but still okay and their pinto beans are tasty, they have a smoky flavor.  Overall, there food is good.  The atmosphere is really nice inside more than anything.  I was surprised it was not more crowded though.  Prices are reasonable for what you get... so many of these mexican places, another favorite (Lindo Michiocans) are just as pricey, so it is comparable.
