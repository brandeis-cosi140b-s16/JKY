Went here with my group for work to say goodbye to a teammate.  I had three Carne Asada tacos which were alright.  I was really hoping there would be a little more flavor or spice or something which most of us all agreed with.  Although we were all jealous of the one person who ordered the Potato...  damn we should have gotten that.  

We ended up sitting outside on their covered front patio which was really nice since it was a beautiful day out.   If I'm ever in the area... I'd keep this place in mind and I'd definitely try the potato next time.  However, I wouldn't go out of my way to get here since its pretty far from both my home and work.
