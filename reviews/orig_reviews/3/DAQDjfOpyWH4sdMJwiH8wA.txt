Ok tried this place for the first time for lunch! I had the shredded pork salad with black beans and house dressing. Love the fresh tortilla shell. Overloaded with lettuce but hey it's a salad. The meat was sweet and Delish! 
My friend ordered two tacos one beef and one chicken. Also really good. 
My only and biggest complaint  and this is a
Major sin. Did you not taste your Salsa? OMG so much lime juice it was horrid! 
Sorry guys your taste buds must be broken. A hint of lime is good. This stuff was overpowered with it.  Service was fantastic.
