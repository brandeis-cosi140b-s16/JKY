Ok I have been coming to this particular restaurant every time I visit Las Vegas.  It's a tradition for my family/friends to come here now.  I have always been satisfied except my last trip to Vegas on my birthday March 6, of this year. 

Friends and I went on a Sunday afternoon craving and I mean craving a good bowl of menudo. 

1) Right of the bat we were told they didn't have any more and ran out at noon!  Ahh I can go to any burrito stand and get some on Sunday all day long! Come on I was expecting better than that from Don Juans!

2) Our server decided to give us extra time to rethink our choices.  We still wanted to stay and eat.  But instead of taking 5 min he took 20 to come back to our table!

3) The bus boy refilled our waters and chips while  still waiting for our server!

4) Once we got our orders in we were not disappointed.  

But seriously Don Juan please don't leave us hanging like that no more!  I mean this is a tradition for me so don't screw it up.
