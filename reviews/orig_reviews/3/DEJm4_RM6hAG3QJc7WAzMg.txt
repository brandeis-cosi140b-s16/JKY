All the 5-star reviews got us intrigued by this place so, we gave it a shot. The parking lot was full but there were lots of empty tables when we went.

We were given a bowl of chips, salsa and refried beans. They have the usual fare: ceviche, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etcetera. Since they call themselves Flaming Fajitas, we got fajitas (and a few drinks). The service was friendly but not that efficient. 

Shrimp and Beef Fajitas:
You can get portions for 1 person or 2 people. Honestly, the portion for 2 was big enough for 3. You can get flour/ corn tortilla. You also get rice, guacamole, and salsa. I didn't really taste what was 5-star worthy about the food. To me, it was just ordinary and nothing different from all the fajitas I've had from other places. Ok, so they bring a cart by your table and you can watch your food go up in flames (well, not really) but that's about it. 3/5

Horchata:
When I'm at a Mexican restaurant, I have to have horchata. Their version was a cross between Mexican horchata (distinct cinnamon taste and sweet) and Spanish horchata (bland). 2.5/5

Mayan Apocalypse:
Amaretto, vodka, Citrus Cruzan, Midori, triple sec, sweet and sour, Southern Comfort and cranberry juice. Tasty but strong. This was the best thing I ordered. 4/5
