I placed a to-go order over the phone and the staff was courteous and the process was easy. By the time I arrived, the food was ready so I was in and out of the restaurant in 10 min.

What I ordered:
-Kimchi fried rice
-Korean chicken wings
-Bulgogi fries

All in all, the food was ok. I probably would bump this up to 4 stars if I had actually dined in because the food (fries especially) were a tad cold. Im sure had it been fresh the bulgogi fries would've been bomb! The sweet and spicy sauce on the chicken wings were pretty good, but I feel like I've had better. 

I would recommend this place because it has a lot of variety, esp. how there's a mix of both Korean and Mexican food. I have yet to explore their "Mexican" menu, but tbh there's other Mexican joints around that I don't feel the need to try it out.
