Popo's isn't the best or most authentic in Mexican Cuisine but it's budget priced and family friendly and family owned. You can always count on a bountiful basket of fresh chips and the best salsa in this part of town. Pope's does serve the strongest $3.00 Margaritas anywhere and I don't think anybody anywhere can drink more than two, they REALLY are THAT STRONG! They recently renovated the entrance and bar area to include a partially open patio. The interior looks like any Mexican Chain place from the 80s and may include some of the dust and dirt from that time too.

Depending on what you order you can have a positive exsperience.

The only thing I will order is the Chicken Fajita Salad. It does vary from time to time. Sometimes the chicken is moist and juicy and sometimes it's a little dry. Sometimes the saut√©ed vegetables are too oily but more often than not they are OK. The salad is always tasty and I prefer to use the tasty fresh salsa as my dressing so I don't know what their dressings are like. The salad is very large and cost less than $10.00.

The guacamole is also unique. It's very thick and creamy but seasoned with lots of fresh cilantro. It seems to be made with fresh avocados instead of frozen like some of the other places in town. I think they add cream cheese to it but can't say for sure. 

The corn tortillas are very thick and sturdy. 

My husband likes Sonoran Cuisine and is usually happy with anything he ordered from here. This time he had the Steak Picado Spicy style with hot peppers and thought it was tasty. I tried a bite and for me the steak was too chewy but it was seasoned in a tasty way. 

You're not going to drive across town to dine here.

If your in the area this is about as good as it gets.
