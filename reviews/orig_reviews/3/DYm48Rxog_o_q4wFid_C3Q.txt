Hmmm. This Cafe Rio visit confused me. It didn't taste quite like the new one on Stephanie in Henderson. It was very very salty! The service was strange as well--two people alternated fixing my dish and taking payment for it. 

I still love that tortilla wheel--it never gets old, but then again I'm easily impressed. I wish I would have gotten my bean/cheese/rice burrito enchilada style, because it was nearly impossible to eat as a burrito anyway--too gooey and needed a fork to scoop into my mouth. 

My belly was still happy, though not as happy as it could have been. A major plus for this place (and maybe for the stars aligning just right) is that I left my cell phone in the bathroom, drove to UNLV and (gasp!) realized after I had parked that it was missing. I rushed back (I don't think I have been such a "Vegas Driver", ever) and lo and behold, it was still there! I got durn lucky, that's for sure, but I like to think it's just good people going to Cafe Rio that aren't stealing my precious iPhone.
