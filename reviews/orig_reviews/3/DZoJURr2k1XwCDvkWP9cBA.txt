They have limited options on meat but I guess that's the kind of place it's supposed to be. I had steak fries, which used to be covered in cheese and decently portioned steak. I got a charcoaled up thin steak sliced up topping my undercheesed fries. Overall, it served its purpose at 2:30AM. Would only go back at that time.
