Inside Mandalay Bay, near the shops, great place to get some pretty good food and some good Margaritas. Get the big version which lets you keep the big cup and share it and come back for refills if you live in this hotel or close. Salsa is fresh, the burrito I had was good and huge and the quesadilla was big too.
