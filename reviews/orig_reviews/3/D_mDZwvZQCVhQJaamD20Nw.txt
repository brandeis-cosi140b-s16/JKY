Ok, so let's get this out of the way, this place was way OVERPRICED. Twenty-four dollars for a dinner plate of pork rice and beans? It's more expensive than WEST LA. What is the justification for this price? Even with the free FLAN (The highlight of the night), it should have been less than $20 dollars.

I got the Pork Carnitas. The meat was very juicy and tendor, but came out only slightly warm. The side chips came with three type of salsa, but the chips were STALE and cold. Definitely the disappointment of the meal. Chips should be hot, fresh off the oven. If they are not, then just warm them up slightly. It was luke cold!

The black bean side was warmed up in the microwave I could tell simply because the outside was colder than the inside. I HATE when restaurants microwave their food. If I wanted a microwave, I'd would have bought some SMART ones, which ain't so SMART, and just nuke it myself.

Side rice was just ok, alongside the pickled vegetables.

The Flan was absolutely excellent. The highlight of the night, and a must have. You get one for free with your meal when you check into yelp

It is this critics opinion that he judges this place perhaps more harshly than it needs to be because he lives in Las Angeles, which has the greatest Mexican food in the world arguably.
