I have mixed feelings for this place.  I've been here 2 times.  I got the blackened mahi mahi fish tacos and they were very good.  The avocado pasta salad is also very good.  I got the refried beans before and they are a meh.  The cheese dip is very good.  We ordered the guacamole today and we were not fans of it.  My husband ordered the bbq mahi mahi tacos and loved them but he found a fish bone in it..and he also found something mysterious and hard in his refried beans (it looked like a fish bone but I don't know how it would have ended up in refried beans!).  Also tried the tomatillo salsa the first time we went and it was horrible..the whole table couldn't eat it.  The corn salsa they bring out with the chips is alright.  Basically a lot of hits and misses but the main attraction (the fish tacos) are very good.  I'm just a little turned off by the fish bone and more so the mysterious hard thing in my husbands refried beans. I think I may stick with the fish tacos at Phat Burrito. They put mango salsa on it and also have a fresh salsa bar with at least 6 or 7 different salsas on it.
