Really good food but the prices are steeeep for what you get.  $12 for guac?  Again, it's good but pricey.  The sides on the meals were actually my favorite part and I'm confident I can eat a 5-gallon bucket full of those mashed potatoes they serve.  My god those are good.  One of our meals was $25 and we thought, "this is great at $15, good at $20, and completely mediocre at $25)."

This is a great place to bring people from out of town if you're looking for a nice Mexican meal but there's a lot of good Mexican in the Valley at much more reasonable prices for the day-to-day dining.
