This Z'Tejas location unfortunately hasn't lived up to the expectations I developed after frequenting the Tempe location. The atmosphere feels a little "Old Country Buffet" to me (light green and white tablecloths, boring plates) and sadly, the food just isn't anything to write home about. 

Most recently, I have ordered the trout dinner and also the chicken burrito on a separate occasion. Both were satisfying but neither one thrilled me, and both were served somewhat sloppily (no garnish, food off center, nothing looked "pretty"). I agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that the staff seem to still be getting a hang of the menu and presentation. 

The frozen house margarita here is ALWAYS a good choice. You can never fail with one of those suckers! The margarita alone will guarantee my return here - even if I only order appetizers. The tableside guacamole is yummy and the happy hour price ($6 as opposed to almost $11 regularly) is worth it. I have always loved the cornbread and the salsa/dip trio on the appetizer menu. 

In summary: go for the margarita and the appetizers! I'd like to try dinner service again in a few months when they've had more time to perfect it.
