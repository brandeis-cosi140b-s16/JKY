Emiliano's is just an a-okay in my book.

The happy hour is great ($4 fishbowl margaritas on Fridays from 4-6) They also have happy hour specials all days of the week. The staff is extremely friendly, seriously! Our server was nice and the manager let us switch tables after we were seated in front of a long table of wasted men discussing/arguing about football. Its moderately priced and the theme inside is cute.

 However, I feel like for a Mexican restaurant it's lacking flavor (bland, tasteless, unmemorable). I ordered the Cabo Chicken which is advertised as this chicken dish with a pineapple sauce (it sounded delish) The chicken was barely seasoned at all and had pineapple on top. There was a sauce on the veggies, but it was dark.. I'm not sure in a pineapple glaze/sauce is dark. The rice reminded me of Uncle Bens (I'm eating clean so I can spot pre-packaged food easily now.. It might have been packaged, it might not have been.. who knows) The refried beans were yummy!! Bobby ordered the faita plate. He said it was good, but again could have had better flavor for it being a Mexican restrauant. Honestly it tasted similar to something from Applebees. I'm just saying.

BUT the service is super friendly, the free chips and salsa rock & the drink menu + happy hour is great :) We will come back for drinks and maybe an appetizer.
