Ate at Gadzooks twice.  The first time left me in a gaseous aftermath which we shall never speak of.  
Note to self:  no.  pickled.  onions.

The second time, I got the poblano pepper stuffed with spinach and mushrooms.  By itself the spinach/mushroom is rather bland so I had the peppers topped with pico de gallo and guac.  These were the only two toppings from my first visit that I liked.  I also got a side of the spicy cornbread.  (Tasty!)

They were out of cookies and chips that evening.  
Note to restaurant:  Make. Extra.  
Duh!

I enjoyed my meal, and even though the colors looked lovely on my palette (platter), only the spinach/mushroom item appealed to my palate.  So I would order the same thing every time.

Won't be eating here often.
