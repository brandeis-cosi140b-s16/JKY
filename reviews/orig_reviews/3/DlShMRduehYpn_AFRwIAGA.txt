I went with a group of friends, and there was a great atmosphere here. I didn't really care for the high stools at the table we were seated at, but there may be other options. The chips and salsa was probably some of the best I've had. The steak chimichanga I had there was pretty good. The texture was perfectly crispy, but the fillings (steak, veggies, rice) were realllly salty. Also, my bf ordered a drink, a double shot of tequila and for 9 bucks per shot, that was a $20 drink! That's a bottle! Anyway, overall it was a good night and the prices were somewhat high for casual Mexican, but I might try this place again.
