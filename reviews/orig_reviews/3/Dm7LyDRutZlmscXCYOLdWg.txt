Went there last Saturday. Somehow, i remember it being better from times before. Do not get me wrong - it was good, but it was not GOOD. Know what i mean? 
Wait was not too long, but long enough. Service was ok, but not great, pitcher of Margarita tasted good but was $36 and we only got kiddie size glasses for it. Food was pretty good, but not superb. Chips and salsa WERE real good.
All in all not totally gratifying experience, unfortunately. Perhaps, i will bump up my rating after next visit.
