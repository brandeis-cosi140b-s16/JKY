Decent upscale Mexican in the MGM Grand. The table side guacamole is excellent, esp. with sun dried tomatoes. If you eat here, def. check this out. The margaritas were also good, though the waiter kept trying to upsell us on these, which was annoying considering the drink prices and the fact that we were not having the house marg. 

My fellow diners liked, but did not love their food. I had the chef's tasting platter, and it was delicious. From what I gathered, this is the way to go. It is a made of of four dishes which vary and are meant to represent the best available. 

The ambiance is rather nice - modern but showcasing the works of the titular Diego Rivera and his wife, Frida Kahlo.
