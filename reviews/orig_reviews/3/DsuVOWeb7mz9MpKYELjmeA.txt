Despite the name, a bit expensive and mediocre, but well located on a busy section of the Strip.  Come here so you can sit outside on the large deck, otherwise it's not worth seeking out.

Despite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.

Tortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.

Service was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).

The location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.  Doesn't seem like there'd be a view from inside.

I've been to the original Cabo Wabo Cantina in Los Cabos, which has better pricing, drink specials, and much much more atmosphere, if much less of a view.
