The adults roam during the day while the kids play out at night. When I see people in suits and dress attire lunching in a restaurant with servers in shorts with butt cheeks hanging out, it's awkward and tacky. You would think that for El Hefe providing a full menu and bar for both day and night, there is a time and place for how you present yourself for various settings, but it was laughable witnessing what I could easily see in a night out at old town during the day. 

I came in during lunch hour. It was not rushed/busy/etc. But you can tell there were a decent amount of guests lunching during their lunch break from work. Our waitress had a really hard time cracking a smile and could not fathom expressing the slightest friendliest tone. My girlfriend and I were actually laughing at the face expression she had when she advised us our food is on it's way as if it was a huge convenience actually doing her job. I haven't seen anything this comical in a business standpoint in years. 

The tacos I had were not that great. Unfortunately, the 2 carne asada tacos I tasted were room temp, stiff cold un cooked/warmed tortillas with bland flavor. I did, however, enjoy the fried avocado taco. I barely ate my third taco. I was not impressed and therefore hungry a little later and had an early dinner.

I would say my experience is better in the nighttime where hot bartenders are slinging drinks at a fast pace, great music, crowd etc. But during the day time, it was a blah experience. I loved the environment, to which all the windows were open and you got to enjoy the daylight,fresh air, etc. So the environment is great, but vibe is just okay. Perhaps it was just my first day time experience, but it could have been better.
