It is a lively place and the food is really not bad. We went in about 435pm which is earlier than we usually eat. There were several young staff just milling around waiting for more customers. They were really busy interacting with each other but would just walk past our table and pay no attention to us. The bar manager was really nice and took care of us. Another manager or the owner walked right past us several times and never said boo to us. The food was ok but unlike New Mexico cuisine I have had in New Mexico it just had too much going on. Sometimes high quality ingredients make more of a statement if fewer are used. The chips at Chipotle are much better than at Blue Adobe sanitation issues were not easy to overlook. The bartender would bus dirty dishes and glasses off the bar and then bring clean beer glasses out of the kitchen but he was holding the stack of 10-12 beer glasses upside down. The bottom glass rim was down in his left hand. I wouldn't want a bartender's hand on the rim of my beer glass. Just not sanitary based on other activities he was taking care of. Another waiter was walking around rubbing his lips and his small growth of facial hair with his hand. I just didn't get a feel that the highest levels of sanitation are practiced by all the employees. I would go back because it is near where we live but a long journey to eat here isn't warranted, at least in my opinion.
