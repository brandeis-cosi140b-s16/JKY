I just don't get the appeal of Cafe Rio, everyone I know loves the food here.  It's clean and the service is good but it's way over priced.  I wouldn't call the food fresh.  My friend and I had skipped breakfast so we came in for lunch right at 11:00 when they opened.  He got a barbacoa burrito and I got a chicken salad.  You can see the food as they serve it up and the beans and the guac looked old, no doubt they were from the day before.  The salad was subpar.  My friend loved his burrito though, I had a bite and the barbacoa was too sweet.  I will be back because all of my friends love it and I appease them but I will not be happy about it.
