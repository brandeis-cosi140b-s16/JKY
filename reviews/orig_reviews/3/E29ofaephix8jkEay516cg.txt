Very hip place to be. I love the decor, the music, and just the general ambiance. 

We seemed to be served by all the servers, who were all friendly. They would all basically come up to us, and ask us how we were doing, and if we had ordered yet. Not sure if they were doing this on purpose, or if they were really disorganized that night.

Ordered the carne asada taco, crispy fish, ahi tuna, and braised beef. I thought 3.5+ for 1 taco was expensive, but surprisingly they were pretty beefy tacos. 3 will leave you satisfied/full. They were all delicious and the salsa is quite spicy. My only disappoint is that half of the tacos came out cold, which gives you a harder tortilla and cold meat. They were still good, but could have been better.

Also ordered churros with chocolate salsa. They were alright, a little doughy, and not thin and crispy enough to my liking.


3/5 Would eat here on a rare occasion.
