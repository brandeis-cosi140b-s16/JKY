3.5

We went here for dinner with a good friend from out of town.

* I liked the spicy cheese bean dip, it is kind of unique and very tasty.
* I like the variety of chips (corn and flour)
* I like the bottles of water and the tiny glasses.
* I like that they add black olives to their salsa

Hubby and I shared the special alambre tacos, our friend ordered the same.
They were tasty but not great. 3 tacos with small tortillas (double tortilla), rice and beans.
It also comes with sour cream, guacamole, cabbage and pickled carrots.
Guacamole tasted a little fake but I am not so sure about it.

Hubby had iced tea and it was not refilled promptly... overall he spent quite some time with a glass full of ice.

Also, they seemed to be extremely busy for a Thursday, I think they can afford to have toilet seat covers for their lady customers : P

The bathroom is small and there was a lot of traffic, it made me remember my party days (long gone)

We were in the back room, which is not very loud compared to other areas.
I didn't have fideos this time, but I think it is a nice touch that they offer that option.
