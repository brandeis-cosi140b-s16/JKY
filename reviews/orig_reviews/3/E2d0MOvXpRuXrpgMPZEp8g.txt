I've heard crazy good things about Cabo but it didn't really live up to its reputation.  The food was decent but I just wasn't blown away.  I love guac so I had to try it as an appetizer.  It was tasty but after you eat through the top layer of cilantro, peppers and other goodies, it is just meh.  I got the Epic Tuna Burrito for dinner.  It was yummy but I wouldn't especially go back for it.  

My biggest peeve was that my margarita was waaaay too sweet.  Another person in my group felt the same way.  We decided to say something since there was obviously something wrong.  Instead of bringing us a new drink they tried to doctor it up.  The waitress said they poured out some of the drink and added more sour mix.  Needless to say, it was horrible.  

Also, as a side note, I parked in the bank parking lot across the street and my car got towed.  Be careful and read all the signs :)
