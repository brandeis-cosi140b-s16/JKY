I've been here a few times, overall decent experience, the put effort into the decor of the place, the way the place is decorated gives it a cool factor.  It's similar to going to a Mexican chain place for a burrito or salad.  Ingredients are fresh, The service is ok at best.  I can't understand the staff, heavy accents, it has potential to be homey and more hospitality driven, just not there yet.
