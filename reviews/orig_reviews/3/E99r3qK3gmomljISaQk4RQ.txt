I've been to this Cafe Rio about a dozen times at least. The staff is always amazing and the food is wonderful every time we go. 

But the cleanliness of the facility has been going down steadily with each visit. More specifically, the bathrooms are horrible. On my most recent trip, the toilet paper was empty, there were paper towels covering the floor, and the soap dispenser was broken. Also, I wish there were a place to hang my purse when I am in the restroom. 

Friday nights are a zoo: go on Wednesdays for lunch ;).
