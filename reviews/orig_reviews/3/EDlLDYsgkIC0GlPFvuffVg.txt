Tried this place out for dinner while on my business trip to Scottsdale. I like Mexican food, being from SoCal, so was excited to try it out with a name like that. First off, chips not bad, salsa ok but not "outstanding" or anything. No impact positive or negative, just about what you'd expect to nosh on while waiting to order and for your margarita. Which of course I ordered.  Tried the first one on their menu, for which the name escapes me (my bad!). High marks for a good pour so not bad at all.
For dinner I ordered the shrimp enchilada. Massive portion heaped with rice and beans on the side. Standard quality fare for the rice and beans, while the enchilada I consider to have been above average in taste.
Didn't experience any issues with service delays or the food itself and prices aren't bad. While it's not as good as some of my faves back home, it's worth another shot or two for me.
