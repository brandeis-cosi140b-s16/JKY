After seeing the reviews here on Yelp, I decided this was the restaurant the family would try this last Sat (5/31/08).  Sat night church, followed by dinner has become our family night.

The ordering system does take a little getting used to.  

The kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.

The kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldn't get past the look and texture.  Not sure why, it's not a texture any different than a refried bean, guess I just don't like to see it so dark.

Kids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didn't think the Diablo was too spicy, but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.

We also got big snickerdoodle cookies with our meals.

Consensus was the food was good and we will probably return.
