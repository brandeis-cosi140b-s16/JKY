Went in for happy hour. Had a couple cold dos equis. Ordered the two taco combo meal with ground beef. The beef was a little bland. I had to put salsa on to add flavor. The chips were a little stale but all in all it was a good meal not a great one. Wife had California burrito. It was huge and she had leftovers. She also mentioned it had way to much sour cream on it. But hers was also good.
