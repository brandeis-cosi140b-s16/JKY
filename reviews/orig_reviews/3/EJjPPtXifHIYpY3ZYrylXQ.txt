I was in here for lunch the other day.  The first thing I noticed when I sat at the bar was that there wasn't a bartender.  Needless to say, that made for really slow service over the course of my meal.

The food itself was pretty decent.  I had the steak platter which came with rice, beans and tortillas.  I liked the seasoning on the steak and felt that it was a good amount of food for the price.

Would I come back again?  Maybe. JJ's just didn't really wow me.
