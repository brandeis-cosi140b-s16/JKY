We had dinner here on Friday night.  No waiting, the place wasn't dead, but there were only a couple of tables.  A few more people came as we were leaving.  It looks like they have a solid patio, but it was pretty cold so it was not in use.  We'll return when it's warmer and sit outside.

To start, we had the cheese dip.  This was a winner, and very reasonably priced.  I had mixed grill fajitas, which was a miss.  I didn't care for the seasoning, it had something I can't put my finger on, but it created an odd taste.  My wife had a beef chimichanga, which was excellent.  Frying things, such as a burrito, is usually a good idea, and this was no exception.  The portions were quite large, we had a lot to take home.  Service was above average, our drinks were never close to empty, but our server did not hover over us.  We will return, but I won't get fajitas next time...
