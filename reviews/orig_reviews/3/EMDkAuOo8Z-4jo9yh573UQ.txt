$17 for steak tacos is pretty steep. I mean, I live in SoCal, so I can get bomb steak nachos for a small fraction of this price. Still, my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed them, and we were in Vegas where everything is more expensive. Since this location was in our hotel, we were totally cool with returning for more food when necessary.
