The decor, ambiance, music, and table service almost make you forget you're in an airport restaurant. But the prices don't. The breakfast burrito, with a few customizations, is fabulous and I would likely come back for it regularly... If the prices were dropped a few bucks and this weren't in the airport.

Standard breakfast burrito with choice of bacon or chorizo is just over $10, which is absurd to begin with. Subbing carne asada adds on $2. But the best (and most expensive) thing you can add to your burrito is queso sauce... Except it's an insane $3 fee. So your deluxe delicious breakfast burrito, with a side of potatoes (because a duvet-sized tortilla simply isn't enough carbs for one meal) will set you back nearly $20 with tax and tip. Frankly, I can't justify or afford that, but if you can, by all means contact me to be your personal assistant.

Seriously though, the proportion of egg to bean to bacon in the regular burrito is perfect, the pico adds an awesome bit of freshness and acidity, and the queso makes it a next-level contender for one of the best I've had. But only a captive audience will pay that kind of price, and they damn sure won't be happy about the bill.
