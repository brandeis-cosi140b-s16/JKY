Went here for lunch, cute place, I liked the decor.  The chips were good, light, crispy and hot and I liked their salsa, a little bit of smoke to it. I ordered the cameron al maya -fried shrimp taco with mango and habanero salsa. The shrimp had a bit of a fishy taste to me, and yes I know they are shrimp so they are supposed to be fishy (duh...), but this was the scrunch your nose up not so good fishy taste. Still holding strong though and not sick so that's a good sign! The shrimp were pretty small. The tacos had a kick to them with the habanero salsa.  They came with beans and rice but it was sent over on a small plate to be "family style" with my friend - the "family style" portion is about the size each person would get on their own plate in a normal sit down mexican restaurant.  You received three tacos with any of the taco plates. It was $12, and the tacos were equivalent to a standard street taco as to size. I think they price was a bit expensive for what you get. The drinks sounded good, but I did not imbibe. Overall cute place, decent food, a bit pricey for what you get, nothing memorable as to the flavor profile. Also, I asked the waitress what she recommended she immediately steered me to the most expensive item on the menu ($22) - I am always skeptical when this happens but maybe she gets to eat for free and that just happens to be her favorite, she recommended a few other of the higher priced items too. Ultimately, I just got what I wanted in the first place. With so many other places in town, and for being a pricier mexican establishment, I don't think I will be back.
