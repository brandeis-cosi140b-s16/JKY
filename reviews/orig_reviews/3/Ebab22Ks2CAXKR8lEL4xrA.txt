Food was good. Not outstanding, but good! I got the tamale with the shrimp and cheese sauce and I was impressed but it was pretty rich! The rice had some pineapple in it which was interesting but good. Added to the richness of the meal. The beans were just, beans.

They don't split checks, first off. I have worked in the industry for years and it just grinds my gears when restaurants don't split checks. I've done my fair share of splitting checks and it's just not that hard. I come to pay good money and relax and not have to stress out about my bill and making sure we all pay evenly. It shouldn't be that hard to split checks to keep your customers from getting frustrated. They do not sell their rice and beans as a "half and half" option either. So if you'd like to add rice and beans to your meal, you are paying $5 for the rice and $4 for the beans. $9 for rice and beans?! That seems a little outrageous when my actual meal was only $12. 

Our server was hardly attentive and wasn't the friendliest lady on the planet. Our food came out about 20-25 minutes after we ordered which isn't too bad but it took a lot to get her to check on us. 

I was so pumped for The Blind Pig and I can't say that I won't be back. I just would say that it isn't at the top of my list for Mexican grub in the area.

Another interesting note is that a lady at the bar was yelling how she was leaving and the bartender asked her if she was okay to drive and she said no but she was going to drive anyway. She was LOUD and obviously intoxicated. That's concerning that she could just leave and nobody do anything about her driving in that condition. Shameeee.
