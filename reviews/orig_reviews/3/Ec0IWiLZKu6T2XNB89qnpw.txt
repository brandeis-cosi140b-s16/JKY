I went there today on the recommendation of a coworker who was working with me. 

It's kind of a small, hole in the wall, strip mall location. That's not a negative, some of the best food I've had, has been in small, out of the way places.

 I had a Carlito's Beef Burrito Smothered. (ground beef  double-meat, no veggies, smothered with green chile sauce), and a fountain soda. 

The burrito was large, drenched in green chile sauce. It was good, the flavor of New Mexico food, which I like.

The fountain soda were of the Coke genre. They also had bottle Mexican soda (the kind with sugar, instead of HFCS). The had Horchata, Jamaica and Orange in the bubbling fountain dispensers.

My coworker had a chicken bowl with salad on it, he said it was good.

My coworker also explained at Hatch chile time of year, they roast the chiles in the parking lot there.

I don't spend a lot of time on that side of town, but if I was in the area, I would definitely eat there again. Give them a try.
