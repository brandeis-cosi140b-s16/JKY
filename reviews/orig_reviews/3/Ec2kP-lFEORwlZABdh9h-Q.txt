I've been traveling to Vegas every six weeks from CA and love that there are Wahoos restaurants here.  This one is cool because it has a full bar and it's exposed to the outside, so I thought it would be nice.  Seems like it's only cool if you're a local....service in the bar pretty much sucks unless they recognize you.  I'm going to start going to the other Wahoos nearby that has better service.
