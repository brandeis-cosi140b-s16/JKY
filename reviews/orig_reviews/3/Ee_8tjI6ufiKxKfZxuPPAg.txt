I've always enjoyed the food at the Blanco on Scottsdale road.  Typically order red enchiladas.  So yesterday we tried the Biltmore location and it was really disappointing.  Hostess seated us but then no one came over for over ten minutes. Decided to try the white peach hibiscus margarita. Sadly, it was syrupy and not worth 9 bucks.   My enchiladas were kinda gross. Chicken was watery, not juicy and cheese was piled on. The sauce lacked its usual kick.   Rice on side was like eating a stick of butter. Table chips were the saltiest I've had in a long time. My husband had fish tacos he said were "fine". He is much more enthusiastic about fish tacos usually.  Kids meals were acceptable for kids. Kind of odd they give kids adult size take out cups. Anyway, it's a nice ambiance. I'd stick to beer or wine happy hour but couldn't recommend this location.
