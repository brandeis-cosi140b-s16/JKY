A historical Scottsdale treasure and definitely one of its most unique restaurants. From the front door donkey to the blue-tinted aquarium area to the Diego Rivera replicated art in the old Mexican adobe main dining room, it is a neat place to eat.  However, if you are looking for great Mexican food in Arizona, it would not be my first choice. The service is fast and friendly and I love the mariachi band and occasional live music however the food is less than desirable. My favorite meal is the Pollo a La Queso Crema but sometimes the chicken is dry and the rice and beans are crusty from sitting too long on a hot plate. There is a definite difference in quality when the restaurant is busy, so timing can be everything. It's a great spot to get a margarita after a Giants Spring Training game but for a good meal, it's just okay.
