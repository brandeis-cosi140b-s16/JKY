While the restaurant itself was nice and the staff was also very nice the food was nothing that I can say was truly amazing. We were expecting a very 5 star experience when it came to the food and we were surprised when the food came out just a few minutes after we ordered. Most everyone in our party thought the food was average, nothing to right home about. We have a restaurant near us called Frida Mexican Restaurant in Glendale,CA and there food is much much better. On the bright side I did order the Nachos and this seem to be the hit on the table So much so that everyone started munching away at my food 

So heres the deal for me, I am always looking for amazing Mexican Food, something above and beyond what I can expect living in Los Angeles. Diego was not it for me, Great looking place, Friendly Staff, with So-So Food.
