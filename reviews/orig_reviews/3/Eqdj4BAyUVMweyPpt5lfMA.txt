We have been anxious to try Urban Taco......we eat out daily and I am a native of North central Phoenix .......we arrived at 11:10 having confirmed on line that they open at 11:00.....we were the first to arrive for lunch. Only two men were sitting at a corner table.......we were totally ignored, having just come from a spin class we were not at all well dressed.....but finally one of the men stood up and ask us if it was 11:00...... And then very tersely ask if we wanted to eat. He was so rude!!!! I later confirmed he was the owner Ouch !!!!
The food has pretty good over all, but not great......the guacamole was horrible! Very thin and kind of runny.......rice and beans side dish, below average.....tacos, we tried three different kinds were pretty good.
There are so many restaurant choices in NC Phoenix , with more opening all of the time.......why would be bother to return or recommend Urban Taco......Otro is better.
