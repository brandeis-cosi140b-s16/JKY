Been to this Mex place twice. I'm from the east coast to almost any Mex food in AZ is better than what we get out east. This place has decent food BUT the atmosphere is sort of crappy. Last visit there the waitress was like 2 years younger than God and sort of cranky. The food is excellent and cheap. Amazingly all kinds of celebrity types have found this place...and the reception area has dozens of pictures and autographs of famous visitors. Pretty cool place. Try it.
