Date night with my cute cute!!! Love the location, but the food good not great. The queso dip was really yummy and the trio of ceviches was good in theory but one of the 3 tasted funny and left me feeling under the weather :( I had a sub par salad as my main course and my husband had some sort of burrito with some very good rice and beans. Probably won't go back next time I'm in Vegas.
