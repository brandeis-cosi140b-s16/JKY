The meal comes with complimentary chips and 3 types of salsa.

I ordered the Shrimp Ceviche and was unimpressed.  I've had better shrimp Ceviche in east san jose.

My boyfriend ordered the chicken tacos, which came with black beans and spanish rice.  There was nothing special about the whole plate.  They don't even ask you what type of beans you want.

The service was better than the food, and out of all the food we tried, the chips and salsa were the best.
