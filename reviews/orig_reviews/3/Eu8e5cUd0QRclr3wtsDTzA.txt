Taqueria Mi Casita has authentic Mexican food I just wasn't impressed by the food. I tried an Al Pastor burrito. Nothing was flavorful enough from the Al Pastor to the salsa to the beans. The refried beans and hot salsa were very watery. There is no salsa bar in the restaurant. Authentic? Yes. Good? Not so much. There are much better authentic Mexican places in the Phoenix area. Transplant this restaurant to an area of the country with poor unauthentic Mexican food and this would be the best place in town. Here in the Phoenix area? Not so much.
