Okay, I just have two Specials that I would like to mention. Okay. Are you Ready? 

TACO TUESDAY & CHIMI THURSDAY 

I heard of Arribas but I've never been until I started working on this side of town. I'm very much loyal to Poncho's. What can I say? So Taco Tuesday is $0.99 a Taco, pretty popular. And $1.99 Chimi on Thursday, sort of popular. However, Tuesdays and Thursdays are usually packed for lunch but if you know what your ordering it's much faster. Service may not be at it's best on these days but you will get your food. (If you get the right waiter and server.)  The chips and salsa (Hot,Mild) and hot bean dip are very addicting, so watch the intake or you'll be taking a doggy bag home. 
WARNING: MILD salsa may have a little heat to it. Eat with Caution.
