The Food: 
- Complimentary chips were a little stale but the salsa & bean dips were good
- Made-to-order guacamole was very fresh & easily customizable. You could omit any ingredient or request more of any of your favorites
- Cocktails were refreshing
- Carnitas were good but not impressive
- Coca Cola steak was delicious all together but the sauce by itself was a little too sweet

The service was a little slow but it didn't matter too much because we weren't in a rush. The server seemed to pick up the pace & friendliness as the meal went on so maybe he had just started when we got there. 

Overall, this won't be a regular stop for us but something to add as a option when in the area.
