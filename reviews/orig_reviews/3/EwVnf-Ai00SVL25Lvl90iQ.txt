While I enjoy the ambiance of El Encanto in Cave Creek, I feel the service is hit or miss and the food is just eh...

I've been on several occasions, most recently this past Sunday.  Perhaps they were short staffed because it was Easter, but we were there for a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waitress and then it took another 15 to get drinks and we had to request salsa to go with the chips on our table.  Our food took a really long time too...

When you do get your Corona or Margarita, you feel like you're in Mexico - the chips and salsa are addicting!  

Go for the ambiance, not the service or the food... and go with a fun group of people!
