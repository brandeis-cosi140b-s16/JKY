We ate at Diego for breakfast.  I had the chorizo quesadilla.  They served them basically liked rolled up tacos, but the outside of the tortilla had the crunch that is nice with a quesadilla.  The pico sprinkled on top was really good, not overpowering with cilantro and had some heat.  The chorizo was also solid, and the filling substantial.  The breakfast potatoes on the side were underwhelming.  Basically just fingerling potatoes cut in half and roasted.  Not much in the way of seasoning.  I had to give them a good application of salt, pepper and Tapatio.  It was a little pricey for breakfast, our total for 3 people was $79 with tip.  But, everyone enjoyed their food and the service was excellent.  Recommended.
