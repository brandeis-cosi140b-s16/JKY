This is my second time to the Sandbar, me and my boyfriend came by to grab a bite to eat. They were having an event there, I called a head of time and the lady who answered the phone told me it was happy hour and told me the times it started and ended but she didn't seem very sure of it. When we got there (about 15mins later, I live near by) it was NOT happy hour. We sat ourselves which was fine but when the waitress finally came she didn't know what specials they had and what some of the menu items were. Maybe she was new? Idk. But being a server myself at one point, I know you're suppose to know what the menu items consist of, at least be able about to tell me how something is or make a recommendation. Nonetheless the food was very good. We ordered Mexican pizza for an app and shrimp tacos and chicken fajita as the meals. Everything came out at the same time. I was upset about that bc the food was kinda cold once we finished the appetizer, but I didn't make a fuss about it. I'd def come back though bc the drinks and food were good and not too pricey and it's close to my house.
