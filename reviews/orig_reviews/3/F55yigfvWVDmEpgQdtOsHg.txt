2.75/5 underwhelming. 

i'm generally not a fan of mexican food, so this may be an unfair review, but oh well.

whenever i think of mexican, i think of bold flavors, hearty, tender meats and sauces and creams and yum! this food was meh. nothing particularly great, it could have been wrapped in foil and i could have probably gotten it off a cart somewhere.

i think there's also something to be said when proportions are off. there was a lot of food, but i also got this huge tortilla bowl full of sour cream...just unnecessary. also, if the food needs that much, i think that speaks poorly to the quality of the steak fajita i ordered.

overall, the food wasn't very memorable, which was reflective of a fairly boring menu as well.
