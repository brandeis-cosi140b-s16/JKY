Another Groupon purchase. Someplace new for us. It's a quaint little restaurant. I loved the decor and atmosphere! Service was friendly. Food was okay, prices the same. Dessert was great! All in all, it was our first time there and most likely our last. Worth trying once but doesn't compete with my favorite Mexican spot.
