I love this place but the service and staff have been getting progressively worse over the years.  There's a bunch of kids that don't seem to understand what people expect in a restaurant staff.  It always is cluttered with staff and piles of employees sitting on top of each other.  I can't understand why so many need to stand around. Good food and love the chips.  Salsa containers should be bigger for green sauce.
