Prior to the Sharks/Coyotes game, my friends and I decided to hang out here for drinks and food.  We set up shop at the outside bar. 

I decided a margarita sounded good. The margaritas was average at best. The flavor just wasn't there and tasted too much like a mix. I then went to beer.

We ordered wings and taquitos. This food was pretty good.  Watch out for the habanero wings.

Two friends and I then decided to order nachos with chicken. That was a MISTAKE!  The nachos weren't very good, had about 2 wings worth of chicken if that and had very little cheese, beans etc. I can't believe I wasted $11 on that. Some of the worst nachos I've ever had. Steer clear of that item.

The bartender was friendly and was very attentive to our needs.

Decent place, but maybe some of the other locations at Westgate are better?
