Burrito company, what's happened?!!?! You've raised your prices and made your portions smaller! I used to barely get through half of my chicken chimichanga, now I ate the whole thing easily and you charged me nearly $11 for that and a small soda. Plus you have a bright red sign behind the counter that says, "extra salsa to go 35c". Seriously?! So if I eat in your restaurant then I can have as much salsa as I want but if I want to go to the comfort of my home, relax with my favorite show and eat your delicious burrito now it'll cost me extra? I'm calling b.s. on that. Are the owners just getting greedy? I think I'll take my business to Someburros for a while. Very disappointing...
