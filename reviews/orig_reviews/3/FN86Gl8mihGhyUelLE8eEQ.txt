There are degrees of devilish creatures. There are some that are bad ass scary ones like Lucifer himself; and, there are some who are cute and not scary at all like Casper. Diablo's Cantina was neither or. 

In the world of devilish creatures, this Mexican restaurant is more like a creak in your wall that you brushed off thinking that it was nothing and wasn't paranormal activity. It's forgettable at best.

We ventured out to find cheap food and ended up here. After all, how expensive could this be? Some tacos and a glass of pop and free chips and salsa? Yeah, we were dead wrong. The diablo has spoken and this must have been what selling your soul to the devil actually felt like because the diablo for sure robbed us.

First off, chips and salsa weren't free. What kind of Mexican place is this? "El diablo." *shaking hands in the air* No devil would give you shit for free. Remember that.

Well, one thing free is scantily clad waitresses. Luckily, they did have hot bods so it was okay to dress minimally like that. It went with the whole devil temptation thing and if you succumbed to it, you would probably get apple instead of taco and condemned to all eternity to jail.

Our server was a dude and dressed complete with full length pants and shirt. WTF man. Where's my temptation? He acted smooth and flirty but nope. Unless he showed up wearing short short and midriff top, I ain't buying his act.

I ordered quesadilla and pepsi. My coworker ordered tortilla soup and steak fajita. All tasted okay and edible. They weren't the best thing we ever ate but it was okay. No devilish punch or tickle or red trident stuck us in the gut. It was just okay. 

The check came. Mine was close to $30 with tip. My coworker's was over $40 with tip. Not okay. 

Diablo's Cantina.. You are truly evil for taking too much of our money and didn't give us chips and salsa. Hope you burn in hell!
