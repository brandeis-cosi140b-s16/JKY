Located in a fairly residential area, Aunt Chiladas has a nice outdoor    seating section along with a bar and bocce ball court.  The menu includes pretty standard items, tacos, burritos, enchilada's as well as some other specialties.

The chips that everyone mentions were OK. They are more of a puffy chip vs. the crisp thin chip you normally see with salsa.

For apps the table shared large tortillas covered with melted cheese, kind 
of like a Mexican pizza and some guacamole.  They were tasty.

For entree, I got the sour cream chicken enchiladas.  The plate was huge.  2 large enchiladas covered in sauce and served with refried beans and rice.  They were good, but the chicken was a bit dry.  Others said the seafood enchiladas were delicious but I didn't taste them.  The chicken in chipolte sauce was good.

If I had the choice, probably wouldn't be my choice for for a meal.
