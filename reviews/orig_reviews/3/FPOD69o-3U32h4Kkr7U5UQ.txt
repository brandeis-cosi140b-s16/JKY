I stumbled in here while driving around burning up my $3.15 gas. Place was spacious and felt very down to earth. I opted for the fish of the day, which happened to be the salmon.

Slightly off topic, but my server was Darlene. Very friendly. I liked her.

The salmon came out with all sorts of veggies. I am not big on veggies so I decided I should make mom proud and eat as many as I could. I did pretty well, i'd say. They cooked them well.

The seared salmon was good. But, the bad part was that the middle was un/undercooked. I did ask for them to toss it back on for a minute (which I felt bad for asking. I hate being a problematic customer) which they did.

I wish that the salmon was a bit skinnier. The seared part was absolutely delic. But since it was thick, there was less seared part to enjoy.

Id give the place a 4 star if the salmon was cooked all the way.
