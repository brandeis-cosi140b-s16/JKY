OK lets get it things straight. You don't need a whole novel to describe a mediocre taco shop. Positives: Meat is flavorful, corn on the cob is on pace to being good. (Its just corn prepared) I tasted better on a roadside in TJ and the staff really makes the place clean even during a busy lunch etc...I came twice just to make sure I didnt catch a bad day. 
Nope!
Negatives: Its a one trick pony! Staff is not what you call "Hello!' Welcome! Why not? I cant stand the lady taking my order, there is so much to order. I mean what if I decided to try Lengua. If I try tongue, I just dont eat that anywhere. How is it prepared?! She is pushy and impatient...really? Street venders in TJ are more polite! The AGUAS FRESCAS are covered in Sugar probably to hide the quality of the "fresh fruit". Now the Taco: You dont need to but in every single ingredient in there, the meat and tortilla should do all the talking. This place has potential to be great, however looks like it is owned by an American with a passion for Mexican Cuisine and hired Mexican staff with no passion at all. If I'm going to spend 10 on burrito combo I expect at the VERY LEAST to be that experience.
