I loved the fact that there is no sign above the door.  It's like Hollister!  Actually, I see this an impediment, but I guess it is unique.  I have dined here for dinner and for brunch.  I had some delicious Enchiladas for dinner and a Mexican Meatloaf for brunch.  Both came with rice and beans.  I honestly don't remember either dish tasting differently from each other.  That's sometimes my problem with Mexican food.  Far too often, it all tastes exactly the same.  The beans were also over cooked.  This is not to say that both meals weren't filling or tasty, but I am hesitant to go back because I know I can get equally tasty and filling meals for 6 dollars less.  That being said, the small interior is very intimate and would make a great place to take a date.
