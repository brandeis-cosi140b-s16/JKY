Food was ok, i just hated how you had to stand in different lines to order your food, that was just way too confusing. I am not really a big fan of mexican food, so my opinion might be biased. Would i be willing to drive all the way to the east side to eat their tacos? Probably not. If somebody brought tacos from there will i eat it? Sure will. So that pretty much sums up my review for this place. :)
