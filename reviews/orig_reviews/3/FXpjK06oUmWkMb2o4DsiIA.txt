Close to the strip and work, me and a few friends stopped by after work on sunday to grab some nachos, drinks and watch what else but football. Pretty decent mixed drinks enjoyed my time there and hot damn them nachos are certainly a force to be reckoned with. Its probably enough to feed 3 people so be hungry. I didn't try any of the entrees but hey if the nachos are good enough for the 2 mexicans I rolled with then its good enough for me. Not bad for a stop for mexican food on the strip.
