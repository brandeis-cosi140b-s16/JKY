Loved the food!!! Excellent!!! However don't sit in the bar, you may get Theresa as your server.   She was horrible; checked her make-up more than she checked on her tables.  My husband and I went to Las Vegas to get married and have our honeymoon.  She put a huge damper on our happiness.  It took fifteen minutes to get a pop and a warm beer.  I was in the industry for twenty years, and service like this was never tolerated.  Go there for the food, but please sit in the dining room.
