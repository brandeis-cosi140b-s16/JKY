I've been to Maverick Rock Taco twice in the last week now, and I feel like both times were solid 3-star experiences - some aspects of the meal were great and some were average.  

My first visit was last Friday night around 7:30 pm and it was packed!  The wait was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad compared to other spots in Charlotte on a Friday night.  I also went on a Sunday at 7 pm and there were only a few people there.  Both times the service was attentive and food came out quickly.  

I read in some reviews below that chips and salsa had to be ordered, but that wasn't the case when I was there - they were brought out as soon as our table sat down, which is good because I love me some salsa.

What I really enjoyed - tomatillo salsa, guacamole, chimichurri steak taco, grilled vegetables, and the Mexican street corn.  Ugh that Mexican street corn is so good I can't explain it...I just can't.  It reminds me what I used to get from the county fair every summer when I lived in California (and believe me, this corn was so legit I still think about it 10+ years later).

Average menu items included the chili lime shrimp taco and the steak fajitas.  They were fine, but it's not like I'll be clamoring to order either of those dishes again.  I had a sip of a skinny margarita but couldn't finish it because it was too sweet for my taste, but everyone at my table absolutely loved theirs.

The location right on Montford is really convenient and it's a fun place to go with friends, so I'm sure I'll be back.
