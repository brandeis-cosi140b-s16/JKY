Went back here on industry Monday for the second time and dunno what happened but food didn't taste as good. The fajita plate was lacking in its seasoning and marinade. 

My brother ordered the mole which was not good at all. 
Tacos were okay...3 stars on the carne asada tacos as well as the pork. 

To say the least I was a bit disappointed this second time around. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...I hope they get their food back up to what I remember. Por favor, mi restaurante favorita!
