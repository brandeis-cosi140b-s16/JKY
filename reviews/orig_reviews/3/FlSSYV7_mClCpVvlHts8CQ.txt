So this is my rant about Sandbar. I thought it was a cool hangout. You would figure Sunday Funday would be lively and lots going on. I thought the green salsa was bomb. But I had the shrimp tacos and I wasn't really impressed.  I hear that Taco Tuesday they spice things up a bit but that's the way it should always be. Don't get me wrong the shrimp tacos were ok but I think there should of been a little more pop to the shrimp. The servers just did not seem lively at all, likely that they were just not motivated at all. Ok well I know I have written a novel but just wanted to spread the word
