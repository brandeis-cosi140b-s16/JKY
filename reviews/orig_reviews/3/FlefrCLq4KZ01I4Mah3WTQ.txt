As others say ... I HAD TO order the Giant Man vs. Food Del Rey Torta.  Just like the pictures already taken ... this thing is Humongous!  I can't believe I ate the whole thing. The wife got the Alambre de res torta which was also very good if not better. Fun place to check out with friends.  Prices are good and the food is pretty good. It is cool to watch them cook in the open kitchen. It can get pretty busy depending on what time of day it is when you get there. Expect a lot of people.
