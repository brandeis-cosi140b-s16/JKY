The 3 stars is for the drinks and chips.  We went on a Saturday night and they had a $6.99 sangria margarita special and $2.50 dos Equis. I went with a beer and my date choose the margarita which I keep stealing sips from! It was huge and delicious.  Most nights they seem to have drink specials.  On a Saturday night it was busy and they do not take reservations Friday or Saturday night.  We got there early and had time to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We were seated fairly quickly but I did not realize how small it is inside.  Our waitress was fantastic!  We ordered the dip trio to go with the free chips and salsa they bring out.  This contained guacamole which was not good, a white cheese dip that was fantastic and pico de gallo which was very tasty. I was so disappointed about the guacamole. I'm glad we didn't pay the extra money to have them make it fresh tableside. For my entr√©e I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was not good at all.  I don't like when they use shredded chicken and it had no flavor.  Others in our party ordered the enchiladas and fajitas and were happy with them.
