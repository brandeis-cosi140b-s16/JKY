It took me a while to decide whether to give Diablo's 2 or 3 stars.  I decided to go with three since most decent places in Vegas are expensive and at least Diablo's had very yummy food and generous portions.

However, this was the worst service I have ever experienced anywhere...ever.  Our server, on the rare occasion she stopped by, was straight-up rude.  She was so rude it seemed like it had to be intentional- she even got frustrated with my friend just because she wanted fresh cheese on her nachos instead of both fresh and creamy/processed cheese.  The waitress sighed loudly and said in an irritated voice, "It's NOT going to taste the same" and shook her head when my friend explained that she's never liked that kind of "fake" cheese.  She also grumpily said, "Well, what do you want?" when she came to take our order.  No hello, no eye contact, nothing.

It also took at least 30 minutes for our orders to be taken even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, another 90+ minutes before our food showed up, and another 30+ minutes to get the check.  What was supposed to be a quick bite to eat for 5 of us turned into a 3-hour ordeal.

1 star for service
5 stars for food
2.5 stars for value
