Emilano's is a great place to come for drinks, it's a cozy atmosphere with excellent service.  The prices are very reasonable and you can get a 32 oz dos equus for $8 or a tasty olympic swimming pool sized margarita fishbowl for just a little more.  I'd come here for drinks any time, but I'd save my appetite for somewhere more deserving.

It's reasonably priced, but very processed and definitely not made from scratch.  Everything is very salty, but lacking in any other kick or flavor.  We got the sampler platter, and despite the fact that it had 6 different things including burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales on it, they all tasted bland, processed and virtually identical.  Nothing here was bad, but it never ventured into the great zone either.  

Bland food, great service and drinks.  Come thirsty, not hungry, and you'll have a wonderful night at Emilianos!
