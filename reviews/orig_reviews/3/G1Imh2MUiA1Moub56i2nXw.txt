Taken to Cien Agave for a belated birthday celebration. Wanted to go here as they have Happy Hour EVERYDAY from 3-7. Headed over on a Sunday that was mildly busy. The group enjoyed house margaritas, cheese crisps, tacos ... All on the happy hour menu... And a chicken chimi that wasn't on the HH menu. Service was a little slow at times but once we brought it to our server's (Mila) attention, things improved. Server spilled salsa on the table...and us, but she recovered nicely. I would come back and would recommend this place.
