This was our 2nd choice since Mr. Lucky was kinda busy.
It took a while to be seated cuz the hostess was away. But the waiter was prompt. I really like the chips. They were warm & had a soft crunch. I am not a salsa eater, so have no opinion on that. 
We shared the sampler appetizer. Overall it was fine, although the chicken was cold. I sure did like the little sweet tamales! The appetizer was just enough food to not weigh us down, so we could move on to the next destination.
