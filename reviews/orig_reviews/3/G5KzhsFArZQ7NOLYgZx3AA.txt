Okay, so I've been here a large handful of times now. First, the fish tacos are the best I've ever had. So, so good. I've tried several of the other menu items but the fish tacos are what keep me coming back. And the side of roasted onion (shallot?) and jalape√±o? Holy geez. I could eat side by side of the stuff all. day. long.

NOW, unfortunately, it seems with each returning visit I become a little bit more disappointed with Tacos Atoyac. Why? THE WAIT. It takes so incredibly long to receive a couple of fish tacos that, let's be honest, aren't anywhere near piping hot (or at least hot enough to justify such a long wait). I'm not talking 10-15 minutes. I'm talking 20 - 40 minutes. FOR TACOS. Tiny tacos. I know that right now it's a 2, sometimes 3/4 person show running the place, but waiting longer than 15 minutes for a few cold tacos is just ridiculous. 

I'm thinking what happened is Tacos Atoyac blew up overnight and while yes, business is flourishing and that's so great...they can't quite keep up. Let's hope that they improve their production (i.e. hire another set of hands?) and don't get swallowed by becoming too popular too fast.
