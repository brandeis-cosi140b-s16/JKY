You won't find a better margarita in the Pittsburgh area.  That's because Verde starts with really excellent Tequila and they don't make them too sweet.  

I enjoy the food, but over the 8 times that I have been to Verde, I find the quality somewhat uneven.  I will admit, much of their food is delicious, it's just that I don't know if I can count on them.  

The decor is great, and the service is excellent, I really like the wait staff.
