Key word: bland. Not bad food, but fairly bland. Went for lunch. The featured hot salsas were not very flavorful. The guacamole and chips were good but could've benefited from sea salt or some spice in general- even adding the peppers didn't help with spice. The veggie burrito was good but unmemorable. The shrimp tacos were, you guessed it- bland! While the building is cool and service was solid, I won't be rushing back for lunch.
