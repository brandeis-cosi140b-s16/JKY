Came here when they were about to close & they gladly served us. Prices are cheap. Didn't really find anything special about the tacos but maybe cause I'm from Texas & also I got it with the standard corn tortilla. (It is called Maize though so kinda of makes sense. Lol) I think you may be able to ask for flour tortillas though.
