Okay so I really didn't eat here, but I think the atmosphere is great!  Live music, rowdy crowd, and ESPN - on top of that daily drink specials ...WT Funk!  What else can a guy ask for...hmmm we'll leave that alone.  This place is huge, it's almost a maze to walk around, I tell if you were drunk make sure you have a friend with you.  Don't want you walking past the lightrail tracks as the lightrail is coming :)  If you need a place to hang with a pal or two come on down!
