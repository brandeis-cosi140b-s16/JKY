I was excited to check this place out after reading the reviews on here. Unfortunate location though---across from South Park Mall but with the entrance facing the Marriott.

We went here on a Saturday afternoon and there were a few other patrons there (mostly with kids, it seems like a good place to bring them) and we were promptly greeted by the server. I was confused by the theme of it though. It has a menu full of Mexican food, the decor seemed more Western Route 66 -ish and the music was random as well. Being one that loves random stuff, I enjoyed it. Service was great and the manager even stopped by after to see how everything was and how we thought everything tasted and if it needed any more flavor or seasoning. I thought that was really awesome that they asked our opinion (even if they really didn't care). I got the ceviche why was served like a parfait in a dessert cup so I found that different but it tasted great as well did the chips and salsa.

Personally, prices seemed a little steep. $7 for one taco? No thanks, I can make one at home for $.80.
