I have been looking forward to trying this new (ish) restaurant for awhile now... so you can imagine my excitement as we entered the cute little place that is the PHX burrito house. I wanted to try a variety of items, so the husband, my dad, and I got a quesadilla, a couple of green chili burritos, guacamole, and a red chili taco... no we didn't try the carne aside, and maybe that was a mistake. I don't really get the hype....the food just wasn't that good. The guacamole was fairly bland. The green chili wasn't spicy and the burrito was overtaken by beans and excess tortilla, dampening any flavor the green chili may have had. Additionally, it wasn't served with any salsa.... and it needed something fresh badly. The red chili taco was a bit spicier, but had an odd smokey flavor that wasn't great. Again, there was no veg on the taco... no cabbage, no peppers, no cilantro....nothing to add any freshness or brightness to the food. I'm not saying the food was bad, but it wasn't great. Maybe we went on an off day, but if this showing was representative of the food here, I can't see myself returning anytime soon.
