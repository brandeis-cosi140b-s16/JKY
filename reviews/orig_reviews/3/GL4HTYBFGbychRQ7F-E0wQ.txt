Great Great Food, but go to the bank first and check you account balance cause the prices are ridiculous.

Guacamole is very different but in a good way. Appetizers are amazing. Main dishes, although flavorful, are incredibly expensive. Their version of Carne' Asada is serving them taco style. It might be Mexican Cuisine, but I'm not a fan.

Their favored Margarita known as the "low Rider" will sneak up on you so be careful. It will also sneak up on your wallet at 13 dollars a pop.

Service in the restaurant for us was good but the food came out too slowly so be aware that you might have to wait a while. It's also very loud with hard floors and the place packs up pretty fast.

My advice is to go for a nice bottled beer and share a main course meal OR go at happy hour and save some coin on some incredible good appetizers. At lease you can enjoy the food and not break the bank!

Would I go back again? prolly' not...
