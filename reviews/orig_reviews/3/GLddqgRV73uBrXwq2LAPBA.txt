I've been wanting to try this place & I received a coupon. My dad watches the baseball game at 4. We had to get it to go. There was no Togo coupon. I ordered a supreme nachos & a buffalo pizza. I parked in the Togo area. No Togo booth, no one greeted me, but greeted the people walking in after me. Then finally someone said have you been helped. It seemed like no one knew what they were doing. The food came out quickly &  I left. I didn't like ground beef, but I rarely eat that meat. The buffalo pizza was good. I would go back to try other foods. Hopefully wont get the 4pm service again. I hope there is 8 slices to a pizza because it looked like someone ate one.
