The food was alright, I guess.  Nothing too great about it but not horrible either. My wife had the Fish Tacos and she's a huge fish tacos fan.  She said they weren't really that great.  I had a Chicken Bowl and was pretty disappointed to get chicken, beans, and rice.  That's it.  Apparently you have to pay extra if you want anything else.  There was no salsa, sour cream, lettuce, veggies, nothing.  I really don't like when restaurants make you pay for all that extra stuff.  Especially when you're a fast-ish food Mexican restaurant.  At least, I think it's a Mexican restaurant.  It's hard to tell with "cajun" beans and Mr. Lee's sauce.  Doesn't make much sense. 
 
Pretty sure I don't need to go back and pay $7.99 for a "bowl" with only three things inside it.  But on the plus side they have happy hour from 3-7 for half priced beers.  Wish they had mor local stuff on tap though.
