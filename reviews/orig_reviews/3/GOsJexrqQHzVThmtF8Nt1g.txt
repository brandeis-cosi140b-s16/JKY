Looking for a place to have dinner I decided to come to Border Grill. I was familiar with the name and know about the celeb chefs that created this chain so I figured i might be in for a treat. In all honesty, its a step above El Torito. 

They started off the dinner by bringing out some chips and 3 different types of salsa. The salsas were not bad but not spicy enough for me. But I have a very high spicy tolerance so cant really fairly rank the salsas. Not bad though. with my Yelp check I got a free blanco margarita. Pretty average margarita and glad I got it for free, as the price for this drink was $11 and it was not worth $11 by any means. 

To eat I ordered the Pork Carnitas.. Pork Carnitas???? Kind of an oxymoron because carnitas are always pork.  When you see Carnitas on a menu that automatically registers that it is pork. Theres no such thing as beef or chicken carnitas right? I'm mexican so I like to think I know what I'm talking about in this matter. Anyways, I ordered those and they came with a couple of corn tortillas plus rice and beans. The carnitas were fine. not going to win any awards. Rice and beans were average. Tortillas could have been hotter and heated up over an open flame to give them that burnt flavor that I love. Like I said at the beginning of this review. A step above El Torito. That pretty much describes this place in a nutshell. And at the cost of $24 not worth the price. But that applies to pretty much anyplace in vegas.
