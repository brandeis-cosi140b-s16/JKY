Was in the mood for some good Mexican Food, and thought SuperMex would fit the script. Arrived to learn that it is now Jalisco Cantina. Menu seemed similar, so I thought what's the harm? I noticed many spots on the wall needed a paint touch up, but the new art being displayed was nice. Was promptly served tortilla chips with beans and salsa. The salsa had a good kick, but the beans were pretty bland. Ordered the chile rellano, and chicken enchiladas with rice. Our waiter gave us a plate with shredded beef enchiladas instead. Initially we were not too thrilled, but thankfully it was tasty. The rice, however, was lacking big time. The chile rellano was eh, and we never got any more chips. Makes me sad.
