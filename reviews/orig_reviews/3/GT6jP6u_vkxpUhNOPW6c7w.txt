More like just-OK, came here today after hearing good things about it the other day from some friends that love the downtown location.  The atmosphere was the same casual look of Garcias and the service was very good as well.  The food though was just OK and maybe I was disappointed from all the hype.  I ordered a pollo fundido (called something else though) and my wife had a combo which included tamale, tostada, & enchilada.  My fundido was pretty good but Carolos Obriens still blows it away and my wifes tamale was a little dry and she wasn't impressed with the tostada or enchilada either.  It's hard to say if we will be back since Macayos is so close to this location and that is just slightly better than this place.  I was still tempted to make the drive to Carlos Obriens the whole time i was here.  Salsa was just OK also, but i asked for hot sauce and they brought me some pretty good stuff that mixed well with the salsa.
