This place is decorated very well, little on the Scottsdale side.
Weird booths, with tables that come up mid shin, not kidding. We opted for a hightop.
All the doors were open, and it was chilly, there were heaters on the patio, but they forgot about us inside.
Waitress was great! 
I ordered corn tacos, but they were out of corn tortillas! Really? No one could run to the store and get them? It is a mexican menu. I don't get that.
I got the beef kabobs, they are awesome! Prefectly cooked, lots of flavor!
I would probably go back for a happy hour, we'll see.
