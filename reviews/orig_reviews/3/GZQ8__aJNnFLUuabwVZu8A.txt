The ambiance is really nice.
First service sucked they did not allow us pick a table, restaurant was empty.  Later waiter came and allowed us to pick better seating. 

Ordered guacamole it was just not spicy returned it.
Chips came too oily and salty did not enjoy it.
For appetizers I ordered the canitas taco it was ok but now wow. My friend order fish taco and it was great,  I tested it.
