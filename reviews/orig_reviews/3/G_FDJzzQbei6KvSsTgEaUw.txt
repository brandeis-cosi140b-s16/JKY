We grabbed a bite before our flight, not knowing anything about the place. Mixed reviews.... the fish tacos were awesome! I really liked the overall flavor & how finely they shredded the cabbage. I am picky about my fish tacos. 

The nachos were pretty bare & the chips were rubbery. 

Would go back for the fish tacos, but that's all.
