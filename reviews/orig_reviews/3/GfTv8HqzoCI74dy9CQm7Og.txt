Basic margaritas and "Mexican" food. We opted to avoid the margaritas and went with a basic cosmo and a tanqueray and tonic. Both good choices, strong and well mixed. 

Started with the chips and salsa which came with two salsa varieties: a red, smoky salsa and a green and rather spicy salsa. The chips were warm and salty (just the way I like them). We asked for more of the red salsa because we loved the smokiness of it. The waiter, Raymond, obliged and was very courteous to us. 

Since we were heading to a show, we ordered a couple of appetizers instead of full entrees. Got the shredded chicken taquitos and an order of the table-side made guacamole. Both were good choices, in fact, the guacamole was perfectly seasoned. 

All in all a good choice, fairly inexpensive, and decent service.
