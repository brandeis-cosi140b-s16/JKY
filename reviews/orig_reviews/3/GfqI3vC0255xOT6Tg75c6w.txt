The food here is delicious. I always get their shredded chicken tacos and I am never disappointed about the quality of the food this location serves. 

My issue, however, is that my order is always prepared incorrectly every time I go in. I always order the two taco meal with an extra taco and they always try to charge me for three separate tacos and separate rice and beans. I have to explain to literally every person in the assembly line what I had ordered and it still comes out wrong in the end. You HAVE to tell them you want that extra taco "a la carte" or they will NOT get it right. They will also miss topping additions you ask for. They are definitely rushing to clear out the line and they miss things because of it. You really have to tell them multiple times what you want. 

They also call their salsa verde something else which I ALWAYS forget! And if you don't ask for it in that name, they say they don't have it. Even though it is right there. In front of their face. It drives me batty!!

I would like to emphasize again though how good those chicken tacos are and even though they mess up a lot, I still go back.
