I love this place for Happy Hour, BUT, do not go at 5pm!  We went in on Fri at 4:50 & All 6 little pub tables around the bar were taken.  There were 3 of us & the hostess wanted us to sit at the bar.  How can 3 people sitting at a bar share an appetizer, let alone have a nice conversation? They would not allow us to sit at a table & still get the Happy Hour discount.  Very Disappointed, as this place is now owned by the Boulder Resort & we would expect better serivce. Not to mention, that we Aways order dinner too!  If they are going to be this crowded during their Happy Hour, why don't they add more pub tables?  Very unfair and turned us away :(
