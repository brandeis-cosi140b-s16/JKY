If your banker ever invites you to lunch, insisting on the restaurant, I hope for your sake it's a place you don't like. 
Because here's what happens when it's a place you like.

She (the banker) drops some kind of bomb on you during lunch, making you want to reach across the table and kiss her with the little corona beer bottle salt shaker. 
You don't of course, but that does a couple of things.

First, you'll never return. 
Even though the service and food were good, you'll avoid the place as if you were about to contract a new strain of chlamydia by touching the hot plate your server told you not to. (I can never resist) 

Second, the next time you order fajitas anywhere, no matter how good they are, you'll dredge up memories of that day that are best forgotten. 
And it's a damned good thing if you do forget them.

Otherwise you're going to have one helluva time explaining to the ER trauma surgeon how you got a corona salt shaker jammed up your ass after your banker's apparition appeared on your wife's face and you unspooled.
