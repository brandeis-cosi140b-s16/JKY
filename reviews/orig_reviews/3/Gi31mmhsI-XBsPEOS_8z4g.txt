For all of the great places to eat in the area, I'd skip Pink Taco unless I were staying at the Hard Rock and needed something fast.  It's pretty standard Americanized Mexican, but I think they dropped the ball in a few key areas.

First off was the chips and salsa.  The chips were A+, some of the best restaurant chips I've ever had.  But the salsa...D-.  They gave us 3 different kinds: tomato-based, dark green, light green.  Each one tasted pretty much the same and had ZERO spice to them.

I ordered the chicken tacos which came with rice and beans and also tried the chicken skewers.  The tacos were basically chicken and pico de gallo on a tortilla.  All ingredients were good, but how about a little cheese and seasoning to the chicken!  The chicken skewers had a little spice to them (finally!).

The service was quick and everything came out correctly, but the waitress was clearly not in a mood to be friendly with a group of 16 guys who tip well.  Her loss I suppose.
