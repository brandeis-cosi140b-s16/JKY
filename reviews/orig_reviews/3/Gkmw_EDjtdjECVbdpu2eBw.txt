Great hip place to go when you are in the mood for upscale modern Latin fair. I wish I could remember the name of our waiter, he was phenomenal. Really excellent service. 

My two favorite things were the table side guacamole and the bread pudding. Seriously, the bread pudding is to die for... I highly recommend it... even if you THINK you don't like bread pudding. 

I'd suggest going here for a girls night out or on a date. The bar was packed when we got there as well. Overall the food was good, the desert was ridiculous and the service was excellent.
