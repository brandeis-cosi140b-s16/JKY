I was a little disappointed in Barrio Queen. The decor and service were great, but the food was not inspiring at all. I like the idea of the a-la-cart tacos. We tried many of them and the tacos were pretty decent. The entree, chicken mole was sooo bland. The mole was OK, but the chicken was overcooked and so boring. The drinks and the tequila selection are great. Unfortunately, the do not offer tequila flights, so you have to order them per shot.
