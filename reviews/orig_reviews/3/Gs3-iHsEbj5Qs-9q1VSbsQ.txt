The building is funky and I loved the blue and yellow color scheme. The person who took our order was super friendly. Since this was our first visit and there was no line we did the usual staring at the menu saying "uhhhhh" while he patiently waited for us to make our choices. We both got the chicken burrito and I added guac to mine and the man ordered chips and queso. 
 
The wait for the burritos was a little long considering we came at an off time and the restaurant was empty. No problem, that gave me plenty of time to check out the salsa bar. I loaded up on a few flavors to try. When we received our order the burritos were a medium size and the chips that came with our queso were in a sealed plastic bag. I don't think I have ever had bagged chips before and there weren't that many considering we were splitting the queso and I had hopes of going crazy sampling the salsas. The queso was yummy and I ended up dipping my burrito in it when we ran out of chips. 

The real let down unfortunately was the burrito, which was pretty bland. Mexican food doesn't have to be spicy to be well seasoned and I felt there was no seasoning on the meat, beans or rice in the burrito. They do get points for the generosity of cheese and guac! 

I would go again but I would definitely try something other than the chicken burrito.
