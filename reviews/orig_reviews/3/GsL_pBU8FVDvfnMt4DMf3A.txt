I wrestled with what rating to give them. I decided on 3 just because while the food was excellent, the service took away from that. Very slow, disorganization handling multiple orders, and last, no hello,goodbye, kiss my grits! Cashier just stares, like I am suppose to read her soul. When I have an extra 40 minutes to spare waiting for the food, I will go back. Authentic and worth the price.
