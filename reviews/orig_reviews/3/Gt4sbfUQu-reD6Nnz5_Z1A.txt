came here for lunch one day and grabbed their chorizo queso and the lunch tacos ( grilled chicken, steak, and carnitas) the server was super nice and friendly but the food was really average. the outside area has its own bar and looks super cute so we may come back for a drink one night but I dont' think we'll br coming back for the food :(
