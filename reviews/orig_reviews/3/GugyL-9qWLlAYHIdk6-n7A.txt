it's a little embarassing for me to admit that i have been here more than once, hell probably 8 times or so. But I have to note that it has only been for their happy hour, which is pretty good, esp. on a date.
The drinks are a lot more affordable, the entrees are somewhat cheaper, and most of them are pretty tasty. The bottomless chips and salsa appetizer during happy hour here is pretty killer, although the servers tend to look down on you by the time you ask for your 5th refill......dont call it bottomless if your gonna sass me! im a hungry boy!
Ladies seem to love this place, idk why, i mostly feel uncomfortable in here, maybe im a little too sensitive to my lower class brat upbringing.
I like this place strictly for the happy hour, and should you try it out im sure you will as well.
p.s. the corn bread is bitchin!
