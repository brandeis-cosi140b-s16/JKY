Decent, but nothing that totally blew me out of the water.  It gets one of the stars solely for the reason that it opens up to the strip, so it's prime for people-watching!! There's an upstairs deck, too, but I didn't get to check it out.  

Party atmosphere, cool vibe, fun theme.  If you're coming directly from the Monte Carlo, you get to trek down a huge ramp like you're going into hell!!  Prices are reasonable for Vegas standards.  Food wasn't bad (I had chicken enchiladas), but I'm almost tempted to take away a star because the chips and salsa weren't free! Sacrilegious!
