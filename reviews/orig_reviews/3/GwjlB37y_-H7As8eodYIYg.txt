This review will be short. My favorite food is a bean burro, enchilada style. Their bean and cheese burro (E/S) is very good. However, the price is too high for my food budget. The burro is $5.95, and the red enchilada sauce is an extra $2.25. If you have an ice tea or a soft drink, that adds another $2.25. The total is $10.45 + tax.  Add on a tip and you bought yourself one very expensive bean burrito. 
The waiters I saw that night were very friendly, and two of the guys working there were almost too hunky to be human. I may go back some day to get some DNA samples from them so that I will finally know the truth. If these two guys are what the people of their planet look like, I hope they colonize our planet in the very near future. Thinking about them made me lose my train of thought. Anyway, to summarize, Best Buy is a great place to buy new CDs.
