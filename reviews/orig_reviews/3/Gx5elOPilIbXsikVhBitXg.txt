We tried this place because of the favorable Yelp reviews and were disappointed.  Granted, we did a carry out, we felt the food was best marginal.  On a scale of 1-10, we gave the food a 3-4.  Very plain  across the board.  

Service and manager was friendly.

May be better eating in the restaurant.
