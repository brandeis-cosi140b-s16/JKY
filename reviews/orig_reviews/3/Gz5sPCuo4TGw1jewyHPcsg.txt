It's impossible to go into Steel Cactus for the first time without comparing it to a well-loved Pittsburgh staple, Mad Mex.  Things that I prefer about Steel Cactus:

-Happy hour.  I almost don't want to mention it here so it doesn't get crowded, but they pour a hefty glass of wine for just $3. Other drinks are also reasonably priced and the appetizers are 1/2 off.  It's great.
-Service.  I've sat at both the bar and dining area, and the service was great at both locations.  It did take a while for drinks to come out, but our food was served right away.
-Tacos.  They double-wrap their tacos, and I think the use a corn tortilla instead of a flour one.  Delicious.

Steel Cactus can improve on a few things:
-Menu.  It's not a huge menu, which I usually prefer, but I wish there were more vegetarian options.  The tacos were good though.  The guacamole was just okay.  They had a great choice of salsas, and the one we had (there was corn in it! was great).
-Drinks.  I had a regular margarita on the rocks and it wasn't the best.  My friends' specialty cocktails were also on the sweet side.

I'm not giving up on Steel Cactus just yet.  Their happy hour is great and I still have to try their other 4 salsas!
