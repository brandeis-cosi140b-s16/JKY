I went here for St. Paddy's Day brunch with some friends, and overall it was a good experience. The food was good, the atmosphere is great (live music on the lawn just outside their patio area!), service was friendly and helpful. However, a few things were wrong enough for me that in spite of the good food, I've had to knock a couple of stars off of this rating.
For starters, we ordered their featured "green Bloody Mary", as we were feeling particularly festive. The result was a bunch of cilantro and tomatillo with undetectable alcohol content (maybe it was just really buried in the salad of a drink). I can't believe they were actually serving this to people. I appreciate the attempt, but when it comes to Bloody Marys, there's no shame in sticking with the classics. 
Next point of contention: the portions. The Dristrito Benedict was delicious, but it was seriously 6 bites worth of food for $14. This restaurant is not high-end enough to get away with puny portions. I was so hungry that I actually continued drinking the cilantro concoction. 
If I came back here (which I might; like I said, the food was good and I'd just order a different drink), I'd make sure to load up on appetizers. Lots of items of the brunch menu looked amazing, but I'm assuming you'd need to order in multiples if you have an appetite like mine.
