Not an amazing place by any means, but it does the trick. i had good company so it helps. But to be fair, there is nothing that make this place stick out to give me a reason to pick this place over another competitors establishment. 

Nothing. And by nothing I mean only one thing. And by one thing I mean the margaritas. Those small vicious, awesome little tricksters in a glass. Those would be the thing. But you cant choose an after work place only based upon the margaritas can you? ... you can!

I might come back here. If I do, it'll be for the margaritas.
