Carolina's claims to have the best tortillas in town, and that may be so, but what's inside them counts too, and here I didn't feel that this place lived up to the hype. 

Carolina's does offer good food for great value; I ordered two burros (green machaca and 3-way with beans) and made it out the door for around 7 bucks. 

As you'd expect at a place that's so insanely cheap, the dining room ain't much to look at. 

Would I go back? With so much top-notch Mexican food in Phoenix, probably not. But I would recommend Carolina's. They just need to get their other ingredients up to the level of their tortillas.
