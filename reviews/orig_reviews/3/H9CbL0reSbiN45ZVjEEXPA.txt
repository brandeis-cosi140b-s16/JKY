Viva Michoacan recently changed ownership.  Used to be awesome, but some of the techniques seem to have left with the last owner.

We had a coupon, so we recently went here.  Had chicken chimichangas, chili rellenos, enchiladas (chx), and a burrito (chx).  Our table mostly agreed that these items had been better in prior visits.  The food is now more bland, as noted by prior reviewer.  Portions are now perhaps a little smaller, though still large enough.  Prices have increased over the last year or so.  

We used to be 1x/mo regulars.  Now we would probably go back again if we had another coupon, just to see if they still know how to make their formerly-very-good mole.

Service is still outstanding and the chips and salsa are tasty.  Waiters keep drinks refilled and are always friendly.
