**3.5 STARS! The Stand is a charming little local burger + tacos joint with hidden gems in their menu. I always get 2 of their 3 tacos: short rib, chicken, and they have a vegetarian option as well which is a point in my book. Their tacos are 4/5 in my opinion. The meat is sometimes dry and can be a little too sweet sometimes but they're the perfect size and filled with yummy pickled toppings. Less than $3 each. I also don't come here without an order of chips & guacamole. Chips taste homemade and are served warm which I like! The serving of their guacamole is a little small, not the right ratio of chips to guacamole unfortunately. I had the chance to try The Standard burger for the first time and it is perfect! So close to In-N-Out which is awesome because there is none in the Central Phoenix area. And extra side of The Stand sauce is a MUST. So close to the thousand island flavor of In-N-Out spread. YUM! Every time I come here and see Mexican street corn on the menu, my mouth waters but they never have it when I come in! It's either sold out or out of season. So sad. On the bright side, they have Horchata and other traditional Mexican juice drinks which are always available. The Stand is definitely a must try.
