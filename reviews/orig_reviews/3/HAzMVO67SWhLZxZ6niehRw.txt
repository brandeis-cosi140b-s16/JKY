We ate there Friday night  - place was packed and it took ten minutes for our server to find us, but once she did, the service was excellent.
Are you people really that stupid that you don't know that the carafe of salsa is so you can pour it over anything on your plate?  and on the small side plate to dip your chips in?  it's perfect poured on the beans and rice; Jeez, you all sound like idiots for complaining about this like it's someone else's fault that you aren't smart enough to figure it out.
anyway the salsa is award-winning, the cheese crisp with chiles and onions was very good, I had an excellent plate of Machaca which is very hard to find outside of Tucson, and Linda had halibut with a veracruzano sauce that was damn near perfect.  Negro Modelo on draft, and fresh coffee too.
No complaints for me - and did anyone notice the front room dome ceiling done by Paolo Soleri? it is a spectacular work of art, as are the wonderful hand-drawn murals.
there is a bit of attitude problem there at the front; it's because they always have enough customers to keep the place hopping - and there's a lot of reasons why
