The owner and his staff are very welcoming and friendly. But...

I grew up in New Mexico and was so hoping a place claiming to be REAL New Mexican food would actually be awesome here in AZ. 

We tried three different dishes and have to say, not really impressed. Just Okay, Still searching for that 'wow, I am home' place but sadly, this is just not it.

Onward!
