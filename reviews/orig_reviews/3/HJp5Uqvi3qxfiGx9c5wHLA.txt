OK, so we went back tonight for dinner.. I have to say, I was pretty peeved that they raised their prices.  So, now when I ordered just ONE shrimp taco, it came out to 4.90 with tax and all - are you flippin' kidding me!?!?!  It's about 5 shrimp, chipotle cream salsa, red cabbage, and corn tortilla for FIVE DOLLARS.  No way... I mean, they're pretty damn good tacos for being hundreds of miles away from the shore, but 5 dollars for ONE taco?  That's a bit presumptuous. 

Like I said before, I'm not expecting .99c value meal prices.. but I'm also not paying Scottsdale prices for a taco.
