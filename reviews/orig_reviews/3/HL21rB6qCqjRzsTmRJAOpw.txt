Besides taking the order 20-25 minutes after we were sat, delivering the food, and giving us the check, our waiter was hardly around. He took the order of everyone around us, including a few couples that sat down after us. The busser was attentive in refilling our waters, chips, and salsa. He was also the one to pre-bus the table and check up on us. 

I had been eating throughout the day and was just snacking on the chips and a few bites here and there. The mild salsa was best described, by my friend, as a pizza sauce. The chunk spicy carried a light kick but was lacking in any other flavor. My friends both loved their meals. The cheese enchiladas were gooey and was good for a simple meal. The carnitas (12.95) were pretty amazing though. The meat was tender and moist on the inside and the outside was crisp. The plate came with rice, beans, two tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, and sliced avocados. 

The food is cheap and decent here. The lower rating is due to the poor service by our server.
