This was the one of the better restaurants I visited in two weeks at Pitt, and the fact that it's getting three stars says a lot about the quality of food in the area.  Still, I can't deny that it was decent.

So, the good.  It was okay.  They actually had salads that didn't taste like they had sat in a refrigerator for several days.  Their beer selection was decent, not just the usual Dos Equis/Corona.  

And the bad.  Their tortillas were crap, clearly purchased at the local mega-mart or at least tasting like it.  They really took away from my tacos.  Their taco salad was very underwhelming.  It was nice to have fresh greens, but the meat was greasy and over-seasoned.  Their guacamole is also over-seasoned, though not terrible.  The service is on the slow side, it was very crowded both times I was there, and the music is much too loud for a crowded restaurant without a dance floor.  

The second time I was there, our food took at least 40 minutes.  We didn't complain because it had been slow the first time we were there, and we were enjoying ourselves.  Without any complaints from us, our server explained that our ticket had gotten lost, apologized profusely, and took our drinks and appetizer off the bill.  So, high marks for service even if it was generally slow.

Overall, the food was average, the service was okay, the atmosphere had its problems, but it was above average for the area.
