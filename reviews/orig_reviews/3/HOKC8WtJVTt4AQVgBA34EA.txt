I was sad to only give Los Dos 3 stars. I love the other locations but the Camelback location has some major service issues. The food however is still outstanding if you like super hot New Mexican style food. I love the chorizo dip. As I said though the service left a lot to be desired. Super slow. Had to ask repeatedly for our water to be refilled.  I will visit Los Dos again, just not this location.
