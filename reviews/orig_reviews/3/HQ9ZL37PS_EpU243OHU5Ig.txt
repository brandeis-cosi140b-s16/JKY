I've been here once or twice when I was younger, so obviously I can't remember what the food tasted like or my overall experience. 
Today I went for lunch with my husband and daughter and was pretty let down. 
The ambiance was fun, we sat outside next to the waterfall (it was hot, but I love the sound of water).
Our server was very nice and energetic but super slow. I don't know what his name was and it took forever to put our order in! Was it busy? No. It got pretty annoying because my 18 month old is FAR FROM patient. Oh well, she got back at slow service with the beautiful mess she left under her chair :)
None of their salads sounded good, but I'm picky with dressings. I'm sure they're great. I could have eaten burgers and fries but I'm really trying to eat healthy! SOOO I got a cup of soup and it was overpriced and wasn't "stop the presses" fantastic. My bad.
My husband got the "Green Chili Philly" and that was friggin' GREAT! I should have ignored my diet for one meal. 
My daughter had chicken fingers and fries and those were also great! (Yes, I nibbled on a few).

Lesson learned? Do NOT go here for soup :)
All in all, it was OK.
