I went to Rosita's for lunch with a large group of coworkers. After hearing the praises sung about this place, I was ready to have "real" Mexican food (by my coworkers' definitions). 

The location is small and not particularly tidy, but was seemed to be pretty legitimate, and we were happy to take the trip over.We started out with chips and salsa, red and green. The green was HOT, while the red was more mild, but they were both very flavorful. Our group of about 12 people was waited on by one woman, who did her best, but definitely could have used some help on a party that large.

We started with cheese crisp, which was new to me, and delicious! The cheese was hot and evenly melted, with a rich, buttery flavor. I added a little red salsa to give it a kick, and really enjoyed it!

We waited a LONG time to get our entrees (I would guess 45 minutes from the time the crisp was delivered), and I was accidentally given the wrong entree. I'd ordered a chicken burro, enchilada style, with rice, and received my boss' order of the same thing, but with beef. After cutting into it, I passed it to him and let the waitress know what I had ordered and that I hadn't received my food. 10 minutes later, she returned to our table with another burro (the one pictured) that was okay, but tasted a bit off... after examining it, I realized that it was pork... which I don't really care for. Not wanting to slow down an already-long lunch, I decided to just go ahead and eat the second burro, despite my not really caring for the meat. 

All in all, I might be willing to give it another try, but the wait and receiving the wrong food twice were fairly off-putting. It would likely have been a better experience, had our table had an extra waitress, as my drink also sat empty for about a quarter of the meal with no server in sight. My fingers are crossed that next time, the experience is better. I was really looking forward to the meal, and it just didn't come out as good as I'd hoped it might.
