I love the food at Cafe Rio! It's great portions and good prices! As much as I love the food I'm giving this particular location 3 stars because customer service was awful! I walked in to a busy joint but when you looked at the employees they weren't friendly and they looked like they hated their jobs. In fact one employee who worked on my tostada gave attitude to a fellow employee in front of me and other customers. I felt bad for the cashier because my order was incomplete as the employee who gave attitude forgot to give me dressing with my meal and I asked the cashier who seemingly was afraid to ask because of the attitude of one of the fellow employees. I was absolutely ashamed for this location because each employee didn't seem to smile or show any hospitality.
