STARVING & NOT HAPPY! I'm giving 3 stars because it's not really the restaurant's fault that I waited over an hr for food that was never going to come. Don't order through the yelp app for delivery because A) they don't deliver and B) there is a huge DISCONNECT with the people/companies involved.  HUGE fail Eat Street, huge fail. What's worse is that it takes 3-5 bus days to get a refund?! Are you kidding me? Please get the information that's available to your customers right. Marketing is only as good as the information given. Let's try and keep that correct. Just a thought.  Especially useful if you don't want 'hangry' customers waiting for food that'll never come!
