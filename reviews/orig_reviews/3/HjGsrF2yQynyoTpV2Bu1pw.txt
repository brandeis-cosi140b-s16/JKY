I'll start off with saying that the prices for the location of this restaurant are outstanding! I went this past weekend with a friend to enjoy sitting outside. The patio was quite enjoyable! 

We started at the bar since the patio was full and I wanted a "fresh" mojito. You know the one that doesn't include mountains of simple syrup, etc. The bartender was very accomodating and made me a great mojito! 

Our table was ready in just a few minutes and a nice gentlemen showed us to the patio which I believe was the manager. The service was great all around so that's a huge plus! They give you free chips, salsa, and jalapeno ranch (I believe). They were both great, I loved the spice in the salsa. However, I am giving 3 1/2 stars due to the actual food. The guacamole was just eh and the queso was oily/incredibly salty. The chicken quesadillas were bland and full of cheese. And my least favorite were some sort of chimys. Horribly bland and the sauce ontop was even worse. I really wanted to enjoy this place but maybe I should have gotten something else!
