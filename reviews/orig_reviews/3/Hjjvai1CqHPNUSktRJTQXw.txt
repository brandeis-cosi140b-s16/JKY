Decided to try this place tonight with my girl and her best friend and son.  Margarita pitcher to start with and usual chips and salsa.  Wish the margarita was a little stronger but it was good.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green chile sauce.  It was yummy but not outstanding.

My girl and her friend ordered some big dishes and they liked it.  her best friend said the Tamale was yucky tho.

Her son ordered the quesadilla with fries and he did not touch the quesadilla.  his mom tried it and knew why, it was nasty so we told the server and she refunded it.

Overall very nice, but I wanna try my mex appetite somewhere else next time.
