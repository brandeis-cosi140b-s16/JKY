It's a nice place. I don't think the food is any better than any of the other mexican restaurants in town.  The chips and salsa are ok.  The room that extends off of the main entrance can get pretty hot so make sure you check where the sun is setting before you agree to your seating arrangement.  The back patio is wonderful, especially in the cooler times.  The bathrooms are in the back patio so if you are seated in the restaurant you have to find your way to the bathrooms in the back.  This can be very confusing.
