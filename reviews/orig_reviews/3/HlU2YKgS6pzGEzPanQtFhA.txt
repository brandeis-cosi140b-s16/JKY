I love Mexican cuisine, and in my opinion, Emiliano's is just "ok." The food presentation is lovely, but  the flavor was lacking for the most part. 

I will rave about their Sangria Margarita's, which are delish! 

Overall, the convenience of this location is cool, but if I have the time to go elsewhere for Mexican, I would.
