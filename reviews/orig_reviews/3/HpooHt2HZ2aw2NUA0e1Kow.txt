The strip district in Pittsburgh was packed on Saturday during Labor Day weekend.  Was able to get a table at Casa Reyna.  Food and service was good.  The place was packed and hostess came over to apologize that the kitchen was backed up and our food would be coming soon.  Would have been nice if we were offered some chips and salsa during the delay but appreciated that they let us know about the delay.
