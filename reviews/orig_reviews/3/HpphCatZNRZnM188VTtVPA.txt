This is a difficult review. 

The food was good (the burgers were really good) and the place should be full of patrons because of it. 

Oddly, we were the only people in the restaurant. Besides the two servers who could have cared less that we were there, that is.

The restaurant itself, in my humble opinion, should be painted, totally aired out and present itself as a sports bar or burger joint. The combination of mexican food and burgers is odd, and if you ask me (which you didn't but I'm telling you anyway) it just doesn't sell. Do one or the other and do it well. 
 
The inside smelled heavily of grease, and we actually smelled like it after we left the place. Ick!

The 60's motif just doesn't cut it, and neither does the obnoxious yellow paint. 

However, the food is the draw, and the burgers were really good (and inexpensive, considering). I'd go back for a hangover burger, but have to keep my sunglasses on and febreeze in my purse...
