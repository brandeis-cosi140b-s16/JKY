I was excited to try this Drive Through Tacos & Tapas place, but was a little disappointed. 3 steak tacos and rice were almost $10 and for street taco size, not very filling for my husband- but they were tasty. 

I had a chicken taco with verde sauce that was good (and definitely better than Taco Bell) but I had to add a $2.50 chicken empanada and a $3 fried ham croquette order. The chicken empanada was very good and was perfectly cooked. The croquettes, however, we're very small and mushy.

I liked the concept but for street tacos, I would expect them to be lower priced. I can get 3 tacos from a standard brick and mortar Mexican restaurant for $10 and not walk away hungry - but the drive through convenience is nice.
