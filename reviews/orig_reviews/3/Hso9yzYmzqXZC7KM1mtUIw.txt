The food here is pretty good... I had the asada tacos and they were good but a bit dry, my husband had the pork torta special (I could have the name totally wrong) and he said it was the absolute best he has ever had. I am disappointed because I ordered (and paid for) the beans and rice for both meals and never got them. I didn't realize it until after we left (my own fault) because I had two kids keeping my attention during the meal. I will be back and I hope to be able to update with a better review next time. The food and service was great I knocked the rating down because I didn't get all of the food I paid for and my asada tacos were a bit dry.
