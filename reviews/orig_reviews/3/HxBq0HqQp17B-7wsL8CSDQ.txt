Came here while on a trip vegas since I was staying at the Hard Rock. The food was very basic as far as Mexican food goes.  

They bring out chips and salsa while you wait. There's three different salsas that they bring out with the chips. I personally wasn't a big fan of the salsas, but the chips were fresh and good.

I then ordered the chicken taco which was fair. Definitely nothing special or memorable in my opinion. It was about as basic as tacos could be. It lacked any special flavor and felt more like take out.

This is the type of place you come to after a day of drinking or maybe to grab a quick bite before you start drinking. But it's nothing amazing by any stretch. Food is good, but not that good.
