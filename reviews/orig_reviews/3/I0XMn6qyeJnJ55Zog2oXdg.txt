Yes, Cabo Fish Taco seems to be like a mecca for the throngs of people standing on the street corner waiting to get in on a gallery crawl Friday night in NoDa.  And Guy Fieri stopped by to film his Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show for food network there.  And it is known to be a favorite of NASCAR driver, Kasey Kahne.  But it is also just plain old solid food.

The owners finally knocked out the wall and expanded into the adjacent space after years of slowly doing the construction themselves and it was worth the wait.  They did a fine job adding the nicely finished surfboard bar as well as a refreshing street side outdoor dining area.  If you close your eyes you can imagine that the cars driving by are the sound of waves crashing... alright maybe not...

The fish tacos are obviously good.  The barbecue mahi mahi is insanely tasty.  Personally, I stick with the shrimp tacos when I am going the taco route.  And that is only because there was a lot of inconsistency with the steak tacos.  Sometimes extremely oversalted.

The wraps are also good as I am a fan of the Southwest Chicken wrap.  The combination of just enough spicy with the cooling cucumbers is the key.

For heavier fare, the Surf and Turf Pasta is good.  Plenty of shrimp and steak with bowtie pasta.  Although, it would be easier to eat if they finished prepping the shrimp by taking off the tails.  Sometimes, you just don't feel like eating with your fingers.

The margarita menu is expansive and good.  When the mood hits me, the Silver Surfer satisfies.  Otherwise, they have a solid beer selection to choose from.

Yes, the chips are usually cold, and the corn in the free salsa is canned.  But if you throw in a side of queso, it will curb the appetite that you built up while waiting on the street...
