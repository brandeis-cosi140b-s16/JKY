My wife and I had lunch on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. Our waitress was very pleasant and helped us with our menu selections.We shared the assorted appetizer plate, which provided two off each item. There were three different items, and each was tasty.The portion was decent for the $11 charge. My wife had chicken enchiladas, which she enjoyed and said they were the best she's had for quite some time.The portion was ample, but for $24 they should have put something on the plate to compliment the enchiladas. I  had a shortrib torta.It was plentiful and very tasty. However, the meat was somewhat tough. Shortribs should be soft. All in all we were a little disappointed, as the hype promised more.
