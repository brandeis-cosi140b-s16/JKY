Came here to eat dinner before a Carrot Top show. It took about 20 minutes to get seated, which is to be expected on a Friday night. We tried the flavored margaritas, they were good, but very weak. We had 3 each and I question if there was even any tequila, so we bought separate shots of tequila. The food was average mexican food, we had chicken enchiladas, guacamole, quesadilla, chilli relleno and tacos. The service was excellent!
