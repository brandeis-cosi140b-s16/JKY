No prices on the menu? Unless you're going upscale, this won't be pretty. And it isn't, friend. 

So I was stuck in the Vegas airport (once again, yes, a virtual Groundhog's Day of Lost in Lodi, only slightly farther east), and I see this lady at Cuervo's Tequileria with this big burrito. I say, "What's that?" She says its the carnitas burrito. That thing looks huge, I think. 

So I order it. Mine comes up out much smaller than the lady's. But it wasn't bad. The sauce had a lime cilantro taste, and the pork was soft.

Would I eat here again? No, at least not until I am stuck in Vegas again and desperate. Did I see other desirables on the menu or at the other tables? Yes, but nothing more interesting than your average Mexican no-frills restaurant. Did I find the service or the accommodations fair? No, I was at an airport.

The price? Well, it wasn't listed, so I suspect that that will change. So I pass that surprise on to you, dear reader. You will be disappointed, and yet, you will be full. Grab a Coke at the nearby Burger King. There's free refills, so get a small. You'll be smiling all over as you wolf down your undersized burrito.

Happy trails to wherever the friendly skies take you next...
