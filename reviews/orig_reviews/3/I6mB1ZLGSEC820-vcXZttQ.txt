Last night, I enjoyed a fun evening at modern margarita.  When we arrived, there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table so we put our name down and proceeded to sit outside on their patio while waiting. It was happy hour and the rustic margarita I had was great. We were called to our booth and our waiter took really good care of us. Unfortunately, the kitchen seemed to be really backed up because it took our food forever to come out. After all the wait, the food was just ok: the shrimp salad had a great dressing, but the shrimp themselves were really overcooked and dried out and the grilled fish on my fish tacos were also overcooked. The drinks were great, our server was friendly, but the food was lackluster. I would suggest this place to go for happy hour and enjoy their drinks and lively atmosphere.
