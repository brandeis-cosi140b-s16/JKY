Rosita's has a bad rep. It's a good little place and they retain employees for years, which is a good sign. When you go inside you'll immediately notice a sort of icky, midwestern grossness about it. Expect to see many corpulent men with military hair cuts. They will be squished tightly into their booths shoveling massive quantities of cheese covered food into their mouths. Try not to let that spoil your meal. 

Those guys go there for the same reason I do. When you sit down you get a basket of warm chips immediately. Their salsa, which is made with oregano, a much neglected herb in Mexican cuisine, is my favorite. I'm usually in a food coma from eating so many chips before my burrito even arrives. You will not leave hungry. It's good hangover food. If the wait at the over-rated Harlow's diner across the street is too long then try Rosita's instead.
