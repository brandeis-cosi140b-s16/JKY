I've heard many great things about Wahoo's Fish Tacos but I wasn't really impressed. It's an average place. The main reason I gave it only three stars is because of the staff. The young guy at the counter didn't know much about the food. I don't blame him. He might have been new and haven't had proper training. It's set up like a normal sit down restaurant but you order and pay for your food up front. But the people didn't check on us after bring us our food.
