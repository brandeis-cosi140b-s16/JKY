Met some guys here for happy hour the other night.  $2.25 Dos XX Ambers drafts and half price appetizers.  We ordered a little of bit everything.   The nachos weren't bad IMHO,  I really enjoyed the chunky salsa that came with the obligatory tortilla chip basket.  Reminded me a bit of Safeways Southwest Salsa, if you've ever had that. 

They also have a very tasty appetizer called "Hawaiian's Gone Fishing" which are four mini fish fillets on a stick, Mahi IIRC, served with three different dipping sauces.   The spicy red sauce was my favorite and really added a nice kick to the fish.  

No complaints about the service, we were treated well and I left feeling very satisfied after spending a little over $10.
