As a Coronado resident, I must admit I am absolutely thrilled at the restaurants that have successfully planted themselves in the neighborhood. After watching the building that now houses America's Taco Shop fail business after business, I was pleased to find something actually survive the location. 

The restaurant is friendly and inviting, and the staff is always super friendly. I do think the food is delicious, however I also find it to be overpriced. Listen, I have no problem paying $2.50 for a single taco, but when the taco isn't even the size of my hand, we have a problem. $7.50 for a taco 'meal' is a little steep in my book. 

The carne asada IS wonderful, though. I can't say that I have had much asada experience (although my dad does grill some kickass carne), but man, it's good. Also, the bean and cheese burritos will put that sad excuse of a burrito from Taco Bell to shame. The breakfast burritos are fantastic, too. 

It sucks that I can't completely jump on board with America's Taco Shop. I so wish I could, because it's so close and so convenient, but I can't justify spending nearly $20 on carne asada tacos for two.
