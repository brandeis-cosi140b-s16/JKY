First of all, the service was very nice. Our server was super attentive and polite.

The food though was just ok. We had the carne assada tacos and the chicken empanadas. The chicken empanadas were displayed beautifully on the plate, but wasn't super satisfying. The tacos were flavorful and big, and the lentil side instead of beans was an interesting take, but the fact that the lentil side was cold was not my thing. 

They did a very nice job converting this location over from what was once a bland Blue Burrito into a stylish taco bar. The have a great outdoor patio that would be awesome when it isn't hot outside. 

Their happy hour also looks quite good, and would come back for that before a movie at the nearby Harkins Theaters sometime.
