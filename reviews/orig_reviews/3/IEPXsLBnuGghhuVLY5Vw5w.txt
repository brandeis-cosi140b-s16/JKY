Enjoyed the queso dip tremendously. The guac tasted and looked too processed- like store-bought guac. The salsa had a good flavor. There were four of us eating and the pasta was the best: jerk chicken was great and just the right amount of heat.  The grilled chicken burritos were good: nothing special about them but nothing negative to say either.  Very spicy! The steak burrito was ok. Chambord margaritas were good bad strong. Would've liked more chambord in mine though. Overall, it's good, but didn't have exactly what I was looking for.
