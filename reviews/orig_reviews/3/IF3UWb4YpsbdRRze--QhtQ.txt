The food was tasty.   Its a fusion of mexican, Asian, and Jamaican.   The restaurant decor isn't that great but the price is right for all the food you get.  I think the system for odering could be improved.   By some type of number system.   Yelling your name out loud in a group of people is ghetto.  I really don't  want strangers knowing my name.
