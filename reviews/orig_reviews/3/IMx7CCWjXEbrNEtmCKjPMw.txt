We tried Habaneros out a couple days ago. The staff is very friendly and the prices are spot on for the amount and type of food you get. 
The nachos are a great starter for the value. Lots of meat, beans, cheese and all the other fixings that nachos should have. The chicken fajitas were huge for $10. Not the best ones I've had considering there's no lettuce or tomato included, but not bad. Lots of peppers and onions. 
The carnitas burrito (enchilada style) is something I would definitely pass on. The meat was extremely bland and there wasn't any wet sauce that you could expect on an enchilada style burrito. 
I would give them a 3.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm not necessarily dying to go back. The quality just wasn't quite there, but at the price point it's still a value.
