We were there this evening from Chicago, 5 pm reservation. I had been before and it was excellent. Tonight, just OK,  wouldn't come again. 
The Chips were extremely Salted, too much. The Guacamole had too much lime. The first Kale salad we sent back, way too salty. It was the dressing, way to salty. Not sure why this French trained chef needed to use so much salt in dressing. Next salad was better.  
My fish was delicious as was the duck. 

When we were asked twice how things were, we answered the second time with, Many folks are using phones and flashlights to see, maybe you need some lights over here! I presume it was the Manager who didn't even listen to what we said and went to speak with the waitress. He seemed pretty Arrogant. He should lose the attitude because dinner this evening was very disappointing.  Presentation is very important for customers. With no lights, we couldn't see the presentation or what we were eating.
