Food was ok, nothing I had really stood out. (chicken chimi meal)  Went here because of the 2/1 coupon I had.  Food was heavy and well portioned.   Service was a little slow but it was Saturday around lunch time.  Place is dark and had a funky vibe for a Mexican place.  Music in the background sounded top 100 of the pop list which I wasn't expecting.  Margarita was good for a hot day.  Read about happy hour specials, I might hit the place up for some of that instead of a full meal next time.
