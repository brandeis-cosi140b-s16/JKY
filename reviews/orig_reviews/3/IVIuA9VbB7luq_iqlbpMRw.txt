Went here twice with a good and mediocre experience. The food is good but service is not that great.  Example: TheY brought three entrees for 2 of us (accidental double order). Drink refills did not exist as the server didn't come around for 30 mins. The check was wrong (Included the double order), and that took 15 mins to fix. They shorted me $10 in my change and conveniently did not include a receipt. 10 mins to fix. At least this restaurant has good food and margaritas or they would get a 1 star for horrible service. The seafood platter is really good.  Be sure to count your change here though.
