I was soo excited for the restaurant to open since it looks so beautiful and it was much needed in this area.   The interior is gorgeous with the plants, fountain and grand staircase.  The food and service also didn't disappoint. I loved every bite.   BUT, the prices are too expensive.  $10 for a basic KIDS meal that doesn't include the kids drink.   A side of rice was $6.  I had the basic beef taco and cheese enchilada for $17.  These were LV "STRIP" prices.
