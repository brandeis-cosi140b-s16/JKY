Like others have mentioned, this place is tucked away in a strip mall on the SW corner of Val Vista and Baseline behind Arby's and soon to be behind a brand new IHOP.  I've driven past this place 100's of times and never even noticed it!  

Stopped in on a late Sunday afternoon and there was steady traffic in and out and for carry-out as well; always a good sign to me.  We were seated in a comfortable booth right away and it wasn't long before they brought us out chips and salsas.  The chips were warm and the salsas were mild!  Even the little cup of "hot" salsa had barely any heat at all.  Even the wimpiest of spice haters wouldn't even know it was "hot".  I mentioned this to our waiter who was quick to offer the "REALLY HOT Habanero salsa".  It was hot, as hot as I expected the other stuff to be, and certainly not as hot as other habanero sauces I've had.  It did have a nice taste and I'd for sure ask for it next time.

I had the seafood rellenos and they were okay.  Covered in sauce and cheese, and more sauce and cheese I had to dig through to find the actual relleno.  Seafood here really means shrimp, and there were a good amount of small shrimp under the cheese and sauce.  The actual pepper had a nice taste, and the pico de gallo served on the plate was cool and spicy.  Serve the relleno/shrimp with 1/2 the sauce and cheese and twice the amount of pico de gallo and I would have been much happier.  The beans and rice were good and served to sop up most of the sauce when I ate it the next day for lunch.  Portions are huge!  The margarita was tasty and guacamole was okay.

I'd probably stop in again for a margarita and try something different from the menu.  Had a comforable atmosphere and a nice sectioned off outside eating area as well.  Overall, everything was just okay, nothing special, not bad, just not particularly memorable.
