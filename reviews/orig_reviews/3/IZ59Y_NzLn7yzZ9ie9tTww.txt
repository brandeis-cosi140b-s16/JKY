Good decor, free chips and good salsa. Unfortunately, the food is a bit mediocre. The flavors were not there and some of the dishes portions were pretty small. Good customer service but that could also be because they do not have that many customers walking to the door. I ordered the fish taco which was pretty good. My boyfriend ordered the taco salad which had a big fried tortilla and very little salad, i would not recommend it!
