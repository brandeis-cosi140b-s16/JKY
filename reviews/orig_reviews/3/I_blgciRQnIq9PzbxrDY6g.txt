Ehhh - pretty much lukewarm feelings for Aunt Chilada's. Have been here 2x since moving in mid-2010 and most recently on Cinco de Mayo 2013.

Sat on patio area and literally waited about 10 min for some menus. Our server took our order and then overlooked (2x) our drink orders. Finally got our drinks after 15 more minutes. 

Honestly felt that the entire dining experience was "locate-and-chase-the-server-down" game. :( Food was decent (only ate chips and bean dip).

Best part of experience? Finally getting the damn check to end the cat-n-mouse game and the cute ducks waddling in from their pond. :)
