Okay, so I like Canteen and all, but dear Lord, let's turn that music down a notch! These guys have a great happy hour, but I realistically wouldn't come here if it weren't for that. I quite enjoy the small bites' baby back ribs - the portions are so small, but since they are half price during happy hour, I get two orders! I'm not a big fan of Tequila, but I know they have a big selection (obviously). I really like the atmosphere here, and the service has always been good. I may or may not come back, but we'll see. Three solid stars from me.
