I visited Rosita's today for lunch with a group of coworkers. A couple of my friends had previously visited, but this was my first experience. We chose Rosita's because of a promo coupon today which donated 15% of the total bill to a local animal shelter.

Previous reviews described poor service; however, our service today was about average for a busy lunch timeslot. I ordered the two item combo with rice & beans. I chose the shredded beef taco and the green corn tamale. Good flavor on the tamale, nice crunchy hard taco.
