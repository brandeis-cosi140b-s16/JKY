It is funny that most of the knocks against this joint are the price, with something like "...for Mexican food..." accompanying the gripe. Yes, there is dirt cheap Mexican food out there - some of it is even decent. But if you are getting an elevated experience with high quality ingredients, then expect a higher price. Hell, Italian food is largely based in pasta and sauce, yet they can charge whatever they want and there is little fuss over the price. With that said, does La Comida's food (MEXICAN even!) deserve a (slightly) higher price tag. Well... maybe. The decor and atmosphere are superb, there is no doubt about that. It sports a retro-chic (to pair two horribly over-used words together) look, and it is done with much love and care. The space is nice and open, and it seamlessly flows right into the street. As for the food - that is a bit difficult to judge from my one experience. My date and I stopped here for something light - only splitting an app and an entree. Oh yeah, and there were some chips and salsa going on, which were fresh and tasty. The app was a shrimp ceviche that was overly limey. The entree was the Camaron del Golfo - a dish with large shrimp, veggies, and sauce. It was solid and light, but seemed to be missing something. If nothing else, I plan on visiting Comida again for its cool, casual vibe. Hopefully, it will be with more people, so I can get more of the flavors going on here.
