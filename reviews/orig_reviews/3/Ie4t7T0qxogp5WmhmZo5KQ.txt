Is it worth the $20 cab ride off the Strip & the hour long wait for tacos? Not really. I really wanted to like these tacos - as reminiscent of authentic tacos of a bygone era - but this is NOT that place, sadly. Points for simply good food & authentic ambience. Would I make the trek back ? Probably not - but nothing here is offensive (great late night smells); this is just a good taco shack -- if you stumble upon it.
