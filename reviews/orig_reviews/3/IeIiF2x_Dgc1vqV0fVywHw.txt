I went here with my family trying to find a place that had bulgogi that rivaled living in Korea! It was good by far the closet I've had since being in the states. The only cons for me was they had know way to make it spicy other than putting Texas Pete hot sauce on our table. I also didn't like that their Korean wings tasted like soap they were so hot out the grease what ever sauce they put on them couldn't be found by my taste buds!! I did enjoy the different ways they used bulgogi in burritos. I'd return only for the basic bulgogi and rice!!
