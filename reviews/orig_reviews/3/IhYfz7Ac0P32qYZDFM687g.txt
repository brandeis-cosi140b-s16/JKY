So, I have this weird affliction that makes me feel really uncomfortable when someone puts a HUGE plate of food in front of me. I wanted the chile rellenos, but not the supersized plate! Alas, such is the state of dining in most restaurants these days, but seriously, if I would have known the portions were this big I would have shared my dinner with my friend.

Still, for Vegas we got a table on a Friday night with no wait and no reservation, the service was very attentive, and the bill was reasonable. My mojito was quite tasty also. So go, share, and enjoy!
