It's just ok. Cool space. Chicken and steak gourmet tacos were good. Short rib meat was disappointing. No kids menu - $8 for a cheese quesadilla.  Guacamole was good and the chips were good. Surprised chips and salsa were not complimentary. (Worlds best salsa at El Pinto in Albuquerque is free). Margarita was average. Our server, a younger guy, was slow to clear table and slow with the check.  Manager or owner asked how meal was and I said OK.  He did not follow up on why just OK.  That surprised me.
