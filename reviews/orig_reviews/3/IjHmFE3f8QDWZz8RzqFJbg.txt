The food is OK is not bad but is not the best sea food neither the decoration as many mexicans restaurants is scandalous the biggest problem here is too loud there is a band playing live terrible music that I can't even talk to my wife or place my order to my waitress really...I'm Mexican so don't say I'm being racist  IT SAYS IT'S A RESTAURANT NOT A BAR OR A CLUB you came here to eat in peace not to dance for God's sake besides there is an army of people trying to sell you illegals copies of movies and all kind of things. ...I THINK IM GOING TO TRY TO SELL EARPLUGS HERE AND START MY OWN BUSINESS
