This was tough to grade, because there were two different worlds in this restaurant. There's the Mexican side, and there's the Chinese side, with not a lot of fusion mixes, it was either purely Chinese or Mexican. I would say the Chinese food was actually pretty good, the shumai's were pretty inventive and tasty, I like the fish eggs on them, gave a lil nice pop sensation and the pork mix was good. I also like the house made vinegar/soy sauce mix, it was delicious! The Mexican cuisine part however, was terrible. The taco's, burritos were all so bland to me. In fact, I didn't even want to finish it, I gave the rest of my tacos to my friend who was famished and was lamenting the whole time of "why did we choose a damn tapas place right after a pool party, this place is wack!" he just wanted to fill his belly up, understandably so. Agreed on that point, and on that same point, if I couldn't even bare to finish a beef taco after a pool party, that says a lot about that beef taco. So if you eat here, my recommendation is to stick to the Chinese dishes! The Mexican dishes were just awful.
