Disappointed in my hotel guiding me to this place. Thought pretty bland taste.  The steak burrito was really lacking in flavor from the meat. I expect or hope for some local spices when in the area. Tortilla was overly doughy. Chips and salsa were good but average. No one in group had any one thing that was special.
