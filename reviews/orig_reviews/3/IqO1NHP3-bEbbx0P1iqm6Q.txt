If Loco Patron was located on a beach in Mexico it would probably be an amazing hangout after a long day of sand and beer but alas it's not....the patio is great when the weather is nice, bar is okay at best, drinks are good and staff is generally uninterested in you. You can tell a lot of the clientele are regulars (which is great) large amount of college guys and men still thinking they are college guys.  Had the chicken quesadilla ( it wasn't that great) how you ruin a quesadilla I'm not sure, chips tasted older and salsa was runny.  Friends had the wings they were good! Decor looks like a beachside bar in Rocky Point, cleanliness?? Look it's a dive type bar/restaurant I don't think they are trying to be anything other than that, could it have been dusted? Sure, chip or two or ten on the floor of course! Definitely not my favorite place but with sports on the TV, a good bar and a ton of ASU fans.....I'll live!
