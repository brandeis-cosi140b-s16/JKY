For five dollars cheaper, I could have got a salad at pollo loco, with more chicken and all the other stuff that comes on a salad. The salad tasted fine. It was just extremely overpriced and for the "fire-grilled chicken" another dollar extra. Plus, they hardly put any chicken on it! The dressing was good. As I said in my tip, it's really noisy in here, very difficult to understand the people making the food when they ask a question. It must be popular because the place is packed. I won't come back. Pollo loco is my Mexican salad place from now on.
