Aunt Chilada's had some good things going for it and some not so good things going for it. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant and loved how the dining rooms were in separate little buildings and how the courtyard was beautifully lit, it added an air of intimacy to the restaurant. 

We didn't have an appetizers, we noshed on the awesome portion of chips and salsa we were served, very yummy! For my meal I ordered the veggie enchiladas and a raspberry margarita (they were out of pomegranate for shame!). The enchiladas were not great at all and totally fell apart as I was eating them. Definitely worth the loss of a star or two. The margarita on the other hand was supremely delicious and it was not long before I'd drank it up. 

If I'm ever in Tempe again I don't think Aunt Chilada's would be my first pick but overall it's an okay joint.
