This place is ok, but with not much else around in the C terminal it pretty much wins by default. The service is kind of slow and the food isn't that great. I was able to share the big blue buritto with my fianc√©e so that would be a suggestion if you are looking to be thrifty after a weekend on the town before you hop on a plane back home
