This place was ok 
Rice and beans were delicious the burrito was huge but the meat was not the best choice. Although the flavor was good the meat killed it for me I like my green chili with a different type of meat not shredded beef. The shrimp cocktail was big for an appetizer and the price for it was good too. it was lacking   In flavor but still good. Overall the flavor of everything was just ok not a huge wow for me except the rice and beans they were amazing. Would prob come again because the price was good and overall it was pleasant place to eat
