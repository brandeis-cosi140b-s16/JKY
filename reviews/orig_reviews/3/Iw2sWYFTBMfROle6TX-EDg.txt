Eh, it was just okay.  I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just wasn't what everyone cracked it up to be.  

The chips weren't warm, and the salsas all tasted the same.  

The chile rellenos (I had the cheese and also the beef stuffed rellenos) are not even worth rating as average.  They were severely undercooked, and normally you don't need to take in a knife to cut rellenos.  I was literally cutting through what seemed like raw chile.  The rellenos we have at our employee dining room tastes better than theirs.  And Leticia's is not cheap.  

Their award-winning tacos were delicious however, and that's what warranted them that extra star.  Their fried ice cream was also very good.  Their tres leches cake was not as moist as it should be -- weird.  That's what tres leches cake is about.  Moist and milky.  It tasted like boxed cake with milk and slivered almonds poured over it.  Other than that, the middle was somewhat dry.  

Will probably never go again.
