I have come back to this place a few times since my review for this place and here's what I think of it now: (by the way, this review is just based on the food and not the service.  The service is good and friendly).
1.  I really like it when Mexican restaurants offer free chips and dip, sadly this place does not.
2.  The last time we were here, the food was medicore... Here's what I mean by that:  the rice and beans tasted and looked like it's been sitting out for some time.  You know, when it looks all dry and burnt on the edges... You see it at times at a buffet when the food has been sitting out all day.. That's what it looked like. 
3. This is what my bf calls this place: it's kinda harsh though... It's a wanna be Mexican restaurant.  He says the food doesn't taste authentic, and the price doesn't match the quality of food.
*I really want to see this place succeed because they do offer vegan options which I love... but maybe with a few of these changes, they will have more people in the door.
