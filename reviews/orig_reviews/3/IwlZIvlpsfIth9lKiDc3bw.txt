Here's the thing.... You can feel the quality of the meat in each bite and you can taste a hint of a yummy marinade here and there but they really overdid the spicy thing here. Spicy is an understatement. I like spicy food, but you can take a crappy burrito and add original spicy salsa to it and it could taste decent. But why do this to amazingly thoughtful Mexican food? I think thy should take it down a notch so you can truly enjoy the quality of the tastes that they have masked in their tender meats and marinades. I would have given it 5 stars with the ambiance and grub but, unfortunately 3 for now. Ps service is great. Love that there are all different ages doing there too.
