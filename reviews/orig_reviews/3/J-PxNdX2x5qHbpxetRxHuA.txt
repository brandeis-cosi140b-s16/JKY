A hip place in a strange hotel.  The food was pretty good.  Rice and beans had more flavor than average.  The carne asada burrito was a treat, oozing with basically only carne asada and cheese, it had a great smokey flavor and a grilled tortilla.  It could have used some hot sauce or sour cream but I guess I'll know to order that next time.

Chicken enchiladas weren't as good but still tasty.
