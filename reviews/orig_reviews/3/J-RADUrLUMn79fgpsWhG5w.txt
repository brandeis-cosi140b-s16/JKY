This is such a cute restaurant, it's a shame it's tucked away in the World Market Center and kinda empty.  I'm a sucker for cute decor, and Mundo definitely is a great restaurant for a date night. Fun lantern lighting and romantic velvet sofa seats really set the mood :) 

I came here on a Th evening with my colleagues to celebrate a hard week's work. Mundo's "Happy Hour" is on the pricier side, and is only available at the bar. But the food is overall tasty and high quality. The bar area is cute and cozy and they had a very competent bartender. It's just sad that there aren't lots of people here. There's also only 1 small flatscreen at the bar, so it's hard to catch the game, and it's not really a place for groups. Intimate and low key. 

+Steak Tacos ($9 during happy hour for 3 tacos, yummy, but still $$)
+Guac ($6, fresh but bland)
+(virgin) Margarita ($4, super yums)
+Sangria ($5 during happy hour...looked yums!)
