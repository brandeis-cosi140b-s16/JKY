Valle Luna is one of my favorite restaurants, but I have to say I am bummed that we haven't received a buy one/get one coupon in the mail yet this year! That is our biggest incentive to make the 24-mile trip (each way) to eat here once a month. So we just went on Family Night (Wed) to save a few bucks. The hostess quoted us a 25-30 min wait. It ended up being right around 30 min.
The chips & salsa were on point! Chips were fresh & warm. Ordered my classic chicken enchiladas (no garnish) with rice & beans. Of the countless times I have eaten here, I have never had refried beans like that... it was as though the pinto beans they started with weren't fully cooked, so when they mashed them up for the refried beans there were firm chunks of bean in it. Very unusual consistency. Like I said, never experienced that here before.
My friend ordered his usual Southwest Chicken and when they brought it out, it was like these two, small, mangled pieces of chicken. It's always a nice-looking chicken breast. Again, very strange. They also forgot he asked for black beans and not refried, so our server said he'd bring out a side of black beans. They were actually very good. They seemed to be better seasoned than previous experiences.
Ordered a fried ice cream w/ chocolate for dessert. Our server forgot to add it to our check and when we pointed it out, he said, "It's your birthday right?" Well, my birthday is actually this month! He got a nice tip. So disappointed in the beans though... I know it was out of the ordinary, but I sure hope it doesn't happen again! And I would like my coupons back, please and thank you. :)
