We went to the La Hacienda prior to seeing the Christmas lights at the Princess. We ordered appetizers and glad we all  ordered our own since each appetizer was extremely small. 3 of us ordered the quesadilla con carne asada. it was tasty but did not look like a  quesadilla but rather like very small tacos. My husband got the queso fundido which not traditional either but came in a iron pan of melted cheese  with flour tortilla on the side. Everyone liked what they had, everything was very tasty so no complaints there and good service. The Margaritas were very good and nice size. but...the bill for 5 very small appetizers and 5 drinks was $150.00. I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that are just as good for a fraction of the price. I guess you are paying to be at the resort.
