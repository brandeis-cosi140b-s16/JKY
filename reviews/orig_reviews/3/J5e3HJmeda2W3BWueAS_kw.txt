I would totally give this restaurant more stars, BUT the waitress lady would have been better off working at an retirement home for people who dont remember anything. She took forever to get the order, i know I was waiting on my friend but I told her I would like to order please :) 
Then I got no water, even after I asked for it, twice. 
Mind you, she did not have many tables to serve.
If you like Sangria and you had REAL one before, DO NOT order this one. Its unfortuantely really yucky. The retirementhome waitress took it back, which was nice. The frozen margarita tasted as any other typical frozen machine crappy one they serve tourists that dont know better. 
BUT the food was REALLY good!!

The chips and salsa were fantastic and the guacamole as well. I had soft tacos, and they were, even though INSANELY overpriced, really good.

And, of course it being the hard rock hotel, the guy candy was not that shabby!
