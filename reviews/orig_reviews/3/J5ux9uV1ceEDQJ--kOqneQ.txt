Tried this place out today.  Had the duck taco, it was very well done.  The shrimp taco also captured my heart.  The coffee braised beef, was not a flavor to my liking.  At all.  The atmosphere was very cool.  I like the use of a historical structure.  Seating was comfortable, in a church way.  Pews and high bar stools.  This is not the place if you are looking for classic tacos, but it's amazing for new twist on 'em.
