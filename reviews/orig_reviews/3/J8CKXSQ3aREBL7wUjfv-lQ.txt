Pretty cool little taco joint if you are in the mood for some quick tacos... I ate here a couple days ago for the first time. 

Our tacos came out quick (i mean REALLY quick) and I admit that I was a little bit disappointed when I first saw them because they were small. However they were tasty, especially with the help of the salsa bar - the salsa bar is awesome.

I will definitely return when I am in the mood for some quick tacos.
