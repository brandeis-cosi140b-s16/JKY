Maybe it was just a bad day for unflavorful beef. My first time here and it was very confusing. The staff were nice though. Clean place. I thought it was a bit pricey. The 3 large tacos didn't look large at all. So because of the lack of flavor of the meat and price, I'd give it a 3 star. I'll try them again to be fair.
