I love the tacos here. Best in the city. Guacamole is fantastic. However, two major complaints. The chips are too greasy and they allow smoking in the private backdoor patio. I would gladly give them 5 stars if their chips were less greasy and if they stopped allowing smoking on their back patio. How lovely it would be to sit out there on a nice day but the smoking from other customers is awful- ruins the experience. I wish they were more healthy- cut the grease and the smoking!!!!
