I have experienced better, in this very restaurant! But, to my disappointment, that was not this case last Sunday when my family went to Gallo Blanco for my sisters birthday. I sat down, my dad told me his coffee was cold. I ordered a mimosa (it was 9AM, but I had heard that the law has changed, in Phoenix you can now get alcohol at 6 am.) Well GB still isn't serving till 10. So I got coffee instead, and mine was?? well, warm, not hot. There a fly stocking us at the table, then I noticed there where about 5 clinging to the window. The rest of our party arrived. We order guacamole was  delicious. Ordered our food. Food arrived, it was good. Again, my beans were ...warm. Then 9:55 came, and the table next to me had bloody Marys on it! I ordered my mimosa,light on the orange juice, and my sister said when the server told the bartender that, he rolled his eyes :(. As he was preparing that, my husband ordered a beer, from our server. My mimosa came and 3 minutes later his beer was placed on the table. 
Long story, long,  Food, good. Service and atmosphere, "Meh."
