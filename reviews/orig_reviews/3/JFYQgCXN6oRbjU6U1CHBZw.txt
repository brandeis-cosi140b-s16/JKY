The service was very good overall. Why I only gave 3 stars is because our food was only warm, not hot. Our fajitas weren't sizzling either. They was again, just warm. Food taste was good, but I've never had Mexican food served just warm. A friend ordered the fried ice cream and it looked like ice cream wrapped in corn flakes. The corn flakes were even stale! That was probably the only bad part of the meal...

Not sure I'd give it another try.
