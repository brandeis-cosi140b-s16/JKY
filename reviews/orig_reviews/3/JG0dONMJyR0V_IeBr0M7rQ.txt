This review is for dining service at the bar. We showed up about midnight and wanted to grab some late night chow. The place was busy, so our best option was sitting at the bar which had a few open spots. We started off with drinks, which easily hit the mark. As for food, we split a carnitas plate. To me, the food wasn't anything gastronomically sexier than I'd had before elsewhere. The service and hospitality of the bar staff was nothing special. I think Javier's is worth another try. The next time I'm staying at the Aria or Vdara, I'll pop in and update my review accordingly.
