I've been to Chayo lots of times. It's hit or miss, but it's a hit often enough that I  come back. Today was a miss. Do not order the huevos rancheros. I'm not sure that you can't actually even call the dish they brought me huevos rancheros. It was literally a plate with a greasy fried tortilla with scrambled eggs on top of it with a dollop of green salsa and a tiny little poop stain of black beans. Where's my beans, sauce and all that makes this dish yummy!? Now if you do decide to check out Chayo, here are the things to try: The chips and guacamole are great, the office margarita is my favorite, any of the three taco plates are great, and the chicken torta is good. The service is spotty and the prices are high, but it's at the LINQ, which I LOVE to hang out at, so the location is great and it you order right, you'll have a good time.
