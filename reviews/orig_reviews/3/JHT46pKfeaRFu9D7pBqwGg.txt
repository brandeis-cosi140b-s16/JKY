This place has low stars but in all honesty its not bad. 3 dollars dos x all the time sounds good to me. As a avid train rider, it literally drops you off at there door. Tons of monitors to watch NFL and they have golden tee.Service was kinda crappy and there was a despute over the bill but the manager worked it out.
