I wish I had read more of the reviews before I went to America's. I clearly did not order the right things. We got chips & salsa, carne asada tacos, and a vampiro. They were all good and we agreed that the salsa was excellent and the meat very high quality, but I was not blown away. Next time I will definitely try the corn, which looked amazing, as well as the carne asada burrito. 

Two things that bugged me about Americas:
1. We were a tad bit disappointed they did not have more choices on their menu. I understand keeping it simple, but if you are not in the mood for carne asada, you are kind of screwed. 
2. I love that they are selling real "Mexican" coca-cola, but it's a little expensive at $3 a bottle. 

Overall, cute (but very tiny) place that deserves a second visit.
