Having been a longtime fan of Rubio's, I was a little hesitant to try it out. I'm glad I did! The fish tacos were very good. Lots of meat in the fish tacos. I really liked that the tacos come plain. They have a great bar with different sauces and toppings so you can customize your meal. Loved the ranch on the seasoned fries. Definitely coming back!

UPDATE: Be prepared to smell "fried" all day. After I got back to work, I noticed the lingering smell of cooking oil on my clothes. My other 3 co-workers said the same thing. It was pretty bad. If you have to be somewhere after lunch, consider going somewhere else and try this place another time. The management needs to amp up the ventilation system over their equipment.

I have to go down to 3 stars instead of 4... But gosh those fries were good!
