We decided to get the Groupon that was $20 for $40 worth of food and thank God we did.  A plate of nachos with beef was $19 (enough for two people so that was a plus) and one beef burrito was $20. The food was just okay, and definitely over-priced.  I know it's right on the strip, but there are other places on the strip that have better food and prices.  The drinks were priced okay at about $11 for a specialty, or you can get a huge 28oz drink for about $33 and get one free.  Overall, it was okay.  I doubt we'll go back to eat, but we definably want to check out their Latin night upstairs.  It's suppose to be good.
