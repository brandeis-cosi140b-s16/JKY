Mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing. 

This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then.  Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe. 

Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.

I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme. 

Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though.. 

The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though.
