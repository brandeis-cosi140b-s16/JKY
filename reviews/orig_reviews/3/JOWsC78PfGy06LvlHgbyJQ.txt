Black bean taco.  $2.  Better than any/every burrito I've had in Manhattan since I moved, but not as good as some of the other hotspots here in the Phoenix metro area.

We went before First Fridays, and the patio was super cute all lit up at the nighttime.  Our server had a delightful conversation with us about Shark Week, which, you know.  Good good stuff.
