Went here because I drive by it all the time. Ordered the chips and guacamole. Very plain. Waiter took forever. Wasn't good service because of the lack of communication or asking "How was everything." Ordered the burrito next.  Burrito tasted awful the chicken was incredibly dry. Oh ya, don't even bother trying their soup they give you it tasted very gross. Would recommend the fish tacos though as they were delicious. Overall, I think chipotle is better at a fraction of the cost
