The interior is very cute and unlike the rest of the reviews I have read, the service was great. We went in on a Sunday around lunch time and surprisingly there was hardly anyone there. We ordered the brussel sprout nachos which were highly recommended and I would say they were OK (I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan) but if you are, I would order them. They come with a selection of different salsas which I enjoyed.
We also ordered a few of the tacos: steak, green chili chicken and cod and they were not bad. I would order again. 
I would go back to try the drinks and some of the desserts which sounded delicious. 
My only complaint is that it seems as if they raised their prices without adjusting the menus as the pricing on our bill was different for each item than what was listed on the menu (which they let you use as a placemat so you could easily go back and compare the pricing). Not a huge deal but the server/manager didn't seem too thrilled to adjust the pricing on our bill to the menu price (which they didn't do it properly, they just knocked off $1 for "inconvinence").
