The food is tasty but the portions on some dishes are definitely small. Tapas small. If this was a tapas restaurant, it would keep expectations in context. Keep that in mind when ordering. If you're hungry, it won't fill you up, but if you just need a snack or a light mean, it's definitely worth a try.
