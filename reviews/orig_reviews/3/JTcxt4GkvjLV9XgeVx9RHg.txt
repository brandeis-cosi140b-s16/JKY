This is a fun place for lunch... It's fairly new so my friends and I checked it out a couple weeks ago. I wasn't really a fan of their take on the complimentary chips and salsa that every Mexican restaurant gives out... The baked corn tortillas that act as chips were kind of hard and tasteless and I didn't care for the dips they provided either.

My friend and I shared the Naked Guacamole. Glad I shared it with someone as the helping was very generous... We ate it with chips as well as the meals we ordered and STILL had some left over. It was good but somewhat bland... similar to the "chips" and dip... not much flavor.

I had the Fish Taco Gobernador and it was very good, especially with the guacamole. I would definitely order it again, it had a lot of different flavors fusing together that made it delicious. My friend next to me had the Sloppy Jose and said it was amazing.

Overall, a pretty good experience. Wasn't impressed with any of their starters but I liked their main dishes. Our server was also very promt, helpful, and friendly!
