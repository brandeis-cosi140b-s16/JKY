Just had lunch here for the first time. Because of that I can only give 3 stars until I try some other things. If your looking for lunch at noon be prepared to wait or have a plan B. The place was full and customers kept coming. I had the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada style with green sauce rice & beans. It was very big and very hot. I kinda over did it with the chips and salsa because they also give you a bean dip and some kind of green dressing like stuff which I couldn't figure out what was in it, kinda tasty though. The service was fair but they were rather busy. My tab was $11 plus tax & tip. I'm stuffed and didn't make a happy plate...lots of to go boxes at other tables to....I'll be back.
