Went with two of my girlfriends on a Wed. Night. Seated immediately. Restaurant had a nice feel to it.

I ordered a traditional beer battered fish taco and a Wahoo Fish taco. The latter was simply amazing. The traditional (at least what I consider traditional) was just okay. Perhaps I had super high expectations because, oh I don't know, their name includes the words "Fish Taco". The corn salsa was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was just okay but my expectations weren't that of the beer battered fish tacos seeing as how it's not "Cabo Guacamole Dip".

This was my first visit so I asked our "too cool for school" waiter his recommendation. He smugly responded, "I haven't had a bad taco in 4 years." Dude, I didn't ask how long you've been employed at the establishment, I asked what you recommended from the establishment. 

All in all, food was good, nice environment, waiter was a douche.
