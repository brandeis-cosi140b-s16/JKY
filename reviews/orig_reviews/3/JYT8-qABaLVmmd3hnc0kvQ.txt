Stopped by on my lunch break, I've been looking for a good fish taco place for awhile now so I was hopeful this would be it. Ordered a fish taco and a chicken taco. The fish taco was ok, nothing exciting just your run of the mill fish taco. Lots of lettuce and no tomatoes in the pico de gallo and only 1 tortilla (most restaurants serve them with two). At over $4 for a single taco (no beans or rice or even tortilla chips) I thought it was pretty overpriced. The chicken taco was pretty boring, again no pico de gallo and tons of lettuce. The shredded chicken was lacking flavor so I piled on the salsa. Breakfast looked more reasonably priced and seems to have good reviews so I'll probably give it a try one day. Kinda disappointed!
