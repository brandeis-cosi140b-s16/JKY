I should start by saying that "American Mexican food" is not really my thing...that said, I like a good dive restaurant, and certainly have Mexican favorites.  Mi Patio is not bad, but it's not better than ok.  The service is great and food comes up fast (which is why I am giving it three stars), but I have yet to eat anything that excites me.  The atmosphere is a distraction...the lights are too bright...a little too industrial for my tastes (industrial as in institutional, not industrial as in modern).
