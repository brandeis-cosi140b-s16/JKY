Round Corner has always gotten mixed reviews when I've brought it up in conversation. I would be lying if I said that I've heard too many good comments regarding the food. I've always loved their bloody marias but only recently tried the food.

A friend and I went the other week for brunch and the menu seemed interesting enough. I ordered French toast with a chipotle butter and ancho syrup. Overall, it wasn't bad. I never order sweet breakfast food but the chipotle and ancho balanced out the sweetness of the toast. I do gave a few gripes about the meal though. The amount of butter given saturated the toast so much so that half way through, I couldn't bring myself to finish the meal. The meal also was just French toast. It didn't feel complete. I understand that some places are a la carte but my friend ordered the hash and his order seemed a lot more complete. It was more than enough food for me but it just would have felt like more of a meal if it had maybe a slice less and maybe a compote of sorts. I will go back but maybe just stick to the drinks!
