As a vegetarian and lover of creative tacos, America's is my jam. Where else can you get grilled pineapple and potato in the same taco?

While my experiences have been mostly good, last time I went with my boyfriend he really came up on the short end of the stick. There was a verbal miscommunication between him and the cashier, and she wound up ordering the wrong burrito for him.
It would have been a different story if he got the wrong burrito in a timely manner, however, my tacos came promptly and by the time I was almost done eating, his burrito was still totally MIA.
Finally, an employee stopped by and asked us if he had gotten his "enter-food-he-did-not-order-here." After correcting the employee on his order, she informed him that what he had paid for was more expensive than what he was going to get.
"Is that okay?" she asked. But when is it really okay to pay for more less? My answer: never.

With him being the perfect gentleman, he said it was okay.

But I guess the $2 Pacifico helped ease our pain.
