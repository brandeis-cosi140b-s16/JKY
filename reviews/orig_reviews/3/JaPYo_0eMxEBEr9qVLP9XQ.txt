i got the torta del rey. holy moly there was a lot of food in it. If you like meat.. there is every type imaginable in this torta.

my only issue w/ it was that.. i got tired of eating it after the first half. It may be my preference but i felt like someone blended a bunch of meats and i was trying to eat it. 

On the positive side.. that quantity of food was only like 6$. I probably could have made 3 meals out of this.
