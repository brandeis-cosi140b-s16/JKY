I was so excited to finally try this place. 

It is kind of like chipotle but for enchiladas where you get to pic what goes into you enchiladas. 

Atmosphere and service was poorly amazing. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. 

Even though we picked are own selections of items that went into our enchiladas, I was not impressed. It is for sure not my style. It was way too heavy. My enchiladas were soaked into a sauce and everything end up tasting the same. 

I didn't feel good at all after eating my lunch. Same said my boyfriend, who loves food.
 
I would still recommend for people to try it. I am sure many of you would find it really good but for us it did not hit the spot. 

We are spoiled with my boyfriend's mom making authentic Mexican enchiladas and that is the way we like them. For that reason perhaps, this place was bit overwhelming for us.
