I was very surprised to see Sam Fox places all over the air port on my way to Jamaica this past week. 

My boyfriend and I stopped in for some pre flight drinks. It was alright, decently prices, service was a little weird, waitress lingered way too long and checked on us way too much. Almost thought she might have had the hotts for my man. 

We didn't eat but everyone's food looked decent. They need some more TVs if they are going to offer sports at all, you can only see them from a few places in the main dining area. 

A-OK is about right.
