Tiny drinks big prices not sure about this place yet.  Location was really good otherwise .not worth the extra money for location.  Review update several days later I loved the interior but who wants to stay inside when you are on Mill.  It's much more fun to sit outside and just people watch and the patio is perfect for that if you are lucky enough to be there early enough to get a seat.  We really enjoyed the atmosphere here but as stated above the prices were a bit high especially in an area geared towards college kids.  I think the location and atmosphere bumps them up 1 star so they get 3.
