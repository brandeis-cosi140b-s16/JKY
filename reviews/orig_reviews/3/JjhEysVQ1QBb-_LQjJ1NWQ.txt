This is a nice place, with a good happy hour. 

For happy hour, from 4 PM till 7 PM, they have five dollar margaritas and half off of their bar menu food items. A good deal!

They serve you free chips and salsa, and the salsa was spicy and the chips were freshly made. The food, from the bar menu, is good. The bar menu includes queso dip's, tacos, sliders, etc.  

The service is good, and it was not too packed up on a Monday night. 

They have a nice bar, and a large restaurant. Overall it's decent Mexican food with a good happy hour.
