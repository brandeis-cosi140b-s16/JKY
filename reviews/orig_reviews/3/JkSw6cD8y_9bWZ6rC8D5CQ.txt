Not impressed. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't anything notable. We're blessed to have a lot of really good Mexican fare available to us in the area, but this doesn't make that distinction (in my humble opinion.) We decided to stop in after going to the movies and when I checked in on Yelp, there was a special deal $10 for $20 worth of food - why not? We ordered traditional margaritas (a bit too sweet). For entrees: Jefe Pollo and two tacos (pork & chicken). The cole slaw that came with the chicken was good, and the piece of chicken was large, but unfortunately, overcooked. The black bean salsa was flavorful, too. The tacos were so-so. Not bad, not good.

When we got our bill, the waitress had not included the Yelp deal so had to re-do it. 

I think this place has a bit of identity crisis. The bar area was like a sports bar which didn't seem to fit with the restaurant theme. And can someone explain the 3 aquariums on the wall dividing the bar from the restaurant? First of all, either the (plexi)glass is very scratched, or the water is dirty. Not attractive or appealing. One tank had a bunch of teeny fish, and I saw one fish in another tank, but one tank looked empty - maybe the fish were hiding. But at first glance, these look like 3 tanks with fake coral in them. I just don't get why they are there - doesn't seem to fit with the whole Mexican food - agave theme.

I'd like to give this place 2 1/2 stars but since I can't, 3 it is. I doubt we'll be back - lots of other options.
