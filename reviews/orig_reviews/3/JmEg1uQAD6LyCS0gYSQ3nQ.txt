I've been here a couple times. First visit I only had drinks.  Nothing serious.  Drinks were decent.  The most recent time I had a late lunch there and had the vegetarian taco entree.  The food was good enough. I mean I wasn't in love with it and could probably do a better job at home for cheaper, but it was decent.  

No issues with the service. (The same server waited on me both times).  Why 3 stars? I expected a bit more from the food.
