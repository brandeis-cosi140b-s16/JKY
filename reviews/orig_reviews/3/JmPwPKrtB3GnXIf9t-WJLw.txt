Between Chipotle and Cafe Rio, I always go to Cafe Rio. There is a bigger menu, and, overall, the food tastes better. The service is friendly, and the staff is pretty efficient when it comes to keeping the lunch line moving and making sure your order is right. 

A few perks: the tortillas are made fresh to order, the lunch deals are a good steal, and there is a variety in drink options besides soda.
