Things this place has going for it:
- a huge ass patio. Perfect for those nights where the weather is fantastic. I could totally see myself starting happy our here and relaxing for a while. Would also be good for some Sunday morning drinking.
-  decent happy hour menu with cheap appetizers and cheap well drinks
- a million tvs ( if you're in to that sort of thing)
- decent selection of bottled beers and a wide range of liquor (which is what I'm in to)

Things that make this place a 3 starer vs a 4 or 5:
- service is suspect at best. They would have gotten a ton more money out of us if they had been on top of the drinking situation. We definitely would have ordered more if the waitress had checked on us more often
- the food is nothing special. Typical bar appetizers and the entrees are just..... Ok. Better tacks have definitely been had and for a better price. Ration of cost and quantity is a bit off.
- The DJ. The kid looked to be 13 and was REALLY hooked on playing the Biebs a little too much and a little too loud.

Conclusion? I'd chill out on the patio for a couple of drinks but wouldn't waste my money eating here. I'm a sucker for an awesome patio.
