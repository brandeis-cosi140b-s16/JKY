I've eaten here close to a dozen times in the past few months. They've always been consistent in their service and quality of food. Today was much different. 
(If it wasn't for the fact that I've eaten here so many times and walked out satisfied, I would have given one star for today's service)
I ordered the blackened catfish tacos. The fish was burnt. When I told the waitress her reply was "it's blackened you know".  Blackened catfish does not equal burnt catfish. To rectify the situation she stated "I'll let the cooks know".  I certainly wasn't looking for a freebie, but at least offer to remake it.  Someone needs to reeducate this young lady. Her attitude towards the situation outweighed the burnt fish. Very disappointing.
