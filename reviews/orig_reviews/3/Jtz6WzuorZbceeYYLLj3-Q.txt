The concept of Mexican & Asian fusion is intriguing, but I feel that there is something lacking here.  I rarely come here, but since my car was getting serviced next door, this was a handy lunch location.  As usual, the service was excellent.  My officemate and I had just walked in when a lady behind the counter called out to us for samples.  She had an excellent attitude and had us sample all the items.  Usually the sample person just asks what you're interested in.  They even deliver your food to your table.  On the plus side, they have a lot of choices and combinations in generous portions.  The downside, though, is that the food's just a bit better than OK.  It's a bit greasy and the ordering system still confuses me.  I still can't quite put my finger on what's lacking here, but perhaps it's all the empty space? The layout of the tables allow a lot of wasted space.  They probably could put in more tables and there still would be plenty of room for everyone dining.
