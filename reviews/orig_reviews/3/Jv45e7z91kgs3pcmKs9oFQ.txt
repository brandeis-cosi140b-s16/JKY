The good:  This is a nice space, with traditional Mexican restaurant decor (of the American-touristy variety), high ceilings, and a huge frosted glass skylight.  The service (at lunch on a Friday) was quick, friendly, and attentive.  The margaritas were well-made and reasonably priced.  The chips were fresh and hot, and came with three kinds of salsa - all good.

The bad:  Most of the food was over-spiced, dry, or both.  I'll give them a pass on my food, because I had the lunch buffet.  The buffet was pretty much indistinguishable from the Mexican station at any hotel buffet.  But my wife's combination meal off the menu was pretty much the same.  She also ordered some cheese-only nachos, which had obviously spent too much time under the broiler and tasted burnt. 

We will give Ricardo's another chance, but for now I can't say that this is the "treasure" of a Mexican restaurant that we always hope to find when we try a new one.
