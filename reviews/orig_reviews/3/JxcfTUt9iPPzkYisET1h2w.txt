They have this salad of sorts in the self serve thingie, made of carrots, whole pickled jalepenos, and onions, all in vinegar; it's really good.

Good Mexican fast food: your usual styrofoam plate of one third rice, one third refried beans, one third the item you ordered (chicken taco, in my case). Got out of there for under eight bucks.
