Modern Margarita has a very cool vibe to it with a beautiful interior and relaxing large outdoor patio. It's a good place to grab a drink and some chips & guac, but not really great as a dining destination. The menu is small and there is all of one vegetarian entree choice. I ordered the veggie street tacos, and they were fine. Nothing really spectacular but not terrible either. The size of one order of tacos ($7) is too small to make a lunch, so you will need to order chips & salsa ($6) and/or chips & guacamole ($6). The salsas are just okay - we got the trio to try them all and the pico and tomatillo were a little bland. The chipotle roasted was yummy. The negative with our $6 order is that each salsa comes in a tiny little dish and though you get free refills, our service wasn't fantastic and it took a good amount of time. The guacamole is good. For being such a fancy place, it's so strange that when you order water it's the really nasty Phoenix hard-metal tasting water. Someone forgot to install a filter.

I would return here for happy hour to have a drink and some chips out on the patio, but don't plan on having entire meals here.
