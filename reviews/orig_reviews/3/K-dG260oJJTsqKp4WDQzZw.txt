I've always been one to enjoy Macayo's.  I usually hit up their location on central ave.  This one is definitely made for the college scene; part restaurant, part club (at least it feels like it).  We showed up around 6PM to meet some friends for dinner. Since it' was too crowded we sat on the inside.

I couldn't get enough of their amazing chips n salsa.. I got nuts over that stuff.  After more people decided to show up, we had to move tables.   We had a great waitress who was cool with us moving.  Unfortunately the new waiter we had seemed like he just started that week.  After ordering about six different drinks, I think one came out correct.  It was busy, so we only asked them to replace a couple.  We're not that mean.  

So this week I happened to be on a vegetarian kick and I ordered the California Burrito.  Oohhhhh  it was tasty.  However eating literally a basket of chips, I could only eat about half of it.

So wonderful.

So yes I enjoy the food, just wish the services was better when we got moved. Just seemed a bit slow and getting our drinks wrong and one plate, didn't go over too well.
