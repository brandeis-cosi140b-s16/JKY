Ordered online and was supposed to be ready at 5:45pm. They didn't start making my order until I arrived. Why have order online if you don't fulfill the orders?? Usually they are pretty good. I've been here several times and almost always order online. Once they screwed up my order and now this. I'm really disappointed with the quality of service. And of course I ordered my burrito enchilada style and it wasn't made that way so I had to go back in. Always check your order before leaving. At least the food is yummy when they get the order right. My suggestion always just order your food when you're there.
