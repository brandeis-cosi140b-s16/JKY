OK Mexican Food, nothing extraordinary.... Chips & Salsa aren't anything special either.... The Chips always seem to come all broken up, & the Salsa is just average.  Not sure why the reviiewers are giving such high marks on the Chips & Salsa?  Sam's Cafe in the Arizona Center at 3rd St & Van Buren,  & Ajo Al's are WAY better!  
This place is always noisy!  Might wanna bring earplugs. The service is great!
