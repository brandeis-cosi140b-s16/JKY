I've had just about everything on their menu.......everything is good, though I'm not sure there is anything worth raving about.  Portions are as you would expect, the price is on par with similar establishments, and the service is OK (interpret:  order at the counter, have a seat, then pick up when they call your name).

Typical menu options:  burritos, quesadillas, salads, tacos, etc.  Similar to a Qdoba, Chipotle, or Moes but less of a chain restaurant feel.  Recently I noticed a BBQ chicken burrito/taco on their menu that sounded like a nice change of pace.  Next time.

Other reviewers have referred to this place as "quirky."  That's probably a good word.  I think Charlotte needs more places like this..... Charlotte is just too squeaky clean.

Oh - the outdoor patio, while small, is a fun space to drink a few Coronas during nice weather.  

I'm a fan.
