I was brought here by a fellow Yepler.  I had to order the breakfast burrito and I went with the machaca.  The cashier was super friendly and offered to let me try the machaca before I ordered it which was nice.  

The place was orderly and the atmosphere was cool.  It was completely different from your  typical "bertos" restaurant.  I bellied up to the salsa bar which was well stocked with a variety of salsas and other stuff.  What turned me off was the super thick layer of dust that accumulated on the top of the sneeze guard around the string of fake red chilies they were using as decoration.  I could just imagine the dust falling into the salsas and chips.  I usually look right past minor cleanliness issues but this was very obvious and in a bad location, right at eye level.  

The burrito was a good size, actually enough for two average eaters to split.  The eggs were well cooked and I enjoyed them using real potatoes rather than French fries in the burrito.  Pretty basic flavors for a machaca breakfast burrito.  It was well done but not outstanding.  

I can see how the bar and nightlife would be a way to attract business in the evening.  I would return but wouldn't go out of my way for basic Mexican food.  

All in all it was a positive experience.
