Not bad for airport fare. Had the Pollo Bocadillo (not sure the spelling). A chicken breast sandwich, grilled with a lot of tasty toppings. Came with fries dusted with a hint of cheese. Felt like an accountant topped my fries, if you know what I mean. If you're going to cheese your fries, then cheese them!!! Came with small cup of avocado. I love avo. I'm not sure how a cup of avo finds it's way to a table in a frozen state, but mine did. Stil, the food was good. Much better than the other fast food choices nearby. Service was OK too.  I would order it again.
