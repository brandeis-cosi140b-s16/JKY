We ordered shrimp in green sauce and chicken flautas. Both the shrimp and chicken were overcooked. The sides were average- nothing too special. What gives this place 3 stars was the fish I tasted from a friend's plate. It was half green sauce and half red sauce...and amazing. I'd return just for that fish.
The restaurant has a fun atmosphere and is very colorful. 
Service was also fairly good as we with a huge group.
