My girlfriend and I went her last night before we left Vegas. We did a yelp search while in the MB. First off, this is no less than a $$$ and maybe even higher. Some dishes are over $40 and most are between $28/$38. We paid over $60 bucks for three small tacos and three small enchiladas. The food is honestly mediocre at best. The three stars was for the wonder staff and manager that came around to make sure we had everything we needed while our server was busy with other tables. There are way too many amazing restaurants in and around the MB for us to go back.
