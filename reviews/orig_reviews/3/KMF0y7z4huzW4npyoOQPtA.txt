Yo Rita is all over the place.  They get an A for creativity, B for execution, and C for atmosphere and value.

The inside is sparsely decorated and very dimly lit.  The food was inventive and tasty.  I gobbled up my very first Brussel sprouts, pineapple, avocoado, japeno and peanut sauce taco!  I had never even imagined this combination in my wildest dreams. I followed it up with "Velvet Underground" the root vegetables, aji peppers, cheddar, crema, and scallions, accompanied by grits with chile, cheese and corn nuts.  It included chips that tasted home made, and included a good mild chunky salsa and a hot salsa.  All of that was enjoyable.  

The bad was, there was a long wait for tables, it was super crowded, loud and  they rushed us out as soon as we finished our meal.  It was Friday night in the south side though, and that's just par for the course there so I won't hold it against them.  My friends who are regulars said if you go on an afternoon or off night, they are much less rushed and offer better service, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt there.  The menu is somewhat limited, but Yo Rita changes up their menu once a season with so it's worth checking back every few months.

When you charge $6-$9 per average size taco, (when they are $1-$3 most anywhere else) you create an expectation for a higher caliber experience.  The food was good and inventive, and I would go back.  I would not call them a great value, but I have to give them credit for offering unique combinations I've never seen anywhere else.  I'd aim to go on an afternoon or week night to avoid the rush, and plan on getting something wild and adventurous, if you just want a plain jane standard taco, it's not worth the trouble when taco bell has them for 99 cents.
