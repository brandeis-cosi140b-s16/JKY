As a Native New Mexican new to Las Vegas I have heard everyone rave about Carlito's and how authentic it is.  I rate this based on my order of the Huevos Rancheros Xmas(both red and green chile), Sopapilla, salsa chips and guac and my buddy got the breakfast burrito.  The breakfast burrito was done very poorly and should not be something NM food is judged off of (1 star).  The flavor of the green chile (couldn't really taste the red) salsa, guac, chips, whole pinto beans, and pork verde was excellent and I would give those all 4-5 stars. The sopapilla was undercooked which is always disappointing but I understand it happens (1 star).  I will go back to try the frito pie, and green chile stew as I imagine those will be excellent.   The horchata was also watered down so just get something else.  So not all bad I think it's a good place to go and could very well be a 4 or 5 if you don't try some of the stated items.
