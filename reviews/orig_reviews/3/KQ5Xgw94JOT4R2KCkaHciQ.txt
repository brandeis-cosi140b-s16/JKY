I took my mom here for dinner because it was right down the road from where we live. From first impressions it was clearly a really popular spot.
The food was really good and the wait time was pretty average. I would give this place 3.5 out of 5 stars if that was possible. Reason why my rating is somewhat low is because the only issue is regarding portion size. It's somewhat small for the price (in my personal opinion), and I didn't really understand why the meal didn't come with one side included. Each side I ordered was an additional $2 added to the meal. Other than that the quality of the food was great and the atmosphere was really chill and comfortable with the crowd.
