After an off-site work meeting and with 45 minutes to spare for lunch, this is where I found myself for sit-down Mexican food.  As the rating implies, it's A-OK.  

I ordered the Burrito, Paradise style and an Iced Tea.  You get that for $11.  The burritos are as large as Chipotle and generously stuffed with meat, beans, rice, guac, and sour cream.  It's A-OK.  

It comes with chips and green salsa on the side.  Those are A-OK. 

For anyone working at UNLV, this is a go-to place for quick Mexican food fare.  They have great happy hour specials and lots of TV's for sports viewing.  They have a nice patio out front.  With a large group of friends looking for good drink specials and something other than fried bar food, this is a good place to go.  Just remember, the food is A-OK.  

The service was good, no problems there!
