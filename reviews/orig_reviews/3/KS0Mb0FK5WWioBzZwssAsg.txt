The NYE prix-fixe, four-course menu with champagne was a tremendous bargain and unbelievably satisfying. The oxtail tamale was so good...I'm telling every abuela I know to start making these! The beef tartare and mushroom empanadas were both outstanding as the second course. The dessert...the blueberry ginger très leches cake was good on the outside cake part, but the blueberry ginger tasted neither of blueberry or ginger. However, that didn't detract from the cake. The entrée had some issues, some related to the kitchen and others related to the service.

The biggest problem we had was with our server. Several times during the meal we had no silverware or water, and he didn't notice until we flagged him down. Then, my entrée -- an amazing 22-ounce porterhouse -- came out medium to medium-well instead of the med-rare I ordered. He didn't seem to even notice that it was cooked incorrectly when I showed hi. (it was gray in some parts...GRAY!). I told him if it would take too long, to bring me the short rib instead (it looked great on other tables). A few minutes later, he said it wouldn't take long to fire a new steak. At least 15-20 minutes later, a manager delivered it and apologized profusely. My dining partner was already done eating his steak...not a great way to spend NYE. The filet of the porterhouse was phenomenal, but the NY. strip steak, which was chile-rubbed, still lacked flavor and needed either a sauce or butter finishing. Too much meat to have not enough flavor. Not to mention, what was that horrendous corn cake/casserole slice served on the side? It was...pretty disgusting. I didn't let it ruin an otherwise good meal, but it made absolutely no sense next to a beautiful steak.
