"Hi my name is Ashley and I'll be taking care of you. It's happy hour (pointing at the menu), the drink specials are there and the food specials there. Because it's happy hour you may not modify anything in anyway."

Hi Ashley.

Awkward.

Arrived with my bestie for happy hour and it was early so the place was empty. I mean empty. Like Paris Hilton's head empty. Totally cool. I was already LOVING the huge patio overlooking a beautiful park/baseball field. 

We enjoyed HH margaritas (tasty!), taquitos (oddly only two, but, hey, it's HH) and a BUTT LOAD tray of nachos (awesome, I must say).

My company was so lovely, by the time we left, I hadn't noticed the small crowd of folks who had wandered in, so I can't speak of the crowd. 

OK service. Great view of the park. Fabulous prices on the margs and nachos.

Most of all. Great company!
