Food was really good, restaurant was decorated really well and our hostess seated us where we wanted and was really nice!


The service on the other hand, was awful.  Our server took a long time to even approach our table and when she did it seemed like she was completely out of it.  She took our drink order and we asked for waters, our drinks came but we had to ask her 3 different times for water.  We ordered our food, it came out quickly which would have been great if my order wasn't completely wrong- which I told our food runner since yet again our server had disappeared.  It didn't take long for my food to come out so I wasn't too bothered by it.  When it came time to pay the bill we had separated it onto two cards and the rest cash.  I was looking at my bank statement to check my balance while we were waiting for her to come back and noticed that she had ran my card twice and had not run my friends card, which over drafted my account and charged me a fee.  We pointed this out to her and she did delete the payment but her demeanor was just completely confused.  Needless to say I was pretty disappointed seeing as I was told how great this place was.  If you work in the service industry, stay home if you are having an off day.
