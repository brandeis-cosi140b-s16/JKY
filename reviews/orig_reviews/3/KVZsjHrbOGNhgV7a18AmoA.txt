Not sure what's happened to Chino Bandido lately but they were a 4 + star rating and they have dropped to 2.5 - 3 star rating at best here lately due to poor consistency.  This is an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant locally owned and has two locations.  They are one of the best "gut-bomb" places to go when your craving something different ~ like Chinese food cooked like Mexican food and vice versa.  Chino's  is very reasonably priced food, packed with flavor.

You can get a chile relleno, egg foo yung in a burrito, jade chicken on a quesadilla, fried rice and black beans, all on the same plate if that's what your craving.  

Even though I'm a meat eater I recommend their veggie quesadilla!  It's one of the best things on their menu.  It's packed with veggies and cheese in a crisped hot tortilla.  Dip that bad boy in their hot sauce and have some fun!  I used to love their Polo Diablo and Jade Chicken, but they were both cooked to death... So I had to bury them both "before their time" in the trash.  This was after I finished my jerked fried rice with carnitas X 2.  

This place is very reasonable in price, very unique and it's a dive.  But there is such a thing as being too "dive-ie and dirty", so please think about your customer's and invest some time and money into cleaning up a bit, please.  

Sure their ordering process needs to be revamped and they need to cook their food more consistently and the cleaning thing (already mentioned), but they have, with out a doubt the best Snicker doodle and Chocolate Lava cookies around!! 

Those darn cookies will keep me coming back in hopes they can execute everything mentioned above better in the future.
