Tried this place out today after hearing my husband talk about it for a year. This was both our first time. I had the vegetarian burrito and my husband had the shredded beef burrito enchilada style with a beef taco. We had the sopapillas for dessert. The service was fantastic. The servers all work together to keep up on the drinks and keep asking you if you need anything else. The food was good but expensive for Mexican food. The service was definitely the shining star here.
