Service I rate 5 stars, they seated us quickly, our waiter Enrique was great, we got our food pretty quickly.
The ambience I rate a 5, not too crowded but busy, me and hubby were celebrating our anniversary and it was a nice spot for dinner. We liked that it was not off the extremely busy main las vegas blvd.
Rate the price of food a 5, every thing in Las vegas is way over priced. The prices were not terrible but reasonable for those on a budget.
Rate the drinks a 5, they did not hold back the alcohol.
I would like to give a 5 for total but have to give a 4 because overall the food was not all that great, it was edible but nothing I would write home about or long to try again. The seasoning could use a little something more. 
Only real negative was management did not bother to stop at our table, they kept passing by but never stopped to ask how we were doing, but they had stopped at other tables.
But overall would recommend to those looking for a nice, but not to expensive meal
