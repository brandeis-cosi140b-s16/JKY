Ehhhhhh. Everyone always say how this place is the best for tacos but I'd argue that. 
1 - their expensive!  2.00 per taco and their tiny tacos with rarely any meat on them. 
2 - you don't get to choose your salsa. 
3 - tacos de asada are awful.  Meat is dry, super thin, it's like their using palomia meat instead of the appropriate ranchera meat

The other tacos are good but in my opinion over priced.
