This place has been the best place we've dined at thus far in Vegas. It's definitely different Mexican cuisine and I love me some Mexican food. We got the grilled corn plazero appetizer and I la-la looooved it! Totally reminded me of the corn carts back in LA. Chips and salsa were okay. I say that because I am a chips and salsa snob and I thought the chips were a little too salty (but the perfect thickness with the perfect crunch), the salsa verde was too salty, but the house salsa, which our waitress said may be a little spicy but was not, was perfect. I ordered the Mexican burger. It was delicious except it really should have had some sort of spread or aioli on it. It was like a brunch burger and I love me some brunch burgers whenever I can get my hands on one. The best part was the fries. Fries with seasoned cotija cheese. Oh. Em. Gee! I'd go back to this place just for the fries! Portions were huge so I pretty much took the entire plate back to my hotel (we had a fridge). Leftovers were just as good!

I felt that the service could have been a lot better. Our waitress decided that since we were spending tons on alcoholic beverages that she didn't need to bother asking us if we needed soda or water refills or even chips and salsa refills. Price wise, this was priced the same had we hit up the More Buffet at Luxor again, except the food was better and I wasn't visiting the bathroom every half hour.
