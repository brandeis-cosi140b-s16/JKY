Good restaurant concept. Great vibe. Would have given 4 stars but valet parking only. Fresh ingredients. Went here for Easter lunch and had no problems getting in and there was plenty of parking that I couldn't park my own car into.  You can get plenty of food for under $10 but most likely will go over 10 per person especially if you're getting alcohol.  House margarita was tasty. No need to go top-shelf, but that have that too. Overall a bit on the pricey side for Mexican, but you're paying for location and the swank ambiance. The free salsa is good. I tried the un-free habanero salsa (they let me try it for free thankfully) and didn't like it.  So before you buy the un-free salsas ask for a taste.
