I have been to Popo'ssevera times and alsways sit in the bar area, which is perfect for happy hour and a frosty beverage. The food is pretty good and the staff is always friendly. Not sure if I would go here for anything other then happy hour or a casual drink or bite to eat. Fun place to watch a game and hang out with friends.
