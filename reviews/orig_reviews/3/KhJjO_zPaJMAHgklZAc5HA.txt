I'm giving it 3 stars for nostalgic reasons only as I used to come here in high school (90s) and remember it being awesome... but if I had not come here in my youth I'd probably only give it 1 star.  I took my family here recently. Service was great and fast, but the food was just ok for being so pricey. I will not go back again :P
