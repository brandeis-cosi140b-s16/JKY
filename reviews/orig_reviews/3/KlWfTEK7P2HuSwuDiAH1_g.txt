A pretty good hole-in-the-wall in South Scottsdale.  It's small and gets packed for lunch, but the staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I've had the tacos, the pork carnitas, tried the nachos, and the enchilada.  All have been pretty tasty, but everything is extremely greasy and I usually feel pretty gross upon exiting.  I'll probably break down and try breakfast sometime too.  Overall, you won't be disappointed with Fiesta Burrito.
