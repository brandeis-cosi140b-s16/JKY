Friendly and attentive service. The place was nice and we got our food quite quickly, especially for a large group like ours. The only thing was the food. It was bland, and this from someone who doesn't like hot and spicy food. This just didn't appeal to my taste buds.  Instead of Mexican inspired food, I'd rather go for the real thing.
