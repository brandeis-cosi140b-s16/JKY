My friends and I made this our first stop on our Mill Ave Birthday Pub Crawl last night.

Happy Hour until 6:30pm. The margs were heavy handed which was nice, but the food was just OK. I had the portabello/salsa/bleu cheese tacos HH special, which is 1/2 price but also 1/2 the size...wtf? Anyway, the waiter who was super funny said the main flavor was bleu cheese and was I OK with that? Um, have you seen me? Yeah I'm good with bleu cheese. BUT when the tacos arrived, all I could taste was the salsa... again, WTF?

The food arrived before the drinks did, but that was OK. My marg was so strong I couldn't even finish it, so I gave it to the birthday girl. 

The restaurant's atmosphere is trendy and hip, not really meant for us derby girls ;) BUT if you sit outside on back patio, it's really nice!!

I have a Groupon for this place so I'll go back at least once, but I'm not really sure after that.
