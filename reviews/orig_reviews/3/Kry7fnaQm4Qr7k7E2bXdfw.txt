Reading about their carne asada fries is what brought us in here - my husband judges every taco shop/stand by their carne asada fries. We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork. 

It is a bit confusing about how/where to order, seems like that problem could be solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!

We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it. 

If I were to go back I would probably try some of the tacos, and also just order the fries with the spicy pork, I enjoyed that a lot more than the carne asada.
