Yesterday I went to a spring training game in Peoria so I stopped in at Salty's pregame to get some food and a start on my beer consumption.  I got the street tacos with chicken and chipotle cream sauce.  They were pretty good tender chicken and lot's of it.  The chipotle sauce gave it just enough smokey flavor and kick.  The chips and salsa were actually really good as well.  They have great prices on beers during Spring Training and after the game it's happy hour which was nice.
