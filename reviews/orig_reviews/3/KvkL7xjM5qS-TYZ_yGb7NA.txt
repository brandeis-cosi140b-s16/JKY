The happy hour here is usually the only time we're here, but a family member wanted to eat here the other day and we said "sure!"  Our service in the bar is  very quick and efficient, but it wasn't that way when we came with a group of 8 and sat in the dining room.  I think the server was pretty new and he might have been double sat so he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  The fajitas don't come with as much meat, or veggies for that matter, than other Mexican restaurants we frequent, but there is an abundance of side items that come with them.  We really liked the nachos as an appetizer because each chip is loaded with beans.
