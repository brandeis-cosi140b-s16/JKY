Don't come here expecting something fancy - it's cheap, a-ok tasty and big portioned Mexican food served in run-down but comfortable place by friendly people.  My husband and I only tried one menu item this time, sharing the super nachos with carne asada.  The meat had a good flavor and was plentiful, but I was bummed by the liquid nacho cheese topping.  That was the main thing I didn't like in our experience.

We were there around 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was busy with families and couples.  Everyone was just digging into their food - we liked the atmosphere a lot.  There was a jukebox playing upbeat Spanish music.  

Finally some maybe useful info:  they're open 24/7, they serve breakfast (going back to try that some day), you can pay with debit/credit, and in addition to the usual carne asada, carnitas and tongue they offer goat, chicharron, pig and beef stomach meat options if that's your thing.  Oh, and beware the red salsa - it's really hot!  My chilly lovin Indian husband even had a hard time with it!
