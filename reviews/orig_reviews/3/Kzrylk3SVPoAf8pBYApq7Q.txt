Decent beer selection at a decent price point.  The clientele is a little eclectic.  I don't think I'd ever get actual food here but ya never know!   This most recent trip, we got a great server and she had a follow.   Good example of service.  There's hope for this place yet.  It's a great stop for a break from shopping.  Misters on the patio offer a great oasis.
