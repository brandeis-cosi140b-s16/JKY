I know people who really love this place, so maybe I have visited on a bad day(s) or I am just extra-picky when it comes to my Mexican food. IMO, Valle Luna is just average. Although I admit the service has been good and the ambiance is nice. 

On our last visit, we were immediately greeted by a cheerful hostess and taken to a booth along the far side of the wall. Unfortunately the patio was full. If you get a choice, ask for a table outside overlooking the water. It helps the so-so food go down better. 

Pros: Big portions, lots of cheese, good service. 

Cons: Ho-hum food. Lots of grease. Can be too crowded.
