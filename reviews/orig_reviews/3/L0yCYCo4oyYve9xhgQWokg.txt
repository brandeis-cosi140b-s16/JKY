"Mexican / Asian Fusion" -- sounds like a night filled with heartburn and the next day filled with running to the bathroom.

But it actually works. The food is really good. You need a secret decoder ring to figure out how to place an order as there must be 3,214,982 different possible combinations. The staff is friendly and helpful though.

Maybe it's my fault, or my decoder ring is malfunctioning, but almost every time I've ordered, something has been wrong. They always graciously taken it back and fix it though.

Personally, I could get by with just a giant bowl of jerk fried rice and a plate of snickerdoodles.
