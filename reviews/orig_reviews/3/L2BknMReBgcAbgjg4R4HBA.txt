Food:
Food was good but I have had better.  Was a little bland.  It could be what I ordered?  I had three wrapped burritos.  The chips and bean dip were very good!

Atmosphere:
Good for a date or a family get together.  The staff is very friendly and my waiter was always checking up on us.  They had a live band playing.  Singing Spanish songs.  The three guys were great.

Price:
The specials range from 9.99 to 25.00 
If you go outside the specials you are looking at 25 and up.
