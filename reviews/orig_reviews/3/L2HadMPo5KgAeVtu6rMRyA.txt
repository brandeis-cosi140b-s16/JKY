I had such high hopes about Taco Guild.  I really really did

I was looking forward going there for awhile.  So my date and I went there with the highest expectations.  Yes, I think he liked it a lot better than I did, but he just really loves tacos.  

Now, the place was gorgeous inside, I have to give it that.  It was old church and they kept the beauty of the structure, which actually made me happy.  

The service was alright.  Nothing that stands out there.  But I was looking forward to the food.

The menu is limiting.  We started off with the chips and guacamole.  It had NO FLAVOR!  None at all.  It actually made me very sad.  And the tacos?  (I had the chicken and shrimp) was actually bland.  I wasn't impressed.

But I will try you again Taco Guild.  Maybe it was an off night?  But I do have to say, your margaritas were great!
