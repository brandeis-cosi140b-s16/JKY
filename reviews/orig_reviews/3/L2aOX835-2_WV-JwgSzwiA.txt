Food was excellent but the service was sub par. 

When we first arrived someone came and gave us chips and salsa right away. They give you a variety of three different salsas. A mango sweet green, a spicy red and a mild red. All were very good and the chips were thin, crisp and super fresh. After we were seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes before she came over to greet us and ask us what cocktails we wanted. After we order our beverages and food on 2 occasions she tried taking my plate of food before I was finished eating without asking me and also tried taking my margarita glass that was half full. At least ask first.... 

The food was great. Order the 2 enchiladas, 1 shredded beef with chili con queso and 1 cheese with chile con carne. The enchiladas were small portions but with the side of espinaca and papas con chile I was stuffed afterwards. 

Hope for better service next time.
