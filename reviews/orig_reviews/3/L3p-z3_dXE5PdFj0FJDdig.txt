So I have a friend who loves this place so we decided go.
SERVICE:We were seated right away but waited awhile before we go any service. The hostess came back and took our drink order. Eventually the server came out, had no idea about our drinks and we ended up waiting awhile for them. We were still waiting for one more person so I guess the server figured she wouldn't check back until the last person was there. So finally our drinks come out and we rush to tell her about our appetizer. But even when the last person joined us, the service still moved slowly. 
FOOD AND DRINKS- we had margaritas. The white peach and guava margaritas were awesome! We also had the blood orange which I found to be a little too bitter for me. We started with the buffalo nachos which were good. I really liked the queso sauce they used. I had the fajita salad: the meat was well seasoned but there was too much dressing which made everything soggy :(
My friends had the daddy's cob salad and their vegetarian mango tacos. Both were really good.
