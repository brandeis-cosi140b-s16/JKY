Totally yummy spot to grab food if you're staying at the Saguaro. The decor was absolutely adorable! I found myself looking all around admiring the light fixtures, various art pieces on the wall, the colors, etc. 

And while the food was tasty, I wasn't totally blown away. There's typical breakfast fare here with some dishes that have a Tex Mex/Mexican influence and there are also dishes like waffles and bagels. Nothing looked like it took a tremendous amount of effort to make and while I waited about 15 mins for a bagel and lox, I somehow managed to think that it took a while to prep the order because the bagel was locally made or made in house. But everything on the plate was something bought at a local grocery store. So I was a little disappointed because for the price I paid, I could have had 3 bagels and lox at home. It was good though and consider that most people eating here are passing through, it's a totally reasonable and yummy place to have breakfast. The juices served are good and the bacon is definitely worth ordering.
