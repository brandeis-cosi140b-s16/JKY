I think this place has great potential, but there were a few things off during my first visit here.  

A) Don't ask if I want a water refill...fill my water...all the time, we live in the desert

B) Veggie paella sounds amazing, but was ridiculously salty...see A.

C)Servers need to help each other out and operate full hands in, full hands out.  Don't come out with the check, then come back a few minutes later with box, then a few minutes later with the check.  I think you can multitask.

Apart from these minor complaints (constructive criticism)...

The inca salad was AMAZING, loved every bite.

Chips were fair, but the red and green sauces were really good, although not very spicy.

I will definitely be coming back for the elote and probably enchildas.

All in all, this is a great space in the neighborhood with a unique menu and excellent potential.
