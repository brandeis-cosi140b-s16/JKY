Well, after being a long-time customer who ate here regularly, I find that in the past 6-12 months, the food has gone downhill. It seems the cook is getting lazy and the food is simply below average most times. I am very disappointed and we have started going over to Habanero's instead. Sad to see a family restaurant go downhill, but that happens after time and as the owners get older.
