Good food. I got the Pollo Fundido and my wife got the Mole'.  

My only complaint is that I paid $28 for a pitcher of margaritas that was 95% Ice.  That's right, ICE!   This pitcher would have been easier to drink at $15.  

Also, some biker decided I parked too close to him so he spit on my drivers side window on his way out.  This is probably the same guy that didn't wash his hands after doing who knows what in the bathroom stall.  #keepitclassycavecreek
