Second trip was the same as the first, A-OK

Skillet cheese - nice cheese with ground chorizo, greasy and delicious with lovely fresh and soft corn tortilla.

Bean tostada, just as good as I've had anywhere and they really load up the toppings.

Appetizer sampler offered a nice mix, had a truckload of food, tamale was delicious and everything else was good.

Chips are fresh, include a mix of flour and corn, paired with a nice salsa.

On the other hand....

Chile relleno - flavorless, stringy, soggy, heavy batter - no good.

Take out order staff - if I find them awake I might be able to judge but they never seem to be aware of what's going on (or that they are working).  As an owner, if I found out that my staff was saying "hello" when picking up their outside line - I'd be pretty furious.
