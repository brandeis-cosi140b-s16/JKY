Place was a NoDa legend but has slipped. Last few times were 2 or 3 star at best. Place has a ton of character but just not focused on giving excellent food. Margaritas = not good (cmon! It's mex!). Tortillas = stale (isn't this a staple for a place like this?). Entrees are hit and miss. 

That said, I hope they get things on track and they stick around.
