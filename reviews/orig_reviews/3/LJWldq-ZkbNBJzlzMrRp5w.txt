I had just eaten at Javier's in the Aria the evening before - I know Mexican food two nights in a row is not my usual strategy... Any way I took the opportunity to really compare the two ordering almost the exact same meal at both locations.

The food here at Ricardo's was good solid food - nothing special that made me think "Wow, this is the best Mexican food I have ever had!" It did however help me better understand that there can be differences in Mexican restaurant food - it was not really in the same league Javier's was as far as the food - Javier's really is a high end Mexican restaurant which I never would have guessed existed (the high end restaurant part...)

Ricardo's was fine, the service was excellent and the atmosphere what you would expect.  I would visit again as overall the experience was good and the cost reasonable.
