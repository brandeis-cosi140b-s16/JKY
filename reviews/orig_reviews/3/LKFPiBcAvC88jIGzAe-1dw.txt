I know it's Vegas, but really?!! Our waiter said that everything is served tapas style, so we ordered the ceviche, 2 Swallow a Clouds, and I think the Unruly Monk noodle soup. The ceviche was weird- it came with a few pieces of seafood on clams- pretty presentation, but nothing to eat! lol. The noodles bowls were ok, but $17 for a bowl? I'd rather pay a little more and go to a buffet!
