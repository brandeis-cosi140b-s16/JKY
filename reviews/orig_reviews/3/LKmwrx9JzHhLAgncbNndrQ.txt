Dick's is a generous restaurant - large portions of good food and decent specials like half-price bottles of wine on Sunday night. It is a hideaway so don't come if you're looking for more atmosphere but their food is good. Adovada is their most popular dish and a great choice if you're a meat eater. The wait staff is experienced and friendly and can help you order.
