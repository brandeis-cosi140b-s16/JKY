Yeah, this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives recently and I'm sure business has spiked because of it. Their tacos are their main draw. It's a diverse and ambitious menu featuring 15 kinds of tacos, ranging from traditional to fusion, along with three vegetarian types.

I went with a combo platter. Four tacos (the Pastor, Texano, Bombay, Shanghai), chips and salsa, and pinto beans. The depth of flavor from the wasabi steak and contrasting textures of the cabbage slaw made the Shanghai my favorite taco. The pastor was good but not as good as the one at Taco El Gordo. The meat in the Texano was completely mushy, rendering it a sloppy mess and I wasn't crazy about the taste of the Bombay. The chips were good, the pinto beans weren't. They were incredibly bland and quite possibly some of the worst beans I've had.
