The best thing about this place is that it shares a parking lot with a large Strip Club so you can ask Siri for directions and she will tell you that you have arrived at Sapphire Gentlemen's Club. 

Anyway, the reviews seem to be pretty accurate about the so-so service and the good food. The service was lacking and it wasn't even busy, however the waitress was well-meaning and nice. 

The food was pretty good. The Aguachiles was okay. It is served in a martini glass and unfortunately the flavors accumulate at the bottom instead of with the shrimp. The huevos rancheros were very good, too. 

A note in authenticity of the food. The rice is just white rice with some cilantro. The salsa were all very good. And finally, they use queso fresco, not yellow cheese some Mexican restaurants use. 

Not worth a cab ride from the strip.
