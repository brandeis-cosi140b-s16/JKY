This place certainly has the charm and secrecy of a speakeasy from the 1920's (NO name on the outside of the establishment and Seriously hard to find!) Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Bloody Mary and Carne Adovada Benedict. The Bloody Mary was attractively presented and delicious but so infernally HOT that my tastebuds were too numb to taste the food for awhile! I love how they cook meat over a wood grill and the pork was very tender and flavorful with a texture like that of beef brisket or pot roast, but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers here that the Carne Adovada was so heavily covered in hot red sauce that it completely overpowered the flavor of the pork and the eggs. Bottom line: When you go there, order food that is not heavily sauced, ask for the Bloody Mary MILD at first (you can always make it hotter)  and I'll bet you'll have a better experience than me. Very friendly attentive service and dark chill atmosphere.
