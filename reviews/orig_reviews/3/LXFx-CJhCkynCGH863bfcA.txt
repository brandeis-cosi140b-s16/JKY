Viva Zapatas is a great place to go for a quick lunch during work. They have lots of space for big groups, and the service is fast (but not to the point of feeling rushed). I had the tamales and enchiladas. They actually were pretty good! You are never low on salsa, bean dip, chips or drinks at Viva Zapatas. They also have a great soup...I am not sure what it was called, but it was a like a spicy Mexican version of chicken noodle soup!
