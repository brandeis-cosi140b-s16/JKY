It goes without saying that Maize is the best Mexican in CU, BUT there's a reason why I've decided to give them a 3 (Even though the food is 4.5 star).

It's really annoying that they charge you an extra $.50 for a miniature salsa on to-go orders. Keep in mind if you dine in, you get unlimited salsa. Granted, I understand the need to recoup costs on the small (tiny!!!) plastic containers of salsa, but $0.50!?!?! As someone who eats here 3-6 times a month, it's upsetting that they don't value their repeat customers. At least have some type of free extra salsa every 3 order type of program. It's pretty ridiculous to think that ONE TINY salsa container will due a burrito and chips justice. 

As much love as Maize gets form the CU community, you'd think they'd find a way to reciprocate. Unfortunately, not quite the case yet.
