6-26-2015 - I Ate at Abuela's Tacos for the first time.  This location was small, clean and no waiting line.    I ordered the Burrito combo and it was made fresh and came with small serving of beans and rice and a tasty pepper, and a medium drink.   It was served in a styrofoam container and plastic fork.  I am not a big fan of either and the plastic fork was hard to "cut"  through the burrito and the fork was too small for my personal preference.  The medium sauce i was given, added little flavor to my food and I probably should have used the hotter sauce.  The waitress was friendly and I have no problem with service.  I try to be fair about my reviews and would say the food I ordered was OK, but nothing to write home about.
