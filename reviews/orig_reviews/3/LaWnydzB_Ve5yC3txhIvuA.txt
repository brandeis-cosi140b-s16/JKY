Senor frogs has character, I'll give it that. The server was excellent and the quotes on the ceiling are unforgettable. Additionally, when you're cheap in Vegas, as I am, and you're slipping whiskey into your coke under the table, they do not notice...or at least didn't make a fuss if they did.

Beyond that, the food was just not great. I'm not very picky but I got the fish tacos and they just didn't do it for me. They had a weird corn-coleslaw thing as opposed to lettuce and avocado and the usual fish taco stuff and it just wasn't good. My boyfriend got a burger that I had a few bites of. Better than my fish tacos but as I'm not a huge burger fan I can't say much more than that.

Overall, just okay. With the many food options in Vegas, I don't think I'll be coming back unless it's for the drinks...which, while I didn't have any, it seemed like there were some good deals.
