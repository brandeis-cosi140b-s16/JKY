We have frequented this restaurant ever since it first opened, but our recent visits have been for the highly regarded weekend brunch.  After signing up my wife for the VIP club, I printed off a 2 for 1 entree coupon that we decided to use for dinner.  We were started off with a bowl of fresh taco chips and 3 salsas.  Each of us decided on chile rellenos for an entree - the roasted poblano peppers were enormous with each accompanied by 2 types of rice and earthy refried beans. Service throughout was very good.
