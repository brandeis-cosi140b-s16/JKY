I was really excited about the happy hour at the bar just outside the restaurant. So after hitting the sauce for awhile. We decided we should probably eat something. It is definitely not my favorite Mexican restaurant. But it was far from the worst too. Service and food was quick and friendly. And I am sure if I am in the mood for Mexican? And don't want to leave the hotel I will eat here again.
