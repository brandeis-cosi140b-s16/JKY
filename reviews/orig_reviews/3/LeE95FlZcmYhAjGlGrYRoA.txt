I hate to come off as a prude and I apologize in advance, but I too am very critical of mexican food. Cantina 1511 is much more about ambiance and being seen/seeing people. Its a trendy resturant but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Service here is good and they have a multitude of drink selections, sangrias, margaritas etc.

On my last dinner visit I had the special, chicken enchilada suizas. It was not very good. The sauce was a watered down green mole and the enchiladas were not cooked to a perfection. They weren't buttery flaky and didn't melt under my fork. The chicken was bland, it just tasted boiled. I can say that Azteca has a better version of enchilada suizas.

Not a deal breaker, as I do like this place. Next time I'll just have to try a different dish. Great chips and salsa though and after work drinking here is a must!!!
