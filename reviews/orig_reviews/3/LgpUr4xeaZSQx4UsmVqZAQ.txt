It was in our hotel so it was easy to get to.  But this place lacked in anything original.  It was just "fine".  

Chips and salsa...fine
Enchiladas....fine
Margarita.....meh....

So, it was affordable, it was close to 'home', but it was not fantastic and not someplace I would seek out specifically in Vegas.
