Maybe it was just an off night. Or maybe the bartenders (all 4 of them) really just suck it.

I've been here so many times, had great service, visited with the chef as he walked around and met with customers and I've had great food every single time. On this particular night (last Friday 4/1) all of this can still be said, except for the service at the bar as we were waiting for our table. There was a rush of people at the bar so I understand that a little patience is in order. What I don't understand is what about a guy who is standing with his arms on the bar, cash in hand, standing there looking at every one of the bartenders doesn't tell them that I might need to order some drinks?? At least 20 minutes had passed before one of them even acknowledged me! Now I've ordered at a busy bar before, so I know how this works. These girls do not. Just not acceptable.

I will return here. I will enjoy the tacos, the torta, the chips, the drinks and ambiance, just as I always have. Unfortunately, I can't do anything about the shitty bartenders, especially the tiny and clueless blonde. They'll all still get their tips because of the popularity of the restaurant, but I truly hope this was just a one off experience. In the meantime, 3 stars is all I can give because this really set the tone for my evening and it was completely unnecessary.
