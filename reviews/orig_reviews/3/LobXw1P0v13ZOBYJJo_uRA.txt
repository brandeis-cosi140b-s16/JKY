This post is actually from early September... 

i wanted to give it 2 stars but only because of distance from me... which is not the restaurant's fault. so 3 it is. 
 the chips were outstanding which is usually always the first indicator of a mexican food restaurant's quality. The arroz con pollo was flavorful and not too dry (which is often the case). The rice had great spice to them (flavor spice, not heat spice) and the black beans were also above avg. Ambiance was full w mexican tapestries and the wait staff, although less "authentic" than i would've expected, were helpful when asked. However, i knocked one star off because it was obvious each of them were serving cuz it was their job... not because they enjoyed being there. And they made that known through body language. knock another star for lighting (dim) and their intention for table turnover was more apparent than i would've liked it to be. I felt somewhat rushed, probably in an effort to accommodate the wait.
