Whoever made the cheese crisp (WOW) over-the top with cheese and it wasn't Mexican either just almost like velvetta..way to much !!

I ordered red pork tamale "way to spicey" for the average person, as if there was jalepeno pepper seeds in it..I eat tamale's all the time and never had one that spicey.  It ruined my dinner.

This locations food is NOT as good as the old location on Main Street "probably NO owners there to oversee".
