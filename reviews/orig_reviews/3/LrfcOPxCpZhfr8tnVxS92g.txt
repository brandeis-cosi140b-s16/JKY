Chinese-Mexican fusion sounded like a really interesting concept when my sister and I were trying to find a place for dinner. In my mind, either this place was going to wow me or it will leave me disappointed. Well...it was the latter. 

We came mid afternoon so there weren't many people in the restaurant at all. We were seated quickly, and our waitress was attentive during our entire meal - big plus (service upped this place to the three stars I gave it). 

In terms of food, nothing really stood out. While looking at the menu, the only thing that sort of stood out to me were the taco combinations. Other than that, everything else on the menu was very much either a Chinese dish or a Mexican fish. Not much fusion going on with the menu items. My sister and I ordered more than enough for the both of us. I'd say we tried a little bit of each type of dish offered. I was not impressed by any of it. The only thing that I remember was the golden pigs entree, which consisted of fried bbq pork buns served with condensed milk. Strange combination with the condensed milk but it worked really well. 

I wouldn't recommend this place but if you're dying to give it a try, I'd suggest going with different tacos if you want the whole Chinese Mexican fusion experience.
