$2 tacos.. that's pretty amazing prices for anything on the Vegas strip. Taste was pretty good, on point but nothing spectaculr. My complaint is that they wanted to charge extra for every salsa you get. You know how at chipotle you can get hot salsa, corn, pico de gallo all on the same thing? You can't do that here. Extra charge for each salsa
