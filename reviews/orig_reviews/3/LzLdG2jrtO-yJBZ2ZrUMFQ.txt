I love Mexican.  He loves Asian.  Should be a match made in heaven right?  Well, kind of.  We wanted to have a late lunch/early dinner, but it turns out only the bar menu is available between the two.  But they do have a great one.

Loved their drink menu and the Sumo-Rita!  Food was just okay for me.  I thought the salmon avocado roll and the spicy yellowtail roll ($5 and $7) were good, but not up to par according to my better half.  The happy hour tacos are a great deal, 2 for $3 or 3 for $5, but just average at best.  I really liked the wild mushroom, the al pastor was good, but nothing special.  The guacamole was the stand-out for me, especially at $5!

Definitely a great happy hour spot.  Good enough to peak my curiosity for their full menu, but not quite good enough for me to prioritize it just yet.
