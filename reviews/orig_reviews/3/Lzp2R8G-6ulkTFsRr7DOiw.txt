ok, let me tell you my story, we had a reservation for 20.30h and got there right on time, there were many open tables but we still had to wait 15 minutes to get seated. So finaly we get out table and they give us a table outside the restaurant to the side, where there is only this one table which is located right to a wall, Hell NO!! 
Ok, we go back inside and wait for another table, still many open tables available, after another 10 minutes we get a booth, ok fine. Than we have to wait 15 minutes for the waiter, who comes to tell us that somebody else is responsible for our table - OK, more waiting!!! 
Than our waiter comes, who was actually very nice, we order our drinks and food at the same time. all drinks get here quick except the Margarita, that took another 20 minutes, more waiting. And that the waiter has the nerve to joke about it and ask "do you want another one, it only takes 20 minutes to make one" At that point I was almost ready to turn into "El Diablo". 

Overall just overpriced Mexican food. If I go back here it will only be for drinks, but not a Margarita.
