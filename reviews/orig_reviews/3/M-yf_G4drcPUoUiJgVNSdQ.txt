A very quick place for a cheap dine in lunch atmosphere. All specials are $6.99 at lunch and a drink can be added for an additional $2. I would not recommend the tacos, poor tortillas, but the enchiladas are a hit! Nothing too fancy about the free chips and salsa or service- everything is just average. I've seen the happy hour menu and drink selection and would definitely go back for a good time.
