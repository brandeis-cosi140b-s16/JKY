I didn't even know this place existed because it's always overshadowed by my desire to go to Burger Bar whenever I get this close to The Strip.  We had to meet some family for dinner at Mandalay and told them about Burger Bar's greatness.  Upon arriving we found out the BB was closed for a private event so we had to pick another place.  Since we didn't feel like walking more than 10 feet we decided on Hussong's. 

The name might be a little off-putting as it doesn't scream "Mexican Food" and they claim to be the inventor of the Margarita.  Still, we gave it a chance and we were pleasantly surprised.  It was a little pricey for Mexican food but cheap for Strip standards.  The waiter did an okay job but was a little slow after we ordered.  My wife had Enchiladas and the rest of us had their Chicken Tostada Salad, which was pretty delicious!  They had two fried strips of Flour Tortilla that came along with the salad rather than a fried bowl and I was a big fan!

I did have a couple of problems with the place, however.  As I said the waiter was 'ok' but he constantly tried to upsell us stuff.  I hate when they offer you Guacamole like it's on the house when it really isn't.  I'm of the opinion that if you offer it, it's free.  We didn't bite.  The biggest thing that I didn't like was the fact that their Margarita's came in Pint Glasses.  Really?  You claim to be the Margarita inventor and you're going to put them in a pint glass? I don't think so.  That alone lost a whole star for me.

There was a pretty sweet Mariachi Band wandering around and they were playing some rock hits that you would expect from Mariachis.  Pretty cool.
