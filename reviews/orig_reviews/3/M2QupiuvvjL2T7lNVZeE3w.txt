This was a pretty good people watching spot.  A mix of youngsters in bathing suits and old men in suits.  There was a Happy Hour special which had 2 or one drinks, and half price apps.  We took advantage of that, we got Margaritas which were good.  The bartender was friendly.  I ordered the guacamole which was great, I also had the Corn Tamales.  My boyfriend loved his Burrito and Tortilla soup.  I ordered the Baja Fish tacos, big mistake, the fish was fried but not crispy because it was laying on a hot steamy plate that made the tortilla moist and soft and it took all the crunch outta my taco.  Thats the only complaint about this place really.  Not a place I'm gonna run to come back to, but it satisfied our craving for Mexican.
