I have been here three times and I can say that the nachos are hit or miss. Between my wife and I and other people we have gone with I'd say we have had about 6 different nachos. It's really all about personal preference, but I have been pleased with about half of them. They make their nachos with either real cheese or really creamy fake tasting stuff. Also, the chips are either the thicker (chewy) home made version or the thinner and much crispier (non home made) ones. Both of these things are not indicated on the menu and can greatly affect the enjoyment of your meal. Although I have not been, it seems like they have good happy hour prices and I have been told that the ample bar area fills up during that time which seems like it would be fun. I stopped here early in the day on St. Patricks day for a quick snack and they had a good shot and green beer special. I think happy hour and special events would be more fun than just eating here. Keep an eye on Groupon though, they seem to have deals pretty regularly.
