We used to love Border Grill. Our last experience was poor. We ordered the Tortilla Soup. The base seemed to have too much tomato and the cheese was a bit chewy. We were also disappointed with the crab nachos. There was only a bit of crab (seemingly like 1/8 of a cup). It is more of a garnish, not an actual component of the dish.
