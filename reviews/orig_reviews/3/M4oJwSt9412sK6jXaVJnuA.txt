First time at Barrio Queen today. Had lunch with the family. Although they were very busy on a Saturday early-afternoon, we were seated quickly. 

We all ordered the $10 three-taco special. You can mix and match from 18 different tacos. I ordered a carnitas taco, one al pastor and one carne asada con chorizo azul. Between the four of us we ordered 16 tacos (they are traditionally small) and we got 15 different kinds. 

Chips and salsa arrived: both hand made which was a nice touch. The chips were hot, thick and just the right amount of salt. The salsa was thick with a little zip. 

Kinda went downhill a bit here. My wife is allergic to onions but the server said "no problem."  My daughter said she didn't want her tacos garnished with extra cilantro, (just a taste preference) and the boys had no changes. My wife's tacos had onions, my daughter's tacos were buried in cilantro and I received a wrong taco. 

The server did her best to make good on a bad situation.  She quickly brought hot, new tacos and gave us flan for dessert on the house. Nice remedy but I would have rather had it right the first time. 

On to the food:  the carnitas taco was good. Nothing earth shaking but tasty. Very spicy tho. The al pastor: awesome. Tender, sweet, spicy and just the right amount of char on the meat. The carne asada con chorizo azul: epic!  Tender, good char, great seasonings. Bleu cheese on a taco? Genius. I highly recommend the carne asada con chorizo azul. Next time I will probably get two of those and two al pastors and have a siesta later.
