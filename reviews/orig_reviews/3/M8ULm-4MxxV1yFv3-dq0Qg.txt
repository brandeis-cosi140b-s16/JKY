Dropped in here on the way out of town.  Huge spot, including a good sized patio.

Not much in the way of large menu, so if you're relatively picky (like me), you'll have to spend some time figuring out which item you perceive will be the least altered (and, therefore, frustrating the wait/kitchen staff to accommodate your order).  Food was great, however.

Like most things in a casino/resort, it's about two bucks more than your average Mexican joint, so be aware of that in advance.

Will stop in again.
