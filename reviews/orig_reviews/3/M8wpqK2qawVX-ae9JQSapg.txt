Overpriced semi-authentic fusion. Didn't really find this to be actual fusion as much as offerings from both cultures on the same menu laid out separately. 

Tacos
Lengua - get this. Delicious, super-tender.
Cochinita - overly salty, flavor was underwhelmingly one-dimensional, forgettable.
Carnitas - great texture concept with pork rinds, but was dripping w/oil - hard to eat.

Chinese
Dan Dan Mien - tasty even if not true to form - the hand-cut noodles are yum, spicy ground pork has a nice kick.
Ocean Nest - essentially seafood liang mien huang (pan-fried Canto noodles). Nice seafood selection with lobster, scallops, king crab, shrimp. Was rather disappointed in presentation.

Physical restaurant layout is a bit awkward - no bar area, major minus. Limited ambiance limited, didn't care much for the awkward 'fusion' decor.
