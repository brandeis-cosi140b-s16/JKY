(3.5 stars)  There aren't a lot of Mexican food choices on the strip--especially one with such nice ambience.  I can't say I loved the food, but I liked it and so did the rest of the 5 other people in my party.  Should they have put paprika on the chips?  No.  But my tacos were delicious and the drinks were good.  Service was ok.  It was all around a good lunch and I would definitely go back.
