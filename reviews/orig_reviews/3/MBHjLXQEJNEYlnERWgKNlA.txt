Funky décor.  Large patio space.  Found myself here mid-week happy hour time and didn't want dinner, but a margarita and an app sounded good.  Service was good; I can't remember the guy's name but he was friendly and funny and attentive. I had something about a Grandma's margarita - it was good, nothing spectacular, but good.
The 3 stars is for my nachos.  It was a fried tortilla sliced up 6 (or 8?) pieces, with canned refried beans smothering it, a splash of cheese and a couple diced tomatoes with (more) canned jalapeños. In the center was a dab of guac on some lettuce.  It just looked sad.  We asked for sour cream and got a spoonful in a bowl - no seriously I'll post a pic.  I took the pic just in case they upcharge for condiments, which I'm happy to report they did not charge us for the spoonful. The server wanted to warn us the sirloin was ground, and I assumed it would be ok but this stuff wasn't even the consistency of ground.  How could you ruin good steak by grinded it to itty bitty specks of nothing??? 
If I go again, it likely will be for another rita, but I'm pretty sure I can find a better deal elsewhere
