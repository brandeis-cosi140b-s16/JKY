Run of the mill place.  More authentic than Chipotle and Chevy's.  It is similar to Filibertos.  The food is on the bland side and a little pricey for what you get.  I am still not use to the Arizona style of Mexican food where part of the ingredients of a burrito (burros) are served outside of it as a garnish on the plate!  It is nearly impossible to insert it in afterwards, espcially if you get a wet burrito.
