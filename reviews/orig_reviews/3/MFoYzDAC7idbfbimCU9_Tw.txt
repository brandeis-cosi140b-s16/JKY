I was expecting a much better experience from Cabo Wabo, but it was just OK. 

The food was the worst part of it. I thought it was meh, and my girlfriend didn't even finish her food. 

I had the Carne Asada Burrito served Enchilada Style. I was not a fan of the flavors. 

My girlfriend had the Chicken Enchiladas. She was not OK with them at all. There was so much Cilantro in the sauce and even more cilantro mixed in with the chicken it was extremely over powering. 

But what saved a 1 star rating was the service and the drinks. The drinks were awesome.
I had the key lime martini because I love key lime pie. Its really tasty. It is rimmed with graham cracker crumbs and it tastes like a kicked up key lime pie. 
She had a Margarita which she really liked. 

Overall I guess I just had a meh experience because of the food. I would probably give it another try, but try different food.
