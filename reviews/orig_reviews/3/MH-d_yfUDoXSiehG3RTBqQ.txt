I like this place. I was heading to the Hard Rock for a show at the Joint and didnt feel like spending the usual more on drinks there than the ticket costs so were were hunting some affordable pre-game drinks. I walked in at 5 on a Saturday and was thrilled to discover Happy Hour on Saturday-yes. I asked the bartender what was what and he explained that basically all drinks were 2 for 1. So my Stoli greyhound was $6 and came with an identical twin-ideal! 
 
The drinks were good and strong and I realized about 45 mins before show time that I hadnt eaten anything yet. We glanced at the basic mexican themed bar menu and quickly chose chicken nachos which were unfortunately, very average. Nothing real good about these- bland and uninspired  but filling and quick. So it was 2 more cheapies and then scamper(stumble?) across the street for some rock n roll.

 I like the casual atmosphere(small and dumpy), the friendly staff and great drink specials. I will be back and give the food another shot, although i will set my sights really low......BRING ME FRIES!
 Oh yeah, AC was pumping and felt like a cool 72 degrees in there too.
