The food was fantastic, I enjoyed every bite of it. However....not sure if she was the manager but not only did she blatantly talk down to her coworkers in front of everyone but she was super rude to us when she came to our table and when we paid for the food. The food is the only thing that would keep me coming back. I just pray that she won't be there the next time. Horrible service.
