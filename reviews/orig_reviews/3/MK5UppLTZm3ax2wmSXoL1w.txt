I got the sabor especiale burrito. The rice is very flavorful. You certainly receive a lot of food for a fair price. I would certainly like to try other items on the menu. They don't have any beer on draft, but a nice bottle selection. Ok so upon more eating (I couldn't stop thinking about it)..much better. I could eat a bowl of the rice alone. I'm also one of those people who prefer things cold. So after some chilling..yum!! I also love that guacamole is included in my burrito, unlike some other places who shall remain nameless. I am certainly excited about going back to try more items.
