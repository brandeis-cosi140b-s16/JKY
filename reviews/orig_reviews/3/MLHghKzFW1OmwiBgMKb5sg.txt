I've been trying quite a few, fairly authentic, Mexican restaurants in Denver, and so my Mexican food taste buds are pretty spoiled right  now. 

Enter, the Isla...had a groupon so thought we'd roll over and give it a whirl. True to vegas form, even after my groupon, we spent nearly 60 dollars out of pocket for 4 people.

Food was ok, nothing really had the wow factor. Chips and salsa was ok, again, not much excitement.

Next time we visit Vegas, we're hoping to find a REALLY good authentic mexican food...guessing we'll have to venture off strip?
