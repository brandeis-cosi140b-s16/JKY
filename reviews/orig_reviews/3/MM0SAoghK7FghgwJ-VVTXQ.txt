Brand spankin' new restaurant bar on the strip.  Lots of innovative, but not-so-great cocktails on the menu.  (they make a mojito with jalepeno in it..).  The guacamole was delicious!  Although for $8 you'd expect more than a couple spoonfuls of it!  The food was decent and the bar/ambiance was fun.  They definitely still have room for improvement, but I'd return here.
