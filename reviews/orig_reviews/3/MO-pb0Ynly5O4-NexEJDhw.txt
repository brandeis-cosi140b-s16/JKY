We went to Vida for a ladies dinner on a weeknight.  The service was very prompt and we were seated on the patio...fantastic view.

Vida was spot on with some things and mediocre with others.  Our server John was wonderful.  Extremely friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu and drink offerings, he made great recommendations.  He knew all of the upcoming events going on and I will definitely request his section next time we come back.  

In terms of the drinks, they had a great specialty drink list and an impressive variety of tequilas.  I had a melon mojito that was pretty good...not exceptional but definitely worth ordering another.  The chips and salsa are good...but definitely enhanced by the queso dip.  It was very very different from the quesos I've had at other Mexican-styled restaurants...and that was a great thing.  It was spicy and had different flavors in there I couldn't put my finger on...but it was delicious.

I had the chicken taquitos...which were pretty bland.  Maybe I just picked a bad dish, but as a taquito expert I was not very impressed.  The chicken was bland and the queso fresco scarce.  I will not be ordering those again.  The rice was good but nothing to write home about either.  

Despite some of the let downs with the entrees I will definitely be going back.  The location and patio make it a top pick for happy hour drinks and the service is spectacular.  Hopefully I will be able to retract my current review on the food next time we go!
