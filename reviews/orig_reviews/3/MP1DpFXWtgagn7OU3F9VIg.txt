Needed some quick food tonight and found this place on Yelp. Closes at 6 on weekdays so I had to rush over there to get take-out. No combinations, everything is a la carte and it can get pricey. The beef tacos were very tasty, the rice was also good, but not a fan of the beans. Almost soup-like texture and I prefer a whole pinto bean style. 
They seem to make everything from scratch so they might not have everything still available at the end of the day. I definitely want to try this place again now that I know the in's and out's of it a little better.
