I was excited for some tacos and realized I have over looked this place many times considering I live within walking distance.   I like that they have a bar and great Mexican beer selection along with fun Mexican sodas!

I had the fish, calamari, and chicken tacos..... they were just okay. I was hoping for more flavor. They were good so I may go back, but I am an as satisfied as I hoped.
