Groupon deal with margaritas! That's what brought me in the door. What will keep me coming back? It's certainly not the blandness of all the foods I tasted here. I think they forgot to order salt for the kitchen. The service was exceptional though.

Bland food aside, the atmosphere here was quite festive.The colorful and eccentric chandeliers in the bar were my favorite.  I love that they do karaoke every night of the week, but I didn't stay long enough to wait for it to begin.The service was attentive and thoughtful. I ordered the shrimp burrito (of course it wasn't on the menu, but whenever I'm at a Mexican restaurant I always order a burrito with seafood), and my sweetie ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas combo plate. 

The food is served just as you would expect at a Mexican restaurant: with a heaping helping of rice and beans on the side, and the sauces would have been fantastic if they had just added SALT to the dishes. 

The jumbo  Cadillac margaritas were included in the deal, and boy were they delicious! 

With the Groupon deal this place was a great bargain. I'll be back again for the karaoke,  and hopefully they'll supply the chef with some salt for the food next time.
