contemporary mexican food, great flavor, if not slightly pricey.

This place is actually located on the ground level of the massive World Market center just north of the Premium Outlets mall, so if you think you are driving the wrong way, you are likely right on track.

There are two things on the menu that stand out, the Wagyu Skirt Steak dinner and the Mexican Street Corn side dish.  We have tried a few things, but these are the best. The skirt steak has great flavor, and the mexican corn is so creamy and lime with just enough cilantro (which I hate) to be perfect.  The flavor on both of these dishes is outstanding.

Now the reason for 3 stars and not 4.  If you order 2 of those skirt steakd dinners with 4 margaritas and you are over $100 without tip, so set expectations accordingly.  Mundo is 4 star on flavor, but I gave them 3 stars as they are just a bit pricey.  Maybe if drinks were less it would be enough to get the bill down and i would have no reservations on a 4 star rating.
