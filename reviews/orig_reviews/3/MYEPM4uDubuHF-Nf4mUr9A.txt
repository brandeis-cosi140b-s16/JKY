We were Downtown and decided to check this place out. I was surprised to see that they were even open on a Sunday morning. A restaurant that serves nachos and tequila open the breakfast? This definitely looks like a place for late night boozing. Attractive, young waitstaff and 90's 'nostalgia' music that I clearly remember as a full grown adult. Nothing will make you feel your age faster than nostalgia that you're too old to care about. The drinks section takes up half their menu. Bar food makes up the rest. We got the nachos because it's in the name so you'd think they'd be good. They were pricey but plentiful. This is a good place to go if you've got expendable income and you would rather blow it on a night out with friends instead of something sensible like video poker. Not my kind of thing but I'm not their audience. If you want to spend your paycheck on shots of tequila and tortilla chips then you might love it.
