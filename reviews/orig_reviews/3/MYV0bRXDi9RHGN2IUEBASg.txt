Here I am again searching for an incredible meal!  Haven't experienced it to many times in Vegas. I find it extremely difficult to find somewhere that just serves an old fashioned breakfast. I drifted to Red Rock and since I wasn't in the mood to wander I dropped into the first place I saw.  Josh was my server and I give him a big thumbs up!  It took a little to long for my drink, but it was delicious and I drank every last drop. The food was ok, but not great!  I had the chicken enchiladas with a green sauce. Tasty, but nothing to write home about. I'm back on the trail for great food, we'll see how this week goes. More to come.
