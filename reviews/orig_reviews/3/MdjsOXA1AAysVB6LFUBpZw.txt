First off, love the name. We'd driven by this place a few times and finally got in to try it for a midweek lunch. I had heard rumors it was overpriced but I really didn't think that was the case at all! 

Obviously, nachos are their specialty and I really liked the unique combinations you could choose from. I tried the Buffalo Chicken nachos and wow...spicy but good! May need some ranch or an icy margarita to cool off your tastebuds. Next time I go though, definitely trying the make your own nacho platter. My boyfriend got something simple - chips, chicken and cheese - plain jane but so tasty! The chicken was marinated just right and chees melted perfectly, sometimes simple is best! The platters are reasonably priced at around $10 and you get a ton of food (I couldn't finish mine!). 

The drink menu was plentiful so that's definitely on the to do list next time as well. They also had a lot of other great sounding entrees so if nachos aren't your thing you'll still be fine.TV's galore so I have a feeling this place will hit its stride during football season. Word on the street is they now have some pretty great drink and food specials on Saturday nights so stay tuned for more to come from this unique place!
