Service and atmosphere fine, but majority of food items plain and average. If the audience is one seeking non -authentic chain-quality food, this makes it (not sure if it is even part of a larger group of restaurants- but the food seems geared for a non-discriminating suburban crowd).

The menu was interesting and cute but I wish they had spent the same amount of time developing a more flavorful group of foods. One exception was the wings appetizer which I felt was excellent and might be the only reason I'd return. 

Main course of fajitas looked nice and the chicken was well-grilled but the accompanying peppers and onions seemed like they had been prepared earlier and were kept warm and soggy until time to use. This was probably the most flavorless serving of this dish I'd ever had. Needed seasoning and freshly grilled peppers and onions. No avocado provided (probably was for an extra price). Just a little grated American cheese and sour cream. Rice and beans served with this did not excite me. 

Shrimp and chicken tacos ok but lacked flavor. Quesadillas were better. 

Oh well. Try it and draw your own conclusions.
