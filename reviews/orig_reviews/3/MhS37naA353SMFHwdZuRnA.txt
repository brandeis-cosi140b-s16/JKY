Came here to celebrate our daughter's B-Day. This was a place that she had been to before and she was wanting to go back again. Even I was eyeballing photos of the famous Chiles en Nogada dish and was getting excited.

The outside of this building is covered with several crazy and colorfully painted murals. They are very psychedelic and most interesting. Inside is decorated in a similar way and has paintings of the same type of art on the walls.

We started with the table side Guacamole that everyone raves about. Guess we missed the fine print and it came straight from the kitchen. The guacamole was pretty good. But not enough to give it a $12 price tag. Not sure why they put cranberries in there. Maybe not the best match for such a dish.

Tried ordering their famous Chiles en Nogada and was told that it is a seasonal dish. They said that pomegranate was not available and they did not have the ingredients. Why put it on the menu if you do not serve it at all times? Maybe start by putting SEASONAL next to the item so that everyone knows up front.

Ordered the Pollo Poblano instead and was not very impressed. Daughter ordered the Cochinita Pibil and said it was very tender. She also said that it lacked any deep flavors and was not very exciting. My wife and son in law decided to go with the Fish Tacos. Both dishes looked really good. Again they fell short on taste as well.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. Other reviews also generally mention that this restaurant is not the same as it used to be. We thought the food was more or less A-OK with prices that were higher than desired.

Maybe it is time for a kitchen intervention or something. Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different idea of what GREAT taste like these days. LO SIENTO!
