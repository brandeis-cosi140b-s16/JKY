My husband and I decided to try out Mi Casa on Silverton's 14th birthday. We'd both gotten coupons for the restaurant in the mail and decided it was the perfect opportunity to try it out. 

We were seated immediately and after a few minutes was greeted by our waiter. We ordered the special of the day- two tacos and an enchilada for $5. My husband also went ahead and ordered a margarita which we had a coupon that was supposed to make it free. 

The food was good and if it wasn't for the service, I would say I would be back.The service was really the reason I gave this place 3 stars. It was extremely slow and there weren't many people there. It took forever to get refills or to order a new drink. I practically had to stand up and flail to get the staff's attention. At the end of the meal, the check was brought to us (after a very long wait) and I was surprised to find that we had been charged the full amount of the margarita despite the coupon. At this point, though, we were so tired of waiting, I ate the cost and left. 

Don't think we will be back to Mi Casa any time soon.
