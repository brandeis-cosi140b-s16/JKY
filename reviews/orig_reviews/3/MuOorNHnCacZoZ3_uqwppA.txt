Gorgeous building and space.  The bar is done up nicely.  The food is fairly good although the rice I got was a bowl of mush so I take off points for that.  Decent service initially, waitress kind of disappeared between ordering main and having it served.  I would give it another try for the building alone and I need to get there during Happy Hour!
