Honestly, just okay. I had red sangria - "house special" - and it really wasn't very good at all. Brought out bread to our table but no bread plates or silverware...we couldn't find anyone to flag down, either. I had the tilapia, which actually was very tasty - the fried rice that came with it was great. Dining companion had a steak special which looked good. We were not offered dessert (or a dessert menu), and it took FOREVER to get our check and pay our bill. I think next time I'm in Champaign I'll stick to bar/grill food and save my "fine dining experiences" for the Chicago area.
