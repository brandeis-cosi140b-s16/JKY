Well we ended up trying this place again since our daughter and friends wanted to eat here. I do have to say! It was a lot better than our first visit? Daughter and I shared a combo platter. I enjoyed their ground beef burrito. Daughter had their beef taco. Wife shared a appetizer platter with mother. They thought it was awesome. Because of our second visit, we will give this place another chance!
