Been here a handful of times and the place is packed even on weeknights. It's pretty standard Arizona style Mexican food, but with some healthier options mixed in. Vegetarians can take note that they don't use lard in their beans. 

On a couple of occasions the service was superb and I was happy about that. I've tried the tacos, burritos, and chicken salad. None of it stood out as amazing but it wasn't bad either, just pretty standard. One time I went on a limb and ordered the spinach enchilada which I highly recommend to anyone that likes gooey cheese and spinach. It was fantastic!

The salsa they bring with your chips isn't spicy enough for my liking but it does the trick I suppose. Overall an okay place for the east valley.
