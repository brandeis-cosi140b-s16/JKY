Where this isn't the gourmet Mexican fiesta heaven you're probably just dying to try. It wasn't re-fried bean heck either. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, it's very typical American Grill meets what it thinks Mexico should look like complete with booths and tacky wall colors.  But they will make semi-fresh guacamole at your table and bring you a mountain of chips that you can't refuse. 

They were also pretty knowledgeable about what was gluten free on their menu. Stay away from the yellow rice, but try the white, it's delicious.
