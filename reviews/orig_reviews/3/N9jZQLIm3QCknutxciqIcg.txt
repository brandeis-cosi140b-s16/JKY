My wife has finally found a place that I will agree to go to when she's craving Mexican food.  I'm usually out on all Mexican food places, I just don't get it... but this place was decent.  

I had a fish taco, a BBQ taco, and a ground beef one.  The BBQ one, which I believe was the actual "paco's taco" - was hella good.  The fish one was good too.  

The chips were meh, honestly, if they were to make their own, my review goes up a star.
