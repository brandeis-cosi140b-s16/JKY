Ishmael was great at offering suggestions but the meal arrived in record SLOW time.  He did check on us right after it was served, but did not ensure that the food arrived on time.  Instead he sold me One shot 1942 Don Julio for $20.  It was great but inflated the bill.
Debbie had the Quesadilla and I had the Caesar salad.  We split each one and still could not finish the meal.  But the ambience with the gondolas driving by, was worth the price.  Wouldn't trade a minute of it looking into her eyes throughout the meal.
Well recommended for food quality but not the service.
