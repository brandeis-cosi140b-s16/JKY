Chips are always stale, and service is never great! They did a great job on the build out and new interior space, plus the Parking is so much better now. But, the old cantina was customer service based. You walked in to a friendly staff and a manager who was engaged and knew your name and asked how you were. The atmosphere was fun and the food was always awesome. Now the employees are blah. They spend more time standing around or checking their phones and small talk amongst themselves then engaging with their tables. They have no personality and act as if your a bother when you ask for something.  Making sure people have drinks, plates, chips, you know? The basics should go with our saying. No one is asking for extraordinary but they can't even get that right! I miss the old cantina. Everyone in Charlotte raves about this place. (I was once on that wagon) but they lost me when management changed and service went down the tube :(
