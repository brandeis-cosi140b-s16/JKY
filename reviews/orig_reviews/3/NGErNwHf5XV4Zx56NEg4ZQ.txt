Friendly staff. Food is pretty good. Servers do great until it's time for the check. Seems like they disappear and you are left waiting to pay. Been there a handful of times and it is always the same. I like the chicken tacos and the cheese crisps with green chile. Not a huge fan of the beans, which is the most frustrating part of goin here as I love tostadas and bean/cheese burros. Oh well, just don't get that anymore there.
