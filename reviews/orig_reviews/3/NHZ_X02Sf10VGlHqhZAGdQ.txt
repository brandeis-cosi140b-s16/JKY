I lived by the first Cafe Rio ever (provo, ut)and have been eating there a couple times a week since.  I used drive to Gilbert on weekends to get my fix so I was so excited when they opened up by home.  The opening crew was energetic and refreshing at first but now the crew is cranky!  They act as though you are bothering them being there! 
I can't believe how much slower they are now without the originals there. 
I will give props to the Same great food and our sweet lady who works both in dining room as well as in the back... restocking the food! Hey name falling me now,  but she is the BEST! Her love and smile is the ONLY thing that makes me come back to this location. 

Please find a crew who represents your brand better... there is no love anymore
