I realize this locale is at the airport, so I'll be gracious. But friends, this ain't The Barrio Caf√© you'll find downtown. The food is really terrific for airport food, the service is mediocre, but it's still the airport. The really bright spot was the tableside guacamole that seems similar to the original locale. Chips were okay too, but how can you screw up tortilla chips? The rest of our meal was average at best. I'm looking forward to trying you again and giving you the benefit of my doubts!
