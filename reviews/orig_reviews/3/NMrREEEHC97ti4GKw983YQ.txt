I ate at this restaurant three times because it was close to the conference center in the Mandalay Bay and was good at avoiding an allergen (milk). I loved the homemade green salsa that was heavy on lime, and I liked the chicken burrito, pork tacos, and shrimp salad entr√©es I had. I also liked the outdoor seating by the pool. The pomegranate limeade was weak.  The food was more nouveau Southwest than true Mexican, but still good.
