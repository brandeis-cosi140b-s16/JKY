Ambience is very casual, wear whatever.  The food is really, very good.   The service was not bad.  However, the portion size and the drinks are measured tightly and aren't worth the money. We ordered the pitcher of margaritas twice ( Cadillac and nasty) they were mostly ice.  They bring your cups filled with ice as well.  So in reality you end up with 2 drinks. When asked about this the server said its all measured if you ask for less ice the pitcher won't be full.  We also ordered the lamb there was five 1/2"X 1/2" cubes of lamb the rest was sauce and a few floating veggies.  Delicious but measured like you're in a socialist camp. Both not really worth the money, but good.  This was the consensus of the 6 of us at the table.
