This is a pretty decent place to get a vegan option in the B-Gates at McCarran.  I found this by accident after reading my boarding pass wrong (score! although I knew of its existence from Sangeetha's review.)  Anyway, you can get tofu in your tacos, burrito, salad, whatever.  Mix veggies are also an option.  I got a black bean and rice burrito with tofu.  It was small and crazy overpriced at ~$9, but it was perfectly fine tasting, especially after adding their hot green salsa.  Definitely check it out if you're in need of some vegan friendly protein!
