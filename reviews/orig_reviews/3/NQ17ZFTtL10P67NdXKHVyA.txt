We were definitely excited about a new Mexican-type restaurant opening up, so we checked out Bakersfield on a Saturday.  This place is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, so we were a little bit disappointed.  Think of it as a Mexican themed All American Pub. (in terms of atmosphere and crowd)

It was pretty loud and crowded by 7pm.  We waited 45 mins for a table, and then we were finally seated at a picnic table with some strangers. I hate eating at community seating when I go out to eat.  It just makes me think the restaurant is cheap and trying to cram as many humans into a sardine can as possible. When you eat at a picnic table you don't really ever settle in and enjoy yourself, either.

In terms of food and drink, the margaritas were good and the tacos we ordered were very good. The short rib one was probably the best, but the rest were serviceable. One nice thing is that you can order them a la carte, so you can try the different ones out. Unfortunately, they charge you for chips and salsa, which rubs me the wrong way as well.  They aren't even good or special.  

I may go back here for some drinks and to sit at the bar, but never again for eating.  The value is in the margaritas, not the overpriced food you get to experience at a picnic table with strangers, while people slam into you as they shuffle around the bar.
