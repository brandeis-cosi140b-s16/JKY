I like the Clarendon a lot. There's a rooftop bar, a really awesome pool, a cool feel to it, a lounge, and they have events that seem fun. My friends and I come here for lunch from time to time, and I've been in the evening a few times  as well. 

The bar service is Ok depending on the night in which you go. I've gone a lot of Saturday nights and had great service most of the time, although there was one night the service was incredibly slow.  I like the drinks and have eaten in the cafe just a few times. The dishes I've ordered are just OK, nothin' special. The fruit salad had a lot of apples and very few strawberries (yes I know apples are cheaper).  I had recently ordered a crepes dish that was supposed to have a specific cream sauce with plantains. I was disappointed to see that the crepes were covered with cheap-o spray can whipped cream and bananas! Not the same. I was craving some plantains.  The guac is OK with greasy chips, but I've had better restaurant guac. I typically enjoy a sangria or a wine.   One of the people in my group had ordered a drink and said it sucked, though. 

I like the ambience of the place, mainly because I am usually with a large group of friends. It can get loud during certain evenings. I used to come a lot of Tues evenings but haven't been a while.  Saturdays can get busy, as expected, but the lounge is a chill area to hang out while waiting for a table, and the wait staff leave us alone till the table is ready. 

I love the rooftop bar area, especially during the cooler months. Sometimes the heat lamps aren't on, though. It's open late, and it's usually not busy.
