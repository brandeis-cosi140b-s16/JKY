I dined here as a second choice after the wait at a nearby spot was too long. Chuy's was fine, but not particularly memorable. My server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. 

I had some enchiladas that are one of the signature dishes due to my server's recommendation. That was an odd choice for me because I generally find enchiladas to be a gooey mess. These had some texture and I liked the chicken inside. I also ordered  guacamole which was good, but not great. Restaurant guac is always overpriced, and unless you must have it, I would pass here, for the price. I thought the salsa with the chips was pretty runny.

So overall, this was fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone wanted to go here.
