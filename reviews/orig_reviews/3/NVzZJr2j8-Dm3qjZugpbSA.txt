My first visit here I had been wanting to try this place for awhile but wasn't sure if it was child friendly. After a horrible experience at Carlos O'Briens we had no choice & it worked out well for us :) We walked in on Mothers Day with no reservations & were happily greeted & seated with no wait time bonus!!! We ordered our drinks & our daughters kids meal very nice atmosphere & ok to bring children as long as they are behaved its a more upscale place with casual dress. I order the steak & enchillada it was delic :) husband ordered a chicken dish it did look a little under cooked but husband is super weird about chicken so he ate it anyhow. Food came out fast & looked very pretty too . All in all we were pleased the only recommendation I had was our server was not the friendliest was not rude but could tell he could have cared less to be at work. I will defiantly return again. Ps it's not the place to go if your looking for "Mexican  Food " it's not greasy it's very light & filling so a great option if you want flavor & not all the grease :)
