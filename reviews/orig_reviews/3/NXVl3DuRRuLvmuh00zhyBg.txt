Went to Richardson's again tonight as it's one of my favorite restaurants for the past 10 years. Horrible experience tonight as we made a reservation late for 6 p.m. and they said all they had was on their patio. I specifically asked if they had misters and they said YES. So off we went and when we were seated the misters weren't on, so we asked for them to be turned on. They did, but they they kept turning them off. When we continued to ask why they were off they said others where complaining they were dripping on them. The only other patrons were ones at the bar waiting for their inside tables. We had 6 people and our bill was almost $400. At the end the waitress asked how everything was and we asked for our check so we could leave as we were all VERY hot (misters were off for the last 30 minutes of our meal). She apologized and told us it was a "liability" to have the misters on and that someone had reserved the "pit" on the patin and paid $500 as a deposit and they didn't want the misters on. As we walked out of the restaurant and left a 15% tip instead of our normal 25% (she lost $30) we saw NO ONE else eating in the "pit" area, only 4 or 5 people standing around and the floor was completely dry. Very disappointed that we were told outside would have misters, which the few times they were on made a BIG difference and that the few bar patrons were more important than our table of six, with drinks, apps, $35 entrees. We will definitely rethink heading back to Richardson's after this experience no matter how good the food is.........since we had to take 50% of the food home as it was too uncomfortable to eat.
