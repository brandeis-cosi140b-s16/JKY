This place is set up like Chipotle or Qdoba or any of those places. I ordered a burrito with sweet pork, enchilada style. The meat was very sweet, good, but maybe a bit too sweet. I'd try the steak or something else next time.

The rest of it - tortilla, sauce, rice, and cheese - were good but not great.

Overall, it was tasty, but I think I prefer Pancheros, then Chipotle, then Qdoba.
