Happy hour is ok, but any other time I would say no to this place. I wanted Mexican food and this place is hella close to me so I figured it can't be that bad. A house margarita will set you back $7 and it's nothing special. Nachos are sad. Street tacos are ok but they're $8 for 2, not including rice and beans, that's $1.50 extra. Not any kind of good spices or flavoring here, not that you should expect that from a place that is nestled inside an outdoor mall. Basically there is nothing authentic here so don't come here for that. And stick to happy hour or their after 9pm drink specials. Service is nothing impressive either.
