I want to like this place. I've given it more than a handful of opportunities. I don't feel like it deserves two stars, but I think three stars is pretty generous. (the food saves it from being two stars) Why you ask? There are serious service issues here.

Been here about a half dozen times now. The service has never been great. My latest experience had me at one point saying, "Am I in an episode of Punk'd right now?"

Joined a couple friends for dinner. Waited. Waited. And waited (wait/waited will be a key word in this review. Don't take a drink every time you see it... you may die) for the server to come by. After about 15 minutes here she comes. Would you like something to drink? Yes, do you have a jalapeno margarita? No, we don't. Okay, could I please have a menu to look at the cocktails. Wait. Wait. Here comes the menus. One of the first things on the list: a jalapeno margarita. Wait. Wait. Okay, drinks are ordered.

I would like to point out... it was not busy at all. 

Among the other highlights: we ordered waters with our food. Food came out 15 minutes before the waters did. No, I'm not making that up. We finally got silverware when we were finishing up our food. Yes, that happened. 

One person asked for a refill of water. She came back and filled up another person's water... but no one else at the table... including the person who asked for it. I could go on and on about the entire night. We would've had more drinks if she bothered to check on us... or if when she did check on us she asked everyone if they need anything rather than just one person and walking away.

I don't know if this server was having a bad night. Although, she didn't even bat an eye when I ordered the jalapeno margarita. Remember? She said they don't have one.

MRT: please get it together. This place used to be packed all the time. Last night, it was super slow. Is this why? Or was it because it's cold.
