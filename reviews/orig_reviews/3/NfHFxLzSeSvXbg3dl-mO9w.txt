Nice people here, but the Mexican food here really is just okay.

The tacos are good, but I would different that they are anything particularly special.  Here are a couple of reasons why:

1) The rice here has no flavor - just salt;
2) The corn salsa here uses frozen corn - you might as well not offer the option;
3) The salsa verde here is a bit bland;
4) The meat here, regardless of which one you order here, is also a bit on the bland side.

So put these things together, you get a pretty average taco/burrito/bowl.  Personally, I think that most of the raving reviews here are a result of needing a good late-night snack.
