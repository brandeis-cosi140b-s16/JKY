We were in the mood for something different and hoping this would be greatness. Unfortunately, this wasn't it.
The experience was "okay".
The food was okay. 
Neither one of us was a huge fan of the salsa or chips, ( we were hoping to get closer to the salsa my fiance's mother makes since one of the reviews says "Not white people mexican food" however according to my fiance the food we had was a mere okay, and didn't live up to that. 
The service was a bit slow on drinks and we barely saw our waitress.
It was terribly busy so that may have accounted for the service...although the food was out ridiculously quick! 
It wasn't anything I got really hyped about, not being big drinkers I don't think we fit the primary people that this place appeals to (those who love tequila).

So if you're into drinking, this may be an amazing stop for you with its huge list of tequila, if not, you can probably find better food elsewhere with about the same prices.
By the way, if you're going around dinner time...you're probably going to have a little trouble finding parking because they are packed!
