Really nice restaurant/bar in Scottsdale, the staff were super friendly and very attentive.
The food was really good, more hangover/comfort Mexican food in my opinion. I would definitely go back to try something different, not sure if it's the "best" quality Mexican food out there but definitely worth the experience here.
