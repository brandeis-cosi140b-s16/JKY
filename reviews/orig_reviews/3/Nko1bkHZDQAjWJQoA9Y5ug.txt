Tried them out for lunch today and was not impressed, not inspired, but I am pleasantly full.  Their prices are *gasp* fairly decent for being in the Borgata on Scottsdale and I would definitely recommend them for lunch.  We had their "famous" guacamole which was honestly not flavored enough.  Everything tasted good, but didn't leave me saying "wow."
