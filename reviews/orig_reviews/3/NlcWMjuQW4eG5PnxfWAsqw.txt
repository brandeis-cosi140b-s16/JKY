I came in because I had been to the one in Mexico and had an amazing time, so I was thinking this would be a lot of fun. I ordered a drink at the bar which was really good and started to look around. The bar was crowded...but the tables were crawling with families and kids...wait, what? A place that promotes dancing to get shots, conga lines with tequila stations, and beer chugging contests allows kids? I instantly felt uncomfortable that I was in anyway contributing to these kids experience here (shame on their parents too). The mc was nice, but a little pushy for my taste (he was at my side every second he wasn't doing something on stage). It would've been a lot different if there were no kids there, but this one just really surprised me.
