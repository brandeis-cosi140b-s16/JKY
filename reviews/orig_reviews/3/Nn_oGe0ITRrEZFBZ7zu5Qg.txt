This is a decent very casual lunch spot.  The chips and salsa are solid.  We opted to add queso for more flavor.  The queso has good flavor.

We split an order of steak nachos.  They are prepared differently than most nachos.  There are four large chips with toppings stacked high on them.  The chips have quite a bit of steak on them.  They have ok flavor.  Not bad, but not a lot either.

They have an assortment of your standard drinks found at most Mexican joints.  The prices are inline with other casual casino options.
