I really want to love this place but after my second time for dinner I still find it mediocre. I order salsa, chips and guac every time and both times I tried a different queso app and I didn't really love either of them. 

I've tried several of the tacos and still have not found one that makes me truly want to come back just for that taco. They're good but nothing to write home about. 

Also, service is sort of slow.
