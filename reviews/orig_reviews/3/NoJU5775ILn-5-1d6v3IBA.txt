I went here for a cocktail with my friend. It was a weird environment. My friend and I were definitely jamming more than the DJ was. Also the margarita is not fresh, it's from a tap. I thought taps were only for beers. Like guess I was wrong about that. Maybe I would go back here to try the food but the crowd was weird. It looks like a local watering hole for old people.
