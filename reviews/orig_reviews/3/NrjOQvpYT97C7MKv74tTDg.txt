So excited to see a fun New Mexican food place in a cute area!

Unfortunately, it was nothing to be excited about. Went during Saturday happy hour and tried 4 appetizers instead of a meal. Chips were greasy and under salted, guacamole tasted like nothing, chicken nachos were cold and boring, I had one bite of the chicken quesadilla and didn't touch it again. But the awful terrible appetizer was their crab cakes. I GOT FOOD POISONING!! I took one bite and sent it back because it was rancid. 

I gave one star because our waitress and the bartender were helpful and accommodating. The waitress was sweet and nice. 

If TQLA continues with this terrible food it won't be there for very long- which is sad.

As for me and my hubby we won't be back.
