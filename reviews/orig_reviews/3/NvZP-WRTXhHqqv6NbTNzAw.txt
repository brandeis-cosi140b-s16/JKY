While this is better than their Oakland branch, I'm still not convinced by their food. It's tasty but not that great. For the price you pay for it, it's not worth going to unless you go during their specials. 
This place is a lot bigger and a lot nicer than the one in Oakland which I'm guessing was geared toward a different demographic. 
I've never had anything here that was truly and epically amazing.
