Service was great,  they kept the drinks full and were very friendly. 

Food itself was just blah,  salsa tasted like something from a bottle (Pace...) and the guac was nothing special.

I know places do Spanish Rice in different ways but leave the carrots and peas out! 

Overall bland flavors likely made to please the masses.
