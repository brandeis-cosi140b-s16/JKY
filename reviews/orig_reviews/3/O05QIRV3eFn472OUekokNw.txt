Today, I had the wet burrito with carne Asada.  They generously load the inside with rice, whole beans and veggies of your choice in addition to cheese.  Warning:  the red sauce poured over the burrito has a kick.  I suggest sampling it first if you don't like spicy!  

I was disappointed with their cheap plastic forks and knives.  It made eating the burrito a challenge.

Overall a good meal.  People line up out the door at lunch, thus the 4.5 star rating.  I however only award it 3 stars!
