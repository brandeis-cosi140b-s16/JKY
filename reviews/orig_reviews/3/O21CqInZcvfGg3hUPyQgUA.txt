I admit, i have passed on this place a few times just bcus i was not highly impressed with things i have read/heard but i finally gave them a shot. Nothing really knocked my socks off but nothing left me complaining or bitching either. they have a large menu and a good variety of original items but to be honest the description sounded a lot better than the actual taste of the food. Service was good and nice large space inside. 

i was full and content but i wont be begging to go back again. I'm not a hater or a lover i guess you can say just a satisfied guest.
