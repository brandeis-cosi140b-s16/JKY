Overall really 3.5 (we need half stars!)

I've been going here for years, very since they had a place in Chandler. I think the Chandler location had better food but I head to BAG about once a year since it is not close anymore.

The food is a large step above the average mexican or southwest place. They have some very creative dishes and they all taste good.

My oly criticism is that they use too much cheese and sauce. It smothers some of the flavors they should be accentuating. If they would lighten up on these they'd gain another star.
