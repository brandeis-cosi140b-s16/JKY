Food was decent and atmosphere was great. Live music and dancing was a nice touch. 

Service was mediocre at best. There didn't seem to be a manager within sight and much of the staff seemed disinterested. They had a heck of a time just getting our order right and getting it to the table in some sort of orderly fashion. 

Enjoyable night but we had to ignore the disorganized and cranky staff.
