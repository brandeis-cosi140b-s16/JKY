Went here this evening for dinner. My wife and I were seated quickly, our server greeted us quick. First off our chip basket was overly greasy. We asked for a different bowl, the second was fine. Are server was very nice. I ordered the shrimp fajitas, we got our food in record time. I was ok with 2 torilla shells, 3 would be better. The green peppers were under cooked, I didn't mind, because I don't eat them. The shrimp were on the small side. Over all for 35 dollars, that was 2 dinners, and 2 soft drinks. I would expect a little more. We may go back, naw I think not.
