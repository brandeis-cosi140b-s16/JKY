Well tonight my girlfriend and I went back to Macayo's to give them another chance after are last dinner we had with them. This time the server was great on top of her game. Very nice and pleasant in addition to checking on us often.  The food was very good too.  Along with are drinks being good also.  Last but not least the management came to talk to us and tell us how sorry they where for the last time we where at the restaurant .  Which I found to be very big of them.  So glad we gave them a second chance will look forward to returning to dine with them again. Everyone does deserve a second chance. Which they make it right.  Thanks so much :)
