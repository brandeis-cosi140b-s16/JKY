The food was beautiful and appealing. Unfortunately, I felt as though the aesthetics of the food packed more punch than the flavor. The tortillas were fantastic and so was the guacamole but everything else didn't hold up to the promise of those. I will most likely come back to see if perhaps the kitchen was just having an off night.
