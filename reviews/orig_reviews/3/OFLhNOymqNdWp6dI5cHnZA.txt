I recently went with 3 other friends... it was the weekend and wait was an hour, which i can deal with since they have pretty good drinks.  the place is really cool inside and i like the salt wall.  

My enthusiasm for the Mission wanes when I think about the menu.  While everything that I had was cooked very good, I felt the menu selection was limited and overpriced for what you got.  I would go back, but only for drinking.
