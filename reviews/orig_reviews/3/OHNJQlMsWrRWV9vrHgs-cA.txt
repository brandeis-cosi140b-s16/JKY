had a serious hankering after reading reviews on yelp for this place and went in for the verde fries and burger. the fries were swimming in a half inch of water from the sauce and were limp soggy mess after i got home with them. hey fat boy..drain your sauce, no one wants to eat that. burger was also ran and can be topped by five guys, fatburger, in and out easily.
