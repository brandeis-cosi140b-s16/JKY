Food wasn't bad. Somewhat salty. The cashier was straight rude. I ordered Tortilla Soup when I got to the cashier and she annoyingly informed me that I should of ordered it at the beginning with my enchiladas. She then asked me what I want in my soup. I asked her what were my choices. She said that it was everything on the line. Again, she was rude and annoyed. I told her to forget it. I'll try it again but if they are rude again I probably won't go back
