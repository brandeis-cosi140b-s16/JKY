Solid 3.5 stars. Got sopes, burritos and tacos. All were requested with asada and were delicious. Refrain from the guacamole- it's basically smashed avocado with a bit of salt- super bland. 
Burrito was really good- from the tortilla to the beans. Meat was seasoned perfectly. Sopes were also on point- had sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo. As far as tacos go- niece had them and loved them.
