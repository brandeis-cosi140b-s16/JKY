Yum and yet a bit of a yawn.  Yes it was a bit of yesterday as I appreciated the decor and the speed of the service.  Nothing stood out much.  The place was clean and made me think of driving a few hours further south for the real deal...and that cannot be bad...right?  To be reminded of the real thing so much that you want to leave where you are and go get the real thing?  Your call...not yuck, though.
