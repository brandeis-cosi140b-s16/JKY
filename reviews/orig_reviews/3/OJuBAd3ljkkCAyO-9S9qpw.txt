My first date with my husband was at a Ricardo's location that no longer exists so I have a certain fondness for this restaurant.  A good feature is they are open late so swing shift employees can get a bite to eat after work.  However, I find the food to be middle of the road Mexican.  Not disgusting but certainly not great.
