I went here last night for the first time. My first thought was the prices are crazy expensive for mexican food. The tamales where ok. not the best I have had but filled with alot of meat, not spicy at all. The fajitas were normal size serving. The beer and drinks are also on the high end. 5$ for a bud light bottle.

I gave this place 3 stars do to the price and normal plain Jane dishes. But on the bright side. The service was top notch and very attentive. They also have the best in house made  flour tortillas.

I will only be going back if I ever have a tortilla craving. So far best mexican food/drink in summerlin is casa don Juan. Flavorful food and decent prices. And good drink prices as well. Service is good to.
