I was meaning to try this place some time ago and I finally have gotten to lunch here on a couple of occasions. 

My first trip I had a shredded beef taco with a cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans ($5.15 with a drink, $1.15)  Very good.  On my second  trip I pigged and had an Oaxaca special burrito with mild chorizo, beans, potatoes, cheese and smothered with cheese and green enchilada sauce and a side of beans and rice ($7.25).  Everything I had was good.

They have a person assigned full time to keeping the dining and drink area cleaned and even then the lunch rush has him falling behind keeping tables ready.

This is a local family run chain of 3 locations with a lot of history in the valley.  Their tortillas made in house are really good.  While some may complain there is not a salsa bar or that the chips have a price tag on them their pricing structure has a lot of merit in that you can order what you want and pay only for that and nothing you may not wish to consume.  In that sense it can be a really inexpensive place to eat.

While I would not consider this a destination place it is certainly a good value if you are in the area.  And based on the crowds that fill the place I am not alone in that idea.
