We were craving Mexican food and this place was close by and I had been wanting to try it. 
Sitting on the patio is much nicer then inside, although there is the constant traffic noise. 
I ordered the three enchiladas, chicken, pork, and cheese. The flavor was very standard considering the price. The Chicken was the best of the three. The cheese had no flavor at all. 
Chris D. ordered the Gaucho tacos. They were really good! Beware of the strong garlic flavor that will make you wake up in the middle of the night to brush you teeth. 
The chips and salsa are good. The service, however, was very inattentive. 
Luckily we had a restaurant.com certificate. I would not dine here without some type of discount. It is just not worth the high prices for average Mexican food.
