So Jason B. and I decided to try Padre's for dinner tonight. It was easy to find, and very comfortable inside. The nicest part, we were the only people in the restaurant for the first part of the evening.
The waiter was very helpful and gave us many recommendations. We decided to start with the Queso Fundido, which was very good. It had tons of caramelized onions and spinach, it was well flavored and very filling. I would order it again.
I ordered the Cerveza Battered Fish Tacos, which were excellent. The fish was tasty and they had just enough Baja sauce and cabbage. I was not so impressed with the rice and beans; they were ok, but not amazing.
I was quite surprised by the prices. I mean $15 for tacos (not the fish) seems like a lot of money, whether they have duck or steak. There wasn't a lot on the menu I would order, just simply because I wouldn't pay the prices they were asking. 
Maybe I will have to go back for the happy hour deals, and then I can try the duck or steak.
