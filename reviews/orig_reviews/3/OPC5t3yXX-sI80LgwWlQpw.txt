3.5 stars

Let's start with the good.  
1) The service was 5 stars very friendly, our waitress was attentive and very prompt with everything.
2) the corn side was great
3) Bells two hearted on tap

The not so good
1) The lentils served with the food were cooked perfectly but were really bland, if they were seasoned they would be perfect. 
2) The meat on the carne asada and pork bell tacos were also cooked fine but like the lentils the tacos were missing something and tasted a little bland. 
3) the salmon ceviche was warm when it came out although the flavor was good

Overall I would return if they 'spiced' the food up a bit. I love brat haus and think this place has great potential but the food needs to be kicked up a notch.
