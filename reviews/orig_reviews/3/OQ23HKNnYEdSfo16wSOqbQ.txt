We stayed at The Venetian during our trip and once we were checked in, we walked around looking for a place to have our first Vegas meal. We found Canonita near the Canal Shoppes and were quickly seated "outside" and had a cute view of the canal. 

We enjoyed some margaritas along with tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole. I had the pomegranate margarita and it was decent, I would have had another, but the early hour and the $12 price tag kept me in check. 

For a meal I ordered the beef flautas, they were decent, but more appropriately described as taquitos, as they were made of corn vs flour tortillas. They were topped with green sauce, cheese and pico de gallo.

The food and view were decent, not great enough to pull us in for a second visit.
