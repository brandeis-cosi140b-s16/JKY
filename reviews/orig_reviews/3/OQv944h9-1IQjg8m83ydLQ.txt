My family came here a little over a year ago and had a pretty awful experience, so I have steered clear of this place for a while. My brother had a craving for Mexican, so we decided to give it a second chance. We went on a Monday around 5 so there very few other patrons. We were given prompt service and asked whether we wanted a booth or a table which is nice! I also liked that they immediately gave out water- I remembered from my first experience that they didn't bring out water until after the chips and salsa and I thought my tongue was going to burn off. Now that I knew how spicy the food was, I wasn't caught so off guard. However, I do think they should offer a milder version, since it's almost impossible to eat the salsa. My mom and I split some sort of plate/sampler and a guacamole appetizer. I found that I was actually able to eat the green chile sauce as long as I followed it up with some guac. My brother really enjoyed his enchiladas which also came with a green chile sauce. I agree that the iPad system is awfully tacky- I've seen other shops use an iPad just fine, but the waiters need to not announce the total of the bill and have an option to write your own tip. Overall, our second trip was a million times better than our first, although I will still probably never come here again, not with so many better options out there.
