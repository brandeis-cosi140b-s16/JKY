Overpriced, and dull. This clip-joint nickle-and-dimes you to death.  The food is of decent quality, but UHM HAY, WHERE THE FLAVA AT? The only stand-out meat I encountered at Lulu's was the Al Pastor, which was tasty, and sweet, but not nearly as spicy as I felt it could, or should be.  If it weren't for the decent Al Pastor, Lulu's would have received a 2 star review. The beans and rice were also bland and flavorless. Food was prepared well, but it's pretty hard to mess up tacos, especially if you're charging about 40% more than more exciting competitors. zzzzzz.
