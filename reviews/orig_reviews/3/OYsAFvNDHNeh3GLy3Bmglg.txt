NOT THAT IMPRESSED.  Food was good, not great.  The pig wings were ok. Don't understand the hype.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were just ok again. The shrimp and corn tamale was just good.  You want amazing Mexican food? GO TO THE BARRIO CAFE and taste the difference.  Yes, it's way more expensive, but you get what you pay for!
