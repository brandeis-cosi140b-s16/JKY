I tried their taco Tuesday special. Only 99 cents, donchaknow?

Ugggh.

I think they compare with the worst of the Lawry's-mix-and-cheap-ground-beef-in-hard-shell tacos served by awkward neighbors who invited  me over to their house when I was about 8. I would class them "barely edible". 

Maybe it would be better for them to run a $1.49 Taco Tuesday and provide something that actually tastes good.

Service was ok, the rest of the meal was ok, but no more Taco Tuesday for me. Not here.
