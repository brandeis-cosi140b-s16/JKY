This restaurant would get a higher rating if it weren't for one word: cilantro.

If you don't like cilantro, don't go to Wahoo's. While they make a tasty fish taco (and fish burrito), all of their dishes are swimming in the soapy herb. That's not really a problem for me, but my husband HATES cilantro, and it overpowered each bite of his burrito.

The staff was friendly, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was laid back. And I like the fact that you have the option of white rice or brown, and white beans or black. But it's unfortunate that you don't really have the option of "no cilantro," because it is everywhere!
