It was just alright. I expected a lot more based on the posted reviews. The kind of place that I'm good with being there just once, not really looking forward to going back. If you're in the area and don't really want to go searching for something else, try it out. It's really not that bad. But, if you don't mind a short trip somewhere else, then take the time. I could think of other places that are better and in the near area that are more enjoyable.
