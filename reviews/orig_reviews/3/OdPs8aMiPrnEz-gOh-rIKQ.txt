Today was the third time I come to this place and the first review I make. I am giving it 4 stars for the overall experience.  However,  being here 3 times now I can say that some of the reviews are correct, service is a hit and miss, the food depending on what you order will vary as well. We had the "Molcajete" which is a must order serves 2-4 depending on how hungry you are. And we had the "Mojara Frita" whole fried fish. Both come with rice, beans, and a little salad. It was all good and filling.

 If you are in a hurry don't come here, this is one of those places that is meant to be enjoyed at a slow pace. Order,  eat chips and salsa, have a drink, chit chat and wait for your food. Atmosphere is great!
