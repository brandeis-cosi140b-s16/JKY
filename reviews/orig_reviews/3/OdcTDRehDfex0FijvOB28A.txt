I went in yesterday for happy hour to have a birthday drink. I had the house margarita for $5.75. Actually I had two! They were good. I think I disappointed the bartender when I question him why his $7.25 Margarita he was pushing was supposedly so awesome. He claimed Cruz a local Tequila was the reason. I argued just because it's local doesn't make it good. LOL. 

The house Rita stands up alone, as a good traditional Rita on the rocks. Don't buy the hype, as I saw half the crowd not question it and accept the pricier one on special as the way to go. 

The place was busy. They were also hosting a MBA networking mixer just off the main bar. In addition to discounted beer at happy hour they also offered free food! I thought those days were gone but they kept a steady supply of warm chips, salsa, veggie tray, cold pinwheel wraps and one or two hot Mexican items (mini chimis, and bean & cheese nachos) coming. I was going to order a half price appetizer as part of my happy hour, but heck I went for the free food and was just fine. 

My sampling of the appetizers makes me wonder how good the menu was, so I peeked at it. It looks pretty basic but tasty. I think everything was $12 or less on the dinner menu. According to the sign outside lunch starts at $5.99.  It may be commercialized Mexican food but it's a step up from some places like Taco Bell and Baja Express for certain.

The staff seemed competent and to work rather well together. Even though it was busy the staff was calm and quick to serve, which is a good thing. They seem to recognize some customers as regular patrons which was also nice. 

The woman's room off the bar was fresh and clean in this madness as was the bar and all areas I could see. 

I think I will be back. I think I could even become a fan of the place over time. It seems to have a good mix of people and an impressive straight male clientele, worth another look.
