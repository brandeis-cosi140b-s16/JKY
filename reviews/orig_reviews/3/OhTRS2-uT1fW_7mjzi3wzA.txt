We arrived about 8:30pm. Blake was our server. He was very friendly and efficient. The biggest thing my husband and I are searching for is a nice Mexican place where we can east chips, cheese dip and salsa. This is the second place we have tried in the Gilbert/Phoenix area...all I can say is try , try again. My husband's comment was "this is the worst enchilada I've ever had." The burrito was just very bland, as was the salsa(the salsa is hot also). The place is not horrible, its just plain and flavorless. Another server who had overheard our conversation suggested for the best queso and salsa..."your house. Seriously, homemade salsa and queso is not going to be topped."  Oh well....we will keep trying.
