Went to the Blue Adobe Grille before our show at Mesa Arts Center this past Friday (saw Mythbusters Tour!!).  We originally were going to go to Queens, but I wanted a sit down, since we hardly ever go to a restaurant and this was kind of a date night/anniversary celebration.  

J checks out restaurants on the Yelp app, and comes across BAG with its 190+ reviews and 4 star rating.  We figured we'd give it a shot.  We walk in and are immediately seated.  Looking around, I began to get scared.  95% BLUE HAIR CUSTOMERS!  Did we make a mistake in coming here??  

I mention to the server that we have tickets to a show at the arts center (lots of area restaurants give discounts.etc) and he said sounds good, took our order, and a few minutes later brought out our bean dip.  

J's order - Cruz kitchen: He thought the relleno was good, very flavorful.  The tamale he did not care for all that much.  I tried a bite and it was on the dry side.  

My Order - I originally wanted to get the adovada lettuce wraps as my dinner, but at the suggestion of the server, I got the Blue Seafood Enchiladas Friday dinner special.  It came with beans (ranch style beans) and rice.  The beans were okay and rice was very flavorful.  The enchiladas though were tough.  After 1 bite, left the tortillas and just ate the insides, which was supposed to be a combination of Halibut, Salmon, and Shrimp.  They were mostly filled with salmon.  Didn't detect any halibut and had maybe 2 pieces of shrimp.  I wish I had gone with the lettuce wraps.  

I think maybe if we're in the area, we'd give it another go.  But would definitely order different items though.
