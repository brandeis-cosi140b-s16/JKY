On New Year's Day, my family and I came here for breakfast but they didn't only served lunch and dinner. There were vintage orange cushion leather booths and wooden tables surrounding a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant was decorated with hollow lights, colorful skulls, crosses, and prints of bulls. 

The drinks especially the Piña Colada and Sangria were very strong! The Piña Colada, which consisted of rum, pineapple juice and coconut cream, tasted like medicine due to excessive rum. I asked them to make a lighter and more sweet version of it. The second was better than the first. The Sangria consisted of red wine, brandy, and fresh fruit juices. They were garnished with strawberry and orange. 

For appetizers, I'd recommend the Guacamole (and tortilla chips), Yucca Fries, Botana Platter, and Caesar Salad. The Guacamole dip consisted of fresh avocado, diced onions, parsley, and garnished with pomegranate seeds. Some of the tortilla chips were seasoned with spices. The Yucca Fries were deep fried, thickly cut yucca. The Botana Platter consisted of two mini pork chorizo and black bean sopes topped with radish, two crispy corn, poblano pepper, and cheese empanadas, and two chicken, cheese, shredded lettuce, and sour cream gorditas. The Caesar Salad consisted of fresh romaine lettuce and parmesan cheese tossed in a creamy anchovy dressing. The other guests in our party ordered Beer Battered Lobster Tacos and Sweet Corn Enchiladas. The Lobster Tacos, which came in 3 and consisted of beer battered lobster, beans, red cabbage, and topped with chipotle mayo. The Sweet Corn Enchiladas which came in 4, consisted of sweet corn, cheese, green peppers, and mushrooms, and topped with cascabel sauce, sour cream, and chives. It's a perfect option for a vegetarian!
