OK, we went in to this restaurant with high expectations seeing the Yelp reviews were pretty good.

This was another typical Meh!

The salsa and chips were great. the rice and beans were really well seasoned and moist (I have dry rice) so they hit that out of the park.

My tacos though were so gross. I don't know what it is about the concept that placing ground beef inside a corn tortilla and frying it in a pan is a good thing??? This was a TOTAL turn off for me (get out the Alka-Seltzer)

I might try going back at some time and trying the enchiladas but with all the other mexican joints around Gilbert it probably won't be any time soon...
