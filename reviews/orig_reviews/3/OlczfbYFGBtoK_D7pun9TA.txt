This place is situated along the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian. My boyfriend's cousin recommended this place to us. Everything was pretty delicious. 

We ordered the ceviche trio for $16. They were interesting ceviches to say the least. They were served with these airy tortilla triangles. 

My boyfriend ordered the Mexico City beef enchiladas which came with black beans and cilantro rice. His plate was pretty tasty. But mine was definitely better. I ordered the wild mushroom enchiladas that came with beans and buttered rice. It was rich and decadent covered in this sinful green sauce. The mushrooms were soaked in this cream sauce that almost made me cry. I would come back here again for this dish alone.

Overall, it is overpriced Mexican food but then again everything you get from a Vegas casino is priced beyond its worth.
