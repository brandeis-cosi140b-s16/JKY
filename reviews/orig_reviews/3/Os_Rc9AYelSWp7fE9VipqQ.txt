So I just thought this place was OK.  We got there in the nick of time, after we ordered there were like 11 people in line to order. Good tip: don't sit in the middle of the restaurant when the line forms they are right next to you. Place is pretty small.  They have TV's with no sound but at least you can watch, my friend got the a bloody beer which looked & tasted amazing--so get one of those!  She also got some fried dough dessert thing that came w/ honey on the side, get that too!

I ordered a tortilla-less burrito [basically like a burrito salad] w/ the green chili sauce and chicken.  The chicken was pretty gross, lots of tough parts and fat, definitely not all white meat and I didn't think the highest quality I picked it out towards the end.  The black beans were under cooked and more on the 'harder side' then they should've been. I'm from Miami, I know black beans!  I ordered my co-worker chicken nachos to go.  They looked amazing, brought them back to her, she ate them, I asked her what she thought--- she said the chicken was gross too! Thank God I'm not crazy.

So my suggestion here: offer an all white meat vs mystery chicken option, I'd rather pay an extra dollar and get the good stuff.

Undecided if I will return.
