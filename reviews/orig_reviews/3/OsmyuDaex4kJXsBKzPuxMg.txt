OK, so here's an example of a place not being quite as bad as the reviews... if you order the right thing.

Hungover (I'm sensing a theme here), we headed across the street to La Salsa. Ordered some nachos... not bad and then decided to share the beef fajitas (the server's recommendation).  Really good. Surprisingly awesome, actually. I was shocked. The beef was super tender and really flavorful. 

Though I wouldn't exactly rush back to La Salsa Cantina (service was OK, drinks were OK, the whole experience was "OK"), I would order the beef fajitas again if they were guaranteed to be as wicked good as they were on this occasion. Maybe that's the hangover talking. I dunno. Definitely good eats though.
