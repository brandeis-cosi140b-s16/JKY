Good food table side quac was good even though I had to ask our waiter to have the table moved "table side not traditional Mexican but more upscale just didn't knock my socks off either my food was not hot and the "jumbo shrimp were not jumbo"
Our waiter Jamar with an R was very good and knowledgable about the menu
