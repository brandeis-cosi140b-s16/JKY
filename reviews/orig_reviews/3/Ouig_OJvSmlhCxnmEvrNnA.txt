OK something happened to this place. I use to love it, but I haven't seen the owner/manager in here like usual, checking on everyone. I come right at lunch time, and there are so few people working, some just hanging out. The drivethru girl wandered in at 12:30. The awesome bottles of sauce are gone. The past few times the bins of food are empty, right at the lunch rush. And no one to clean the tables off, as there is no place to set your dirty tray to make room. 

Too sad as it is quite a staple for lunch.
