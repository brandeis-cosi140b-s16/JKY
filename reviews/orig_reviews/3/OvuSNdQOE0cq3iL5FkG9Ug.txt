Love the atmosphere, sometimes it can get loud. The food is great but a little pricey. 
Its hidden for all to see but is well worth your time. As for the server it a hit and miss. The first time I went the server was great, second time I took my husband the server was really bad (I think he was drunk) or in some kind of medication. But overall I like the food. If you want a quite evening dine in the afternoon.
