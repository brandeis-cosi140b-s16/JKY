Was staying at The Boulders and stopped here for dinner. There was no wait and they had live music which was a nice touch. After perusing the menu, I decided on the Carne a la Tampiquena. My bf had the chicken enchiladas. The chips and salsa they brought out was pretty good. We both enjoyed our entrees - I had a feeling they forgot the tortillas with my entree, which they did, but i didn't have a menu to check so I didn't bother asking in case they charged extra for them. For dessert we shared an order of sopapilla, which, be forewarned their version is a mini version (like little pizza rolls). They were still good, just not as expected. 

Only reason I'm not giving them a 4 is because they seem to have a major fly problem. I'm guessing they had their doors/windows open earlier in the day, but flies were buzzing around nonstop and I heard another table or two bring it up to their servers.
