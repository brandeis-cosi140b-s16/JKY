I'm giving 3 stars. The food HAS always been good.... I sort of love their crunchy shrimp tacos.  To be honest though.... Street tacos at that price point can really only be justified by the hot and starving REHAB pool party goers who end up there by default. 
I've been here several times.... Each time walking away with a generous amount of guilt about the amount of money I spend on such mediocre plates!
