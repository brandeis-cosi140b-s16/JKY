The Barbacoa was so-so, but the fire roasted salsa is excellent and the red sopa( not the Posole- the one that comes with the Prix Fixe) was the best thing we had here.  The restaurant was canalside, so the ambiance is festive and noisy.  The Tres Leches and Brownie are overrated, but the Peach Empanadas are very good.
