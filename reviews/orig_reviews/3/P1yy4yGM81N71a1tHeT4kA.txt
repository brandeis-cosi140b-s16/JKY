I popped in here for a drink with co-workers after a work function recently. The outdoor seating and ambience were nice, which is the only reason I'm giving them  three stars and not two. The service and the alcohol selection were lacking, in my opinion. If friends were coming into town and wanted to go out, this isn't someplace that would immediately spring to mind to take them.
