Blanco Taco and Tequila was ok. We went for drinks and to share an appetizer. We wanted to sit on the patio where the fire pit was, but it was full at the time. So we settled for a table on the other patio for our first round and a cheese crisp. 
We shared the short rib and avocado cheese crisp and it was good. The ingredients tasted fresh but it wasn't too spicy. I expect a little spicy when tacos and tequila are incorporated into the business name. Regardless, it was satisfying. 
After we finished our little appetizer, we headed to the patio with fire where we originally wanted to sit. There was then room, so we sat to have a few more cocktails and finish the ones we had. Well, we were able to finish the ones we had. Nobody acknowledged us for the ten minutes we sat there. The patio is open seating so it wasn't like we skipped a step and didn' t have the host seat us. We were totally ignored. I was definitely disappointed. This took away any desire I had to come back. 
If I'm invited I will go back. It's not on my list of places I will choose to go to though.
