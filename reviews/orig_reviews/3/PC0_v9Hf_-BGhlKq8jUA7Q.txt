Sunday drink special: $2.50 draft beer (4 choices: Modelo Especial, Dos Equis Amber, Fat Tire, and something else). Good start to an okay meal. Fresh made chips and salsa to begin, awesome, but salsas (verde and roja) were too salty. Ordered the table side guac appetizer because it came highly recommended by my fellow yelpers, however, I wasn't super impressed. I'm pretty sure I can make better guac for much less than $9. 

My date and I were feeling slightly crazy and wanted to order the family taco plate for the two of us (8-9 tacos), but the waitress talked us down from it. We each got the 3 taco plate (lots of tacos = more variety = more accurate review of restaurant?). He got the carnitas johnny, carne asada steak, and taquitos vegetarianos. I got 3 fish tacos (damn you self-imposed pescetarianism!). Fish tacos were just okay. Lightly breaded pieces of tilapia on a bed of cabbage, topped with diced tomatoes. The saving grace was the chipotle crema and "Mexican hot sauce" (tapatio? cholula?) mixture they had going on. My favorite was the taquitos vegetarianos, lots of flavor and veggies stuffed in a not-that-crispy taco shell (which was fine with me). I was told the carne asada was just meh and the carnitas johnny was good, however, after eating those two and then having a fish taco, the fish taco tasted completely bland. 

Atmosphere was conducive to date night and decor was modern. Service was just okay, I'm thinking our waitress was new because she wasn't familiar with a couple of things, but she was nice enough. Although it felt like we were being rushed through our meal from the start. 

We had a few things boxed up (couldn't finish our 6 tacos, fail) and someone in the kitchen threw away the left overs before they could be boxed, but they were nice enough to make new tacos for us. Score, more tacos for later! 

Overall, I would return to try other dishes, but will know to specify less salt. 

My quest for a good fish taco in Charlotte continues...
