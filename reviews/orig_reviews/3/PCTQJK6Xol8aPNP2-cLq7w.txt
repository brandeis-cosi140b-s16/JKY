This place isn't bad at all. It's fairly new in the neighborhood and actually checked it out by accident considering the restaurant I wanted to go to around the corner was way overpriced. I'm glad I stopped by to check it out! The menu was fairly reasonable, and yea, it did remind me of Chipotle, except, I think this place has larger burritos than Chipotle! The staff was friendly, and fast. They put our burritos in this oven conveyor belt that thoroughly melted the cheese and baked our burritos. I would definitely come back again.
