Stayed at the Hard Rock for Bud Light's Largest Pool Party.  Girls wanted to grab something to eat before taking a nap for some bar crawling that night.  I got the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) a corn tortilla with beans, chicken, salsa, and avocado.  It tasted like any other taco I could have gotten from a fake me out Tex Mex restaurant.  I also thought their chips and salsa were a bit too salty for my liking.  I preferred to have gone to Mr. Lucky's next door than here.  I also found the service to lag but I really wouldn't expect too much from a restaurant in Vegas since there serving tourist 24/7.
