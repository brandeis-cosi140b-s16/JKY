I read a lot about this place and heard quite a bit as well. So I found myself in the area and decided to give them a try. I was there early so I ordered a ham and egg breakfast burrito. I also asked for it to be smothered in the green salsa. I enjoyed the salsa it was good and had a good kick! I also liked the fact that it was a big burrito. The burrito said it had hash brown but the hash brown was like potato strings. I had hoped it had more hash brown in it. Overall the burrito was good but not great. I would definitely try something else again mostly since the salsa was very good.
