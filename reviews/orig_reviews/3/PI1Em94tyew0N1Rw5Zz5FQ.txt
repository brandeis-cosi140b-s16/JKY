Ate here last night and my second time dining here at China Poblano. Came here later in the evening without a reservation and was sat immediately with a group of 6. The service was excellent. We ordered tacos for each person.

Portion size was decent. Ordered 4 tacos for each person was more than filling. Though it is a bit pricey for just tacos. Our order of tacos, 2 bowls of fried rice, guacamole, chips & salsa, and a round of drinks came out to nearly $400 after tax and gratuity. I would definitely recommend this place to try, for a different experience. But it's definitely not some place I would come frequent.
