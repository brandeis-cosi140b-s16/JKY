After a day of hiking, Mexican cuisine seemed right on time.  This establishment had some overall decent reviews. My take on this restaurant: Don't order a pitcher of margaritas unless you prefer your drinks watered down  :-(   Complimentary tortilla chips were mediocre, although Salsa/guacamole and bean dip were pretty good.  Streak/shrimp and tamale/taco/enchilada combo pretty good - would give that a 3-4 star rating..
