Like the Yelp 3 star choice says: A-OK.

The food was decent but nothing to write home about.  Tres leches wasn't that creamy and was " too Americanized" if you will.  The fresh-made-to-order fajitas weren't made to order.  They were prepared awaiting for pick up.

The mariachi were nice and not pushy.  The waiters/bus boys were very friendly and courteous.
