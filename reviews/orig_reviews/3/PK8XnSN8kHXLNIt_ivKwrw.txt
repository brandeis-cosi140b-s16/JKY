Cheap Breakfast!  Okay, so the coffee isn't great, and the food isn't awesome, but for the price, 2 eggs, meat, taters and tortillas (as opposed to toast), I'm not going to complain a whole lot, except about the coffee.  The coffee was pretty bad and had to be doctored with cream/sugar pretty extensively.

Service was very very friendly.  The place was clean, and more importantly, the silverware was clean (unlike the place next door).

Good food, good service, bad coffee. Pretty good, just not good enough to make me a fan.
