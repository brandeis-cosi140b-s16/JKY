In sunny Mesa for Spring Training. Went to this place twice. The first time it was a five star visit, the second not so much. First time we wet on Saturday night on the 1st of March. The food was awesome, the meatloaf for ten bucks was well worth it, I would have paid double. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. The staff was happy and friendly, the place just had a good vibe. Ok, the second time on Monday the 3rd. Woah completely different place. Service was very slow. The bartender was very unfriendly, especially compared to Saturday night. The food was mediocre. It was not hot and a crab dip type of appetizer sucked and was overpriced. By the way the owner was in the place on Monday and she was the bartender. May give you a clue to how the staff gets along with the owner. I will note we were given $10 off our bill on Monday, I guess the waiter recognized the long wait for food we had that nite.
