I am usually here for happy hour with friends, so we're always at the bar (outdoor bar space is great when it's not too hot!) and always well taken care of.

Drinks: Fresh, flavorful, and flowing. Whether going more tradicional and ordering mojitos or sangria or whether you want somehing more cosmopolitan (dirty martinis are always a good choice!), these bartenders know what they are doing. Lots of flavor, lots of fuel, and lots of smiles.

Food: The fried plantains are crispy, have a nice fresh taste, and were perfectly salted. We've had a few types of dips and salsas with these, depending on the mood of the group or the proprietor (specials, etc.) and have yet to find one we didn't like.

The slow roasted pork was tasty if a bit on the chewy side. I don't know if they needed a better cut of meat or more time in the cooker. Either way, it was flavorful but the texture made it less than a "I'll fight you for the rest" kind of dish.

The tamal was tasy and the masa was good, but there is just not enough meat to make this any more than a masa dish... think polenta with a cuban flair. I wanted more filling and more of their delicious sauces. Fell flat. Totally something I can see them improving... and I hope they do.

Service is always great, either because our group tends to draw the servers in or because they are just that good. Either way, it works for us! The matriarch/owner is always sweet, keeping watch over his home away from home. Great energy from a great staff.

It's not phenomenal (it doesn't have to be), and I prefer the food over at Cuba Cafe. However, it's a solidly good, A-OK, happy hour joint that I look forward to visiting again.
