The menu was varied, not the same old "rice and bean" Mexican fare. The food was awesome and the wait staff attentive but not constantly hovering and being intrusive. A great date place, business dinner, or fun night out on the town, I highly recommend if you are tired of the cookie cutter Mexican restaurant
