I had eaten at this restaurant once before and enjoyed the stuffed chile and returned for the same item.  This time it was more bland and slimply hot and not cheesy.  I also tried the Pizza which was surprisingly good (4 cheese) but had too thick a crust to be exceptional.  An interesting but not really a "New Mexican" restaurant, Gardunos, while generic in some ways, is actually the real thing.
