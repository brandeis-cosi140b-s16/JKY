I've dined at Barrio Cafe three times. I have mixed feelings. I really want to love Barrio because I love the concept...fresh, original, Mexican-American-inspired food by an award-winning chef in a non-snooty neighborhood. 

The most memorable dish I had was the chicken mole. You get a generous portion. The sauce is a good balance of sweet, spicy, and smokey. The chicken was cooked well, but not very tender. The margarita drinks I had were delicious. The table side guacamole was so-so. Overall, I found the prices to be too high compared to the food and service experiences I've had. It's solid but not stellar.

What bothers me most about Barrio is their execution of the concept. The graffiti-style artwork on the exterior walls is beautiful and shines with Mexican-American cultural pride, but once I walked through the door, I felt like I was in Scottsdale. Once when I was dining at the bar, I overheard a couple of waiters gossip with the bartender and mock a customer who had asked for rice and beans in the dining area. Okay, we get it Barrio, you're hood-hip and gourmet and all, but don't be petty...is it that unreasonable to expect rice and beans on a Mexican restaurant menu?

Perhaps the staff is coached to take on an air of superiority, to beat-down assumptions that the "gringos" might have about dining in a Mexican food joint. Whatever it is, it's my impression that the show they put on is hampering the quality of the food and service in some cases. The food and service should stand on its own...no amount of attitude can make up for that.
