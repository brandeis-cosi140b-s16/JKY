I don't like to write a review of a restaurant unless I've been there a few times. Why? The first time we came here the food was pretty tasty, second time a little less impressive and the Third time was not a charm. I got the pollo fundido each time (for the sake of consistency) - first time it had tons of sauce and each subsequent time it was dry as a bone. My husband tried a few things and was only impressed with the mole sauce. The salsa and chips are ok but nothing to write home about. Definitely had us missing our New Mexico Mexican food! We came one random day for dinner and there was a 30 min wait. The setting and ambiance are fun! You can get duck food from the hostess for 50 cents and the kiddos will love feeding the ducks, turtles and fish. Watch out for those ducks because they will bite! 

We will come back because the kids like it and the food is decent, but don't expect to have your socks blown off by the food. A cool place to check out though!!
