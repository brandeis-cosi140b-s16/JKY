I had to give 3 stars because of our first waiter... JAVIER... 

I came in yesterday for my bday dinner with my husband and we got sat in the nice view area. Everything started great until our waiter ignored us for 30 min, he passed by several time but did not look our way or ask us if we needed anything. He was busy with the large table next to us. I waived him down to grab an appetizer while we waited for the rest of our party. 
Then when my family finally arrived they advised us there was no room to fit 6, so we said thats fine you can move us. Well the waiter wouldn't even address the problem to us the hostess and the bus boy had to speak for him while he stood behind us with a distasteful look on his face. 
When we were finally moved the new waiter was much nicer, Rene. He actually acknowledged we there. 

Other than the waiter situation, food is amazing, atmosphere is great. I'll be back just not with that waiter.
