I wasn't too huge a fan of this place. We started with their guacamole ($15) which was okay - nothing to rave about. I also had their $13 empanadas de pollo con mole poblano which I was very excited about. When I received it though it was covered in oil and had absolutely no flavor. Lastly, I had their carnitas taco which is set at $5.50 and that is the reason my rating is at a 3 instead of a 2. The carnitas taco was the best. The other girls at my table ate nothing but tacos and they both agreed the carnitas was the best. The plates here are very small. If you want an actual dinner I definitely recommend going elsewhere as this place is more like tapas (similar to his restaurant upstairs). If you do come here, just keep ordering the carnitas tacos and take in the unique interior design ;)
