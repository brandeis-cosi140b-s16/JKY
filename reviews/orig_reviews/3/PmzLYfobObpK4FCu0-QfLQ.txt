I was here for the second time on the 4th of July... To our surprise they weren't that busy, we had a nice table outside and they were nice about more people coming to join us... When our server was taking our order he failed to write it down and my boyfriend always is pretty picky so I knew something was going to be messed up... Well it was my boyfriend and his friend's order was wrong and the server seemed to not believe us when we told him. My food was pretty good but the margarita had way too much sours in it, not what a Mexican restaurant should be serving... The place Is nice, clean and has a fun feel if only a little better customer service.
