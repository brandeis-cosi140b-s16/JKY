Carlos O'Briens has been a staple restaurant for my family for years. My parents took me there when I was a kid, and I've been going ever since. It is nostalgic. The interior could use some updating, but the layout is unique, which I like. I can make a meal out of appetizers and desserts, so at Carlos O'Briens, I go for the chili con queso (cheesy warm goodness) and the tasty fried ice cream. Carlos O'Briens is an oldie but a goodie, they could just use some updates on the inside.
