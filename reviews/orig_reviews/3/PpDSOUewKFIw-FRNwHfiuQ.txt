This place is trendy and has a decent atmosphere if you care about that...The best thing was the Guacamole.  It was fresh and there was plenty of it so that was a plus.

The entrees were over-priced and bland at best.  I ordered the marinated shrimp tacos and it looked and tasted like cocktail shrimp, just a bit warmer...every other flavor blended together.  

We had a party of 6 and none of us enjoyed our meals.  Everyone had the same feedback..:"it was bland."  If you go to a Mexican restaurant you expect the flavors to POP!  This is NOT traditional mexican--obviously--and the only way you would even know it was supposed to be a mexican restaurant is because they serve chips and salsa.

The service was not that great and it felt rushed, especially as it started to get more crowded.  They just seemed unorganized.  

The thing that annoyed me about this "nicer" restaurant is that after taking two bites of my shrimp cocktail taco, I put it down and didn't touch the rest on my plate.  I did eat the refried blacked beans and they were pretty yummy...but other than that--my plate looked untouched.  As a waiter, you should realize that someone didn't touch their food and ask if everything is okay--I was a waitress for several years and that is just basic server 101.  If you care at all about repeat customers and their opinions then you need to take notice if they didn't eat their meal...at least ASK if everything is okay.  I'm not saying he had to comp the meal or anything like that but to just act oblivious is also just ridiculous.

There are soooo many amazing mexican restaurants that are more affordable, half the drama, and way more authentic.  Save your money and go somewhere else.
