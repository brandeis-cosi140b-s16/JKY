I agree that they're over priced as some other Yelpers have mentioned. I've only eaten here once, and I ordered a chicken burrito. It was good, but the chicken wasn't super flavorful or moist or anything. It was a completely average burrito. I would've tried the taco, but the street tacos go for $3.49 a piece! F that. Maybe I'll come back to try out what the hype is about the tacos.
