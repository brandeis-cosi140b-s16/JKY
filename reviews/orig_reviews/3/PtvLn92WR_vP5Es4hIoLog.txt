Came here with a couple of co-workers for lunch who don't seem the adventurous type, though everybody always says they are.  It's a pretty standard Mexican food restaurant that you can find just about anywhere.  There is nothing standout about the menu, other than the fact they call their burritos "burros" which we were all pretty sure meant donkey.  You get the standard chips and salsa.  There is a big lunch menu with lots of options.  They charge for just about anything extra.  The server was good and made sure to take care of us before he got to a very large group so we wouldn't have to wait.  I wouldn't not come back here; but there are so many options that I wouldn't necessarily seek out this place either.
