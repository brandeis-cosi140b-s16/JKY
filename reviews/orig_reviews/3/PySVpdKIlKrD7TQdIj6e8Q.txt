This place is decent and I love the queso dip.  We were going out for dinner and our usual spot was packed, so we stopped in here for a bite.  I could eat their queso all night, it is just soooo good.  I had the green chile pork entree and it was OK.  I took most of it home and it tasted a lot better the next day.  Perhaps it just needed some time to marinate.
