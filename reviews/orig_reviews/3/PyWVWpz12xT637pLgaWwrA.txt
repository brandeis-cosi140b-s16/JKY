This place is pretty good. Kind of pricey if you ask me especially for food that taste just okay. The bar is pretty fun though. I was just there with family in shady side and the bouncer was mad cool. The bartenders were really nice as well. Sunday brunch is pretty cool. I mean the food is not terrible but I just don't think it matches the price well.
