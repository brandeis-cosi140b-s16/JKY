I love the hole-in-the-wall feel of this place and they were friendly people, but I was not impressed by the food. I tried carnitas, lengua, and al pastor. All of these were really dry.  Something was a little off with the bitter-tasting guacasalsa. And the horchata was way too sweet.  On the plus side are the roasted jalepenos and spicy salsa bar. Maybe I 'd come back to try the weekend specials like birria or menudo.
