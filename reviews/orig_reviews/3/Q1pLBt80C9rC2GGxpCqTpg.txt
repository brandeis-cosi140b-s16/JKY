Returned after a long, well-deserved hiatus to find that the food has improved greatly. I had the chicken fajitas, and it was enough food for about three days, no kidding. The Mr. enjoyed his steak tacos, as well. Drinks are still ridiculously overpriced, but I'm finding it amazing how much of an impact switching to soda has on your overall bill, not just here, but everywhere.
