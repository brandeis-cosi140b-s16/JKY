This place is a good place to go when you're in a hurry to scratch that itch for your Mexican fix. It's service with a smile and in a hurry. The prices are good, the menu is simple, and the margaritas... well... they have specials all day. I only wish I didn't have to drive back to work so I could enjoy a few. 
I've been coming here for quite a while. Decent food, fast service, even in rush hour.
