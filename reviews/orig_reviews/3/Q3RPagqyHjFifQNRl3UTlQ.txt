First off... The food is good.  It's not amazing or anything to rave about, but what you get for the amount you pay is good. 

I think some of the staff needs to be replaced.  We got a kid who didn't have a clue what he was doing.  He kept getting distracted when we were ordering and kept repeating himself over and over.  

As for the atmosphere... It's okay.  The decorations are action sport themed.  Unfortunately the music is way too loud.  I like music as much as anyone, but when I'm in a restaurant, I like to talk with the other people in my party.  I could never bring my parents or grandparents here.  It would be impossible to have a conversation with them.

Overall, I'd say Wahoo's is just OK.  Not great, not terrible.  Maybe turn the music down and get employees who can pay attention and maybe I'll revisit this review down the road.
