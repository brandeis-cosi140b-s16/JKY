Although the food is tasty, it is unfortunate that I cannot bring my child to Joyride or its sister restaurant, Postino because there is no where to change her diaper. It is not convenient and completely unsanitary to expect patrons to do so on the floor of the bathroom. I will keep this is mind when choosing where to eat in the future. The food however, has gotten much better since opening and the atmosphere is laid back and fun.
