good menudo on weekends, decent burritos, but they get a crazy 2 point deduction for having watered down hunt's tomato sauce in lieu of salsa. i've actually seen this at several other phoenix area restaurants, so it might be contagious. their location on mohave is pretty gangxta, so make sure to tell all your out of town friends about that hole in the wall in that colorful neighborhood you love so much.
