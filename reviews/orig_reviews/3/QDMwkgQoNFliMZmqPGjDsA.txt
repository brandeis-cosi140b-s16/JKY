Who doesn't think all gas station quick marts should have Mexican takeout counters in them?  Raise your hands.  

Seeing this place on TV, we knew we had to go when we were in town recently, and not only did we go, we went directly from picking up our rental car.  We ordered carne asada and a few other things.  Food comes in a styrofoam takeout container with rice and refried beans.  Menudo is only served on Saturdays (thank god it was Wednesday--yuck).  While I was thrilled to see the horchata and hibiscus flower drink machines, the counterperson sadly told me that they were out of it because...they couldn't find their delivery person.  Huh?  Whatever, I had iced coffee.

There are tables set up in a reasonable space to the left of the rest of the convenience store, with some bistro tables by the window.  Portions are on the small size, with the exception of the flour tortilla that comes with your meal that is enormous.  The carne asada and the other stuff was a little tough, a little flavorless, and probably not worth the excitement in our opinion.  However , we both felt that we would happily try some other things before rendering a final opinion.  Perhaps the burritos or enchiladas are more toothsome.  

The whole place is a riot, with people enjoying themselves and their food and everyone talking about how it had been on Food Network.  I think Guy Fieri is an oaf, so that doesn't mean much to me--the quirk factor is in full force here, so come if you're in the area.
