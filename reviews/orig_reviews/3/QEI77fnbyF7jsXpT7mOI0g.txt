I've been here a couple of times and the burritos are awesome! The last visit I decided to try something different and got their taco salad (it's called something else on the menu that I cannot remember.)

The taco salad was meh. I ordered with tofu as I am a vegetarian weening his way back to meat. Next time I will stick with what's good to me and that's the burritos, only this time with chicken.

Great place to grab a bite and don't let the name fool you, they do more than just fish. And it makes for a great spot to catch sports. Came here for World Cup Soccer last year and will be back for the women's World Cup this year.
