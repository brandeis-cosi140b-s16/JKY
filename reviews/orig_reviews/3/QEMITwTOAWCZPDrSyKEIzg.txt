If you want a solid meal for cheap, this is probably the place for you. Not too expensive, the meals are decent, and the service is quick. I've only had an issue here once, and it was corrected immediately by the manager.

The black beans are cooked to perfection every time, and I love the Polynesian shrimp tacos. If you are more of a no-tortilla person, you can also go with the bowls which provide you more bang for your buck (in my opinion). The carnitas tacos are pretty good too, but eat them promptly, or they turn soggy.

The service is that of a quick service Restaraunt. It's nothing to write home about, but the employees are nice enough. If you ask for something, and they aren't busy, they are pretty on top of it. I've only noticed a drop in service if the place is packed.
