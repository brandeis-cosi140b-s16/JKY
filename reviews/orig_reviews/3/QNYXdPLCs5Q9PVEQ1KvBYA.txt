Went here the other day with with some friends from Canada. The drink and atmosphere are good but the food was less than what i was expecting. I didn't have anything extravagant, just steak taco's. and for $15 I have had allot better. I could have had better ones at a local taco shop. Service was good at first but then out waitress switched out and had to ask for a new server, it took some time. would go again but probably just for drinks.
