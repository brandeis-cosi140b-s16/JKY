the chips and salsa's were a great way to start and we hoped a good sign of things to come but we thought dinner went downhill from there. Food was bland and not real fresh. The staff was really attentive and we thought our waitress was top-notch but can't remember her name due to the all night bender which usually follows dinner in Vegas. I may go back but the Chile Rellenos is off the list now.
