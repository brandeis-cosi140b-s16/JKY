Very unique experience.  Not sure if it's authentic Mexican but sure feels like it.  The Al Pastor tacos are great!

You just go up to anywhere and order, no real line or semblance or a line.  The tacos are a little over $2 a piece and are small, so the price adds up quickly if you get 4 or more.

This used to be an Irish Pub, then a night club and now a Mexican joint.  The cool thing is that it kind of feels like all 3 elements are combined.  You eat Mexican soft tacos while sitting in a night club with Gaelic style woodworking.
