Generally, very tasty with a few missteps. I ordered their double burger with cheese and it was very tasty, although a bit soggy with all the sauce they put on. Still, pretty good value and definite step up from your basic burgers. I also ordered a short rib taco. Really, really good! Tender beef, cabbage and onions. Very nice. Chips and salsa was good, though the chips were very, very salty. Only real complaint was drive thru girl was outta sync and kept talking over me and then really, long pauses. Otherwise, I'll be back.
