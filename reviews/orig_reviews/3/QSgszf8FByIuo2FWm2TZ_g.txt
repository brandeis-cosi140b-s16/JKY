When I first moved to Charlotte, my husband and I went to Cantina during its off-peak hours. When we went in and got seated we noticed it had an unusual and unpleasant odor. After sitting for just a couple minutes we decided to leave. A few months have gone past and after multiple people told us they like Cantina 1511, we thought we'd give it another chance.

We went for dinner and it was a popular place! I could still smell a slight odor (like a mildew rag), but it seemed to be overpowered by the smells of saut√©ed onions and grilled meats. Perhaps I was more sensitive to it because of our prior experience. I'm sure the majority of their patrons do not notice. 

The service was great! Their staff was very friendly. The food was pretty good. I love chips and salsa and I was happy with theirs; they bring out red and green salsa. I think I'm a tough critic when it comes to Mexican or Tex Mex because I lived in Arizona and Texas the majority of my life...the Southwest is difficult to beat when it comes to Mexican food. Overall, the food was good and the service was great.
