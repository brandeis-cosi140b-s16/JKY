The husband and I came to Richardson's for happy hour to celebrate our 9 monthaversary (and we had a gift card, so that helped). We sat at the bar, the husband got a beer, I asked for a bellini (since it said they had them on special on their menu) and the bartender looked at me like I was insane... I guess they don't make those anymore? Not sure. I ended up getting a mimosa, which was very good. The OJ tasted fresh and the glass was a generous size. We had a feast of happy hour food items that included: Blackened scallops, chicken tostadas, chipotle ribs, green chili sliders, and a green chili potato. Some items were delicious and some were not so much. The scallops (HH priced at 15$, so still fairly expensive) were the best of the bunch in my opinion. They were perfectly cooked and came with 4 different sauces, beans, and rice... it was all delicious. I would come back and just get that. The portion size was very generous. The ribs were the second best item. They were very tender, fall off the bone, and flavorful. The green chili potato was ok, but really not as special as I would expect for a restaurant's signature item. It is essentially a twice baked potato, but instead of putting the potato innards back into the potato skin, they stuff it into a pepper.... I thought the pepper was too firm and the flavors didn't completely complement each other. The filling could have been seasoned better. The sliders were alright, they were like little french dips sort of with chilies on top. I didn't love them, they just weren't that flavorful or special. The worst dish of the night was the tostadas... they lacked flavor, fell apart, and just were boring. When a menu states that when you order chilies, you're responsible for the heat level, I expect something will be spicy... but nothing was. I liked this place alright overall, but it was a bit inconsistent. I would probably come back for happy hour, but it wouldn't be my first choice in town.
