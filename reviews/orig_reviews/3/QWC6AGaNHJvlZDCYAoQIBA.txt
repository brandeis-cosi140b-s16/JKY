Sandbar, I did not want to like you. But your beer list actually pretty good, and the service was excellent. Granted, we were there on a Sunday at 1 p.m. but still, it had a nice atmosphere and the folks were friendly. Thumbs down for the menu, which was way overpriced ($15 for a taco plate?) and the food was "meh" at best.  

I do drive by this place though at night, and it looks like a hot mess. I would stick to day drinking.
