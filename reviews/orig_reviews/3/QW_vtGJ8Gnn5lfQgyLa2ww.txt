I realize this is a order at the counter type of place and not fine dining, but the place was a mess. Every table was dirty, trash was overflowing onto the floor. At one point the person working the register walked over pushed the trash down with his hand and went back to work (no hand washing going on there).

I had a cheeseburger with the homemade BBQ chips. Everything was beyond salty. I think the lid from the salt shaker must have come off while preparing my food. Sadly, I was not the lease bit impressed. I REALLY wanted to love this place since it's in my neighborhood.

On another note, I must be missing something about this place. At one point the line to order was about 20 deep, so maybe it was just a timing fluke on my part.
