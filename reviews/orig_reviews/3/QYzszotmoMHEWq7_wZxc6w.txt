The bar is still great, with an amazing list of tequilas and a decent one of mezcals. Nice cocktails too (although I did not see teh copa de fuego anymore).

But this time, for the first time, I went there for food. I'd say a strong 3 stars. I had rabbit tamale. It's great to be able to eat rabbit somewhere in Pittsburgh - hard to find in supermarkets. And the tamale were good, although not very subtle. The rabbit had been smoked so you couldn't taste very much its distinctive flavor, and the spices sort of overwhelmed it too. Not a bad dish, but not very subtle overall.

I would have put a 4 stars, but I found the restaurant a bit expensive for the quality of the food. 

I'll be back probably, surely for drinks, and perhaps to enjoy their terrasse.
