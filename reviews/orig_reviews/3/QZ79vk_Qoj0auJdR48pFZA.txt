I think the reviews here are a bit on the high side.  This place is in an obscure location, and the food is okay, but not great. The chips are okay, but not great. The salsa is okay, but not great. Even the guacamole, which is pretty hard to mess up, was only okay.  I doubt you'll be disappointed here, but it's definitely not a 4/5 star place. Actually, even the service was only okay.  I think for the prices and the Yelp ratings you would reasonably expect more.  I know I did.
