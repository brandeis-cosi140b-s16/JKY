Brushfire is a neat concept...very food truck-esque, with its drive thru and patio options 'round the small kitchen establishment. Brought here via a Groupon deal, I was excited to try the small, but interesting menu. 

Among the carne asada taco, shrimp taco and chicken empanada, the steak taco was my favorite, with great fresh toppings, including a little guac. I expected more from the shrimp taco, which was a little too seafood fragrant for my liking. I understand that frozen shrimp may be necessary for this type of place and that doesn't always mean bad! However, though the shrimp tasted fine, the smell was a little potent... also, not a fan of the slaw...wayyyyy too many carrots. No other explanation. Just odd. 

The empanada itself was good though I didn't get the lettuce dressed with some globby white substance (plain mayo?) in addition to their spicy mayo sauce (which was tasty, even for a non-mayo person). 

I've got two more $8 vouchers so I will be back, but I am not sure I'll be a frequent visitor. For the money, Rubio's is better and included the salsa bar. I do applaud this local place's effort though!
