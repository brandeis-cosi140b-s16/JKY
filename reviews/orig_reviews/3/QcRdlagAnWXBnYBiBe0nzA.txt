Food is very good- reason for the reduced stars is that we asked for the GRILLED SWEET CORN to be cut off the cob. the bartender said the chef refused to do it but she'd get us a steak knife so we could do it ourselves. she said other people have asked and the chef refused. i said - go ask the chef. he still refused, so i said, no thanks. seriously - it's a nice restaurant not a picnic - i don't want to eat a greasy corn cob with my hands and have all that stuff stuck in my teeth. and it takes 2 seconds to cut the corn off the cob but it's going to be really messy if i do it at the bar myself. not sure what the reason is, and while i don't think the customer is always right - i don't think this request; especially since others had made it; was too demanding or burdensome.
