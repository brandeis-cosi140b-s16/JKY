If I could give it 2 1/2 stars it would be preferable... But alas I'm not going to be that mean...I'll  give it an undeserved three stars... It's just not as good as the other Pepes.. I keep giving this place chances after chances.. It's way too convenient because it's directly across the street.. After months and months of trying it occasionally and being continuously letdown..I've given up altogether.. if you are in the mood for crappy fast Mexican food 
 I would try Fausto's or even the Roberto's across the street over this place.
