Late lunch here on a friday.  Chips and Salsa were awesome, the tomatoes were fresh not jarred.  Chips made in house.   Got the ribeye tacos. Ribeye could have been trimmed a little better.  Had a couple pieces of gristle in there.  Meat was flavorful but not very tender.  Overall pretty good. I would probably try different tacos though.
