As a Mexican is my review the end all be all for a taco stand?  No, of course not, that's silly, my head is not THAT big.  But as a Mexican did I have higher expectations for this place?  Probably . . . yeah.  I may not love it as much as everyone else but by no means did I not like it.  Heck, if I had only tried the adobado (spicy pork) tacos I'd probably give it a five star.  While we're at it, the tripas (intestines) are pretty damn good as well and I definitely don't mind the tongue either.  

What gets me though is the carne asada.  No matter how much toppings you have on your taco or whether you partake in those chiles, there's no escaping the fact that the meat is just pretty bland to me.  Every single time, whether in taco form or on top of the fries it just really doesn't do it for me.  And it's a huge disappointment because whenever I have tacos I always want one with carne asada.  While I'm complaining, the horchata has tasted pretty watered down to me whenever I had it, although the whipped orange is delicious.  

This is an actual Mexican franchise and it should be commended for having body parts that turn the average person off.  Tongue, brains, intestines, you name it and they all range from good to great with the adobado being the star of this place.  The set up is a little weird for most people and thus causes everyone to think they have to start at the right side thus delaying my quest to get those delicious adobado tacos but once you get through the process is quick enough. 

If you're adventurous enough, come on down and try those tacos you'll never see at a Taco Bell.  If you're not, well then I'd still choose their carne asada tacos over what they have at Taco Bell.
