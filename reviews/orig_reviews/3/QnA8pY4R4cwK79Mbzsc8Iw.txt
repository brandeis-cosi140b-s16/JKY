Good quality, but not a great value. Like other restaurants of this style - they skimp on the more expensive ingredients and try to fill you up with the cheap ones. I got a burrito and for $8.00 I received about 3 oz of shredded chicken, a tablespoon of guacamole and tomatoes and lots of beans and rice. Even the amount of tortilla chips I received was skimpy. Their salsa is just okay - very watery. The ambiance is non-existent (dingy) and I don't appreciate restaurants that have the news on when I am trying to eat. The guys behind the counters never asked me how my food was. Overrated and overpriced IMO.
