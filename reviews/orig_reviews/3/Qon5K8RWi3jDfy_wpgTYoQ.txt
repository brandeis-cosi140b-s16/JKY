Picked up a friend that was stranded there. Seems to be your typical "Poser, Meat Market, and Look at Me" establishment. There were all kinds there, from youngsters, to Tommy Bahama old men hanging out. It was early 9pm and the place was filled up. Music was good, drink (soda) was taste, and I was in and out in about 15 minutes. Not sure when I will be back, as this is not really my scene...been there done that years ago!
