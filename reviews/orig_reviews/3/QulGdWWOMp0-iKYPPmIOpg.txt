I like the look and feel of this place and was hopeful for the food. It was OK but mediocre and unremarkable.

We got the guacamole, mango and watercress salad, and chicken enchiladas. Their chips are crispy and have a nice spice to them, and the guacamole was buttery but not very flavorful. The salad was good, with a honey-mustard-like dressing, although there was too much of it. The enchiladas were disappointingly flavorless -- basically plain chicken in tortillas with a bland sauce over them and a few garnishes  like avocado slices and onion and radish slices (?).

Service was good enough.

My impression was that the place is trying to be upscale Mexican but falls short on the food. Not a good value.
