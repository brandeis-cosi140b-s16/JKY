Hmm I wonder what the proprietors could possible mean by "PINK TACO" :) Appropriately named for Vegas ,this place fits the bill for a good place to start for a night of debauchery. Happy hour from 4-7pm means you can get nice and inebriated before the night even begins...
and being a little drunk might help to make the food more palatable. There may be many iron chefs, top chefs, and michelin rated restaurants in vegas, but pink taco is clearly not harboring any of those chefs or accolades. 
   
      the first time i ate here was many years ago for my bachelorette party- the meal was a blur of tequila shots- many many tequila shots-ughh i feel sick... the food itself- no recollection....
       
      this time around we started out with the guac, margaritas and the corn tamales. guac and corn tamales- yum!!! we were off to a good start!! The corn tamales had a nice corn sweetness which went really well with the masa. The guac was just delic. The margaritas were where things started to fall apart. Definitely made with sweet and sour mix with a little too much mix thrown in- gross!
    
     for dinner I ordered the fish tacos- huge mistake- BIG... Yeah i know they're fish tacos, but being overwhelmed by a fishy smell is not how I like my fish tacos. simply put the fish was less than fresh. I'm giving this place a three for the awesome apps, but unless you're looking for a fantastic place to start a bachelorette/bachelor night of drunken mayhem, I would avoid this place....
