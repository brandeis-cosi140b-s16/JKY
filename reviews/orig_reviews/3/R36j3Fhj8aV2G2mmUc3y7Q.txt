Modern Margarita is close to home, so for that alone, this spot has me due to its connivence. I've been a couple times now and think the food is pretty solid, but not phenomenal. The tacos each have a unique twist, not traditional per say, and personally I think the chips are excellent. They are hot and fresh, just the way I like them. The carne asada tacos are my favorite and the margaritas I have had are quite good... they have a great kick, they are not stingy on the alcohol, which I appreciate, especially for the price.

The restaurant itself isn't huge, but has a nice outside patio and the inside is really nice as well with a big bar. The staff has always been friendly and accommodating so Modern Margarita gets high points there. Happy Hour specials are great as well!
