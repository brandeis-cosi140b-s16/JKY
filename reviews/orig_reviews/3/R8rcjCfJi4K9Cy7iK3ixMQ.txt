Went last week for Book Club- it was actually cool enough to sit out on the patio! Nice atmosphere, GREAT margarita. They don't skimp on the tequila! My chicken queso was a little cold, and so was another entree, but I'm chalking that up to the big group. It was tasty, but I don't know if I'd purposely go back. I like Nandos much more.
