So another venture on campus we saw this place the other day but it was packed because of a band so we decided to come back another night.  I ordered the Taco Combo 4 tacos and 2 sides.  I asked if that was too much food he said "no they are small tacos"  Ahh yeah right huge amount of food for the price!  They also have over 100 beers and almost 100 tequilas.  A cool vibe, nice decor and fun music playing and they do have bands on some nights.  I am only giving 3 stars because the menu is not explained very well and ended up with 2 choices I did not enjoy.  However I would go back and try it again and just ask more questions about the menu options.
