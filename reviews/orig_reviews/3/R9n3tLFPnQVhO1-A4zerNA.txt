Great service. James hit all the marks a waiter should. The best items we tried were the soup of the day..cilantro cream..and the chorizo sopes.  The cocktails were very tasty but very small for the price. Also..what the heck is going  on with the drinking  water? It tasted like chemicals. All in all a very nice light meal. I'd Def go back to try dinner. Ask for James.
