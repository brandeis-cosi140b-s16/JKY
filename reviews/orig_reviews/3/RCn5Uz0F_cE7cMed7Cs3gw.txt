I've been here on a number of occasions. The atmosphere is fun and casual with ample parking and good happy hour. The restaurant is very small, and doesn't easily accommodate larger groups. I wouldn't recommend coming here during the summer months, as the restaurant was uncomfortably warm the last time I was there (August-ish). Gallo Blanco is very "meh". Just ok. Nothing outstanding. Fine for a quick drink and bite with friends but I wouldn't come here with high expectations...quite a shame considering its location in the lobby of the Clarendon hotel. Has potential to be a great spot!
