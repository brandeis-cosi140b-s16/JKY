I think some of the negative reviews here are unrealistic...

Let's face it -- if you are eating here you are trapped in Airside C waiting for a flight.  You have no other real choices except fast food.  The place is going to be busy, and the patrons are always in a hurry...  Welcome to an airport restaurant.

And, by the way, the plastic utensils are REQUIRED in an airside for security reasons...

I had lunch and thought the food was good, and the service was attentive.  The prices are hight, but again -- you are IN AN AIRPORT!

I had a better experience than I expected -- so I think 3 stars is appropriate.
