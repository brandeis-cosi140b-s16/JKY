Pink Taco...clever name guys.  I visited this restaurant located in the Hard Rock Hotel on the last evening of my visit.  I ordered the fish taco plate which came out incredibly fast!  It seemed like the food was on our table within minutes of actually ordering it.  

My hypothesis is that they have figured out how to manipulate the time-space continuum and are using this knowledge to gain that much needed edge in the restaurant business.  I could be wrong.

But, I digress; my girlfriend had come here before and loved their chili relleno.  So much so that she got it again!  Being from San Diego, it will be hard to please my appetite for Mexican, but Pink Taco made a valiant attempt.  I would not feel right giving this place a 4-star rating just because my dish would not hold up to some of the spots I'm used to in SD.  

I would recommend it to anyone visiting the Hard Rock.
