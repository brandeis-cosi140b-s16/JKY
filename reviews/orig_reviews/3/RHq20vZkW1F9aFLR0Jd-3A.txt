Came to Sol Mexican Cocina expecting great Mexican food but while is not bad it is not the best either. Had the chicken fajita torta and it was ok, could have had more flavor and seasoning. The service was very good and the ambiance is nice.
The burritos are so big that are not as appetizing as they could be. Giant does not mean better in my humble opinion, as long as they are flavor full they can be a bit smaller.
I will come back and try it one more time.
