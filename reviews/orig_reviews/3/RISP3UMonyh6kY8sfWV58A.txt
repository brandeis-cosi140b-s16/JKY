I may have had too high of an expectation for this place due to the reviews & recommendations from the hotel. I felt this place was average nothing spatular about it.  I tried the carne asada, chicken & pastor street tacos. They all tasted great, but no better than any other place that serves street tacos. The beans had great flavor, but were so runny I had to eat them with a spoon because a fork made a big mess.  Rice was average.  

I have been to several of Guy's stops & must say I have never been impressed & this place was no different.  I actually thought the ladies were rude who took my order & gave me my food.  There was no line when I got there around 1125, but by 1130 the line was out the door.  I noticed almost everyone ordered either soup or a burrito, so maybe I just order the wrong thing. If I lived here I would try it again and get a burrito next time, but I don't so my first impression is all I have.  It's worth a try if you are in the area, but I didn't think it was quite 4 stars.
