The Korean fusion thing has been getting a little out of hand. Since Kogi truck, korean-inspired foods have been popping up everywhere. I'm a little bit of a Korean-food purist--why mess with a good thing? But I can't complain (too much) about the grub they serve up at KoMex.

FUSION TACOS: You have the option of beef, chicken, or pork. I sampled one of each in addition to a plain old shrimp taco. I added fried kimchi on one of them for an extra $1.. I won't ever do that again. Kimchi is good with a lot of things; just not on my tacos. The kimchi was a little too sour for my taste. The tacos without that extra Korean element were quite good though! The cabbage was crunchy, and it was balanced with just the perfect amount of onion, cilantro, and darn good pico.

VARIETY: This tiny restaurant has a huge menu. Korean Mexican food, Mexican food, American food, and Chinese. Now if they only made donuts... I want to say they're DTM. But the food here is good. I tried a little of everything; nothing great, nothing awful. The 'KoMex' gimmick isn't anything special. But if you're craving a cheeseburger with your KBBQ taco and taquitos, KoMex is a one stop shop.
