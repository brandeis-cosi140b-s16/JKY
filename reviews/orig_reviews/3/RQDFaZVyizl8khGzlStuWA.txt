To be honest I think most times I've ate TEG I've been way too drunk... I mean it's perfect for when you have the drunk munchies and it's conveniently located on the strip..

 In my opinion (shhh don't tell Mike C & James K) I think the food here looks better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong it's pretty yummy but I don't find myself craving it.. I feel like it's just your standard taco shop food that I can get from a regular taco truck parked on the street somewhere.. Oh and be careful I didn't think those grilled peppers could be that hot but last time I had a bite and my mouth was on FIRE for a hour.. lol 

Hot Tip: don't forget to ask for some pineapple & drink the orange bang! OH And chat up the cooks and tip em.. They hook it up!!!
