I was so very excited to try this place! Unfortunately they didn't have a lot of stuff in season which i understand. It must mean they buy fresh not processed.  Burgers were very tasty and fries too. I was a bit surprised by fries because  they didn't look like other yelp reviews. I like the seating outside. 

Somewhat pricey for two people
