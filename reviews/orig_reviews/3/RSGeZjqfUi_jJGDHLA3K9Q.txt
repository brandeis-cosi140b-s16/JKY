I will state immediately, if you are not a fan of margaritas or staying in the Mandalay than it is going to be hit or miss.  If you are a margarita person, these folks will do right by you.  No frozen BS here.  Their Rita's are on the rocks, including the higher than to be expected quality 40oz special, $18 up front and $13 refills(a quick note to Rita fans, the receipt, if your order is over $40, easy if you get the $18 40z special and a bite to eat I received a $5 off my next order coupon.)

Anyway, food wise nothing I had is going to blow you away(bearing in mind I did get carry out and take this to the room).  It isn't of immense quality, though I found the guacamole of great pedigree.  I had carnitas tacos.  I liked them, in the sense they were warm, moist, flavorful and fulfilled a Mexican niche for $14.  My wife got the simple cheese quesadilla, which I thought were surprisingly good.  Keep in mind, we aren't talking authentic Mexican here.  This is Tex-mex for the masses, which is just fine by me.

To simplify:  If you want authentic Mexican cuisine, look elsewhere.  If you are on the Strip and want a decent Rita and food to match or you are staying at the Mandalay and need a quick Tex-Mex fix it is a solid choice.  If you dig a good, well priced Rita(the closest I've ever had to my preferred 3-2-1 method (than I'd go so far as to say, considering the price) it is a must stop multiple days of your trip.
