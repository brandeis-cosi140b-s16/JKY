My daughter took us here for dinner as she had eaten there before and it was good food/service.  We were there on a weeknight and it was cold but because the had heated lanterns and small fire pits, we chose to eat on the patio.  Not all the lanterns were turned on and they sat us almost on top of the table next too us and it made it difficult to get in and out of our chairs. We asked to be seated somewhere else but they did'nt want to turn on the lanterns and it was a 30 min wait to get inside. That aside, the food was pretty good and the menu deffinately unique, but the service was very poor.  They were friendly but very slow and not very attentive and it wasn't that busy.
