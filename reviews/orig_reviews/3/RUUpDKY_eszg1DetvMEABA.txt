Alas! My fourth time at Paz :-) I came here for lunch on the patio, and overall it was a great experience for me. I had a kale salad with all sorts of fun stuff on it (it was one of their speciality salads). Delicious! For me, the service was great. Exactly what I was hoping for. However, my guest's order was incorrect...so, for her she was not super impressed, and had to settle for her incorrect order because we were in a time crunch. Accuracy, is important! 

Overall, I would come back. This is my second review, and I had to share some of the feedback. It's just too good of a location. However, I hope the servers can work on their accuracy! You guys got this, and I know you'll be great.
