I guess I have to give this place another chance...but I'm sorry to say...had higher hopes.  The service is terrible, it took forever to get our food and one beer.  Our server kept coming back to the table to ask what we ordered...get a pen and paper hunny.  The food was good, not great.  I've had way better authentic mexican in Charlotte.  Hopefully they wow me on my next visit-haven't ruled them out.  Hate to hate on a local establishment...but just keepin it real...
