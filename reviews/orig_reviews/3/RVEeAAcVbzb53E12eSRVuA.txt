Ok, so I was in the mood for authentic Mexican food today and wanted to try something new....so I headed towards the hood.  I figured I'd find something good there.

As I passed by Pepe's, I've seen this place a 1000 times since I've lived in Vegas, but never stopped.  I did today.

It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I was glad to see a typical menu for a taco shop....reminds me of when I lived in SoCal.  I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and a bottle of Mexican Orange Soda....I love their soda because it's made with Natural Sugar and not High Fructose Corn Syrup.

Anyway, my burrito came out and I was pleased to see it was a good size...not too big and not too small.  I went to the salsa bar and got some of their spicy red salsa.  The burrito was ok....I thought the Carne Asada was too salty, but it had good flavor....the beans were good....the rice was dry....and the salsa in the burrito was ok.

Overall, the experience didn't blow me away.  It was a good visit, but not the one I was hoping for.  I guess next time, I'll have to go deeper into the hood.

Will I return?  eh...not sure.
