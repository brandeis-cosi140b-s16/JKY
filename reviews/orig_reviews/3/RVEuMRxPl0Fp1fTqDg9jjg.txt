Say Uncle!!
By The Rue

Dinner at Aunt Chilada's,
Oh what a plan,
The food was decent,
Just a little bland,
Chips were warm,
I ate with my hand,
Hostess was cute,
Legs very tanned,
Do you play air guitar?
Let's start a band,
Chicken chimichanga,
Didn't taste like sand,
Chile poblano,
Might have been canned,
Bar tender was good,
The bar he manned,
Fish from a boat,
Or fish off of land,
I really doesn't matter,
Even if you planned,
Did you know in baseball,
Pete Rose was banned,
Ron Paul has a son,
His name is Rand,
This ends my review,
Yes, it was grand!

Paquito!
