Went here for some happy hour margaritas and chips + guac. The margarita was okay, but I didn't taste much tequila in it. And it was pretty small...maybe I just like to drink...

The tableside guacamole is cute idea, albeit a little awkward. The texture was nice and chunky but there was something missing in the spices...cumin, perhaps?

I really liked that they had a vegetarian menu with decent-looking options on it. Not many chain restaurants in Arizona go out of their way to do that!

Overall, it was alright...nothing too special and still a chain restaurant.
