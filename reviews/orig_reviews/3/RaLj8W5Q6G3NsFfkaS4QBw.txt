I've always wondered why the empty space next to Postinos East wasn't occupied by something and now finally I got my wish.  From the "Owners" of Postinos,  the Upwards Project, have rolled out another concept restaurant/bar.  This time its a taco shop. I love everything from the UP especially Postinos and I love Mexican food so I was very excited for this new place.  How can go wrong right?  

The Good
-You can expect the attentative service you've expected from Postinos with LOTS of servers always checking up on you.  And of course all the servers are attractive and easy on the eyes.  
-The d√©cor is always interesting, a mix between modern, with southwest, but more Texas southwest as opposed to Mexican southwest.  But never the less its also easy on the eyes. 
-The food is FRESSSSH and taste like everything is made from scratch.  After eating a few tacos you don't get that greasy, heavy, guilty feeling as you would elsewhere.  It seems like every item on the menu was created individually with its own recipe and taste.  No 2 tacos taste the same so you'll definitely have to try them all out.
-The seafood is def the highlight of the place.  Esp the scallop.  Scallop ceviche is good and the scallop taco is fab.  The fish tacos are great too, especially the battered crispy one.
-Ok so I lied, the drinks are the highlight of the place.  They have a good sized list of specialty drinks that they created themselves.  But not so long that its intimidating (that's what she said).  I like that its just not a Mexican restaurant and their only drinks are margaritas. They have a really good variety and they all taste good.  The drinks would be the only reason to come back
-They have a nice chill "patio"/outdoor that you can go and just hangout and drink on

The Bad
-Although every taco has it individual taste, that doesn't mean each taste is good. there are some taste and combinations that really just make you wonder.  Esp the chicken tacos.  
-although the seafood tacos are great, the regular meat is just ok.  I've been all around AZ eating all types of Mexican food and i'd like to consider myself an expert of tasting tasty tacos and Joyride's non-seafood tacos are deff a lackluster.  They just don't have the same taste, the flavor, the 'OOOOOMMMPH" as others. The carne asada, the chicken, and the pork (carnitas)
-They have 6 different salsas, however only one of them is hot/spicy.  However the Spicy gradient is steep, we're talking tomato sauce to "melt your face off".  But no in betweens
-The music is def like that of a bar.  American 80s,90s and some contemp rock.  Isnt this a taco shop, atleast some Mexican music, you can even do Spanish rock. 
-The ambiance is LOUD, like El Hefe loud but with more hipsters and less Dbags. If you want to have a quiet conversation, def sit outside or go next door to postinos

The Ugly
-Everything here is expensive. $4 is the average price of ONE taco. Yes one taco.  The scallop is MKT price so you don't know what it is.  Although they are big and thoughtfully made. $4 is much. 
-They charge extra for salsa.  EXTRA FOR SALSA WHAT?  most Mexican places have a Salsa bar that you can choose from for FREE.  Its $2 for a small bowl of salsa.  

Pros:
-Great seafood tacos
-GREAT drinks specialties
-great atmosphere

Con
-very Americanize that its barely Mexican
-EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. $4 per taco, $2 for salsa, $12 for ceviche
-loud and borderline El Hefe like....(shudders)

I would def come here to grab drinks and chill out on the patio but that's about it...
