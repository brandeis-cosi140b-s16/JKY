Food is great, but it's pricey. it's great upscale mexican food, but we live in Arizona and can get great Mexican food everywhere. Service is good, but it can be a bit stuffy. I'd say eat at the bar, if you can get a seat. Our server gave us lackluser service once he realized we weren't ordering a ton of food. Our billl was still around $100, which was fine. Just wasn't blown away, don't much care for being treated like that.
