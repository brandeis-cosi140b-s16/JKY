Came in here Friday for some lunch and was impressed the space - they have a couple different levels, with a bar and tables overlooking a square-in-progress. I tried the Las Velas Lunch Combo for $10 (one burrito, one enchilada, and one taco served with rice and beans.) The enchilada and taco were pretty dry, but the Cancun burrito (Marinated steak and shrimp, melted cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole) was pretty good. Chips and Salsa were good along with the service.
