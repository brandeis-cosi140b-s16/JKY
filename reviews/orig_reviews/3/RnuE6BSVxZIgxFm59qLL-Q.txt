Although I prefer the original location in El Mirage, this location is a solid spot to visit. I can't put my finger on it, but the food at the El Mirage location is just a bit better and the service is just a bit more efficient. Not that the food or service here is bad. Maybe it's just something about the original. I don't know. You will get a solid meal here with no-nonsense service. Your drinks will be kept full, and you will leave feeling satisfied.
