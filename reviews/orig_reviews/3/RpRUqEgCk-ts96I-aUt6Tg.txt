I want to give Verde a 4-star review... I really do, but after about a dozen visits, they are sitting at a solid 3. I'm partial to the neighborhood, and I feel that this place is a great addition, but how can a new-ish trendy place in the middle of a growing neighborhood have an exhaustive trail of Yelp reviews about poor service... and not ever fix the service?

The food is fantastic. Much better than it used to be. I've never had a menu item I didn't like. The menu is limited, but I feel like the kitchen would rather pump out a few good items than a bogus list of 100 "okay" items. 

The prices are higher, yes, but they aren't horrible. Boutique-style restaurants just aren't always where you go for a cheap meal, and since the food is good, this has never been an issue for me.

The drinks... meh - they're decent. A few times we had a server talk up a few of the signature drinks only to be mildly impressed. I usually just stick to beer unless something really strikes me and I have money to blow (not often). 

Annnnnd speaking of the server leading me down a path to a sad cocktail - I've also had servers steer me wrong on how large portion sizes are, what the daily special actually is, what comes on certain dishes, etc. A hot mess. It's a one-page menu, and the chef is doing a great job - you don't stick priceless artwork in a $2 frame, so don't leave your awesome culinary creations to be described, sold, and delivered by a train-wreck style unprepared server. Get some excited, energetic, hard-working, knowledgeable staff in here. People will probably stick around longer, drink a little more, and tip a little better - everyone wins. 

Overall, I like Verde.  The atmosphere is cool, the neighborhood is fun, and the food is great. I'm really hoping after another few visits I can write a 4 or 5-star review.
