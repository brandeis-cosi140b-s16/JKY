Nothing strikingly good or bad about this Tex-Mex place

Service is very slow - took us 1.5 hours to get our meal

We had the house pasta - "Was OK, not outstanding, not as good as an Italian restaurant"
Trout salad "tasty"
Stuffed pork loin "average, not alot of flavor and a small expensive meal"
Corn bread was great although not alot was brought out for us to try - but comes with the meal.

Mixed drinks were good

Overall and OK place and might be worth trying again, but only after trying some of the other places around

Expensive for what you get

Nice surroundings
