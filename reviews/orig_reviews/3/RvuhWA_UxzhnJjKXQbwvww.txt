3.5 stars.

Weary from a busy conference, I suggested dinner at Diego to my companions, looking forward to margaritas and spicy cuisine. Based on the fierce, sexy campaign for patronage that was splashed throughout the MGM Grand, Diego was clearly looking to entice a sensual crowd into its space, so I was also hoping for a bit of eye candy. But as the walls throbbed with bass and the red interior lighting cast a hellish glow on our faces, I was tempted to order room service, until the appeal of tacos and ceviche anchored my feet to the tiled floor. We collectively sighed as we sank into plush chairs in the middle of the restaurant, only to be startled by the arrival of our bubbly server, whose desire to identify fun drinks pricked our nerves. Clearly, we had all transformed into grimalkins at this point.

Declining the fresh guacamole that is prepared tableside, we ordered a variety of tacos, including shrimp, beef, and chicken. Each plate came out artfully arranged, four small square plates holding meat, condiments, seasoned beans, and veggies. Layering the juicy meat with beans, crema, tomatoes, cilantro, and cheese, I found myself seeking more spice, but was grateful that I had not ordered the shrimp, which were small and seemed to be overcooked. The meat was tender and I enjoyed the tacos, but not enough to remember them several months from now. Surprisingly, the portions were nicely sized, and as we drained our glasses, we agreed that Diego had served a delicately seasoned, nourishing meal. Alas, there were not sparks or lightning bolts.
