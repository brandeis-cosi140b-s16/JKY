best value inside the MGM... server knows menu and its ingredients extremely well... don't wear blue-blockers, it's ALL RED inside.

Our first foray at the strip was the dining row at MGM Grand. Wolfgang Puck may have his name on a placard in this place, but I think the odds would be highly in my favor for a bet that the Puckster isn't on the premises. I've already seen what happens without the man in the middle; think Oba-Chine. No place that allows smoking should be allowed to simultaneously serve food.

Thankfully the farthest restaurant from the smoke and casino has the best value. Just don't wear your blue-blockers: this place is all decked out in RED and PINK.

Big portions, so no need to order multiple courses; good too, 'cause these prices add up fast. Ours was the black bean soup and seafood cocktail, prepared table side. Main course was carne asada with beans and crispy fresh veggie salad (called Diego salad).

The salsas are the key to this place. Made fresh fresh fresh, and it has to be made just a few minutes ago, or the lime juice would start to cook those tomatoes into sour squishies.

Service was prompt and orderly. Great stop!
