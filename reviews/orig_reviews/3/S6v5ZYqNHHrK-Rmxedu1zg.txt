A couple girlfriends and I stopped here for a quick nosh and to kill some time because we were an hour early for the drag show down the road at The Rock.  Once we walked up and saw the sign for the "Best Carne Asada" we obviously all decided to get something with Carne Asada in it, you can't see a sign like that and get the Chorizo!

Two of us ordered the quesadilla and one ordered the breakfast burrito.  We were told it would be about 30-40 minutes because they had lost a cook for the night.  Ummmm, okay, I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but this place was not packed by any means and let's be honest, you throw some stuff in a tortilla and put it on the grill for a couple minutes.  I don't understand how that equates to a 40 minute way.  We had plenty of time though so we decided to wait.

Our food came out and the general consensus was that we were underwhelmed.  The food wasn't bad but it was THE BEST CARNE ASADA EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!!!  The two of us who ordered the quesadillas were kind of thrown off by there being lettuce in it, never experienced that before but okay.  And the breakfast burrito was soggy.

Would we go back?  Meh, maybe if there was nothing else open and we had an hour to kill again but we won't be going out of our way to make it in.
