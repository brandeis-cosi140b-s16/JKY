So after THREE freakin times trying here, we finally on the 4th time just said lets do it. We came at 0330 one time.. Line out the door. We came at 1100 on a Sunday morning, line out the door. We came a 3rd time... Guess where the line was... Yup. 
This 4th time we were like dude, I hate lines and am so starving but omg this place must be amazing if it's getting this kinda business, right? Right. 
I can't promise you'll love it. So I can't promise it's worth the wait of the long lines. It's definitely authentic. The cooks/preparers are very kind and efficient. Friendly. Nobody starting sh*t or acting crazy. Living in El Paso, I CAN say I've had better... However I CANNOT say I've had better in Las Vegas. Cheap, on the strip, good "drunk food". 
Tacos (for a dude my size) are smaller so order a few. My Japanese wife, who barely clocks in at 100lbs, ate 4. It was tough of course but she still finished all 4. So you see what I mean... Big dude with big appetite? Get about 6... Not kidding. Everyone seemed to love it. Didn't see any sour faves or disappointed kids etc... I mean it is what it is. Locally it's obviously the dope biz... I guess I'm immune to it because of where I live, which is basically Ciudad Juarez lol...of course it's El Paso Texas, but you wouldn't know that from the license plates you see. But I'm cool with it, border towns got the bomb food! 
Go to Tacos El Gordo... Get a few, try it out. Won't break the bank. Worth it. I say 3 stars, but Let the long lines and overall rating on yelp guide you.
