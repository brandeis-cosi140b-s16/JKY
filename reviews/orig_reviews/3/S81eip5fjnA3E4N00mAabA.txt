unimpressive. 


cochinita torta, bland meat, onions weren't fully "ready"  needed to marinate in flavor for longer. 

small portion of guacamole for 12$+ albeit very tasty.


plusses are that we had good service by the busboy. decent service by server, and food arrived on time.

minuses were the price.  Food super overpriced, like absurd prices.     12 bucks for a dessert, 12 bucks for guacamole, 7 bucks to add chicken on your salad that already costs 12$!  Main course was adequate in flavor.
do not go here if you are expecting a romantic dinner eachother, you can barely hear anything its so loud.
