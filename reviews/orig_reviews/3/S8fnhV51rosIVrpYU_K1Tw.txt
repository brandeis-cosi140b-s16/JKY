Ate here this past Sunday night. The best I can categorize it was strange.  The atmosphere is very casual - felt more like a cafeteria than a fine dining experience. Long tables with backless chairs, Mexican pottery and artwork on the walls. No bar to wait for your table so we went to another restaurant's bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The menu is not Chinese-Mexican fusion it's basically half Chinese and half Mexican and all small servings (like tapas). Our group of 4 started with guacamole which was the most expensive item on the menu. It was truly delicious and was served with homemade tortillas which brought me back to Mexico in one bite.  We ordered chips and salsa as well which were very good. On the Chinese side we went with Traditional sui mai, Lamb pot stickers, And 2 noodle dishes. Everything was good but not outrageous. Plus I'm accustomed to dipping sauces with Sui Mai and pot stickers that are usually seasoned with garlic, ginger and a touch spicy. The sauces here seemed just to be soy sauce. We finished off with a few more Mexican choices - Shrimp mojo, scallop ceviche and barbeque beef tacos. All were very good but again not amazing. Also the offerings at the bar are very limited unless you're drinking tequila which I wasn't because I had to start drinking at the bar next door so I started with Sky raspberry vodka which I couldn't get at China Poblano. Plain vodka only here. Also only Chinese or Mexican beer. I probably wouldn't return unless I happened to be in the Cosmopolitan and was really hungry.
