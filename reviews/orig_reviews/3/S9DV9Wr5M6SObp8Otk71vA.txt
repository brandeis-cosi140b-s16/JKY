Interesting concept of bringing Chinese and Mexican food together.  Upon greeting us the waitress explained the menu and suggested per person you order a couple of items because the portions are small.  At least she was honest!  The standout items to me were the twenty vegetable fried rice and the Rou Jia Mo street taco.  I had a few other items as there were six of us so we ordered and shared a few dishes.   It's not that I didn't enjoy eating here but I think this restaurant falls into the category of why I avoid eating on the Strip which is it's extremely overpriced for what you get.
