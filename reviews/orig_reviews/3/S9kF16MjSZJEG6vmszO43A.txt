Interesting concept. 

Chino Bandido serves up combinations that allow you to mix and match various flavors, wrappings, and sides in a fast food Asian Fusion fashion.

I've been here a few times, and while the food is consistent, it's consistent in the fast-food Asian/Mexican way, like a step up from Panda Express or Filibertos.

I've ordered a few items, my thoughts as follows:

Chinese bbq pork: It wasn't the bright red color I'm used to seeing in typical Chinese bbq style pork, but the pork was tender, and had decent flavor.

Jerk fried rice: Has hints of the "jerk" spice seasoning mixed with bits of chicken and veggies. Mildly spicy.

Hengrenade burrito: This burrito was around $3, which is quite cheap. However, it is tiny! It was basically the size of the palm of my hand. The hengrenade chicken itself had a great kick from the spicy sauce, and had a piquant bold flavor.

Emerald chicken: My favorite entree so far, with tender white meat chicken blanketed with a bright green scallion-ginger sauce. It's somewhat reminiscent of Hainanese chicken.

Pollo Diablo: Deep fried chicken coated with a vinegary sauce with peppers. Although this is touted as a super spicy dish, it was more like a mild-medium level to me.

I've eaten in and takee outee'd, and I've always encountered fast and friendly service. 

Overall, good for a fast food fusion fix.
