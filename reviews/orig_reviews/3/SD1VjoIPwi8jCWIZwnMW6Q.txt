I went to this spot last weekend. The service was good, it wasn't too busy but they mentioned they had to turn away people the night before because it's starting to get pretty popular. The design of the restaurant is amazing, my hat goes off to who ever was in charge of the decor and overall ambience. The food was really good, only thing is I requested avocados or guac with no onion with my meal (or even as a side) because I HATE onions, and neither option was available. Not clear on that one. They said they don't even have avocados which means the guac is likely made somewhere else or bought pre-made or made there and they had no left over ingredients. I would love if they would make side table guac an option on the menu. It's always great to watch your guac made fresh at your table and brings me back to mexican restaurants. I like knowing the food is fresh and made fresh. The other let down was their lack of margaritas. I mean you're a mexican restaurant, break out the tequila will you? Our waiter also checked on us way too much. It was starting to get annoying if I'm being honest. Now on to the important stuff, the food. I ordered the chicken tacos and they come on this cutting board thing with all of the toppings to dress them yourself. I love that, super cute and fun. They were also pretty yummy. The portions were good and the bill was only $60 for three people. Two of us got this fancy watermelon sangria which was good but I would prefer to have had a fresh made margarita. I'm giving this place three stars because they have a few kinks to work out. They only had one desert option, bread pudding, meh. They said they will be adding more to the menu soon. I'm also used to really fresh authentic mexican food so I have high standards when I dine for Mexican food or even modern mexican style cuisine. This place is great, I do recommend it and I will go back....I'll update my review next time if anything changes.
