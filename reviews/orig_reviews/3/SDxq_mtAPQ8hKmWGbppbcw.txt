came here because Holstein's was too long of a wait.

very expensive for what it was.  lunch for 3 was over $100.  $5 for a two bite taco isn't all that its cracked up to be.  tasty?  yes.  filling? no.  the dim sum was pretty good as well.  just a weird fusion approach, imo.

service was great though.  the waiter knew everything about each dish.  

would i eat here again?  probably not.  go to the place next door.
