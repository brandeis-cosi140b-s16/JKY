Great service! Great environment!  Nice HD TVs, cool bartenders. . . Incredibly overpriced. Food is great but holy shit, it's Mexican food, $18.95 for a Carne asada quesadilla, $7.50 for Negra Modelo draft. . . Am I on the strip or something? Even though food and service were great,  never coming back here.
