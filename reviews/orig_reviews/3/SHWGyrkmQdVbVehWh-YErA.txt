My sister and I were out and about and I have been starving. I was ready to pass out, good thing they gave us chips and salsa. I was not hungry for Mexican food since I wasn't feeling well anyway. I just wanted some fries. We ordered quesadillas al cangrejo, asada y enchilada and torta de carnitas.

Chips & Salsa:
The chips were warm, thin and crispy. They were awesome. We had 2 dipping sauces: one spicy, one medium spicy. 4/5

Quesadillas al Cangrejo:
3 quesadillas stuffed with lump crab, goat cheese and topped with mango ginger salsa. This was a nightmare on a plate for me since I'm allergic to shellfish and I'm lactose intolerant. Since I was already sick, I had a small bite anyway. The quesadilla itself was nice, soft and fluffy. The goat cheese and mango add tartness to the crab. I wouldn't worry about this dish since they were pulling it off the menu that day. 2/5

Asada y Enchilada:
Grilled skirt steak with marinated onions, rice topped with tomatillo sauce. This is something I would somewhat enjoy if I wasn't sick. The steak was pretty tender and flavorful but it's not one of the best asadas I've ever had. 3/5

Torta de Carnitas:
Griddle-baked sandwich with slow-roasted pork, apricot spread and chipotle aioli. It comes with a side of fries. Yay, something I could eat! The slow-roasted pork was juicy and very mildly flavored. The apricot spread and chipotle aioli turned me off. I took 1-2 bites and ate some of the fries. 2/5

If you want Gringo Mexican food, this place might work for you. I've had better food and paid less money somewhere else.
