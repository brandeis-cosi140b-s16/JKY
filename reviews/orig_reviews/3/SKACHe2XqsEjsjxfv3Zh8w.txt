I ate here the other night with my boyfriend and a friend. We were planning on visiting anyway, but we got a coupon for a free appetizer and that pretty much cinched it.

We went during happy hour so we all indulged in the $3 margaritas. I got the watermelon (on the rocks), which I loved. My boyfriend got the house maragrita (on the rocks), which he wasn't crazy about it, and my friend got the peach (blended) which really wasn't all that great.

We got the nachos, which were about $7. I was surprised to see that it was just chips and cheese with some salsa and jalapenos on the side. They do have a salsa bar with different kinds of salsa and also lettuce and cabbage, but when I think nachos I also think sour cream and at least some kind of beans or ground beef of it. Not to say it wasn't tasty, just not really what I was expecting.

For dinner I got a combo of a cheese enchilada and a steak taco with rice and beans on the side. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the enchilada, but everything else was tasty.

For dessert we got sopapillas. These were tasty (how can you go wrong with fried dough?), but had a little too much cinnamon (this is coming from a girl who *likes* her cinnamon). They were also served with warm honey, which was good. My friend and boyfriend were only so-so about the sopapillas.

It was a pretty good eat, although I don't know if I'd become a regular.
