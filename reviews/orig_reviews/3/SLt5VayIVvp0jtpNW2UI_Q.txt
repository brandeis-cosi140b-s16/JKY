Oh, San Felipe's you sure did luck out by being right next to the stage at Tempe Marketplace.

Showed up at 7 on a Sat. Yep, I just missed their happy hour. They weren't very crowded.

Short line at the door for checking ID's. Have to wear a bracelet for 21+.

"Wait to be seated". So we wait, & then wait some more. The 2 girls lackadaisically wiping down menus don't say anything. We finally ask about the lack of a server & they finally want to put our name on a list. Gee thanks!

We sit at the bar & order drinks. Bam! The table we wanted on the patio is available. Yay!

We sit & wait. Wait. Wait. Server! Oh, this is the same girl who served us last time we were here.

Ok, basically you do a lot of waiting at this place. *sigh* Pathetic. It took FOREVER for my quesadilla to come. $4.95 for a small. Add $2 for chicken or steak & $3 for shrimp. It was decent. They didn't skimp on the chicken at least.

The heaters came on a little too soon. Got a little warm. Temp dropped & it became perfect. Heaters go off & stay off. Umm OK :(

There was no guy holding the men's restroom door open this time. I was so relieved, you have no idea.

So, why 3 stars this time? Free chips & bomb ass salsa. It's chunky & perfectly spicy with black eyed peas & corn. I want some in a bottle for my house please!
