This place had consistenly good food...however, today we had a waitress that seemed to have other things on her mind. She took my water to refill it and never came back with it. Never offered us dessert and was just generally a little scattered. We had two of the fishes if the day and they were good...a couple apps and they were good. Definitely worth coming back.
