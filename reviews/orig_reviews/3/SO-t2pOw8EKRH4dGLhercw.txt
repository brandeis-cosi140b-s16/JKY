If Yelp had .5 stars this would be a 3.5 out of 5.

Food we ate:

Gan Pung Ji Chicken Wings - Salty but had flavor

Dan Dan Mian - Noodles were good and flavorful but again was really salty.

While we ordered two light dishes they both were on the saltier side. While there is high potential for this place I do wish they redo this menu and make it more on the creative side as the concept is an interesting concept but the results are somewhat bland...
