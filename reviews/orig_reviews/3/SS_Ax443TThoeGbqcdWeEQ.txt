Salsa and chips were really good, salsa has just enough kick. We got the bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os to start and they were great. Service was pretty good, they forgot our silverware and napkins until our food came and I got up and asked for some. 

I got the "paco taco" which is brisket and was ok. The other taco was the Al Pastor. The pork was so salty I couldn't eat it. I told the waiter and he said he would let the chef know and left it at that. 

I prefer Cantina 1511 and Cabo's tacos to Pacos.
