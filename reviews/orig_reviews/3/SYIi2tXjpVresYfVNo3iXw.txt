The boyfriend and I had been meaning to try this place for awhile, having had a friend recommend it.

He had the supreme nachos, which he found unimpressive.  Not bad, just not very good.  I had a build-your-own with corn tortilla chips, the 3-cheese Mexican blend, carne asada, and guac.  I like pretty basic nachos, so getting these without all the extra crap was really good for me, and I really enjoy guac, so I was happy they didn't skimp on that.

Our server Megan alerted us to a $3 margarita special they had going on, we had a few of those and they were very good for that price point- I find a lot of margaritas overdo it on the sweet and sour mix, not the case here.  We stuck with the special, but they have an extensive tequila selection here for fans of that.

Yummy margaritas + decent nachos = I'll be back during some sports games.  Not the best choice for a regular meal, but good for a sports bar.
