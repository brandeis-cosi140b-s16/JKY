We've been going to Braddah's on Rainbow Blvd. forever and enjoy the food there. The problem I have is that the serving portions keep shrinking each time we go there. We used to order the bowls but the container has gotten so small that we now order the burritos. They have even been holding back on how much salsas they put on the burritos! And $2.35 for the canned Hawaiian fruit drinks is downright ridiculous! I'm rating Braddah's four stars on the food but giving them three stars on the service and food portions. Step back up, Braddah's! You used to be so awesome before you started branching out and opening new locations!
