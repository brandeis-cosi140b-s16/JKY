Delicious thin flour tortilla. Carne asada can be more marinated. Green chili pork chunks were tender. Pretty tasty, but not overwhelming.

My friend the veggie quesadilla was better than most and lemonada was good .

Tamarino and jaimica beverage was interesting... Sweet/sour. 

Staff was very friendly. Gave us complementary chips and salsa.
