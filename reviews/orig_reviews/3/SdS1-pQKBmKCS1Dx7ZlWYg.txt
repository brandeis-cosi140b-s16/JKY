Modern Mexican style spot: Friday happy hour time...If you order tacos on the patio be prepared to be attacked by flies.

The weather is perfect so we decide to be seated outside.  We start with a margarita pitcher and guacamole which the highlight of it all was the 2 table sauces.  Thank goodness for the spicy green & red sauces to dress everything up.

We get a tray of tacos: 2 fish, carne asada, veggie, shrimp, and pork.  It looks great once it arrives but 7 FLIES start aggressively bombarding us.  Thankfully the busboys must know about this and we put our tacos on our plate and they whisk the wooden & metal tray.  I cannot stand eating something a fly has landed on so I was waving my hand over my 3 tacos and shoveled them in as fast as possible.  As for the taste- the tortilla is homemade but very thick.  The carne asada was my favorite- love the marinaded flavor.  My veggie taco was lacking punch.  Fish tacos were very yummy.  My companion has the pork and shrimp which he seemed to enjoy.

We ended with the lime tart at the recommendation of our sweet & server.  It was absolutely delicious with a nice serving of real whipped cream.  No flies at this time!
