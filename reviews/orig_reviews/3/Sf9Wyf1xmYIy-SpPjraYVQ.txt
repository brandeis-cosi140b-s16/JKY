While waiting for our flight my husband and I ordered the chips and guacamole. My husband asked for a Hendricks martini because he has had them here before while waiting for a business flight, but was told they do not have Hendricks. I ordered the rojo sangria which was very good.  The guacamole could have been seasoned better, in the sense that there was none. Our server was very attentive and pleasant.. 
Would I come back? Possibly, as there aren't many options for drinks and food in that area.
