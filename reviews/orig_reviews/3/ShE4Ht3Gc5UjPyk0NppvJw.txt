My lover boy and I finally made a visit to this location as it is only a couple of blocks from our home. I really liked how bright and clean this new location is in comparison to their location on Decatur which is not so appealing.

We ordered a carne asada burrito, carne asada torta, shredded beef hard shell taco and a shredded beef soft taco.

The carne asada burrito was fat as F**k and that was without the beans I asked them to leave out. The carne asada torta was mad big and loaded with guacamole which is the real avocado deal!

They have the salsa bar which has a really hot green and red sauce which is NOT for whimps!

The prices are good for the quality and quantity of what you get. What I was totally stoked about is that I could have all of the refills I wanted of Pina!!!! Mmmmm yummy I was doing the happy dance when I looked over and saw the fountain soda machines and the Jamaica and Pina machines!

We really enjoyed the food as it was reasonable and very tasty as well as generous in portion as I had to take half of my burrito home it was big.

We will be back for sure as we have no complaints what so ever, just wish we had been coming sooner since we live so close.


I like a little dirty flirty.
