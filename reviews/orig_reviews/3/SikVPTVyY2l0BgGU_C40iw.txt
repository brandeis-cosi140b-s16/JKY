I visited this location with a friend a few weeks ago. The food is great but the service is HORRIBLE. After being sat down no one looked at or even acknowledged us for over ten minutes. We were not even offered drinks, which was extra bad in our case because we just got super stoned. People who entered the resteraunt after us had drinks and their orders taken before us. Maybe we werent brown enough. After getting our food, our server never came back to refill drinks or make sure we were ok. A server from a different table eventually brought us water but never asked if I wanted a refill on my soda. Needless to say our server got a very very small tip. Again, the food is good and worth checking out but the service is REALLY REALLY bad.
