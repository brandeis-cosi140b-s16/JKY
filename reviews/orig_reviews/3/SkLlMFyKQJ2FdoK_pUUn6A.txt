Stopped by about 10pm on Saturday to grab a late dinner before heading out for the evening. We were greeted and seated quickly, but the service kind of went down hill from there. Our waitress didn't even  bother to make eye contact as she slid our chips and salsa onto the table and kept walking. She came back and took our drink orders, still not even a "hello" or "how's it going?".
Anyhow, we place our drink/food orders and enjoyed the very tasty chips and salsa. I ordered the Tacos Al Carbon, the chicken was very flavorful, the steak, not so much. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their plates. I had a margarita on the rocks ($9.51) yet couldn't even taste the tequila...bummer. The rest of my party had only ordered sodas/water, none of them were offered refills. 

Overall, the food was good. The margarita was disappointing and the service left something to be desired. This place serves the purpose of filling you up with some decent food at a reasonable price, but other than that, don't get your hopes up.
