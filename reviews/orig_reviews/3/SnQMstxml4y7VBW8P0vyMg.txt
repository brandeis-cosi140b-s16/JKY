We finally visited the new restaurant 3 1/2 years after the Richardson's fire. It is quite amazing how similar the new Richardson's looks and feels like the former landmark restaurant. Their service is great. We ordered a pizza and salad. I should have known better to order a pizza from a New Mexico style restaurant... roasted tomato sauce with New Mexico sausage and mozzarella. It brought back memories of conversations with my Papa debating whether Prego or Ragu was the better canned tomato sauce.
