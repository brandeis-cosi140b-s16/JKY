This is not only in my hood, it's basically in my backyard - so I was excited to try the newest spot when a Sunday night taco craving hit.  Unfortunately, they were out of short rib tacos and all tacos for that matter.  Ok, not a total deal breaker - we just opted to split a burger and fries with grilled jalapenos and a dulce de leche shake, but they were out of that too.  I appreciate that they seem to make everything "fresh" and with this comes the tendency to run out of things so I guess I can't really fault them on that - It was 30 min before closing on a Sunday night after all, I was just disappointed that I didn't get to try what I had craved in the first place.  The burger was fresh, could have used a touch more salt in my opinion (which is easily remedied at home) and the fries were also fresh and tasty.  My bf also really enjoyed the chocolate shake.  I like the convenience of the drive thru, but the burgers are not a bargain by the time you add extras such as cheese or the grilled jalies, you could easily wind up in the $8 range which in this neighborhood is just not that far off of other famous offerings (Delux, Grind, you know the types!).  I am definitely going to try it again to sample the taco offerings and will update my review but for now, a solid 3 stars.
