This place is great.  We use to live in the neighborhood near this place and the food is great.  My friend Alexander C., described the restaurant and its interior perfectly.  Dimly lit and cozy.  The food is like a good home cooked meal.  
There are numerous choices on the menu at a decent price. The service is good and the owner wants you to know he expects it to be good. It may be an old restaurant but it is well maintained and clean.  It's a neighborhood eatery locals like, however, it is waiting for newcomers to discover it.
