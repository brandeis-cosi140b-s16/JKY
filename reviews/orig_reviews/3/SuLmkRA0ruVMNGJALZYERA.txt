Backyard Taco is like that 80s cult movie that everybody likes, but when you watch it, and really look at it objectively, the best part about it is the nostalgia.  It has such a cult following that it was guaranteed to be successful the day it opened its doors... And considering they used to operate an illegitimate back yard operation (hence the name), it's kind of deserved, isn't it?

First, the good things.  The facility is nice.  And their claim is that they keep the menu simple so that they only serve what they're good at.  This seems to be true about their salsa, carne asada tacos, and chicken tacos, but not their cheese quesadillas.  The quesadilla was boring and flavorless.  But the tacos had great flavor, especially the chicken one.

At some point, however, if you want to run a real top-of-the-line taco operation, you have to expand the horizons a little bit.  They don't have any of the nice juicy stuff they serve at the more legit places, like chorizo, lengua, cabeza, pastor... Are they afraid their mostly-white-Mormon clientele won't eat these? (OK, that might be a legitimate concern.)  They don't even serve carnitas.  No pescado.  No camaron.

With their limited offerings, it's hard to make an argument that they serve anything close to the best tacos in the Valley.  Atoyac is better, La Condesa is way better, Moreno's may even be better.  I'm tempted to even say Tia Rosa Tacqueria is even better as far as tacos are concerned.

This is great food if you're inviting people over to have dinner in your back yard.  But if you're running a restaurant, you have to offer more than the two most boring meat choices on Earth.
