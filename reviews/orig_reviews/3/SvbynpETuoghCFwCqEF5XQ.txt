This is the 3rd Mexican place we've been to in the valley so far. Tacos Tijuana on the east side was as authentic as could be (they had sesos, bucha, tripas, lengua, etc), cheap (just north of $20 for the three of us), and made a killer salsa. That place was a definite 5 star joint.

Habaneros Taco Grill just down the street had a wider selection, generous portions, a salsa bar with three salsas, pico, radishes, limes and the requisite pickled carrots. Nothing stood out but neither did anything suck. It was very satisfying and we left full and happy.

Roberto's pickled carrots were much better than Habaneros' but that's about it when it comes to saying the former was better than the latter. Roberto's should've been good but something was strangely lacking. There was no wow or even an oo-o. The ambiance was a bit off, too. Maybe because it was kinda cold inside or maybe it was the way-too-big cutout photo on the wall of the not-so-happy-to-be-celebrating-50-damn-years elderly Latino couple staring at you while you tried to enjoy your meal. Something just wasn't right about the place.

People kept streaming in one by one but nobody but us stayed to dine in. It was all take out. Maybe nobody wanted to stick around to actually eat there with Mr. and Mrs. Roberto staring at you without a smile on. If I had been in business for 50 years with multiple locations, I think I'd have a smile as big as a hard shell taco stuffed with all the fixings.

Back to the food. It was just ok. We went there because of the ratings, felt like we got suckered in, and had to go somewhere else to get a real fix. We don't need to go back, unless it's to steal the pickled carrots to go along something from Habaneros.
