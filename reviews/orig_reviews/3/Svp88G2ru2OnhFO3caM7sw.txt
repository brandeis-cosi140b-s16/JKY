Just came to pass the time with a drink. Nice location on the grand canal inside the Venetian, great ambience. 

The margarita, advertised as "the best in town", was definitely not, but for $5 at happy hour, was a good value. 

Chips were standard out of a bag probably, but the salsa was good with some roasted pepper in there.

UPDATE: Despite not being a featured happy hour drink, I ordered the jalapeño-infused margarita. MUCH better, the ingredients seem fresher (the Classic was too syrupy). The jalapeño-infused has fresh orange and cilantro in it for an interesting twist.
