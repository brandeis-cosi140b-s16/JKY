I like Mexican food and I like Chinese food, so why not? Interesting menu. The Jade Red Chicken is as good as any Orange or General Tso's you'll find, and I like that there is a wide variety of choices here. Good food, especially if you like spicy!

I have one beef with this restaurant, and that is the cleanliness. Walking in, you'll notice that the decor and general feel of the place is very low budget. Uncomfortable seating, very weathered ceilings, and generally messy. No big deal. But the restrooms were disgusting, the eating area was dirty, and the trash was overflowing. The place was busy, but there's no excuse for the condition of the men's restroom! It looked like something (or someone) exploded in a truck stop restroom on a state highway. I would have chalked it up to a busy night, but the door and walls were filthy (almost black) with handprints from weeks (if not months) of neglect. All but one of the trash bins were over-stuffed, and most of the tables were dirty. We didn't see anyone cleaning anything. I'm glad I didn't go into the restroom until after I ate!

If it were my business, I would put at least a few dollars toward general maintenance and upkeep. Maybe even invest in a few nicer tables & chairs. If it were close to clean, I'd give at least 4 stars.
