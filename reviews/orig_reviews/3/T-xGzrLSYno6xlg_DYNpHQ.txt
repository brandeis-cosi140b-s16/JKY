Let me preface this by saying that I moved from Austin, TX last year. As such... mexican or tex-mex restaurants are not something I am used to. Hole in the walls run by moms and pops? Yes. PLEASE. Somehow those are just vastly BETTER.

That said, El Encanto is turning out some decent food. Not great. Not bad. Just decent. The mole is probably some of the best I have tasted (what IS that flavor to it that I have never had in mole before?). The enchiladas aren't spectacular but then again... they're enchiladas. I like 'em. Pollo Fundido? I guess I'm in the minority with that one as I barely touched it. The chicken wasn't the least bit tender and chowing down on poultry a few feet away from some ducks, swans and random birds wasn't exactly a rocking experience.

Having said that, the pond and its denizens does provide for some nice atmosphere. Go at night around dinner. In the summer it cools off enough and in the winter the patio is heated. Just make sure to guard the complimentary salsa and chips off hours or you will have some competition for them.

In my visits, service has always been A+ though.

My main gripe... the margaritas. People think these are good!? For the price I'm paying I at least expect to taste SOMETHING. I've ordered them enough times now to know they're consistently weak and mostly ice. Hell to the no. Never again.

All in all El Encanto is a good enough place to go when in Cave Creek and in need of some americanized Mexican food.
