Last night was our second time eating at Baja Joe's in the last 3 months.  We bought a couple of AmazonLocal deals back in Nov/Dec.

Both times were nice experiences but only one item may bring us back in the future (the guac).  It wasn't crowded last night or the Saturday night we went to back in January.  However, there was a steady flow of people.  We ate in the restaurant portion both times, but the Catina had happy hour last night, which had a good number of people but still room for more.

Our family favorite item was the table-side guacamole.  In our opinion, Baja Joe's beats every other Mexican food place we have been to in the east valley.  The price is good too for the size...definitely a 2 person or more size.

Margarita's were good, but a lot of ice (even in the pitcher version we ordered last night).  

The cheese on the deluxe nachos as very mild and turned the dish into soup.  We had the nachos with shredded beef, which was very sparse.  I hate sour cream, and asked if it came with sour cream on it (the menu was silent on it), and the waitress said it didn't have SC.  I asked her to be sure, and to even make a note to put it on the side if it did......sure enough, it came to the table (delivered by a runner and not our waitress) with a blob of sour cream on top....  

On our previous visit, my wife and daughter had some of their shrimp cocktails and some other shrimp dishes. They both thought they were good, but last night no one opted for any seafood.

Their regular salsa tasted very good and fresh both times.  I asked for a hotter salsa, and they brought a condiment bottle of homemade salsa that was supposed to be hotter...to me, it just tasted saltier so I stayed with the regular salsa, which was quite good.

Portion sizes of the food were a good size and I we were all still full the next morning...

Our wait staff were good both times and were great about offering suggestions about their favorite items or recommended items on the menu.
