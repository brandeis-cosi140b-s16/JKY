Good solid Mexican food, very similar to the style in Texas.  A tad bland for my family but we are more used to California/Baja style.  A nice surprise to find this good of Mexican in NC, good atmosphere and price is right as well.  Had "Super Nachos", also tried "chile rellanos", "tamales" and "enchiladas".  Overall a good dining experience.
