Pros:
the tacos!
plenty of parking (maybe this is not a big deal for locals, but as an out of towner - always appreciate easy parking)

free chips and salsa.  Feel like this is a dying tradition.

Mixed:
Frescas - Cumber Mint is delicious and refreshing. But I got their special, which was Mango, tasted like a weird watered down Mango Lassi.  He actually recommended it and when he asked me if I liked it, and I said, "my friend's cucumber mint is better" (as my passive aggressive way to change drinks) he sadly didn't bite.

TIP: ask them to go light on the ice. Half the glass was ice, it was a bit much.

meh:
Cheese Y Mas - appetizer, on paper sounds great - but once ordered, was a bit disappointed.  I think I was hoping for something more like how adult mac 'n cheese when done righ can make me gladly fork over $14 for mac 'n cheese, or what restaurants have done to burgers to make them fancy. I was expecting a queso twist, but just got Velveeta. 
 
service - started off attentive and friendly, and than ignored at the end, was so thirsty had to ask to drink some of my friend's water.

Even though I'm giving it a 3 - I'd still come back.
