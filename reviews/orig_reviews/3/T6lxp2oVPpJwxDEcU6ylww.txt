I went here with some coworkers for lunch.  It was my choice and they ended up a little annoyed with me since the service was very slow and the food was not cheap.  So, not the best option for a work day lunch but I would consider coming here again in the evening.  I'd enjoy some of their yummy tacos with a beer on the patio if the sun was already down (there is no shade). Or else something from the dinner menu with a glass of wine in the swanky bistro.  I'll give them another shot but they are definitely on my coworker's "no" list.
