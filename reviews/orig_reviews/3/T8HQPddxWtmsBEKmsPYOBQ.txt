We chose this restaurant for lunch randomly. When you walk in, you think it's chinese food, but then when we looked at the menu, it was more like mexican food. We ordered chips & salsa to start off. The salsa is good. Not amazing but it's good. They give you a huge wire bucket thing of chips and a spoonful of salsa in a mini bowl. We had to ask for more salsa 5890325783 times. Good service though. All employees were very friendly. We ending up deciding on just getting their small tacos. Husband ordered carnitas tacos 3 of them and loved them. They were pretty small and $5.50 each. Yikes.  I ordered 2 Viva China tacos which were beef, oysters, scallions. They were pretty good, but if you are picky about textures of food, these tacos were kind of "slimy".
