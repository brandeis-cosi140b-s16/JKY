I went there last night. Great menu with a wide selection of tacos and some great appetizers. Try the shrimp ceviche and the corn salad. Only knock was the slow service. To make matters worse, the manager wasn't helping his staff at all. At one point he stood next to our table full of dishes and a check that was ready to be picked up and instead chatted with his college buddies about nightlife.
