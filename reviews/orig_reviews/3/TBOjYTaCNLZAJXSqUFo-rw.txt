Took advantage of the lunch special. Ordered caesar salad and steak and chicken fajitas, and tortilla soup and carnitas.

Salsa and chips were far better than I expected. Both the soup and salad were quite good. The chicken fajitas and the carnitas were very bland, but nothing a little salsa couldn't fix. Tthe steak fajitas were delicious.

Service was good.
