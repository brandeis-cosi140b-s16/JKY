Beans and rice could be their own food group for me I love them so. I came with a big group, but it seems like my experience echoed many of previous reviewers. The food was pretty banging. The service not so much. Sorry dude, you did you best but who assigns one waiter to a group of 15 or so when the restaurant isn't even 1/3 full? We ran the poor guy ragged. All the food I tasted was pretty dang good but without the service matching up it is a tough sell. I will return maybe on a Wed. for their 3,2,1 specials for margaritas and chicken tacos. 

Highlights: the drinks claim to be made for local ingredients and herbs. Well, these may be some of the best in Charlotte. I tried the signature margarita and the Texas mule. I could come here just to sit at the bar and bunch on their well-balanced salsa.

My tacos were filling and chock full of flavor. Lots of unique combination and gluten-free/veggie options. You can get any taco as a lettuce wrap.

Lowlights: Limited parking, their neighbors tow so try for their lot or street parking and the service.
