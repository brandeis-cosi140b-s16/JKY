My friend and I rolled in here around 9:00pm on a Saturday night and we were seated right away.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria ($23.00) and that is the reason that this places gets three stars instead of two.  The chips and salsa came out and those were good.

I ordered the "Delgado Chicken" and my friend ordered the Steak Quesadilla.  The food came out rather quickly.  My dish was nothing special...just a chicken breast covered with some cheese but the rice was terrible.  It was all dry and crunchy...YUCK!  The quesadilla wasn't very big but my friend didn't finish it...I don't think he liked it.  But the Sangria was great and I was drunk as a skunk by the time we left...but still not drunk enough to remember that the food wasn't very good.

I'd go back for the drinks but not for the food.
