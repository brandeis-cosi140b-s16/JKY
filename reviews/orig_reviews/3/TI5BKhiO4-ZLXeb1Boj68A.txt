This is tex mex at its finest. I'm only giving it three stars because I'm not a huge Tex mex fan. 

Chips are delish! Thin and crispy. Salsa is more like pico de gallo. 

We got queso as a app. Spicy but warm and flavorful. 

I got the #6 combo and it had great presentation and was a lot of food. Only bad thing, I think my enchilada drowned in the rustic red ranchero sauce. 

My friend ordered the veggie enchiladas. Not a beautiful dish, she said it was good but that she expected better. 

Our server was super friendly and great with suggestions and explaining the concept of restaurant to us.

Won't suggest this place next time it's my choice but will be fine if it's someone else's choice 

Love the decor!
