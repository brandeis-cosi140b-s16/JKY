This place is filling, tasty and pretty cheap. The service is always super friendly & the drinks are OK. The chips and salsa are kind of dangerous - I always end up snacking on them when I don't want to fill up before my meal!

Anyway, recommended for the kind of thing it is, which isn't really my kind of thing, which is why I only gave it 3 stars. Good, hearty mexican.
