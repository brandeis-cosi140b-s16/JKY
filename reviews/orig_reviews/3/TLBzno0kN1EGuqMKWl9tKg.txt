I heard a lot of good things about this place and was looking forward to some great food.  I was not impressed, but for a hotel lobby restaurant it is good.

The margaritas were just average.  The beer selection was limited and there was not a good Mexican beer selection.  

I tried a selection of the tacos; beef, fish and shrimp.  They were overloaded.  I am not a fan this, the filling either bursts the tortilla or it falls out all over the plate.  The beef was a bit chewy and along with the fish was a bit bland.  The shrimp taco was pretty good. I split a beef torta; it was pretty good.  It had a nice balance of filling and bread, but not much flavor.  There was a queso dish my wife ordered... I tried it, but I can't speak intelligently about it because I was a few drinks into the evening.  I remember it was OK.

I am not sure it was hotel or the restaurant, but they have a free Flamenco dance show on Wednesday nights.  The show we saw was pretty amazing.  It fills up fast.

I would not go out of my way to eat here, but If I were staying at the Clarendon, I would eat here.
