So here is the deal, 

I get that this is supposed to be like being at Manny's in Rocky Point, the ocean on one side, drunken slutty girls on the dance floor, and more booze than you know what to do with. But the thing is if I were at Manny's, I'd be wearing a bikini, some denim shorts and flip flops. Totally comfy and cool for a night of humidity, wind, sand, tequila, lots of sweating and bad decisions. 

Ok now I'm wishing I was five years younger and I could actually BE at Manny's right now. 

I digress, this environment just isn't conducive to a normal prissy girl's get up. I know I'm not the only one fighting the granules of sand in my heels, because that seems like it is the only thing my girlfriends and I talk about all night. "Ouch, I can't get this damn sand out" "Well take your shoes off" Shoes taken off, shaken, and placed back on. "Damn it! More sand!" ...yea. It's a vicious cycle. 

So, really cute guy with the GORGEOUS blue eyes, I really was interested in what you were saying...I just had little tiny pebbles cutting into my skin the entire time you were talking to me. Maybe next time you'll still think I'm cute in flip flops? Here is to hoping...

+1 star for the street taco stand. Saves whomever is my DD a stop at Jack in the Box on the way home.
