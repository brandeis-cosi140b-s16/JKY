So I ordered the The Burrito Carnitas Especial.  And I won't lie, it was tasty.  Comes with a dollop of sour cream in the middle, with two slices of avocado on top of a burrito that is semi-glazed with some cheese sauce.

The atmosphere is nice, and so is the server, but when you had to wait about 20+ minutes for Mexican food off-Strip on a Monday night, it's either amazing, or there's something a bit wrong.

I'm actually shifting towards the latter.  The atmosphere is a great place, and perhaps they justify the cost due to it being in Downtown Summerlin.   But, there just wasn't anything enlightening about it.  Maybe it's just me.

The burrito I ordered cost about $19.  Honestly, it's probably worth about $12.  Unless the ingredients were all fresh, farm raised, organic and all that, I just don't see it.  Maybe they do... Trader Joe's is right across from there.  Somehow, I doubt it though.

Vegas isn't SoCal, and this wasn't a Strip experience.  Unfortunate.
