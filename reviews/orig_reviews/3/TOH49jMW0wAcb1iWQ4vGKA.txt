Their food is so good they need metal bars to protect it. Seriously the order and pick up windows are behind bars, but it may be due to the neighborhood.

This is a place the Yelp is good for. There is no way you will find this driving by as its off the main road and has no sign on the outside. The only indication was the line of people going out the door.  

Seating is limited to some dilapidated picnic tables on the adjacent patio. 

The menu board is quite simple only listing burritos and chimi changas and tostadas, apparently there are some off menu options that are not posted.

I ordered the a bean chimi changa, It was a bean burrito deep fried and then dolloped with guacamole and sour cream there was cheese sprinkled on top of this. It was served on a small bed of shredded lettuce in a white container.

The Beans are flavorful and runny like a bean dip, the fried tortilla was great a it should be, the guacamole was a neon green fake variety and the sour cream was cold and firm . 

There were down sides, the price was a bit steep considering the location, potion size and lack of seating. They ration the hot sauce and charge $.15 for a thimble or $.50 for a small cup.  Drink are cans of soda only. And the line was long and poorly structured. this is why it only gets 3 stars, the food is good but the drawbacks hurt it. 

Also Note CASH ONLY
