Went at lunch today. Busy but not slammed. It was ok overall.  The food was hot which was nice as sometimes it can be lukewarm. The brewed tea is a plus for this location- 3 kinds of fresh brewed which is heaven for this chick!

You do get quite a bit of food, but for 2 cheese enchiladas w/ rice and beans and with sour cream and a drink it was close to 10 dollars. They charge extra for sour cream. Ok value I guess..

The one thing I noticed her though is the staff is less friendly than some other locations
