I got this recommendation from friends that live in Vegas.  They liken this place to a Chipotle and I love Chipotle so I thought I give Cafe Rio a try.

Located near UNLV and a close drive from the airport so you can hit it up on your from picking up friends from the airport as you head your way towards the Strip.  The decor is nice.  Not as modern and clean as Chipotle or Baja Fresh but this place has more of a real Mexican restaurant feel instead of a fast food chain.

I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito with some enchilada sauce on the sauce.  My friends were raving about the barbacoa but I was a underwhelmed.  Even though the meat was very tender and they packed quite a bit of meat in the burrito, the meat was WAY too sweet for my liking.  It was overwhelming and it pretty much took over all other flavors within the burrito.  My other friends had the chicken and they really enjoyed it because it was very moist.  Beside the burrito is a bed of lettuce and pico de gallo.  It is a very filling meal for being just a burrito with some veges on the side and for around $8.

The staff were cordial and efficient.  There were tables all around so you should not have problems looking for a seat.  I think this place is worth another try but with another meat.

Also remember to grab a stamp card if you are going to be a frequent visitor to Cafe Rio.
