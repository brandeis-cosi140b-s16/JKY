The price point is perfect! ~ $3 tacos depending on what kind of meat you order.

They offer all kinds of options (carne asada, brain, tongue, etc) - so you have to find the person serving the kind of meat you want and get in that particular line to place your order.  You'll have to ask which line has what because there are no signs.

.. and it's weird because even if you're first in line (and you're at the counter ready to place your order) - if someone next to you has a tray of food and is waiting to place an order, they actually get to order BEFORE YOU because Tacos El Gordo has to serve those with food on their tray first.. that's right, they get to order before you, even though you were in line first... Tsk, Tsk!

They don't have chicken (aka pollo) - so if you're not a red meat person this might not be the place for you.
