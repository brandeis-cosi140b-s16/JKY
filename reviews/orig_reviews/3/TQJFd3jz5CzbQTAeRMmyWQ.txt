I've always enjoyed Rosita's. Everything is really cheesed up, a lot of it is greasy, and the've expanded their menu within the last few years. It's almost overwhelming how many things are on there but I especially like the fajitas and of course the chips and salsa.The salsa is definitely 5 stars. I've gotten college kid servers who were cleaarly stoned, twice! My eating partner and I asked what one of their favorite things to eat was, and it was classic to see the look of delight in his red eyes, because he got to dispel his great wisdom of Rosita's fare on us. "Dude...anything with the red sauce is the best..."  I wonder if he hit the Cheeba Hut next door after a serious case of the munchies?
