The food was decent but a little pricey. We had the az burrito (a little spicy but lots of flavor), carne asada taco (pretty standard), and a fish taco (the texture wasnt what we expected....we prefer the fish tacos you get in rocky point so that might be why). Loved the chips and salsa but wish they were complimentary:) I have a hard time with places that charge for drink refills, so that's a thumbs down. Overall we might go back but this will not be a regular lunch stop for us.
