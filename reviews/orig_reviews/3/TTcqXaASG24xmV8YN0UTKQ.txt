I'm conflicted about Diablo's. The food was quite good. But the service was terrible. But they gave us free beers to make up for the terrible service. But the food wasn't spicy. They had two big-screen TV's set up on the balcony for the NBA finals. But they were LOW DEF. As a bar, I'd go with 3-4 stars. As a restaurant, 2-3 stars. Overall, I guess A-OK sums it up nicely.
