Garduno's started in Albuquerque and has had 3 locations in Las Vegas, the one at The Palms being the only decent one. They use the same basic recipes as the original ones in Nuevo Mexico and everything food wise is usuall pretty darned good. Their chips & salsa will always be my favorite and it's nice to get a green chili fix living here in Vegas. Ask for sopapillas at the end of your meal... free, puff pastry doughnut awesomeness covered with honey :)
My reasoning for 3 stars instead of more is the service is really hard to predict and so hit & miss it's ridiculous. After eating here at least a dozen times I would highly recommend going there for lunch and avoiding the absolute BS worst service ever that the night staff provides. I've complained to several managers about food & service and they don't give a shit either so if service starts going down hill just get up & leave. If the service is good you know what to do.
We will continue to go back cause my wife loves the huge chicken/mexican salad and I slurp down a ton of chips & salsa and tend to enjoy the outdoor patio by the pool with a cold beer. Give it a shot as occasionally the food & service both kick ass and that's what keeps us going back.
