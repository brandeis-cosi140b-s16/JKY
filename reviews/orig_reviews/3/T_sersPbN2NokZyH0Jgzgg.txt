Went here, not once, but TWICE, in one evening! 

Why, you ask? My friends and I were hungry and this place was cheap, and their nachos didn't mess around. 

At $16 a pop, the nachos was big enough to feed you, me, and everyone we know. The cheese could've been melted a little more, but it was still pretty good, especially when you're trashed. 

If you need more alcohol in your system, scrounge up a couple of bucks, panhandle, get your "Will dance for $" sign out, and get a $1 margarita. It's strong and sweet, and will keep your buzz going.
