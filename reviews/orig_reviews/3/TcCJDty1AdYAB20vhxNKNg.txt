Number one option in desert ridge for a casual drink.  Sandbar is a good place to go to meet people whether at night or during the day.  Sometimes you have to watch out for some lame people at night but for the most part the clientele is good.  Servers are pretty hospitable.  Though I usually do not eat the food is not bad and they have a decent taco Tuesday deal. Sit out at the patio if you can stand a little smoke.
