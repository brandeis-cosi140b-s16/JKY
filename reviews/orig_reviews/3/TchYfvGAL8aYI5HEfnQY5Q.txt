This place is definitely a cool one. It's all beach themed so there is a panorama of the beach and outdoor seating that consists of sand and a mini pool. However the mini pool is apparently used for nothing, so it's fun to guess what you can do with it. There is misters so you do stay cool. The Chandler location is beautiful, I've always liked that side of town, very green and nice!  

It consists of two very large bars with a huge variety, I can see a lot of bros and brosettes going there. 

Our waitress was very nice and helpful, she checked on us often. I ordered the cheese enchilada. It was okay, wasn't the best, but wasn't horrible. However my friend got the nachos and she just did not like them, so don't order the nachos! 

I went here because of the Groupon I received, I don't think I would go there again for food, but definitely for the drinks.
