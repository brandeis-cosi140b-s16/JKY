Usually really good when we eat it there but food quality really goes down when you call in an order to go. Thought it might have been just bad luck the first time but it has happened 3 times now. It also usually takes a really long time when you get it to go. Seems like they prioritize the orders for dining in over to go orders. Also the last time we were in there they guy taking our order wasn't very friendly.
