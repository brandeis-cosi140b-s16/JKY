Los Reyes has gotten such rave reviews, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought that the Torta Los Reyes, their signature torta, was just a glorified Denny's Grand Slamwich with hot sauce. I didn't find the meat that flavorful, nor the sauces. That said, the restaurant is surprisingly nice inside, the service is prompt and friendly, and the mango agua fresca was amazing. Maybe I'm just not the torta type, because for the most part, I'm a healthy eater and avoid beef, pork, and ham. My dad, on the other hand, loved the torta.
