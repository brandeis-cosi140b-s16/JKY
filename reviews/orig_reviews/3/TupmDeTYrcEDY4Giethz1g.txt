After seeing many great reviews on Carlitos, I tried it. Well I won't sprang my ankles trying to run back.
I was excited because they were mad busy!! So many choices, so many flavors! Wowwww!!
That's how excited I was initally...
The burrito was huge, with red tasteless sauce poured over it and all the fixings. Definitely looked inviting, but no flavor to brag about. Ground beef was completely flavorless.
Maybe I will try something else before I completely write them off my list...
