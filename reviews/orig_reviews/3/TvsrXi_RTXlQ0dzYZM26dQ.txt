This place was our first stop for our weekend vegas getaway. The ambience was good, low light, not a lot of energy so it was a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the vegas casino floor. Service was mediocre but the food was delicious. I had the combination of tacos; carne asada, chicken and carnitas. The carnitas taco was my favorite with pickled red onion, chopped orange, and the moist and tender carnitas. The chica got a trio of carne asada tacos which were delicious. The only had one corn tortilla for each taco so you weren't getting a mout full of tortilla each bit. Each plate came with rice and beans ehich weren't bad but nothing to brag about. Salsas were good and the chips were airy and not heavily drenched in oil. ***WARNING- they charge $3 for chips and salsa*** but they don't tell you when they say, "we'll be right back with your drinks, and chips and salsa". I'm not gonna cry over three bucks in Vegas but hidden charges irk me, and no it's not even on the menu. Probably won't go back as there are so many places to go in Vegas and it wasn't one of those Epic meals that you have to have again.
