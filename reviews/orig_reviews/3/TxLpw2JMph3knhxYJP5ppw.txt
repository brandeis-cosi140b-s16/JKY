I've rated higher, but today my order was boring, chipotle shrimp tacos didn't really have much spice and the tacos over stuffed with the extras fell out and made for a messy meal. ( I know tacos but could've been built better). The service was excellent no complaints there! 
Still a point of destination when in the area.
Okay, I wanted to add a note after reviewing some of the other recent ones and while we all have different taste, therefore different expectations I want to remind everyone that if there is something wrong or we don't like let Management know and give them a chance to correct. Even if the server fixes what's wrong, speak with management let them know of the problem and how it was managed even the successes help make it better. 
Anyway always remember the problem no matter how big or how small - it cannot be fixed if no one says nothing!
