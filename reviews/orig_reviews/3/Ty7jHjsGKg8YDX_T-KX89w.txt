I figured I'd just do a "world tour" of Mad Mex's in the area as of late.  So here goes another one (but pay no attention to the fact that I was JUST at another one on Sunday)...

The newest addition to the Mex clan looks...about the same as all the others.  I do love the open garage door front like the McKnight Rd has.  The bar area is also a little bigger than Greentree and McKnight, which is smart for the location.  College students = Drinking. I also was a little bummed that happy hour was from 4:30-6:30....boo! I need it til 7 pahleeze?

For the first time my friend encouraged me to go out of my comfort zone and try something new, so we got the pickadippa.  I know, not really venturing too much outside, but it was worth it!  I loved the bean dip (that they also have at sister restaurant Kaya) and really enjoyed the spicy cheese dip as well.  When you combine the cheese and reg salsa together it's like dippa magic!

I ordered one of my reg meals, the Taco Salad. Recently (well, Sunday) I had some issues with the gauc) and this time I'd say I was a little disappointed with the salad.  It had WAY too much beef in it and not enough of the good stuff (um, like healthy salad). A little bummed.

I still won't give up on you Mad Mex, I have faith....that I'll still be back to visit!
