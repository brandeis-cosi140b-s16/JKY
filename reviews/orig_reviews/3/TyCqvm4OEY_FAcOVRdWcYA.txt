Someburros isn't exactly AMAZING, but it is pretty good. I've been a few times and had a number of different things off the menu. The restaurant itself is a bit unexpected. You order your food, which always comes with chips, sit down, and they bring you your food. For some reason the place seems a little off to me, but the staff is super friendly and has always been helpful, answering questions about the menu.

As for the food, I think the carne asada burritos are their best item as is the maccaha beef. There is lots going on in them and it's pretty darn tasty. I've also had a couple of the breakfast burritos and they are good, but need a sauce or something... they are very dry. Also, they are very greasy leaving me with a bit of a stomachache after, so be prepared.

All in all for a quick bite when your in the mood for a burrito, I'd surely recommend Someburro. Don't expect to be blown away, but for the price this spot is really solid.
