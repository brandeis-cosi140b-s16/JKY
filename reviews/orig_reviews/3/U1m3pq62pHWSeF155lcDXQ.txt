Decided to give this place another chance. I love to support neighborhood establishments. 
The place was pretty crowded, which is great. There was a party on the patio and another party in bar. 

There was a little bit of a wait, and some confusion with the hostesses. They have a hostess stand with two ladies standing behind it, however there are several girls that stand to the left before you turn into the bar that you are supposed to check in with... 
We weren't the only ones that missed them. 

After being seated, our waiter asked for our drink order and was very friendly. 
We ordered our food along with chips & salsa, which still amazes me that they charge for them. Maybe a 2nd or 3rd basket.. but come on.. even Baja Fresh gives you chips why you wait... 

My husband ordered the Nacho Daddy burger which he said is probably one of best burgers he ever had.. 

I ordered a combination of the Shrimp & Fish tacos.. Highly recommend you try the fish tacos when you visit. They were pretty much everything you wish for in a taco.
Lightly grilled fish.. cooked perfectly, crunchy slaw with a flavorful sauce..  
Its served with black beans, which mine were cool.. but I understand when your busy cranking out food, some items don't always stay hot on the plate when completing the order.
