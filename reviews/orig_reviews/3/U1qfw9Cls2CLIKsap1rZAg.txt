It was my third day in Vegas (on a family vacation) and I still hadn't gotten around to having a drink. In large part cause I was trying to spend time with the parents, who are not big drinkers, and in part because I still feel a little weird going into a place and sitting down at the bar alone (especially when it's filled with old men- which seemed common).

I ended up coming into Diablo's, sitting down at the bar, and ordering a strawberry daiquiri. I was a little sad to see that it came in a plastic cup and that it wasn't as delicious as I've had before, but.... it was booze and the staff were great. I was considering ordering another, but.... I got a call and I had to leave. I left happy.
