I was looking forward to seeing what this place had to offer as I've walked by it a lot but never had a chance to try it.  The place didn't really live up to the expectations.  I had the ten treasures noodle soup which was nice to have after a night of drinking in the Vegas desert.  I also tasted the cheese fondido with chorizo but it was just an overly salty goop.  My friend ordered the Shrimp Mojo and it was adequate but nothing to write home about. The pork steamed buns were overly sweet and really on the small side. 

Probably not worth a second visit given all the choices in town.
