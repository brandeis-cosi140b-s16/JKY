Visited El Segundo Sol on a Thursday evening at 7pm after mall. Group of six.

The restaurant is walking distance from Trump, Wynn, Treasure Island, Pallazzo or Venetian. Located on the south side of the Fashion Show Mall. 1/2 inside seating 1/2 outside under cover. Fair view of the quiet portion of the strip.

The good:
1) Fresh made corn tortillas are awesome. Kinda small... but great.
2) Braised Beef tacos are excellent.
3) Grilled Chicken tacos are so-so.
4) Chips are good.
5) Salsas are very mild... if you like it that way.
6) Water for the table is served with small glasses and a large cork-top bottle. (kinda cool)
7) Coke products (I prefer Pepsi... )
8) Fresh guacamole was good. We ordered spicy.. and it wasn't.

The bad:
1) Wait staff is VERY VERY slow and forgetful.
2) Filling the chips and salsa takes too long. must asked twice to remind the staff
3) Fresh Guacamole, although good. Was a very small portion, especially for the price.
4) Food portions were very small for the price. $16.95+ for dinners, with five or six 4" tortillas and en our meat to stuff three of them.
5) Meals served with seasoned white rice and black beans. More Cuban style than Mexican.
6) Limited menu, and no side orders.

After an extended service, based on the extremely slow staff, combined with the high pricing and small portions... we'll seek out mexican food elsewhere next time. Too bad.... it's close. I'd be willing to pay a premium, if the food was great and the service was too... but it's not.
