I have gone to Steel Cactus a few times, but usually it's because something else isn't open, or my friends and I want some Mexican food. They have $1 tacos on Tuesday...I think. Super sweet deal, because I love tacos, but I'd rather go for the half off burger at Stackd.

Generally their meals tend to be very filling, so go there on an empty stomach. The last time I went, I ordered the three-pepper burrito, mistakenly assuming there was meat in it.  I found the lack of meat....unsatisfying. It was a little spicy, but overall bland. There was an overload of red pepper, which took away the taste of the guac, and made the crunchiness of the jalapeno unwelcoming. The jalapeno tasted weird as it was the only part of the filling not cooked. The sauce on top of the burrito did not add much to the taste despite the huge chunk that was on my burrito. 

While I consider Steel Cactus maybe one of my lesser favorites of the places on Walnut Street, I'll probably come back for their tacos, or a few drinks.
