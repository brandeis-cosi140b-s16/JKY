Food is great, but the inside of the place kinda smells like mouse poop. I always leave wondering if there are rodents because of the smell or the place is just old. Wish theyd fix that. Otherwise, id absolutely visit more often. Service is great, bar service awesome. Specials and selections are Right On.
