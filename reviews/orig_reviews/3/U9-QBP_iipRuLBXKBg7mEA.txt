Pastor is really good, everything else is decent not amazing. Salsa bar is impressive but boring flavor wise. Free onions and jalape√±os are always just warm. I'd rather pay for them and they be hot.
The worst thing about this place is they are selling 1.00 tacos for 2.50 it should be a crime. I don't know how the owner sleeps at night. Also the concept is dumb I prefer taco places to be sketchy and dirty this is way too nice. I once was robbed at gun point in a taco joint in santa ana and of course I went back for the food and the rush. This is a safe clean taco joint totally unappealing.
