Went on a Saturday for an early dinner.  Service was great, waitress was friendly, we were seated right away.  We also moved tables because our location was too loud for me and they had no problem with that. Living in Phoenix, I feel like we have lots of great food options here and I would say that their food was a bit pricey and tasted good.  Not great, not awesome, just good and that is fine.  The chips and salsa were great (probably best part).  We also ordered the fish taco (husband said that was good) and the carne asada burrito (that was ok).  Also got the vanilla custard pudding for dessert (very interesting, not my fave).  So, I guess I was expecting awesome since lots of people have eaten there and suggested it to us, but I thought it was average.  I do love the ambiance, though and the outdoor seating area is great.
