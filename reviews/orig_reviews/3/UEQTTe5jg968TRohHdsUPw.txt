Two story taco palace serving up some pretty decent Mexican fare. 

It was Tuesday and I was obligated to eat some tacos which led me to TyT. Upon coming in I was quite impressed by the restaurant itself. Very nice two story building with high end finishes featuring a market style set-up and a upper level dedicated to large parties with plenty of seating. 

While the restaurant is much nicer than one would expect, the tacos are pretty average. I had the al pastor and the carne asada  I felt that both meats were lacking flavor. They have a large salsa bar which is probably there to compensate for the bland fillings. Even for street tacos I found the portions to be really small. I could easily have eaten 5 of them and at $2+ a pop, the $ adds up. Not a bad spot but I'm probably gonna have to find a new taco Tuesday spot.
