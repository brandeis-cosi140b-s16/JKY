We got there around 8:00PM and sat outside. Was very loud, making any conversation a shouting match. 

Food is Mexican/American and pretty good. Very slow service (waitress giving menu, taking order, bartender bringing drink, getting food and paying bill. Don't go here if you have a tight schedule. 

Drink was just OK. Bartender was juggling drinks and putting on a show for patrons, perhaps that slowed things down?
