Being so close to my office, ATS was one spot I wanted to check out as soon as I saw it on Yelp. Walking in, you really have to love the layout. Another "restaurant in a house", the Shop has a very breezy open feel, with not a lot of seating. It was early, only 5pm, so there weren't many customers. Without a wait, I was able to walk right up and order a carne asada burrito. BurrITO. I emphasize the "ito", because when I got home, I realized they gave me a burro. Honestly, I didn't know the difference, so I can't be too upset.

Biting into the burro, I immediately agreed with their motto; it really is the best carne asada I have had in town. Great flavor, a little salty, and the texture is perfect. The wrap was perfect; little bit of added flavor, but thick as well (which is essential with the juice from the carne asada). I only had two issues, and one may just be due to the mistaken order. The burro only had the meat and the pico de gallo, so it was a little boring. Delicious, but boring. Also, as others noted, it's pricy. Even without a tip, the XL burro was about $9, and you got something smaller than a Chipotle burrito. Once again, delicious, but a few bucks more than I would have liked to pay.

Long story short, the meat is delicious, and it's well worth trying out. I will certainly go back to try a burrito, and will try to enunciate my words a little more!
