Too expensive for what you get- better, cheaper options if you just walk a tad further. Service was great but management seriously needs to look at pricing. $18 for a tiny chicken sandwich? Watched multiple people leave after being seated. Only stayed  to get kids meals and water- ate our KIND bars rather than contribute further to this insane operation. However- service was attentive and professional.
