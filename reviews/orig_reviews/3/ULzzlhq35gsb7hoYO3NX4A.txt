Located south of Chase Field, I expected this place would be packed since it was game night and U2 had a concert that night.  There was a good handful of people but the place was never "packed."  I think that because it's behind the Field people don't think to come here.  So I recommend Tee Pee if you are wanting to get served quickly before a game.  Our food came quick!  I ordered the popular cheese crisp and my husband had the fajitas.  Both delicious and came out piping hot.  The servers were attentive and good at refilling our water. 

I only knocked off a star because the meat portion of the fajita order was not very generous.  It was delicious, though!
