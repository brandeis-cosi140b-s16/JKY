This place looks like a taco joint at Disney land. Way over the top with outdoor seating and fireplaces and huge bar. We stopped in for a quick drink and lunch. As soon as we sat down, the table next was leaving and ran off in a huff "Maybe next time you can send us a waiter that cares". Normally I chalk this behavior up to the princess syndrome....we sit down and order 4 drinks. This place was almost empty and I saw a two full time bartenders working. We ordered 4 margaritas, and waited at least 25 minutes for them, the entire time not a single person came out to see if needed anything. We eventually were allowed to order some carne asada nachos which arrived with almost no meat. And even if we wanted to complain we couldn't because the waiter never came over. Maybe it was a bad day? I totally saw what the table next to us saw. The service was pretty bad. Food was ok, and the drinks were pretty good. Maybe next time I'm in town, I'll go at night and see if service improves.
