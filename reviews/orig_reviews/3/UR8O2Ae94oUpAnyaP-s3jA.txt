From the second we walked in the door to the time the check was paid, the customer service was excellent. We were immediately greeted with a cheerful hello and the waitress, Liz, promptly arrived to deliver the menus and take the drink order. She came back with drinks and a basket of complimentary house made chips with salsa and guac. 

I said that we were first timers so she helped us make some selections and recommended we give the fusion tacos a go, and we did. We sampled shrimp fusion tacos, fusion flautas with dak-bulgogi (chicken), stir fried kimchi, fried wontons and veggie chow fettuccine. Everything we tried was ok but I was a little disappointed with the spicy level. I was expecting HOT and I got mild at best. But it's nothing a little hot sauce won't cure. Also, I'd probably order the kimchi fried rice (Liz said it was really good) instead of the stir fry in the future. 

For the price, the portions are large. It's a decent spot to grab some quick, cheap lunch and I can't imagine I won't give it another go. I want to give some of the other items a try. I've got my eye on those nachos everybody is raving about.
