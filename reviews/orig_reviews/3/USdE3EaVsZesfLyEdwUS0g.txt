Two words - beef chimichanga. I love chiimis and theirs is hands down one of the best in the valley.  
Overall, Rosita's is a pretty average Mexican restaurant. Calling it "fine food" may be a bit of a stretch. I love their chips and salsa and their black beans along with the chimi. Steer clear of the "guacamole". I don't think it includes a single avocado. It's more of a green sour cream.  We affectionately refer to it as "the creepy green sauce".
The service is usually fast and always friendly which makes it a great place for a weekday lunch.
