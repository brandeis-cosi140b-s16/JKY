Have eaten at the other location many time. Took some friends to the Summerlin location for dinner. The food was as good as the other location. The service lacked. Jose ( who I recognized from Dona Maria's)  just didn't seem to listen when we requested something and we had to ask for things several time. He was pushing the Gold Margaritas, so 3 of us ordered them. We should have asked the price. We definitely weren't expecting $14.00 each. Probably won't go back very often, because of the service.
