The sample bar is a very good idea - props to Chino Bandido for their creativity and marketing strategies.  Still, I think this place, while kitschy, is not worth driving 15 miles out of your way to experience. If you happen to be in the area, choose it over Taco Bell or Panda Express any day. But don't take a date here. Take friends from out of town who want to experience the "real" Phoenix - I'd say fusing anything with Mexican food is just about as Phoenix as it gets.  

PS, I went next door to Poppa Maize after lunch. The owner has been going to Chino Bandido for nine years and never knew that you can get the Jade Chicken without the breading. Not like she'd have to worry about it, but I do, so there you go. :)
