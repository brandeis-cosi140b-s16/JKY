I wish my kids enjoyed the rice with teriyaki sauce or the rice with gravy because a bowl of it is free for kids.  Mine didn't enjoy either sauce.  You can add chicken to it for $1.50... way cheap kids meal.  It also comes with a drink and cookie.

I am a vegetarian and try to eat healthy.  This place doesn't leave many options for me.  I do really really like the chili relleno but it is greasy and I wouldn't eat it very often.  I eat it with the plain rice and black beans.  I just LOVE the black beans... my favorite part of the whole restaurant.  I tried the fried rice and it was way to greasy for my tastes.  The vegetarian egg fu young was not good at all.  Greasy and no flavor.

The cookies are scrumptious!
