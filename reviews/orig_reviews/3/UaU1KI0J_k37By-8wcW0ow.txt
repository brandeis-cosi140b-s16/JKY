Came here on a Friday night with a group of 4. We called at about 5:30 and were thankfully able to make a reservation at 7. We were staying at the Hilton down the street and when we arrived, we were quickly seated.

Service was prompt and quite friendly. Our drink order was taken almost too quickly has half of the table hadn't looked at the menu yet. I tried a lucky (something?) margarita and it was delicious ($7.50). I had to be sure to stir it often though as the agave syrup would settle. Beer was served nice and cold and my Mom enjoyed a (tiny) mimosa. It was disappointing to hear that all of their margarita flavours were syrups vs real juice, especially as an entire page of the drink menu is marg options.

Food wise, my dad and I each enjoyed the combo fajitas (steak and chicken) and my mom and husband had combo plates. Portion sizes are definitely ample as none of us managed to finish and we definitely didn't leave hungry. Meat portions on the fajitas were very tiny, as I was down to onions and peppers after my second tortilla. I enjoyed the fideo pasta vs traditional rice, though consistently have an issue with mixed peas and carrots being added. They overcook and shrivel to sad little rocks.

Overall, we enjoyed our meals. Not sure that we would rush back for food, but the outdoor patio definitely looks like a nice place for drinks on a hot day.
