The food here has a unique style, healthy, well-presented and so tasty.  I would argue the portions are too small for the price, though.  The tequila pairings are quite good.  The inside seating is too small.  If you are at a booth chances are in the evening the butt of someone at the bar might be close to your face.  Gross: hot or not.  

Really love the d√©cor.  If you are a fan of Dia de los Muertos this place is for you just for enjoying the ambiance.  

Do not expect traditional Mexican here.  Which is pleasant in its own way.
