Just ehh.

Came here with a group of friends who really hyped this place up for me like it was the best Mexican food on earth. I was also forced to come on a semi-full stomach so that's also probably why it affected the "okayness" of this place. It's good for groups and was not too busy when we came in. They have an extensive menu and also extensively pricey on some items. Specifically the ONE taco I ordered was freaking $8. I thought it came with 2 but realized that it was only 1 when the waitress asked me. I ordered the Fish Taco which had a star next to it so I was expecting it to be wonderful as fuck for the $8 I was going to pay for it. But no... it was literally just like wtf. It was a small taco with a soggy grilled fished topped with a shit ton of mangoes, onions and cilantro and some sort of tartar sauce I'm assuming. But the tortilla was actually pretty good..much better than the soggy fish. I was also disappointed in the chips and salsa that my friends worshiped because I've definitely had way better chips and salsa than that. Is it my fault that I was given false high expectations? Lol. Oh yeah and I also got a chance to try their Supreme Nachos which was basically Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme on steroids. Again, nothing special at all. I feel bad that I had such high standards so maybe one day in the future again when my friends force me to go here when I'm NOT on a semi-full stomach, the food might taste better to me.
