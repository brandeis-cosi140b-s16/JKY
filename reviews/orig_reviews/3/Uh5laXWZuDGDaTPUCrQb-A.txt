Expensive and crowded when I went. Slow service, nonexistent refills. 

Damn it. I wanted to like Abuelo's more, since I had gone there years back and remember a great meal with friends. This time, the entire city of Peoria decided to show up there to eat. My girlfriend and I did have to wait a bit before they could find a seat for us. 

Our sever was a nice guy, very focused on all of the tables he had. Unfortunately, this also meant that we would only get drink refills sparsely throughout the night. This included our waters as well, which was disappointing. 

For dinner, my girl had the salmon and rice. I had enchiladas and pork tenderloin. Both of us were impressed with our food. My plate was amazing. But that did come at a price. So with the price and lack of service considered, this was an average experience. 

I'm not mad or anything, I can't say whether or not I would come back. It's a long shot to be honest.
