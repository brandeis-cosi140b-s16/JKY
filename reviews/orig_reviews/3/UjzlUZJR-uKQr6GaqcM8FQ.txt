Chips and salsa were great! Thin, crispy chips and spicy red salsa. Ask for the green tomatillo salsa as well. Other diners said the shrimp taco and tortilla soup were really good. 

My meal was average. Chopped salad with almost no flavor, grilled vegetables that I could do better at home, and queso dip that had a good base but lacked salt or any other flavor.
