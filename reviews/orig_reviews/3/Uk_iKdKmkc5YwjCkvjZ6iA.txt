I Absolutely love that this place is NON-GMO! One of the very few places in town. The location is kinda sketchy since it is sharing the building with a "gentlemen's club" but don't be fooled, you're at the right place.

I do want to say that the prices are a little bit on the pricey side, but it can be expected because they use NON-GMO ingredients.

Overall the food is good, but the service is awful. The waitresses have their boobs hanging out of their shirts in these tiny little spaghetti straps as if we were dining at Hooter's or something. Yeah, it is located next to a gentlemen's club, but that shouldn't mean it has to be associated with it (I understand that it may be a uniform, but you might want to reconsider bringing your kids with you). The few times we have been there the waitresses hardly come to check on you or even seem like they want to be there, but who knows maybe they were just having a bad day.

Chef Paco is great, my family and I met him at the March Against Monsanto this past year and you can tell that he is dedicated to the restaurant and providing the best ingredients.
