We frequent this place and I just have to comment on the service by the manager the last time that I was in. 

I ordered the White Sands Chimichanga (usually scrumptious) and it wasn't anywhere near the exception that it usually is. For some reason the meat was not that good. We mentioned it to the manager and she was quick to take it off the bill. We weren't expecting that or inquiring for that reason, we were specifically wondering if there was something about it that had changed, which she mentioned that they haven't changed a thing about it. She was exceptional and took it off the bill no questions asked.

The food here is always good (minus this instance) and I will continue to go back regardless of my latest experience with the food.

Besides, kids eat free on Sundays... hard to beat that!
