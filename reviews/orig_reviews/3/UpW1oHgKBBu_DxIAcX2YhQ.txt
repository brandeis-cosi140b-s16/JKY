I really appreciate the service but when does service become a little annoying? Please don't ask me every two minutes if we are ok especially when we are only eating the free chips. Now to the food which was 20 minutes late, was okay. Very bland and no flavor. The giant "Durango Ranchero Relleno was said to be loaded with shrimp. I found only 4. The ranchero sauce was sweet and made the dish boring . But again we are being asked every 90seconds if we are doing okay...Annoying. The price is ok. I may just try something new next time  but eh not too impressed.
