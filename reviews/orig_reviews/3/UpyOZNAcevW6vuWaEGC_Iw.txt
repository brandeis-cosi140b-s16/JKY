I have been to mad mex many many times over the years, but have never gotten around to writing a yelp review until now.... So this is sort of a summary of all my visits over the years but mainly focused on my most recent visit (which was yesterday) .... Overall, the food is pretty mediocre. Really nothing special about it. It's pretty standard Americanized Mexican food.... Not very authentic. Not terrible. Not great. In fact, the best thing on the menu is definitely the chicken wings, which aren't even remotely Mexican. But that said, they have really good buffalo wings. And the San Francisco sauce is outstanding. 
As far as the bar / liquor goes, they have some really good drinks and a really nice beer selection. 
As far as the service goes, it's a pretty casual restaurant, so the service is so so. 
Overall, this place is pretty mediocre.
