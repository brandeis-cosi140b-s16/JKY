Went in for Happy Hour and ending up having  dinner. My chile relleno was just so-so, I like mine with hot, melted cheese in the middle surrounded by a light batter-and this was not it. I was surprised when I got the bill at the price of my margarita. It tasted like mostly mix- like it was a .99 cent one at the casino. My hubby had the taco salad, and he said it was great!
