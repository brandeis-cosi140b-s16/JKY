- great space...I imagine it gets pretty fun in the summer on their back patio 

- tacos are all named after movies...kind of cool 

- interesting flavor combinations, but the taste didn't knock my socks off. I thought the tacos tasted just okay 

- waiter was a little over the top/pushy. kind of a turn off 

- worth giving it another shot, despite the service that rubbed me the wrong way and the prices being a tad too high
