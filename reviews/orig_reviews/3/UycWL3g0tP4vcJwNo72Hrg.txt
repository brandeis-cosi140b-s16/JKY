The decor was nice, a few seating along the window wall. When I decided on the torta the young boy who took my order stood out. In a bad way. It felt like he didn't want to be there. And when he handed my receipt he flipped it at me. Was this a magic trick? Was he showing off? Whatever it was, it was rude. Than I was reaching for my debit card, he slid it across the counter. DA fuck?!? My hand was right there. 

When the cook brought my food, he was nice and smiled at me. A neighbor was eyeing my food and when our eyes met, he gave me the nod of approval. LoL

At first, the pork torta was wayyyyyy to salty. Than I had a bite with bread and it brought the saltiness down. With cucumbers and carrots, it turned out pretty good. The cucumber aqua was VERY delicious.

Will I be back? The rudeness of the young boy says NO. The food? Maybe.
