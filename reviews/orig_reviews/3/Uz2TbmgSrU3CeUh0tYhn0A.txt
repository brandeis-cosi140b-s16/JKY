came here on recommendation from my brother who said it was bomb lol...went with the hubby & son ...it was super small inside kind of felt claustrophobic ...awkward since my son is only 1 hes noisy so everyone looks at u .....the service was great! food not so much decent prefer over micky ds any day but fatburger is way better with bigger portions...i got the bacon cheese burger i believe with chencho fries & they where sloppyed made & cold to top it all off.... it was decent good but i was let down because the chencho fries lookd so  good =/ maybe it was an off day
