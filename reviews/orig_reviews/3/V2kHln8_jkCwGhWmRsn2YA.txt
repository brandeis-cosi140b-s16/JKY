Normally not a huge fan of Mexican fare but I'd come back to this place perhaps every few months. Arrived during a busy lunch hour on a Friday and were seated instantly. We got the chips and three dips which were more delicious than my own meal. Ordered and got the horchata and it was made perfectly. Very authentic feel but kind of dimly lit even at lunch time. I got the taco bowl and my sister ordered a burrito. Waited a little over 35 minutes for our two entrees to come out which was kind of a long wait but we had chips so we were ok. The food was good, but I'd still prefer Chipotle. There was a birthday celebration and they sang happy birthday and brought all the servers out complete with instruments, it was fun to watch. I noticed there were many Mexicans there for their lunch, even a few construction workers and a good amount of older folks at the bar. Sadly our food took so long we had no time for dessert but overall the service was great, food was good and the wait time not the best. I recommend going at a time when it isn't busy.
