Had dinner at Mercadito on Monday.  It was packed.  It's dark and the music is loud, too loud for me (because I'm not cool).  Even thought it was crowded, we were seated pretty quickly.  We decided to try the trio of salsas with chips.  You don't get a lot of any of the salsas, but that's probably best, because over indulging on chips and salsa is easy at Mexican places.  We had the tomatillo, chile de arbol, and roja.  All were good, but I preferred the tomatillo, which had a nice kick.  None were chunky, they were all blended to a nice consistency.  The server offered us more chips, but we didn't get any because we didn't want to overeat on chips.

Each serving of tacos is around $12-$16 as I recall, and you get 4 small, street sized tacos per order.  My buddy had the carne, and I had the pastor.  The pastor was my favorite of the 2, the chili rubbed pork was tender but had a little crispiness.  But, I wasn't blown away by either taco.

For a side, we tried the mac n cheese, which is served with manchego cheese, chiles, and corn.  This was easily the best thing I ate at dinner.  It's not a thick sauce, but it has a ton of cheese flavor.  And, the chiles give it a nice kick.  I'd absolutely get this again were I to eat a Mercadito.  I'd return if I am in the area, but I certainly wouldn't make a special trip to Red Rock to eat here.
