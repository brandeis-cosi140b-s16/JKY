I thought we had finally found an awesome neighborhood Mexican place, but nope, the food kind of sucked.  My gorditas tasted kind of old.  The steak was chewy and tasted kind of weird.  The burrito was bland and very soggy.  Aren't they supposed to fry it a little on the grill first?  

I feel bad saying it because the atmosphere was so cool.  It was little and cramped and the furniture was shitty.  There was a tv!  And like kids running around screaming who were somehow attached to the people running the place.  

Oh well, maybe they were having an off night or something
