The food is not "super" authentic Mexican. I normally get the Pollo Fundido. I like it, but the drawback is service is almost always slow there. Some of the food I find pricey for what you get. My husband and I ordered take out last month and he ordered a cup of soup, $7.00, and no joke, it was no bigger than a condiment cup. I was annoyed enough that I wanted to call the restaurant and he just said let it go-he was hungry and luckily had ordered enchiladas. Previous time we had gone in and my friend ordered the fajitas, waitress asked if she wanted all the "normal" things with it, my friend said sure. Well when the bill came, they charged her $1.95 for sour cream, $1.50 for cheese, $2.00 for guacamole and $1.50 for pico de gallo. So when the waiter came back and we pointed it out, she said "well you said everything- so is this a problem?" My friend wont go back since that. I dont blame her. I have had them inconsistent on pricing before when Ive ordered. Its nearby our house and the margaritas are good and my husband likes their soup, so thats why we continue.
