Someone recently recommended Gallo Blanco to me, so I was excited when friends invited me there for happy hour on Labor Day. The food and drinks were good, but the service was absolutely terrible. We had to wait over 20 minutes, and ask for a server twice, before we finally gave up and ordered drinks at the bar. After drinks, guacamole, and some tacos, we got our check and split it up on a couple cards. After 10 minutes, our cards and check came back with our server telling us we still owed $33 dollars. We looked at "our" check and saw she had confused us with another table. Unapologetically, she took our cards again, voided them and reran them. It took another 10 minutes, maybe not a big deal, but I had a friend to get to the airport and was annoyed by the whole situation. I couldn't decide if I should give them 2 stars or 3, because the food was okay, but I won't return anytime soon.
