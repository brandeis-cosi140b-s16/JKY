Burrito CO is Okay...

How can you go wrong making eggs, bacon, sausage throw some canned chiles together whip it up in a flour tortilla then charge 6 bucks. It's a combo hard to screw up, I go here when I don't want to cook, and don't want Dennys or Ihop or don't have the time, and stop in and get a breakfast wrapped in a tortilla to go...

convenient yes,,, the best breakfast burritos in town? No...
