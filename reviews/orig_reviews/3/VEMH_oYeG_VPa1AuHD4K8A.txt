I went here primarily based on the great reviews it was getting on Yelp. Honestly, I wasn't that impressed. The food was good, but it wasn't great. i've definitely had better Mexican food. None of their combo plates had a chimichanga, which was a disappointment for my partner. My combo plate was smothered in sauce and cheese so everything pretty much tasted the same. The enchilada was ok, but nothing spectacular. The shredded beef taco was pretty good. The chile relleno... not so much. The batter was so eggy it was like they made an omelette and wrapped it around the chile. There was more egg/batter than chile, which is unfortunate. The homemade horchata was the best part of the meal. It was almost like a horchata slushie. 

We went for a date night in the middle of the week, and the one comment my partner made as we were getting ready to leave was "Next time, we go somewhere quiet for date night." Blah. 

I may go back, I may not. It's not someplace I'm itching to go back to, but if I were in the area I wouldn't be opposed to going. Either the people who gave this place rave reviews have never had REALLY good Mexican food, or they're just really easy to please.
