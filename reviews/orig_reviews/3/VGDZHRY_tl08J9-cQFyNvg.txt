This place must of been having an off night when I came because it seems to be pretty popular. When my girlfriend and I arrived there was quite a wait . Thing is we had terrible service. They were having staffing issues so our waitress who typically bartender was having a hard time keeping up. The chips and salsa were just ok and it took a long time for her to even take our drink order. Once we finally placed our order I made it clear I do not want beans . Sadly they showed up right on my plate with my chile releno .. Overall it was just not as good as I heard. My friends quesadilla had issues too but I didn't try it . We did have her apologies and I understand sometimes these things happen. Hopefully if I get the chance to try it out again they will wow me but for now it's just meh
