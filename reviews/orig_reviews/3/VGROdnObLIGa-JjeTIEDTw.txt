I had the veggie tacos and they were decent although, I expected more. Black beans are in the description but I only spotted a couple in the mix. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the cheese used either. I had 2 tacos and was still hungry. Hubby got the standard and fries and enjoyed it but said he wouldn't drive out of his way to go there again. I would love to try the milkshakes as they sound delicious and would really love it if they came up with a veggie burger-they already have quinoa and black beans, surely they could make them with those as the base ingredients!
