The only thing I have liked that I've ordered are the burritos, and I love authentic mexican food so I think that says something. Everything else is just ok. Don't look around to closely as everything needs to be cleaned. The floor, around the soda machine, the walls, the roof tiles inside- all dirty. Definitely a dive. Seems to be a bit pricey also. My husband loves the burritos but it always seems like we spend a lot of money and leave hungry.
