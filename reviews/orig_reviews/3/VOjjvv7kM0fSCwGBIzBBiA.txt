i have been to this place a few times now.. in the beginning it was amazing but last time i was a little disappointed.

the salsa bar has lots of great flavors, but the best was the guacamole which used to be free.  now they charge $3.75 for a tiny container..!

the quesa (although tasty) can be VERY greasy.. took it to go last time and it was literally swimming in the container by the time i got it home.

the art on the walls and bathroom doors is lovely and tricks me into liking the place more than i would otherwise, i think.

not bad.. but not good.
