I went on a Thursday night at about 7 so I expect to wait a little. The problem with that is, there is NO place to wait. the doorway was so crowded the hostest couldn't get to the people that had been waiting. Also people that were waiting in the bar overflowed into the tables of people eating. Once I sat down, we were in a an overflowed table. It was weird to eat with people's rears in your face. 
The salsa was great. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I wish the chips were hot, like they are at other tex-mex restaurants. The meal I ordered was a burrito Verde (I don't eat fish). It was not really that good, the veggies didn't really go together. It tasted like they just took every veggie in the kitchen and threw it in there. I would not order this again. 
The service was also not so great. I went in with three other girls and when we asked for our check to be separate we got some attitude. My water glass was empty about half the time. 
Overall if I went on an off night (which from the other reviews doesn't seem like there is one and ordered something different it would be OK.
