My Mexican friends don't like this place. They said it's not the food/flavor they grew up knowing. I find the food here real salty. The times I've been here, there's more gringos and gringas than Mexicans.

I do love their chips, tomatillo, chipotle and bean dips for sure. I can eat 2 baskets of their chips. 5/5

I've tried their signature dish: Quesa Taco. Loaded with cheese, very flavorful and very salty. I asked for no tomatoes since I'm allergic, they gave me tomatoes anyway. I scraped the tomatoes off but I guess not all since my lips were puffier than their puffy tacos. 3/5

Puffy Tacos:
Fried flour tacos. Greasy. Rice was salty. 3/5

I love horchata. They don't have free re-fills though.

The wait can be ridiculous even with a reservation. There are parts of the room that is dark and warm (to the left of the hostess' booth) and bright and freezing (to the right). Bring a scarf/jacket just in case.
