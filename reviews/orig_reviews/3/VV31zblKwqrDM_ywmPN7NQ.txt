Hmmmm......

Went for the happy hour special that says 5pm to 7pm on their website (and it's still up as I type). I get there at 6:05 and they said it's 4pm to 6pm now....WTF?

Can't order full menu at the bar,only "bar menu"...WTF?
Can't order happy hour drinks at the table...WTF?
Chips, salsa and guac free at the table, but $4.95 at the bar...WTF?

Sat at a table and ordered the chicken fajitas, at $16.95 that's pretty steep for being 5 miles off the main strip...I give them a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10...average but decent portion.

Salsa average, decent guac, fresh chips

Unless your staying at this hotel, there are much better options, at better prices with REAL happy hours.
