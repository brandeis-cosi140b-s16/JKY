I went here for dinner with my parents a few weeks ago. We had a coupon for a free quesadilla appetizer. It was really good and had very tasty cheese. We also had the Toreados (grilled jalapenos and onions) which are complimentary upon request. 

The entrees included Fideo soup which I enjoyed. I ordered chicken in a cream sauce with sliced poblanos. It was good but I would try something different next time. (The menu is very extensive.) My mom got the beef Barbacoa which was okay but the marinade was a little strong. My dad ordered shredded beef tacos which he said were quite good. 

There are many items I would like to try, so I will probably be back.
