This was my favorite Mexican restaurant and everything was so good, so similar to how my family cooks. My step grandma cooked food similar when she was alive and this was the closest to that and my moms Mexican cooking. 

But somehow it's lost its way for me. Look at my previous reviews over the years to look at the trend.

It's become inconsistent. It's better during daytime, probably because the owner is there. There are times also for dinner the food is SO salty, SO greasy. Servers are either wonderfully attentive and super friendly or horrible and will never check on you at all. Horchata is sometimes perfectly creamy and spiced and sometimes so cinnamony. It's like being at 2 different restaurants. 

Thinking back, out of the last 6 visits, once both the food and service wasn't good, 2 visits the food was good and service wasnt, 2visits where the food was bad and the service was good, 1 visit where food was amazing and service was too. Most of the good food was earlier in the day. These 6 visits have been the past year, I've gone less and less when we used to come frequently.

They also raised their prices from opening to now, by quite a bit. Most of my favorite dishes have gone up $3 since I first started coming here a few years ago. I like the food and probably would still frequent even with their raises every year if it was still as good consistently, but I think some of the items are priced too high for what they are, they are definitely higher than most competitors aside from Lindo which also prices rather high. 

Go during lunch as they tend to be better then. Also it's cheaper so that if you were iffy about the food, you just didn't pay $15 for 2 enchiladas. 

What is (usually) good here is the carnitas, the chile verde, the mole poblano, enchiladas and I think their mocajete is solid. 

I just wish they would up their standards a little bit again. I might look for a new Mexican food place.
