- Interesting location.  Pretty sketchy area and being next door to a strip club makes it a little odd
- Service was very friendly
- The space is nice.  Well spaced and doesn't get too loud

Overall, the food was pretty good.
- The chips and salsas were excellent.  The green salsa was slightly sweet and had a little heat at the end
- The pozole wasn't that good.  Ok flavor, but pozole should be overflowing with hominy.  There might have been ten pieces of hominy in my cup
- The table side guacamole was excellent.  Chunky, salty, and just the right touch of lime
- The shrimp taquitos were pretty good.  The shrimp was tender (and I could taste it) and the plate had just the right amount of salsa, guac, and cheese
- The carne asada street tacos were average at best
- The carnitas street tacos were great

I probably won't be back because the neighborhood skeeved me out a bit, but I could be forced back if someone really wanted to go.
