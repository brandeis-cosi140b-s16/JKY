This review is a little dated seeing as I was there last year but, here you go.  

This place is pretty good.  I had a vanilla Coke and a Texas burger. Zing and zang!

My only complaint was that there was only maybe 8 onion rings that came as a side. A few more would have made me happy.  The ambiance is cool, although i was there in the late afternoon so it was pretty quiet.  i bet is sounds like an old school diner when it is filled up.

I might drop by again soon.
