I really want to love Javiars because of the the atmosphere but the service was so slow and terrible to be at an upscale restaurant that it just kills it for me.

We waited 15 minutes before a server came and took our drink order and when he came back another 15 minutes later there was no explanation of the menu, welcome to Javiars or let me start an appetizer for you---just are you ready to order like we were at Dennys no recommendations or anything.  Once the order was placed, the food then took 45 minutes plus to come out but by then our drinks were empty and our server never asked if we wanted refills.

The things I would highly recommend are:  pineapple margaritas, lobster enchiladas, and carne asada.
