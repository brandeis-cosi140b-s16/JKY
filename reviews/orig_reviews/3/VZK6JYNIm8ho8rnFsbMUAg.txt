I come from LA, so I am a tough critic for Mexican food! 


2 stars for the decor, it's a little outdated. 
2 stars for service, the lady had a bit of attitude 
1 star for the gross tap water. 
5 stars for menu, it is extensive .. 
1 star for the price, they charged us for every little adjustment. 
5 stars for the taste, everyone loved it. 
Overall, we wouldn't pick this place again...
