Had been wanting to try this place since it is so close to me. There always seems to be a pretty good crowd there. Went for dinner on 12/7/13. Service was good and the waitress was informative when we had questions because there are a few funky items on the menu. We asked if we could get the vegetable enchiladas without mushroom and the waitress said no because they are all pre made? Food was ok, everything is a la carte so it gets pretty pricey. Not sure I'll be back unless it's just for drinks, just not for me.
