When I first started coming here, it was a 5 star joint. When I came back this weekend, I see it for the 3 1/2 star-red joint it now is. It's unfortunate. The server no longer take the time to converse with the patrons to make them feel welcomed. The complimentary chips were crumbs. Quite literally, crumbs. They fell through the holes of the basket. They never refilled my salsa and chips like they used to even though he SAW (and yes, I know for a fact he saw it because he looked right at it) that it was pretty much empty. After bringing us our order, he basically never came back again until he saw that we were finished with our food. Um, thanks for nothing, jerk! I'm not going to tip you more for coming right before we ask for the check!

That's just service. As for the food, a bit salty. I'm embarrassed to have dragged my friends here swearing they've got the best tamales ever. FAILED.
