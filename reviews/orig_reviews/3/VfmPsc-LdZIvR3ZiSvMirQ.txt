I like Mad Mex though the location is incredibly busy. I've gone on both a weekend and weekday night and the place seems to be hopping. Very fun vibe - music, props all over the place with a huge bar. Plus their front windows open up via a garage door which is where I prefer to sit. I've sat in the back and my eyes can't take the darkness that well. Food is mediocre - gets the job done and nothing in particular standing out. Quantities are typically on the larger side. Service has always been good though the one bunk thing is that you have to pay for chips and salsa!
