The food was good [and presentation was gorgeous! Kudos to the awesome chef!!] thus, the three stars. The atmosphere was so-so. The staff was AWFUL. We went here on our first day, and last day of our trip since it was inside the Luxor where we were staying. 

The first time my husband and i split the shrimp ceviche. DELICIOUS!! You don't get a ton of it, but was worth the money for how good it was. He had the tostada sampler [will post a photo].. we didn't realize just HOW SMALL, the small plates were. It was also delicious however, and beautifully presented. I tried the Watermelon drink, which was pretty bland. Service was decent at this visit.

Second visit we tried the nachos, as the plate was supposed to be much bigger. It was! And was delicious! However, we had to wait a good 10 minutes or more just for water or chips and there was only 2 other tables seated at around 3pm. Then another 10 minutes for food. The hostesses gossiped loudly at their podium and were rude. Our waitress was sweet, but checked on us ONCE the whole time we were there [she wasn't even the one to bring us our food, as she was too busy talking the whole time] and the rest of the time hung out at the bar talking to the bartender. 

Good food... awful service. Maybe I could have handled the crappy service if the food was rock bottom prices.. but it wasn't. Doubt we'll be back next trip. Gonzalez Y Gonzalez over at NYNY was way better!!
