Decided to try this place out since they got rated as the top 25 burritos in the country.  So let's just start with that!  I had the grande burro...excellent!  It is really one of the best I have had.  I chose the ground beef and it was really good.  The beans are very tasty also!  So the food can stand on its own.  It is good quality and tastes good.  So the part that stopped me from giving this place a great rating is a few things.  One, the service was not spectacular in any way.  Two, margaritas were not very good.  They were strong but the taste was just off.  Three, the place was hot as hell!  Everyone in there was sweating.  So I will be back for the food...but maybe once the weather cools down!
