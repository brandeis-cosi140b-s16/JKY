kinda disappointing Mexican food to be honest.  nothing special, different, or memorable about this place... I can definitely relate to fellowing Phoenix-ans when they say, there isn't much good Mexican food available, which is surprising and disappointing.

i had a pork burrito, since their pork is "award winning..." leftovers have gone untouched in my fridge, and i probably won't eat them since i am not all too hip to revisit the sub-par cuisine... which is REALLY annoying actually considering that thing wasn't cheap AT ALL.  they ding you a $1 for sour cream, $1 for guac, and $1 for extra cheese.  gimme a break people, sheesh!
