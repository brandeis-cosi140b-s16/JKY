Was in town for work and met a friend that lived nearby here for a beer, with one of the main reasons being they had a Golden Tee machine. Well, they served beer (albeit a limited selection) and the machine worked (unlike the pinball machine next to it) so I guess it served its purpose? Nothing to write home about though, the outdoor patio seemed like it could be pretty cool to hang out and the dedicated cornhole space was a nice touch, but all in all, just a dive bar.
