Great place for a Friday happy hour! The chambord marg is top notch, achiote chopped chicken salad is to die for, and the trio appetizer is great ONLY when it's half price during happy hour.  Highly recommend but only hangup is the cocky manager, useless hostests, and unattentive servers.  After two margaritas you get over the staff :)
