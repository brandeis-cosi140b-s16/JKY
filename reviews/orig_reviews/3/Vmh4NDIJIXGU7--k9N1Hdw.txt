Best Vaginal themed mexican restraunt on earth!  Other reviewers knock the lack of authenticity.  But, frankly, if I'm eating at a mexican restraunt named after a woman's anatomy I'm not necessarily looking for the place to be following strict traditional guidelines.  So, whatever.  The guac and the salsa are both really good here.  The food is fresh and good quality.  It certainly is overpriced, but its very nice and the waitstaff is RETARDED hot.

eww, this is starting to sound like a review from hooter's.  i quit.
