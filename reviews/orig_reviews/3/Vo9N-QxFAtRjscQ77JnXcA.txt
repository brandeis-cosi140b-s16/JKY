We had such a blast here. Love coming for the kareoke. It's a lot of fun and the staff is great. However.... at the end of the night our bill ended up being 300 bucks for 6 rounds of drinks with no food. And instead of letting us know how much our bill was getting up to they decided to be selfish and just hand us the bill at the end. They are way too expensive.  14 bucks for one drink depending on the drink
