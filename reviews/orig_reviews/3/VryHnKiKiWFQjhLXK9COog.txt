I ate here twice during my stay in Phoenix last week and I can't say too many bad things about it. Prices were decent, food had flavor and it filled me up. Was it the best Mexican food I've ever had? Absolutely not, however it definitely wasn't nasty! The service was A-OK and the food hit the spot. I would definitely go back again.
