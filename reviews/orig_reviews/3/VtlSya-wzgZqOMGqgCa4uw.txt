Just like all the rest.

There was a time when Cafe Rio had it going on. We knew it, they knew it and things were really good.

The flavor is still there but things seem sloppy and the staff give off a "don't give a shit" attitude now.

I'm no restaurant chain consultant but I think if you pay managers enough to care and staff well enough that they know they're making a very competitive wage, value follows and customers come back.

Then again, customers might not care about anything other than consistency and this chain has found that sweet spot of product and price.

Guess that leaves the door wide open for someone else to do what they used to!
