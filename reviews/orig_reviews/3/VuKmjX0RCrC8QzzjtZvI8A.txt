Pretty typical sit down mexican cuisine. It isn't super authentic, but it is better than those other commercialized places like Azteca.

I would put this on fighting ground with that Irish Mexican place on 16th st. (i forget it's name). definitely would prefer this place. it is more hole in the wall.

Food has HUGE servings. I walked away happy.

The green chili quesadilla isn't bad (not the best i've had though)
