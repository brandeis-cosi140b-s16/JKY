The good:
The tacos here are amazing. Best I've ever had? No. But enjoyable, if pricey. I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco and the La Condesa Veggie Taco. The pork taco was tasty, though extremely messy; the onion pieces were huge, but weirdly enough they had no flavor at all. My favorite was the veggie taco. The vegetable variety was great and they were all cooked to perfection--crisp but fully cooked. The cheese on top was like the glue (best glue ever!) and had a lovely salty tang.

My husband had the pork taco as well and also the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The steak taco was his definite favorite; he thought the pork chunks were way too big.

Our server was good--much better than when I visited the Glendale location by myself and was ignored.

The bad:
Yes, the salsa bar is great, but the restaurant is so crowded that it makes getting the salsa difficult. The restaurant is downright claustrophobic, and it wasn't even fully packed with customers when we were there. We wanted to finish our food and leave ASAP so we could stretch out and breathe. There's not a great deal of parking, either.

The tacos are served in baskets lined with tissue paper. With really messy tacos, that means the paper disintegrates and you can't easily cut big chunks of meat with a knife.

Really, it's a place with great tacos and a horrid location. We won't visit again.
