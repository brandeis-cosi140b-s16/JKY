PRO:
1. Good food - Menu has enough variety to keep things interesting
2. Margaritas are BIG - They aren't going to blow your hair back or anything, but they are good. 
3. Friendly staff when I have visited.
4. To Go service is quick and cheap. In and out without a hassle.

CONS: 
1. Slow service, had to ask for the check twice...never good.
2. The ambiance is a little 'cheesy' and the music can be loud.

All in all, it's a nice sit-down Mexican food chain. You can get better Mexican/tex-mex food in the valley, but this is good for the price.
