The food was average. The price to me was insane. The atmosphere was intimate. My wife and I had taco shop food, placed lovely on a plate, for about $100 2 drinks. I got carnasada. That was the smallest steak I ever seen. my wife got sopas. I kid you not they brought out 4 sopas the size of a quarter. I couldn't believe it. This place is probably better suited for tourist. It just isn't really for me.
