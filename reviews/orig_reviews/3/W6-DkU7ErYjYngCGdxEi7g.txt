I came in today, 10/27/14, because I had been here before and enjoyed the food, but it had been a while since I've been here. The timeliness of the orders is good, but the quality is standard, my Horchata, which is my favorite drink aside from eggnog and root beer, wasn't very good it was watery and disappointing and the food wasn't really worth the $13 I paid for a chicken burrito. I did appreciate one of the employees (manager or owner maybe?) thanking me for remembering Mango's from two years ago, but they need to step their game up. Sorry guys.
