Went for a quick and easy lunch with my girlfriend where I could be in view of the Bellagio fountains. 

I had a burrito and it was pretty good, definitely no complaints about the food. The outside area was a little messy and there were birds EVERYWHERE. Not sure what can be done about that, but having to constantly worry about them being down by your feet the whole time was not okay. 

The service was also a little off, we waited about 7 minutes before anyone took our drink order, also $3 for chips and salsa at a Mexican place? Let's be real. 

I'd go again, but there's definitely areas for improvement.
