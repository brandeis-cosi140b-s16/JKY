This place has the potential to be great!! However, it's not. The chips and salsa and atmosphere are definitely a reason to go! The best I've ever had!!!! The first trip there provided a waitress who never brought the cheese dip we ordered. When I asked her to take it off our check, she said, "ok".  Never an apology or "oh my gosh! I forgot!"  Nothing. She came by a couple of times to refill the empty water glasses them disappeared until the food and check were brought out. 

Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we went back the next day. Again, beautiful atmosphere from the patio. The chips and salsa were DELICIOUS!!!! The food and service were mediocre. I had the chicken sandwich which sounded somewhat healthy but came out greasy. 

So my advice: go!! Get the chips and salsa. Although I didn't have one, I hear the margaritas are good, too. Enjoy the patio and beautiful Phoenix weather. Just don't expect too much from the rest of the food or service.
