Javier's is a chain.  They've got a few here in So Cal.  You already knew that, though. You don't need me.  WHY DON'T YOU NEED ME???  WHAT DID I DO WRONG??? Huh?  Oh... ok.  Back to the review.  It faces the casino (near my dear Roulette area). The ambiance is super cool.  Dark.  Luxurious.   Good margaritas (though a bit too much ice for my taste).  You'll feel like you're in some upscale resort in Cabo.  Now the bad news.  I thought the food was marginal, at best.  Also.. FREAKISHLY pricey.

I say go for drinks and bar food.
