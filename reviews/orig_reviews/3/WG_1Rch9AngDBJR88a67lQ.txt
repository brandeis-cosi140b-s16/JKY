C+/B-

Service:

Our server said that they had run out of a few things, AFTER we had ordered them. (Staff should be aware of what's still available before taking down orders). Additionally, she put in our starter and entrees at the same time so everything came out at once. I really don't like when that happens. Anyhow, maybe it was someone else's fault but it still was an unpleasant start to the evening.

Food:

What I had was Delicious. Something as simple as Avocado Bruschetta was elevated by the simple addition of Lime Juice, Tapatillo, and Red Onion. Think of this as Guacamole without it being all liquidy and mashed up. Wonderful giant chunks of avocado and tomato. The portion was fantastic; I would go back just for this.

Additionally, I had the Shrimp Tamale. While the shrimp was VERY overcooked the portion size was perfect and it had an amazingly creamy, flavorful, rich sauce I wanted to lick off the plate.

My dining companion had the Mushroom Quesadilla. We agreed that while, again, the flavors were incredible...the execution was a tad off. When you bite into it water from the mushrooms drips onto the plate. It happens, they're mushrooms. But you need to cook them down first. Then you can place them into the tortilla and grill. This preparation would help them out greatly. 

Overall:
Food: B-
Server: C - She WAS super friendly though, and apologetic
Ambiance: B+ The Restaurant, while on the smaller size, has a nifty little bar in the middle, and an outside patio which can be taken advantage of during great weather.

I'd give my experience a solid B-

Once they work out some of the kinks with food prep, running out of items and making sure that the servers are aware of it, they'll do very well.
