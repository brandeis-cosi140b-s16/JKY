This is a solid burrito joint. Over the years they have crept up on the prices but the quality remains the same.  All food comes with salsa and chips. No thrills, no frills just decent food to fill you up on your hungriest days. There's no drive-through so I recommend calling ahead and picking up your food if you are in a rush. The service is average, and most of the time they keep the tables clean during lunch rush.  My favorite is the Barbacoa enchilada style (about $7.50), it's filled with tender Mexican BBQ beef, green onions and tomatoes. After eating this I usually sleep at my desk for the rest of the afternoon. PS- they don't accept AMEX.
