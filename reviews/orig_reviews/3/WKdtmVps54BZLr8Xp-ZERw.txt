Three of us lunched. waitress gave us samples since we were first timers. The meals were prompt, and they were not so expensive. My meal consisting egg foo young w/ red chicken and black bean was so so. I have had much better chinese than this. My friends had red chiken, friend rice, and pulled pork. They said they were ok. Do I go back......maybe one year later.
