I had such a fabulous visit to Carlsbad back in 2011 that I couldn't wait for a return trip this year.  Unfortunately, the most recent reviews have been spot on:  the service and quality of the food has dropped a few notches.

This year I tried the chile rellenos and actually really enjoyed it.  But my mom and sister's meals arrived lukewarm.  We all enjoyed our meals, but weren't wowed enough to make a return visit in the future.
