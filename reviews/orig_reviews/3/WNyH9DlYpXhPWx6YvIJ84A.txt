Good diggs - service isn't great but its alright I guess.  THE CORTADA SALAD IS MY FAVORITE SALAD in the WORLD!!!!! Try it try it try it, I feel healthy while satisfied when I'm halfway eating that salad.  It's fantastic!!  The cheese tower/chicharron de queso is....interesting.  I didnt mind it but have gone with a group of people,  who really enjoyed it and called it "una cosa bien especial".  I didn't exactly like that they don't offer complementary chips and salsa, and also the carne asada was a bit dry/overcooked.  The Torta with the fried eggs on top is sssooo flirtatious so I'll try that next time and I'm psyched!  Oh also, the Prickley Pear Marg is juice - if you're an alkie, just stick with beer, they can't really get that wrong.  Overall its ok, I guess if you like to explore different flavors - which I'm glad/proud they offer.  It's a good spot, I'd definitely recommend!  Have fun tasting all their yummy stuff and their bland stuff too!!  Enjoy!
