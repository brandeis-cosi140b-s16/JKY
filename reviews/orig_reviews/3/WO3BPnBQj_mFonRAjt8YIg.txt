I want to have a 5 star here. I really really do.  Sadly the food didn't deliver. I came here on a weak night. It was empty. We ordered steak tacos. I was hooping for some citrus flavored Carne Asada but all we got was fatty chewy steak with little flavor. The guac and chips were good as were the salsa but the meat was plain bad. 

If you go here I say get something other then the steak (or maybe it was one bad night) and hopefully its great. I haven't been back. I cant convince my girlfriend to try it again.
