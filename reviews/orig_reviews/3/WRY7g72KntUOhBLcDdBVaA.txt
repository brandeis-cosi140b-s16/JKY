Decent mexican food and good table-side guacamole, but like most places on the strip it is just overpriced.  I've been here and Border Grill and thought both were decent but I wouldn't make either a regular stop.  El Segundo is a okay stop though if you want to sit in an outdoor setting and get some drinks and socialize or even keep your eye on a sporting event.
