Went to an On The Border in California and it was awesome! Gave this one a shot and it was not do good. Food was pretty good. A little over priced but good. Service was so slow! We waited 15 to be seated then 30 to get our food then 30 after we were done eating and waiting for the check! All in all food is good but service is terrible!
