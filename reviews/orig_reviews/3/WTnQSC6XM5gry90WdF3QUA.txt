We visited on a Saturday around 4 pm. 
I had the ghost chili nachos, which are listed on the menu as having chicken. Mine had beef.
I was hungry and I didn't send them back. They weren't very spicy, but were tasty and yet needed more chili flavor. The portion was good for the price and it's definitely a meal. 
The menu lists "all day breakfast", which we would have ordered, but our server said it's a no go on breakfast. Disappointing.
My friend liked the potato chip nachos and I found them tasty also. The decor is fine and they have TVs showing some sports broadcast all over the restaurant. My favorite thing about this
location is the self serve beer station. I regret to say that I didn't patronize the station, which had a nice selection and would make for a fun afternoon/evening!
