A friend recommended this restaurant for lunch . . . and since ASU was on Spring Break . . . we thought it would be a good time to try it out.

Somewhat disappointed . . . The service will prompt and somewhat attentive . . . seemed to lack a little, especially since the restaurant was pretty empty.

The food . . . The chips and salsa . . . the chips tasted burnt or at a minimum fried in old grease . . . the salsa however was very tasty and had a good amount of heat . . . I had the number 5 . . . the taco was crisp and tasty . . . the enchilada was also very good . . . the tostada was mushy and not very good.

I hate giving out three stars . . . since it is like riding both sides of the fence . . . but that is exactly what this place was like . . . some good and some bad . . . and while I have other Mexican restaurants that I would prefer to go to . . . I would probably try this on again . . . but would definitely try something else . . . maybe breakfast.
