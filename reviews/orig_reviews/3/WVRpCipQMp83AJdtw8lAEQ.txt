their food is about the same as it has been for years....though the prices have increased recently...which makes me think it is not the same bargain it used to be.  

Don't get me wrong, still great margs and awesome salsas (especially the yummy one with a ton of cilantro...)...but...you might find similar bargains elsewhere too.  

I'll still get their mexican pizza no matter what, however!
