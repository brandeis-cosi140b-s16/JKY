Well we made a stop at here for dinner while in Las Vegas.  The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is the atmosphere. The food was just ok and the drinks are really expensive but what isn't expensive on the strip.  I agree with other reviewers this is definitely not kid friendly.  The high light the balloon woman. She was making balloon sculptures with adult themes.  She is very talented. The balloons seemed to be a hit with the wild fun side of adult Vegas. As for going back for another visit, maybe if I win big and need a quick bite.
