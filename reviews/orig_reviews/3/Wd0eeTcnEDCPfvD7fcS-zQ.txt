Great news !!! They changed the menu! And it's awesome !!! The chips & salsa is amazing ! I got the hot one. The mahi mahi tacos were some of the best I've had! They don't have fresh jalape√±os and are kinda pricey but it's the airport. The portions were larger than before also. I will come back when I'm passing through again for sure.
