The short version: Not bad, not great. A few problems, nothing major. The food was good... not great, but good.

The long version: A friend and I met up here for lunch yesterday. Even though it was noon, the service was quick. Unfortunately, the floor was had been mopped with something that left a slick residue, and my friend (who was wearing flip flops) had to quickly find a seat so as not to fall. I, however, was wearing boots with heavy tread, so I had no problem. Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we sat down, and it was fresh and enjoyable, though it didn't stand out from other burgers I've had at places like 5 Guys. (I had the Paradise Valley Cheese Burger). The table was wobbly, and it was annoying enough to make me want to change places, but we were engrossed in conversation, so I decided to try to ignore it. The server did come around once to clear away trash and ask if we needed anything, and I wasn't expecting extra attention in a casual burger joint, so that was nice. However, when we left the restaurant at 1:30, the trash can that had been filled to overflowing during the lunch rush had not yet been emptied. That would have been gross enough on its own, but someone had spilled guacamole all over the opening of the trash can, down the side, and onto the floor in front of the can. This was the kind of trash can that you have to push open the flap on the front in order to dump your garbage inside, so it was rather disgusting to have to deal with that. 

For the two of us, lunch was about $22. That got us one burger, one side, and an ice water each.

So, overall, it was a pretty decent place to grab a quick, freshly-made hot meal. Just don't expect too much.
