We got here around 7:30 on a Thursday night. They were:

1. Out of al pastor meat
2. Out of chicken meat
3. Only had enough to make 1 small cochata drink.

This considerably dampened our dining plans. Nonetheless, we ordered 2 regular size carne asada burritos and the last remaining cochata. 

The cochata's horchata component was literally scraped from the bottom of the barrel. As a result, I couldn't taste much horchata flavor. Instead, I tasted more of a vague creaminess with a lot of grit from the bottom-of-the-barrel cinnamon and rice particles. The coffee component was fine. It had a smooth flavor. 

The carne asada burritos were quite flavorful. I enjoyed the marinade the carne asada was in, and there was also a little bit of guacamole and some pico de gallo in the burrito. It came with a small cup of salsa, which looked like it would be good, but tasted bland and watery.

Service was decent and our burritos were made in no time. We got our order to go and along with the cup of salsa, our brown paper sack came with a baggie of lime, radish, and cucumber, and a plethora of napkins.

Hopefully next time if I'm in the mood for America's Taco Shop again they won't be out of most of the main meat components of their menu!
