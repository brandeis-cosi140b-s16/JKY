Total bargain for students, with 50% food up until 4pm daily.



 CA living has made me a bit jaded or that I'm a little older,  but the food here is bit lackluster.  Lots of volume, and very little substance.  Just like college kids!  The menu is creative and offers a lot of variety and a number of veggie options and the prices are great, but its nothing worth driving cross town for.

Ok, maybe that blue cornbread.
