Well, we hit this place up with a guest from out of town. Richardson's is usually our stop, but you know it burned down:(....
Everything was great, except the service. The service was sort of not with it, but she did check on us and stuff. Just sort of "lights on nobody's home" head in the clouds. She wasn't horrible, but not what you expect when ordering a $22 entree. I like the prices and ambiance here, even better they took reservations for our party of 4. Overall its a great way to break out of the rut. Wish they'd opena lunch place with lighter offerings downtown.
