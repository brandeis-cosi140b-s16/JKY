Had the chicken and shrimp burrito with jalapeno and cheese mashers. The burrito was tasty even though I did not taste any shrimp. It was also filling, so I did good and only ate half.  Saved the other half for Monday's lunch.

The mashers were happily recommended by our server, yet they were lacking seasoning. Hats off to Cabo for my being able to tell they were homemade ( or in disguise)mashed potatoes.  Bf and I also tried Azula Rita margaritas. Margaritas range from $5 to $12 and are $1 off on Sundays. It consists of OJ, pineapple juice, Blue Curacao and Jose C. Pretty tasty and bf ordered a second. ;)  Service was just ok and there was a not big crowd. Will be back to try some of the other menu offerings.
