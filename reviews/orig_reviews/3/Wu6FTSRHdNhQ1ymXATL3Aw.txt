This is a good place to eat, but there are a few issues. The food is fresh and tasty (though neither authentic nor flavor rich). The premium margarita is excellent and the chips are a nice mix of fresh spicy styles. This is my third visit and I enjoyed the carnitas and enchilda platter. The enchiladas were great and had an unusual white sauce that really made the meal. The carnitas was well prepared, but a little fatty for my taste.  

As others have said, uneven service remains a challenge. The staff works hard, is friendly and trys to be attentive, but somehow come up just a bit short. Remembering details like split checks or dessert requests seem too much. If you have time to linger and people watch, none of this will be a problem. They seem to cater to conference visitors and folks coming downtown for the day. This may be your best option in the area. 

A final thought. While the desserts are not spectacular, they are good. The banana burrito stands our from the rest. It is tasty, a bit like bananas foster in a fried tortilla, but the use of Hershey's syrup leaves the experience falling short. And that summarizes the entire experience. Good for an area where you wouldn't expect good, but still short of what it might be.
