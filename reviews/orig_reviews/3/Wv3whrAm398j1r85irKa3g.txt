We ate here most every time we have been and mostly it's been consistent in quality and service. This time wasn't a major disappointment but we will question eating here again in the future. I had the Tres Tacos (fish, pork and mushroom). The pork taco was a bit to "porky". It just tasted like a low end taco shop taco in my opinion. The fish had an odor I cannot describe and while it wasn't offensive it wasn't exactly inviting. The mushroom taco was good and as always the cilantro rice was really good.
