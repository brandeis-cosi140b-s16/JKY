Maybe my bar is still way too high from eating Mexican food in Texas, but I thought the food here was mediocre.  The bean dip was pretty good, but the chips and salsa were uninteresting and the pork belly tacos I got tasted mostly like bland fat (some hints of flavor there).  The margaritas were just OK.

There isn't much seating here and it gets pretty crowded.  The limited hours may contribute to that...

On the plus side, the service is pretty good and the interior decorations, while sometimes corny, make for a fun feel.
