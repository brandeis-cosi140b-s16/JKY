We went here for a large group function, and the indoor/outdoor environment was nice, and it was easy to mingle. The served some apps of chips and guac and they were good. The entree and salad, not so much. We definitely didn't come here for the food, it was less than mediocre, however, we were a big group and serving in that volume can tax the best kitchens. But, it was a fun place for our group, despite the food.
