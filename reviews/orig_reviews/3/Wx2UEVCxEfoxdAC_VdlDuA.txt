Like Beth above, I found Otro's food up to the high standards of sister restaurant Gallo Blanco, but the service was a disappointment. Our server took our order and then vanished. Drinks stood empty as did our molcajete of chips. Iced tea was replenished, finally, but without ice. However, like Beth, I will be back for the great food. Try the frijoles negro (black beans liberally dusted with cotija) and the paella mexicana, delicious with bits of chorizo, chicken, and surprisingly zucchini. Some of the rice grains along the inside of the cast iron serving plate were wonderfully crisp. Your creative and delicious cuisine should carry you far, Otro, but only so far if the service continues to lag behind.
