The food was OK. It's a bit pricey for the quality. Have you been to a restaurant and already thinking when to come back after you're done eating?  Or the next day you're dreaming about the meal you had?  This is just not the type.  But I might come back someday since I live in Summerlin. Pretty interior and nice location though. This is an amercan-mexican fusion restaurant.
