Been here a few times now, and the food is pretty consistent. Basic Mexican food decently cooked. The Chimi's are great and the service has always been very good. 

Why 3 Stars ?  Their Chimis are good for the price, but not my #1 Chimi... Their "free" chips and salsa are ok, chips kind of THICK, but hey, free... Last order was the Chili Relleno, and the batter was meh...

I will be back, but this isnt a normal stop for me. Gotta be craving some Mexican food, and not feel like driving to Carolinas or Abuelos, which, u should find my reviews for them.... 

Still better than Macayos n Garcias, but just shy of 3.5 stars for me....
