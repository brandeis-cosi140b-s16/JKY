I used to go to the location in Miami but was never really impressed. When I saw that they opened in Vegas I was really hoping that this one would be a little better. I can say that the drinks were good but a little over priced. The outdoor patio was cool but the tables were WAY too small! I felt like I was playing tea time with some kids...seriously.  The service was good and the waiter was friendly. We ordered the chips an salsa which was a JOKE! It was about 1/4 oz of liquid on a shallow plate. You can't even dip your chip. WTH. Don't order it! It's wack! 

 I really hope that corporate reads all the reviews so they can make changes.  The place has potential but I don't like getting corn holed for drinks and food.
