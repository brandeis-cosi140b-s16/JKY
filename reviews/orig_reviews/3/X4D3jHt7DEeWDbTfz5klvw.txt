Portions are generous.  Wine list needs some work.  But then, I'm sure people don't normally come to a Mexican restaurant expecting good wine matches.  I would like to see some improvement there.  Great ambiance on the "open air" balustrade that allows you to enjoy the gondoliers at close range.  Excellent guacamole.  I was very impressed with the duck rellenos (the creamy orange sauce was a great play against the green chile) and the mussels, shrimp and chorizo skillet really won me over.  The sauce was so beautiful, I could have eaten it on shoe leather!  Wanted to immediately go home and try to recreate both dishes.  Mexican food is not usually my first choice when out of town (we live in Texas) but we chose this restaurant because of the proximity to the canal.  Service was very good.  Nicely surprised about the food.  Upscale and beautifully presented.
