Had lunch there after a morning of classes at my conference.    Hubby and I ordered fish tacos.  We liked them, but they were nothing we haven't had done just as well elsewhere.  We had discount cards, offered through my conference, for a free margarita or a free taco.  I got the free margarita, which I really enjoyed (free is good!).  Hubby decided to have the free carnitas taco.  This was a joke!  It was free, so we can't complain much, but it was so tiny.  We had a good laugh over it; I definitely got the better deal with the margarita!  

Service was subpar.  We had to ask a few times for our chips and salsa, and my husband never received the drink he asked for.  Speaking of the chips and salsa, the red salsa tasted like marinara... not spicy at all. 

Spendy for what you're getting, but they're taking advantage of being in a prime location -- Mandalay Place.  During our stay, we also ate at T&T, which is not far from Hussongs, in Luxor.  I'd recommend T&T over Hussongs.
