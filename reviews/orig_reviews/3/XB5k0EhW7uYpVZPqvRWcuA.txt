Huge freaking burritos. They put together one for my boyfriend and i swear it could easily feed a family of four! So your money will absolutely go far here :) Service on the other hand was incredibly slow and the guys were a little ditzy on getting things done. It was getting later in the evening so maybe they were just tired??? (Hey I'm trying here) Overall o.k spot to get a quick bite to eat. My tostada and pork taco were pretty good overall.
