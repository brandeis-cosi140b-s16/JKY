I'm amazed at how bad the reviews are. The food is good and the prices aren't bad, plus, Sunday night kids eat free. The down side is how bad the service is. Every time I go in there it takes way too long for everything from getting chips all the way to getting the bill. 

The food is good, way above average. They actually have some spicy food, which very few restaurants seem to do anymore. We eat here quite a bit, it would be a solid 4 star if the service wasn't so bad.
