On Friday, I went to Arriba with my wife, mom and young daughter for a mexican dinner.

We were promptly sat, greeted and ordered our drinks. 

We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of guacamole that we received.  Always a good start to a mexican meal.

Our food came out within 15 minutes of order. I had the triple enchilada plate. I enjoyed my enchiladas (beef, cheese and chicken). The plate was big and flavorful.  I could have gone for another enchilada! 

The most disappointing part of the meal was the rice and beans. The rice/beans didn't have the best taste and easily the most disappointing part of the meal.  Not sure if that is the normal taste or just had an old/bad batch.

Service was very good. 
 
Arriba is very kid friendly and a festive atmosphere.

Not the best mexican food, but slightly above average, close to home, affordable and nice atmosphere. We'll be back for these reasons.
