I've eaten at Leticia's close to a dozen times over the past couple of years, but noticed that food quality hasn't been consistent. After not dining here for 3-4 months, a group of friends and I decided to meet for lunch today and try it again. The chips, salsas, and beans were great as usual. I shared the empanadas (1 chicken tinga, 1 beef), Mexican corn, and had a bite of carne asada chimichanga. It was all good, but for the prices ($15 for the chimichanga burrito!) I feel it's not a great value. 
The main area of concern was the service. After being seated it took 15 minutes for someone to take our drink order (water and iced tea), and an additional 20 minutes for the drinks to be delivered. Granted it was a Saturday afternoon, but it's standard to have at least waters brought out within 15 minutes of a party being seated. When we politely asked our server about the drinks, she made some excuse about the bartender being busy. Not cool Leticia's, not cool.
