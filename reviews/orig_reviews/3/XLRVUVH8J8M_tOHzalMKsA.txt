This place I totally forgot about. A friend use to take me here years ago and I forgot how good it was. The chips and salsa are ok, but not the best. This is not gourmet/fancy mexican but it is good and VERY affordable. The tostadas are great and the chimichangas are good also. If you are looking for some cheap good mexican, for sure check this place out.
