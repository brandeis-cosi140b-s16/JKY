While searching for a place for some drinks and appetizers in Scottsdale the other night, some friends and I decided to pay Loco Patron a visit mostly due to their spacious outdoor seating. In all, while not the best experience, the time was enjoyable.

Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?

After seating ourselves, my party was promptly met by a friendly server who brought out our drinks before taking our orders for several platters of appetizers.  Outside of being just the right amount of attentive, the atmosphere at Loco Patron was comfortable, with a diverse crowd of 30-somethings and a friendly vibe. Star Granted.

Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?

Admittedly, and possibly for the first time ever, I didn't keep track of the costs of our drinks and appetizers, but we did take advantage of the Happy Hour menu that consisted of fried goodies and decent drink specials.  At the end of the day, after ordering a huge plate of nachos, smashed potatoes, hot wings, a quesadilla, roughly six (weak) margaritas and four beers, our final tab for our party of six was roughly $125 after tax and tip. While I suppose $21 is a bit steep for a sampling or two of each of the appetizers and two drinks each, it wasn't unreasonable. Star Granted.

Stars 3/4 - How was the food?

While I can't speak for the normal menu, Loco Patron's Happy Hour menu was satisfying, and particular compliments go out to the hot wings and the generous portion of nachos. As is common, this isn't anything fancy, but if you're looking for a quick appetizer, Loco isn't a bad option. Single Star Granted.

Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?

Would I come back again? Sure, especially since Loco Patron is very accommodating for larger crowds; however, with so many options in the area, I can't say I'd make Loco Patron a regular spot. No Star Granted.
