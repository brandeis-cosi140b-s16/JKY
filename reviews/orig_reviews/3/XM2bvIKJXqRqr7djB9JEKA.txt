We went here for Sunday football to watch the game after seeing them advertise they show all games. I would not go here for that experience again. 

Food was good, we ordered the nachos and quesadillas to share with each other. Nachos would have been enough! Drinks and food are expensive and though I was filled, I can't say 100% worth it.
