I came here with my husband before the Yelp Cocktail Society at Lustre Bar. It was very close by, and there was a Living Social deal available so I figured it would be a great time to try out one of my bookmarks.

Things got off to a rocky start. The place was empty except one table on the patio, but we had to request the preoccupied to server to actually serve us. Then we were told they were out of Negro Modelo. Como?

My veggie tacos were delicious, and I really liked the rice. The beans could have used more seasoning. My husband thought his carne asada tacos were just ok.

I would come back for some happy hour veggie tacos and people watching on the patio when the weather is nice.
