This place is everything that has been described. Small, authentic, shabby looking, iffy service.

It was a little hard to find parking, but I guess that is not an uncommon problem in Madison. They advertise they serve mixed drinks but they don't. They don't even have margaritas. 

I got the Mexican Burrito and a veggie taco. The burrito was kinda bland, possibly would have tasted better with meat in it but I was less than impressed. The veggie taco was much tastier and wished I had gone that route instead.

It was also kinda hot in there but I guess air conditioning isn't common in Madison since it stays cold most of the year. I may consider going back there again but I wasn't completely sold.
