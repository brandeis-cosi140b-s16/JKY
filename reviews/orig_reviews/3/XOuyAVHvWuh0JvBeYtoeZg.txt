One of us was a little skeptical about this place as it is located far enough down Central that it starts to get in the not so nice part of town.  But we ended up liking it a lot actually despite the location.  The place was clean, service was good, we parked out front but we got the last spot...not sure if there are other parking options.

I don't remember exactly what we got but for those of you who are Jim Gaffigan fans you can be sure it was some sort of meat, cheese, and tortilla mix.  Sorry, couldn't resist.  We got the carne asada and the enchiladas al hormo.  Both pretty good.  Also they served drinks (sprite) straight from the can...not bragging or complaining...just stating a fact.

I know our rating seems a little low for how much we liked it but the problem is that the difference between bad Mexican food and good Mexican food just isn't that much.  Especially when you are talking about Americanized Mexican food.

We give it 3.5 amigos out of 5
