It really was a pretty nice place, and I would give it an extra half star if that were available.
I think the beer is a little pricey, but they had a pretty good selection of tap beers.
Food seems okay, some of it quite tasty, but nothing special that I would rave about.
Service was good and Unlike what somebody else said, the chips and salsa were free for the first basket anyway and I think they were better than your average Mex. restaurant chips and salsa.
