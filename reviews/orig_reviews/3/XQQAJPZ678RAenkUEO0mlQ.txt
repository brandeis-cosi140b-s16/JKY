Trekked here for lunch one day with some work folk. It left an eh in my mind. Not a bad eh, which is usually a 2 for me, but more like an I'll-come-back-here-if-someone-else-is-dying-to eh, which leaves it at a 3.

I can say that the cornbread is exquisite. It's what cornbread should be. Corn and bread. It's not cornmeal trying to be cornbread. It's not some yuppie metropolitan height of sophistication's chef trying to be country. It's the no shit real deal. I appreciate that. I just have to remember to appreciate it in small quantities.

The service was pretty on par for it being lunch on a Monday. 

My main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point, but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe. I was pretty annoyed to see it came with tomato even though tomato was listed nowhere on the menu. I will remember that. I may just return and order cornbread with a side of cornbread.
