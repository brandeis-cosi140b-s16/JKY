I want to be fair to ol' Diego. Yelpers, I think your experience in this kind of place depends on the context. 

Me? I was looking for a tasty, relaxed place to have lunch in a casino. 

Key words: tasty, relaxed, lunch, casino.

I ordered the Chile Colorado and my friend ordered the tamales. We were both pleased enough. Would I return for another meal? Probably not. It's not Diego's fault. The food was fine. But it would not be worth a trip to the strip for a local. But if you are staying at the MGM, this place is great. And if you are partying at the MGM, this place is even better.

See what I mean about context? 

They probably deserve four stars based on my meal. Three things keep Diego from the the coveted four star approval: 

1) My friend was slightly less impressed with his meal than I   
2) They seemed crazy overwhelmed by a conference. Don't they get notice about these things? The wait staff remained professional (read composed), but the hostess was clearly frazzled. And why don't they open more of the dining area for a huge lunch rush? Oh well, I'm sure they have their reasons. Like I said, I won't be back, so I won't spend any time worrying about such things. 
3) The salsa was rather pedestrian 

In short: Everything was fine. I just need more...heart in my Mexican food if I'm going to travel to the strip and battle a crowd.
