It took me a long time to find a great Mexican Restaurant in Scottsdale, so I was very excited to find Frank and Lupe's!   The chips and salsa (one of my favorite parts of the meal) are delicious and I have been satisfied with them every visit.  I also have never been disappointed in the food.  
I have to agree with some previous reviews that the service is terrible.  At times it seems like you need to beg to even eat there and they are never friendly to the customers!  Improved service would make this a 5 star review!
