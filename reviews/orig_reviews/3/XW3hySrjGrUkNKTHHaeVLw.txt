The Steel Cactus is def. A-OK in my book.  The biggest selling point is the deck - I would go as far to say this is one of the best decks in the 'burgh.  It's HUGE, with ample seating, AND offers a glass-covered ceiling so you can enjoy the outdoors without worrying about the elements.  In our fair city, that's key since it does rain here every once in awhile ;)

Daily drink specials are offered, as well as Happy Hour and Late-Night deals.  This makes Steel Cactus ideal for a slightly-younger crowd than myself.  No hate there, just an observation.  The peeps enjoying the deck last night were most certainly in the mid-20s age bracket.

I enjoyed the Carna Asada Enchiladas, per @Kristian M.'s suggestion.  I'm usually hesitant to order steak in any of my Mexican food, at the risk of it not being a good cut and then ruining the whole entr√©e.  Not the case at the Steel Cactus; the steak was tender, juicy, and had a great flavor.

SC is a fun place to enjoy tasty adult beverages on special and above-average Mexican treats in a youthful, energetic atmosphere on one of Pittsburgh's Premier Porches.
