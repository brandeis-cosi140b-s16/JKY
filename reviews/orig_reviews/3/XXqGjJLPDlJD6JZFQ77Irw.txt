I think this might be the first three star or lower dinner experience I've had in Vegas? Or maybe the second? I have such good luck with restaurants here, that this was disappointing.

Dinner started with a salsa that I think was about 50% garlic by volume. Absolutely inedible. I had one chip worth, and pushed it away so I wouldn't have to think about it. Probably the worst salsa I have ever had. And I've had the salsa at Chili's. But that was saved by the table side guac, which was made nice and citrus-y, with serrano chiles, tomato, and no onion, per my request. Tasted very good, and I like their chips, which are the right amount of salty, with almost a sweet taste to the chip itself.

I can't turn down ceviche, so the bay scallop with grapefruit, mango, and habanero was next on this list. And this was really very good. Nice big helping, great citrus flavor, plenty of heat, and sweet, tender scallops. Absolutely worth getting again. Unfortunately, the main entree, barbacoa enchiladas, was just...nothing special. I wanted it to be better, but the beef didn't have much flavor, and the rice/beans similarly lacked any kind of punch. The whole dish was just blah.

Service was a little indifferent? It was fine, not rude. Just...aloof? Not that I expect them to make friends. Anyway. I expected the least from this meal of all the meals I had planned during this week's trip, and I think that's been borne out as I sit writing reviews for them all at once. I'm not...too angry about this, but in a place like Vegas, the thought that I know of restaurants where I could have had anywhere from a very good to a transcendent meal is floating around in the back of my head.
