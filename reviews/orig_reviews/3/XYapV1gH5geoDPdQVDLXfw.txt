I have eaten here three times, trying to give the restaurant another shot after previous visits. I have not returned since then. My cuban sandwich was rather dry, nothing inside the sandwich only the meat. Bread was ok, but could have been fresher. The side dishes could also be fresher, since you can taste the reheated food and hardly any taste. Beans a bit salty; fried plantains lacked salt, we had to add it; portions kind of small for the price charged. Food needs more flavor, in general.  The place is good for entertainment and drinks; after the drinks, you won't tell the difference on the flavor of your food!
