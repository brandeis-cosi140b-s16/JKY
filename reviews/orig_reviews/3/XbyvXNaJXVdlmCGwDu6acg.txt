My son & I came here to eat after an Adventure Run and ordered the chicken quesadilla & the chicken tender kid's meal. 
We were both disappointed with our meals. The chicken quesadilla did not have enough cheese in there and chicken tender in the kid's meal was not real chicken- it was processed. The fruit that came with the meal was not fresh, it was the canned fruit kind except it came in a plastic cup. So neither one of us really enjoyed our meal. The chicken quesadilla was a large portion size and came with sour cream & lettuce & tomato. The kid's meal portion was small. My son was still hungry afterwards. 
The complimentary chips & salsa was tasty. 
The place was packed with runners from the Adventure Run and it did not seem like they had enough waitstaff. My son had to grab the waiter twice to get his attention. 
Overall, the atmosphere is good. We would go back and give the menu another try but I would not recommend anything on the kid's menu. Better off ordering off of the regular menu and have leftover to take home for the kids.
