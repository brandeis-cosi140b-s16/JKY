Calrsbad Tavern was good. I'd heard a lot about it before going, so my expectations were high. The food was a little pricier than I think it was worth. I did enjoy the multiple salsas they offer with the chips in salsa (thanks for the check-in offer on yelp). I had the combo (enchilada, chile, and burrito) so I could get a good variety. The food had good flavor, but there wasn't anything very special about the dish.
