I am rating their take out service. I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea, but the "take out" area is crappy. You feel like you're in a closet. I know I'm getting it to go, but do we really have to come in the back door and stand in an area that could fit 3 people max? It just really turned me off. Anyway, the price for the food you get is great. I had a chicken burrito enchilada style with rice and beans. It's "eh". I've had a lot better, have had worse. It's mediocre. The enchilada sauce on the burrito doesn't really taste like much, the rice has a nasty flavor, and the beans are bland. Favorite thing about the meal? The salsa. That's about it.
