Not bad, not great. Got a bacon breakfast burrito, added ham. Good burrito, but it wasn't that hot. Given, we drove over somewhere else to eat them, so they may have lost their temp on the way over, but if they were hot to begin with, the cheese would have melted, which it didn't. No big deal, still not a bad burrito. Nothing to write home about, though. I definitely want to try it again, eat it right away and give it another chance.

Not really blown away like other reviewers were.
