Aww, why all of the bad reviews, my fellow yelpers?  This place isn't so bad, especially if you are hung over, hungry, and half asleep.  This place is perfect for a cheap breakfast to make you feel human again.

Sprinkled along the Vegas strip, I'm sure plenty of La Salsa Cantina's are the equivalent of McDonald's, but with a heartier affair and with better service.  We had 11 in our party and one awesome man named Javier served us all and with such a pleasant smile that after we finished our breakfast of champions and while all the rest of my party gave him good-bye high fives, I extended a little more thank you with a good-bye hug.  He was willing to deal with our rowdy group to make sure we ate well and left with a smile.  Well, we did so thank you!

The food is average, but how can you beat $3.95 for eggs, potatoes, and choice of bacon or sausage?  Of course I skipped the pork, but eggs and potatoes were pretty tasty.  A side of french toast for $2 was a perfect accompaniment.  Not to be forgotten, my double bloody mary (also $2) was pretty damn good too.

I can't be all judgy for a cheap delicious breakfast offered on the Vegas strip.  Looking for a little more morning glam?  Not La Salsa..but if you're looking for what I detailed above, step right up, don't be shy, and ask for Javier!
