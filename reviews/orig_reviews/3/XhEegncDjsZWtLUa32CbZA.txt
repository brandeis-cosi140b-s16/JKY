Good food and drinks, not the best service. We were never asked how our food was, my friend didn't have a bite of her food. He dropped the check and we were planning on ordering dessert, and never asked if we wanted more to drink....in was cinco de mayo... We WANTED more to drink!!!! One of my friends even said she was only here to drink....nope never asked her if she wanted another...bad move mustache man!
