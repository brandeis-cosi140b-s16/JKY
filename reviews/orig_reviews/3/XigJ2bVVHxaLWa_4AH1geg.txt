Went here tonight on my first night in Vegas. Wanted something convenient, affordable and spicy!

Service was responsive, but nothing too out of the norm or exciting. Three stars.

I ordered the Beef Flautas, came with about 6 pieces, maybe 3 flautas cut into halves. Drizzled with sour cream and with guac, black beans, and cilantro in the middle. Yumm! Four stars. $11

To start, though, I ordered the Queso Fandido or something like that. It comes with tortillas, but it's pretty much just a glob of melted cheese. I'm used to eating queso that has dip-ability (haha, word creation ftw), but this one was the equivalent of microwaving shredded cheeze and adding chorizo as a garnish. Would not order again for overpriced nuked cheese. Two stars. $12

In addition to these items, I had a white peach margarita, made with patron, but I think it needed a little more alcohol to be worth the price. Still, it had a good taste. Four stars. $12


But what you MUST have which was wonderful, were the chips and salsa. YUM YUM YUM. And for Free! These chips had a fresh crunch, not sure if they were made in house, but I'd love to have some at home when I cook tacos. Served with chipotle and green verde salsas. Five stars!

An overall average place, but a little pricey for what you get. Go for happy hour, if you have a coupon, or if you find that one irresistible dish that makes it worth it.
