I got a gift certificate from Restaurants.com for $50 off $100 check so we thought we would check this place out.
We show up and love the set up. It is a open area of tables so it is great to people watch. After the hostess quickly seats us, it takes about 10 minutes for anyone to notice us and bring us menus. After about another 15 minutes they bring out chips and salsa and we ask to give our order. It takes about 10 more minutes for our server to come around. We then finally get water so we can actually eat the chips and salsa which were spicey. 
After finally getting our food I can say the food is a positive at this place and worthy of 4 stars but the service was horrible and only about 1.5 stars. They brought out the wrong food items and then took forever to bring the right things.
It is a shame they can't get their act together because the food and atmosphere was great.
