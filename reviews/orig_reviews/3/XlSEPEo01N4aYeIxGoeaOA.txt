Only went here to meet friends for happy hour and sat at the bar on the most cushioned giant sized barstools.  These stool were so tightly packed together that it was difficult to use and without back support they were not comfortable for long.
The staff was very attentive upon our arrival but once they discovered that we were waiting for a fourth to join us it was impossible to get the servers attention again with any regularity. 
In order to take advantage of the happy hour prices (which I recommend as the menu is pricey) food was ordered prior to the last member arriving.  The appetizer portions were generous. The party tried the prime rib sliders which were tasty although a little too fatty for their liking.  The meatball skewers were next. The meatball was a little dry but it was covered in a tomato sauce that had some good spiciness. It was awesome. 
Also tried the chicken lettuce wraps.  They were a bit disappointing in so much as the chicken used was a cold chicken salad style instead of a warmed chicken. 
Overall I wouldn't mind giving this place another chance to be able to sample some of the dinner and salad items.  But as others state...you better make a reservation.
