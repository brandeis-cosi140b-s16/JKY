My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time last night and it was solid.  We didn't have to wait long for a table indoors (they could seat us outside immediately but we opted to wait 10 minutes to sit inside) and the service was prompt.  We split fajitas, which were decent.  We did need to ask for more tortillas, then a side of rice (they only came with beans and some pico de gallo) and an extra side of pico.  We will definitely be back to try some other options on their menu.  

Oh and the huge pond outside with the ducks and turtles seemed a huge hit with everyone - kids and adults alike!  It was fun to go out there after dinner and watch the kids feed the animals.
