This place was a mixed bag. I went here for my brother's going away party last night. The restaurant itself is nothing too nice looking, just kind of a standard restaurant. I didn't like that they charge for chips and salsa, and that they only brought out one bowl of chips and one little plate with three salsas on it, when we had a party of about 10.... kind of stingy. The salsas were good, though, especially the tomatillo salsa. My brothers got the ceviche and said it was good, I tried it and was not a fan, but I'm not a fan of ceviches in general so I can't really evaluate it. I ordered the pollo relleno. This was really tasty. It was a chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese, corn, and peppers. It had a good green sauce too. The mashed potatoes it came with were weird tasting and the veggies were nothing special. I also tried my dad's steak with chimichuri sauce... it was ok, but nothing special and I would not order that. I tried the carne adobada and didn't think that was so great... it tasted alright, but the sauce was not so great. I also tried the west coast burrito. (I tried a bunch... big family, you know?) The burrito was pretty good. I would come back for the salsa verde and the pollo relleno, especially if they offer another groupon. I think the place can be very good, if you order the right thing.
