First of all I don't know if this is Barrio Cafe's problem or yelps, but it would be a stretch to categorize this place as mexican.  I'm from Houston and I expect my mexican food to come with rice and beans.  My enchiladas sat there all alone on the plate.  While they were fairly tasty, I couldn't help but notice how lonely they were, sitting there with not one other thing next to them.  It just wasn't right.  The saving grace?  The table-side prep of the guac.  It was the best guac ever.  Who puts cranberries in their guacamole?  Me from NOW ON!  It was incredible!  I could see myself going back for a drink with some chips and guac but not for a meal.
