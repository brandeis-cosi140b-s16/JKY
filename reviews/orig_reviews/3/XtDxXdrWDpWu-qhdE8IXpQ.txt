My hopes were very high with the rave reviews. I'm still on the hunt for the best carne asada burrito in Vegas. 

Carne asada burrito Zapatas special- 3 stars. The special has sour cream, guacamole, and some other stuff inside. It was okay...I've had better.

Beef chimichanga- 5 star. It was my friend's dish and it was def better than mine. It was fried to perfection and the shredded beef was delicious! 

Free chips and salsa- super super good. I almost want to say their chips are the best I've ever had. I keep saying that it seems, but I swear these are reaalllllllly good chips. The salsa was good, only because it has a major kick to it. 

Service was excellent. 

I'm giving 3.5 stars. I'll be back for the chips and the chimichanga someday.
