Went here with a Friend before a concert. He saw then reviewed on diners-drive-ins-and-dives. I loved the TAVARUA (TAV-A-ROO) TUNA TACOS. One of the best fish tacos I have had. Tasted like sushi if you can believe that. I also tried the BBQ MAHI TACOS. No that impressed. It was good but I was not blown away. As for the tortilla chips they were stale? This is why I am not giving Cabo 4 stars. Along with that, they give you Corn Salsa and personally not my favorite, I would rather have a tomato based salsa. But that is me. Furthermore, you have to buy your GUACAMOLE and GREEN TOMATILLO SALSA for $6.50 and $3.95. The Guac was not great and only a ice cream scoop worth for $6.50. Need to offer free salsa. The good is this is not your average Mexican taco join. They do have burritos as well but did not try any.
