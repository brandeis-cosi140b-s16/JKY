We landed at this restaurant on a whim.

Service was excellent - 5 STARS
Food was okay - 2-1/2-3 STARS

CHIPS - too thick but had good flavor
SALSA - was tasty

PORK TACOS - Very good

CARNE ASADA TACOS (extra crispy) - Absolutely the worst I've ever had!  They were so dry! The taco was a store bought white corn tortilla and baked - completely fell apart at the first bite.  Nothing in the taco but the meat and a little lettuce - it was so frickin dry and tasteless I asked for sour cream - it didn't help.

RICE - White rice, a little corn and seasoned well.  Very different than typical Mexican rice. It was okay.

PINTO BEANS - served in a little dish, tasted okay, very little cheese (goat I think)  if any.

This is not typical Mexican food - I find it's more of a healthy version.  Prices were steep - $14.00 for the Taco meal.  Also, portions are small.

Waitress asked if everything was okay and normally never do this but I told her, "they were the worst tacos I ever had.  They were so dry and just completely fell apart.  Obviously your restaurant doesn't cook with a lot of cheese," I said.

She was nice enough to remove my meal from the bill - hence 3 stars.

I think for many of us eating at restaurants everyone has a good or bad experience.  Usually though with a first bad experience we tend not to go back. End of story.
