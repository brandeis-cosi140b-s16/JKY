Everyone must be reading all the bad reviews about here as every other sit down place to eat was packed, and it was pretty empty here...
There were numerous open tables & the bar was pretty empty... So I sat at the bar, thinking I Would he served much faster.

A tall Dos Equis and some Nachos, a little pricey, but i am in the airport.

The Dos Equis was good and cold, not a biggie, but I have had crappy tap beer in the past.

The nachos came out quickly, (probably because how empty the place was), and they were hot and over all  not too bad.
(They did have some weird pickled onion thing on top...weird for nachos, I picked those off)

Over all, it was what you would expect for airport food. Not amazing, but not bad. And a little pricey, but nothing more than any other airport restaurant. 
A solid 3 stars.
