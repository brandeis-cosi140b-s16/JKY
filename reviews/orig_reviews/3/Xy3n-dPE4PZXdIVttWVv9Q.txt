So so so.......what to say...I actually enjoyed my meal. Was it tasty? Yes. But was it anything special? Nope! 

Ordered CABO AZUL: Maine lobster with shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab/ COSTILLA DE RES: short ribs Osso Bucco style/ TACOS DE CAMARON: shrimp, duh.

The COSTILLA DE RES marinated in a spicy tomato and serrano chili sauce was super DUPER tender and juicy. Although the meat was perfectly cooked, the "spicy sauce" fell short. I was craving for that spicy serrano bite. Still flavorful and enjoyable, but it just needed that "in your face" spice.

The CABO AZUL & TACOS DE CAMARON, I thought was deliciously...average. Good quality freshness in the seafood. I just wasn't blown away. 

My $15 cocktail was really good though! Basically a margarita but I requested it with muddled jalape√±os. I was really craving some kind of heat with my meal. Finally! I got some spice that lingered happily in my mouth. BOOM!
