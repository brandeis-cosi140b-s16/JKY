We had a groupon for this place and were in the area so we decided to cash it in.  We sat at the bar.  It took a little bit for someone to notice us but after that the service was great.  The food was ok.  Not anything I would seek out again but our friends mentioned they go here for happy hour and love it so we would definitely try it again with them.

We started with the Papi's trio.  The salsa was great, the guac was great, but the queso dip was not very good.  Too much spinach.  I ordered the grilled chicken entree.  A little too much oil but nicely seasoned.

It's worth trying.
