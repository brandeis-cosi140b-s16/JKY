This place is, average. It used to be my favorite Mexican food place, but their prices have increased for no apparent reason. My last visit was a bit disappointing which has earned it the 3 stars. The food was mediocre and the service did not exceed my expectations. If I have to find you for more chips and salsa, there's a problem.
