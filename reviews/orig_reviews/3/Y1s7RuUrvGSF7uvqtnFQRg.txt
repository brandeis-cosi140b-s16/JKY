Visited the restaurant for a Sunday lunch. It has a very good Mexican ambience and is perfect for both indoor and outdoor seating. They have a huge duck pond which makes for good viewing while you eat. The mandatory chips and salsa are good. The green one is the best. We had the shrimp ceviche which was very refreshing with the cucumber, avocado, onions and cilantro in tomato broth. I know I wil enjoy it on a warm summer day ( I tried it on a rainy day) . The other dishes we had were ok, nothing wow, nothing disastrous. Service was very good. Satisfied overall.
