It has been awhile since I reviewed Mucho Gusto.  I always used to come for lunch and was never disappointed so thought it would be a good place to meet a friend for drinks and a little food after work.  It was alright... the service was actually pretty bad. I did hear the waitress serving the table next to us that they were short staffed so I guess I can cut them a little slack.  Beyond that though the food was not that memorable this time either and my dinner companion agreed:).    Doesn't mean that I wont come back  I will give them another shot sometime soon:).
