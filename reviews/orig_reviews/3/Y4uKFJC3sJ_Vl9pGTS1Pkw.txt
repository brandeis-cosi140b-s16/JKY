I like the food but the menu made it difficult for me to get what I want so I always go along with having the same order as my sister,  she is completely obsessed with their food  that there not a week she doesn't eat them. And good thing she got a coupon from them cause it bit pricey for one meal. But other than that the food are definitely delicious because the place get so pack on certain day and hour (I'm not sure when) They also have an outdoor seating area.
