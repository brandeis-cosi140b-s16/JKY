Myself and another quickly found a spot at the bar received service with in a few minutes... Drinks were 6 on a 10 scale... Nothing to rave about... Service was 5 on a 10 scale not bad...Not attentive nor suggestive, cleanliness was 5 on a 10 scale... Not eager to eat the food. (Cobwebs around the bar) this is the type of place if you wanna get drunk with friends... But not to impress company.
