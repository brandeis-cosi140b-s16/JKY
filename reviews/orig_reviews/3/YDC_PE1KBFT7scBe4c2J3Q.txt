I've had a mixed experience at Rosita's. The first time I came, I ordered their signature dish with chicken, that came absoutely swimming in melted cheese. I should've known, as Lauren V. noted, Rostia's serves Arizona-style Mexican food for the most part, which means uber helpings of cheese and sauce.

Wiser the second time I went, I ignored my waiter's advice to order another dish that seemed to be also a prime candidate for cheese drowning, and went for the fish tacos, which were quite good and served with a heaping portion of rice and beans.

I should also give props to the salsa, which was somewhat spicy but comes with extra hot sauce to add to one's own pleasure. While this seems common out in Arizona, it's a tradition that should make its way east, for sure. 

I guess it all depends what you're looking for. Most of the dishes here seem to be in the "cover with as much cheese and sauce as possible" category. If that's your bag, then you're set. I, on the other hand, feel I need to choose very carefully here.
