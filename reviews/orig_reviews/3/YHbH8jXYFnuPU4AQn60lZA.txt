Still in search for the best Al Pastor in town!

Taco Taco fairs well but average IMO! The al pastor was good, but not above the rest. They were completely out of Lengua and Chorizo, so I wasn't able to try them! The Asada was also average in my opinion.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-taco-mexican-eatery-las-vegas?select=GHocOcTO-lY_e310BQcHFA#GHocOcTO-lY_e310BQcHFA

I usually don't order Tripas, but I decided to break from the norm and give it a go since they were out of most everything else. It was crispy, flavorful, and good!

I really like their salsa bar here...8 different salsas, beans, veggies, etc! Way more expansive than any other I have ran into so far, and it keeps it fun and interesting!  It was a little odd adding salsa to tacos that already had salsa though, so this is more for people that ask for plain?  Probably for burrito orders and misc too.

But since I am still searching for the best, I have to move on to the next!  Who else do I have to try??  Message me!
