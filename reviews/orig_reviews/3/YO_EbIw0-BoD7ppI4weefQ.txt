I have such fond experiences of eating here with my girlfriends when it first opened a few years ago, but my most recent visit wasn't nearly as delicious as I remembered. I don't know whether my taste has improved since my starving college student years or whether the restaurant has changed, but it was no longer the mind-blowing food I recalled. 

We ordered the Golden Pigs, the Beef Shumai, Lobster Tacos, and for dessert, Mango Sticky Rice and Churros (we like dessert). The pigs were basically donuts filled with BBQ pork, and they were quite tasty when drenched with the accompanying condensed milk. The shumai weren't really anything to write home about, but the lobster tacos were the real disappointment! As my coworker put it, "for $10 a taco, I expected them to taste good." The lobster was completely overwhelmed by an abundance of lime and grapefruit, making the tacos quite acidic and sour. The mango sticky rice was an interesting twist on the classic Thai dessert, as the rice was puffed and sprinkled on top of mango and ice cream which was covered in quite a lot of whipped cream. It was light and interesting, and I enjoyed it. The churros were nice but not particularly special. 

Overall I'm a bit disappointed in the experience, and I hope they will start putting more effort into the food here.
