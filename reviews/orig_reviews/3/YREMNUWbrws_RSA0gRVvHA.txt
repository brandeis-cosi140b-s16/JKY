Z'Tejas is your typical "higher end" chain restaurant. Good for families or casual yet sit-down meals. They do southwestern, tex mex, with a good mix of seafood, too. 

I really liked the the corn bread that's complimentary..haha! Super warm, fluffy and delicious.

Weak wine list, but good margaritas/drinks. Service was great - our servers were constantly checking on us!

 Overall, a decent option in Chandler, especially for groups of 2-6 people. Lots of the food is shareable.
