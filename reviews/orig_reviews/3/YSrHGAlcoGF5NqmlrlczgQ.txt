The three stars is only for the lovely server I had . She was amazing and tried to make my night , she even sang karaoke in an english song ( she made my day ) .The problem was I attempte to order a beverage off the menu. The first drink I ordered they did not have as we'll as the second and third drink . Therefore, I finally just ordered a beer which was amazing ! Although this is discouraging to customers who order a drink then being told they do not have it 3 times
