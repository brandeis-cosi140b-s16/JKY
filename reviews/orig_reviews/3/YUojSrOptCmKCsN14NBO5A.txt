I've been going to Casa Don Juan for years, but hadn't visited in more than 6+ months. It looks like the plating and service has changed quite a bit. This time around I went in with a groupon (2 Dinner entrees and 2 Jumbo Cadillac Margaritas for a $46 value) and a group of 3 people.

We tried ordering a Thursday special of Sopes without the margaritas they come with and we were told they couldn't charge us for the food without the drinks. Having tasted the jumbo cadillac margaritas we had received from the initial groupon we turned down the offer of getting additional margaritas. Why you might ask? They tasted less than mediocre and whoever made them was horrible at mixing! It also shows the lack of flexibility and management experience when the manager doesn't know how much to charge for food if its not printed on a 'special' pamphlet as well. We didn't mind paying a difference, and ended up ordering one Sope as a separate dish which truly wasn't a sope but a tortilla with chorizo on it.  

I give Casa Don Juan 3 stars for seating us promptly and being attended quickly by the servers with chips, bean dip and drinks. The restaurant was clean and it had musicians playing authentic Mexican Corridos with guitars. Definitely set the mood. The cheese dip was great and so was the handmade corn tortillas! But the food is fair, there's no sopa de fideo and we couldn't get over the horrible alcoholic beverages. Some of the staff doesn't understand English, glad we're Mexican and can speak spanish! Parking is also bit tricky and difficult to find-  unless you want to park at a meter-  because it was packed! Not the best yet not the worst experience. Our final bill was $65, we only paid about $30 with tip due to the groupon. For that amount you could go to another Mexican restaurant in a nicer area/location. Maybe in 6+months the food and service will change again. Till then, happy eating!
