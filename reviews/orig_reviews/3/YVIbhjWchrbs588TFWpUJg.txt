I came across this place under Yelp's "Hot New Businesses" and was in the 'hood so thought I'd give it a try.  I came mid afternoon to avoid the lunch rush and ordered the beach house burger with sweet potato tots.  The tots were great as I'm a fan of all things sweet potato,  The chips were ok, maybe just overshadowed by the glory of the tots.  I'd like an option to sub the tots for the chips at  reduced price, as my order (with a water) came to over $10.  The burger was good, the toasted bun maybe could have been a little less....toasted.... as that flavor sort of overpowered everything else.  It was good overall, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back unless I had some other reason to be in the area.
