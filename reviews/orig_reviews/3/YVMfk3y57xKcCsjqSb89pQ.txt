5 stars for the chicken, green chili, and also the corn chowder, which was amazing. 

But the rest of the food was nothing special. 

My chimichanga was really greasy. And it's the first time I have ever NOT eaten all the Guac at a restaurant. 

Okay, waitress just came and we weren't charged for the chimi. That was nice of them. 

But since we would never go back, the place gets 3 stars from me.
