I don't know...Maybe I've been spoiled by a couple of better Mexican places. 
When I first moved here, I went to this place because it was really close to my house, and I remember thinking, "Wow! This is great and so close by. I can eat here 5 times per week."
But recently I re-visited, and came to the conclusion that this place is on the pricy side, (especially for lunch.)
It is the most expensive Mexican place that I've been to since I've lived here, but keep in mind that I've only been to 4 or 5.
The atmosphere is good, the service is good, the food isn't bad.
But the bottom line...The food just isn't worth the price.
Sorry.
