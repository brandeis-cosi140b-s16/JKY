service: 2 stars
food: 4 stars

the food was awesome. my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed it. i loved the free chips and salsa. bean dip was also offered, but it was kinda meh to me. i had the enchiladas suizas. she had the chimichanga. my enchiladas were crazy yummy - fantastically tangy tomatillo sauce, tender chicken, soft corn tortillas and a healthy amount of cheese with sour cream on the side. my beans were covered in cheese and the rice was really, really good. she said she really liked her chicken chimi, and it showed - she ate every bite of it.

now, let's get to the service side of this lovely experience. i asked for a margarita recommendation; server couldn't come up with one. i decided to stick with water; my friend ordered diet pepsi. after 3 requests (to two different people) and 20 minutes, the diet pepsi finally arrived. like i said, my friend really liked the chimi, it wasn't what she ordered. she ordered the 2 chimi plate, one chicken, one beef. oh well. 

the bill was cheap ... around $24 for the two of us. the food was ready fast and like i said, it was really, really good. i know this is kinda inconsequential, but  i still think it is worth mentioning: i absolutely hate it when restaurants print the calculated 10%, 15% and 20% gratuity amounts on the receipt. tacky, tacky, tacky! and a really bad way to end a tasty meal.
