Verde, verde, what can I say...I love your decor and space, however the food has been hit or starve. I went once for lunch and enjoyed the Torta and chips, it was just filling enough but for the price, a 12 or 13 dollar sandwich should leave you with leftovers. Then I had the eggs benedict, which was served without sides and for brunch. For those who don't know, brunch is a combination of lunch and dinner and should be more filling than the average meal, justifying its possible extra cost. This eggs benedict left me hungry. The salsa has changed many times, and it its most recent iteration, it is kind of like BBQ sauce or chutney. If you go to this place hungry, and want brunch, I recomend the ham torta, which has an egg on it and is more filling than other dishes. Overally, this place is fine and would be GREAT if they lowered the prices.
