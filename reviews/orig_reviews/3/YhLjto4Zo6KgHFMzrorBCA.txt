I live in West Phoenix, and don't get out to this particular area often, but I've been teaching a class nearby, so I'm taking advantage of the opportunity to try some local spots.
  I was happy with the Blue Adobe. I ordered a Tenderloin Ceasar wrap, and it was quite good. The tortillas are great. The wrap made a great lunch.
  I was surprised by a side of frys. They were decent, but didn't make sense with the main course.
  The food was good, the staff friendly and courteous. A little expensive for lunch - expect to spend about $10-15 per person.
