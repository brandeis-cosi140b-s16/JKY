Food is 5 stars 

Atmosphere is 5 stars 

Music playlist is 5 stars

Services ruined it all for me. This seems to be a trend with central Phx restaurants. Maybe it is a vibe I don't understand? We are all about relaxing, but I still expect my drinks to be filled in a timely manner. We got things done quicker by asking random servers that passed by, rather than our server doing it. 

Will try again and get the stars up hopefully.
