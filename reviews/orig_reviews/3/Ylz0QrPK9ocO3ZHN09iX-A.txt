We went to Secreto with moderate expectations given the reviews.  The service was fantastic and we had an excellent and very attentive server.  

We ordered a Margarita and Sangria.  Both were very very substandard and cannot see myself ordering mixed drinks in the future.  

The food did appear flavorful with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla done perfect, the Carne Adovada House Special both a real hit.  The Aztec Chicken came with a wonderful presentation, but it lacked any depth in flavor.  

Overall, the food is above average though pricey.
