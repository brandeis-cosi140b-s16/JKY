Stopped in for lunch with husband and son.  Divey but clean enough.  Quick service - ordered at counter.  $25.00 for the three of us. 

Authentic.

Quesadilla was average and fine. Two fish tacos were average in taste and portion.  Carne asada was juicy and flavorful enough (had a taco and a burrito).  Burrito was big.  Bean and cheese burrito was average in flavor and size.  Got a side of refried black beans .  I think that was my favorite thing.  Got refried pintos too.  They were good.  Three little cups of sauce were with all that came with all of our order.  All green but very good.  Wished for more sauce.  Wished for red.  Little limes were pretty dry.  It happens.  The grilled onions and two hot peppers were nice but cold.  Wished for warm.  Drinks are in a fridge (cokes, and such in cans, glass bottles, etc).  

Price is average for the food presented.  All in paper and cardboard containers on a plastic tray.  Napkin dispenser.  Kind and friendly people.  Sat outside.  Guy brought it all out to us.  Simple lunch.  Okay.
