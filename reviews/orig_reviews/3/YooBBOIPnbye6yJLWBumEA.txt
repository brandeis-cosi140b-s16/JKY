Round 2 this time for dinner. Realizing all these local Gilbert restaurants do not take reservations is a huge turn off for us. 6:30, and it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 2 and honestly the managing of the table space is ridiculous...sitting 2 people in a huge booth for easily 6. Badly designed, bad seating management.

The food as I had reviewed before was really good, service was excellent. The $8 Citrus Vodka was so weak (not worth the calories). The basic margaritas were excellent. We had the Guacamole and Chips, 3 Taco platter with a side, and The Beast burritos w/no sauce.

If we came again for dinner I would either advice eating earlier (then I feel like an early bird "snow bird") or coming late late.
