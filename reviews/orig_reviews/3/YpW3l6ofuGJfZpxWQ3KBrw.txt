The food was pretty good. Got an arepa and a beef empanada with a small side of rice and beans. The small side was taken literally as they give you almost sample cup sizes of each. My whole order came out to about $19. I did feel full however my pockets felt much lighter. I'll go to there sister location Three Amigos from now on.
