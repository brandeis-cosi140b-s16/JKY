I'm all about the local haunt, and this one being literally down the street from me, I had to give it a try.  The one thing that I LOVE about Los Taquitos is that in Arizona (where people mistakenly assume that the Mexican food is good no matter where you go), they are proving that a delicious plate of food doesn't have to come at a premium.  You could go down the street to Macayo's and get a meal for twice the price and half the flavor.  More than price, value is king these days, and Los Taquitos knows the drill.

I tend to judge the quality of a restaurant on the goodness of their machaca, and Los Taquitos does an excellent job for the low price point.  In their burritos, quesadillas and tamales, the meat is flavorful and moist.  I second the vote of others on the rice and beans being tasty - I particularly enjoyed the rice in its fluffy, flavorful goodness.  It didn't taste like an afterthought.  Spring for the side of guacamole - it's a welcome addition to the plate, particularly if you're sopping up the whole mess with a bag of chips.

My husband and I ate like kings and didn't even manage to kill a $20.  That's some real majesty.  We'll be back for seconds, I promise.
