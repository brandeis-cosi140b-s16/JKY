I started off with a Saoco (silver rum, coconut juice, simple syrup, lime; $7.50). It just tasted like a non-minty mojito. All of my guy friends got different mojitos. We all took our first sip and cringed. "Too sweet," was the consensus. I looked over at the bar and my suspicions were confirmed: girl bartender. But still, the drinks were good. Didn't stop us from ordering three more rounds. 

I also got a Cuban milkshake. My Cubano friend recommended the guayaba and guanabana mix ($5). He said the flavors separate are shit. But with their powers combined are mighty yummy. Might yummy indeed. I can't describe the flavor accurately. It was kind of cakey, but still tropical. Maybe a little banana-ish. 

We ordered the tostones. They're like little griled plantains with cheese and your choice of meat: shrimp, ground beef, or shredded beef. We got the Mezcla de Tostones ($11), a combo of all of the meats. They were okay. 

I ordered the Camerones al Aljillo ($19). A bit pricey for garlic shrimp. It was good, but with a recipe like shrimp, garlic, and butter, it had better be good. 

Cubano said the food was authentic and made him nostalgic for his madre's home cooking. I'll have to take his word for it. 

The service was a little slow. It was nice when we wanted to just sit around and shoot the shit, but not nice when we wanted to order another round or get the check. 

Havana Grill has live entertainment late on Fri and Sat nights and free salsa lessons Wed night.
