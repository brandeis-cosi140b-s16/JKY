If you love good old chips and salsa to start off your meal, you will be in absolute heaven.  I am not usually a big fan of fried stuff, but they have a crisp fluffy taste like the bottom of a tostada as their main chips selection.  I felt like I can almost eat a basketful!

I ordered chicken fajitas.  I have had better seasoned fajitas, but it came with a lot of good salsa and guac to enhance some lack of flavor.  

The overall ambiance is excellent here because you feel you are in a "casa" than more of a restaurant.
