Tacos El Gordo is a fine option. I wouldn't seek it out, however admiring I am of the ethic of a place that expands from Tijuana. 

I had lengua, cabeza, adobada and asada. Nothing jumped out as being anything better than good Mexican fast food. The asada was particularly uninspired. I suspect that that the meat is cut into small pieces before being marinaded and cooked. This method sacrifices juiciness and flavor.

Of the remaining three, lengua was probably the best. It'd be nice to counter the fattiness with something more bracing. 

In any event, Tacos El Gordo was fine. I'd go back. It's just nowhere near the level you'd expect from the median review, and nowhere near the best I've had in NY, CA, or even Chicago.
