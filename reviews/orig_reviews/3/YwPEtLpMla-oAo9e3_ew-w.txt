Late Night , semi drunkin' food spot - HELL YES!
For that - Perfect.

Amazing mexican food for you should travel for? Ya, not so much.
Although I have heard the burritos are AMAZING, have not had one. 
Eating a burrito at 2:30AM terrifies me! That is the only time I am here, so far.

Would I go back- ABSOLUTELY
Would I make a special trip across the city. Nope.

But would I drive all the way over to "Tacos El Gordo" for ANY REASON?
HELL YES I WOULD!!!
