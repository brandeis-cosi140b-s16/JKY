The food was good but not good enough for more than 3 stars. The best dish was the steak. They make fantastic chips and salsa though. The fish tacos was really good. They give 3 large pieces of perfectly battered fried fish. The yucatan pork was flavorful but some of my pork pieces were dry and hard. The server was exceptional.
