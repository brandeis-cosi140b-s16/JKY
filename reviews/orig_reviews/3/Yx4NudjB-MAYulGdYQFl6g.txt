I wanted steak and my wife wanted Mexican. Guess who won. Arrived on a cold Wednesday night and there weren't many people so sat right down. We ordered the chips and salsa. It was pretty good. My wife ordered the drunken chicken nachos. Not your typical nachos. They said they were a little spicy. Not really. They were really good though. I ordered the Gaucho Steak. Appeared to be a sirloin and was supposed to be rubbed with red pepper. Looked and tasted a lot like black pepper. I was over cooked as well. Luckily the mushrooms, asparagus, and potatoes were good so not a total loss. Although not worth the price tag. I mentioned the doneness issue to the waiter and a manager offered us two deserts. We decided on the key lime creme brute and cheesecake. The creme brute was pretty good. The cheesecake was average but good fruit.
