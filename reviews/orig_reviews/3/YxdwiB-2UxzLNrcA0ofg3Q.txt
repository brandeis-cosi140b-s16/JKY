This is a review of their night club (Latino night) - I didn't try the food or anything else. Local ladies are free to get in, my husband had to pay $10. 
The atmosphere inside is kind of tropical, and dress code was business/party casual. The dance floor got crowded pretty quick. 
The music was very rhythmic and I couldn't stand still and danced the whole night. The crowed was mixed. Tequila shots are $8 each for a small shot, ugh how I hate the expensive drinks in Las Vegas. Anyway, it was nice to try out this place and we had a good time. Will I be back? Maybe.
