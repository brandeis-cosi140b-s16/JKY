Went there on a sunday night around 8 no one else in the restaurant. The place says open till 10 so we went in man at the front was very unfriendly and rude the entire time. Lady in the back was nice. The mole tastes like pure chocolate sauce no spicy?  The taqitos were really good. Will never go back primarily due to rude service. Not even a thank you have a good night wow hope he wasn't the owner.
