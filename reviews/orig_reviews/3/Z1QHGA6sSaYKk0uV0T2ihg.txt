Went there for lunch and sat outside on a nice sunny day. Overall, I liked this place.  We had above average margaritas that were both huge and a good deal. I had chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The three enchiladas had a lot of chicken and a decent sauce that was flavorful but lacking heat. I liked the fresh tasting beans and the rice that sort of reminded me of fried rice.  I loved it. My wife had the dish tacos which were excellent. They had a lot of tasty fish with good slaw and sauce to make your own. I rate this as above average suburban Mexican. Not amazingly authentic but fresh and tasty. I would go back, and their happy hour looks great.
