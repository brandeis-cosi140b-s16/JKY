Border Grill in Mandalay Bay is probably one of the better cusines in the Resort. For lunch, I have tried the grilled chicken torta, this is a sandwich which consists of jalapeno bacon, poblano aioli, saint andre cheese, roasted poblano, caramalized onion and avocado. 

I have also tried several other appetizers such as the chicken quesedillas, sauteed shrimp,  empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. All of which are pretty good. I would probably eat here again if I was staying at Mandalay.
