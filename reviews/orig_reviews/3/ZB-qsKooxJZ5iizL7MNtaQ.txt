Place is alright. Nothing super special about it. Just your simple, good MEXICAN food. There is nothing really NEW MEXICAN about it besides the fact that they want to call it so. 

Try their own micro brew, its pretty good if u like NON-bitter beer.  Last time we had soup and some salad. Soup was OK if somewhat plain. Salad was fine without being anything special. 

All in all its not bad. Probably real good for big events as there is room a plenty.  Just to compare it is WAY way better then Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy, which easily ranks my own list of WORST Mexican Food places.
