All three of my stars go to the excellent, fresh, delicious taste of the carne asada, salsas, and guacamole. I can honestly say this place does have some great authentic tasting flavors. On the other hand....

Instead of going inside I decided to slip through the drive-thru since there were no cars in sight. I'm guessing the place must have been bumping inside, because I did wait a LONG time to get my food at the drive-thru. Instead of getting tacos, I decided to go for the carne asada torta with a side of chips and salsa (holy crap, they give you a huge bag of chips btw). The lady over the intercom for the drive-thru was hard to hear, and I know she was asking me if I wanted all the extras on my torta, well hell, I said yes - but be warned you will get an extra charge! However, it is worth it.

Unfortunately my torta was mooshy-mooshed by the time I got home! :( Not all of it mind you, but a good portion of the bread had just soaked up the guac and juicy meat leaving a messy bread pile wrapped inside of foil. I did salvage a majority of it though. The salvaged part was delish! So word of warning: do not get the torta to go, especially if you got all the extras put on it. And note: I only live about 5 minutes away from this place, so it's not like I had to drive 15 mins home with it sitting in my car.

Lastly, I must say even though they gave me a ton of chips, they were cold! Even Taco Bell serves me warm chips through the drive-thru window! *sigh* So, when I got home I warmed up the chips and they were very, very good and SALTY! Mmmm. Plus they gave me a TON of pico de gallo for dipping, but I don't like cilantro. I opted to dip my chips in the SPICY red sauce they gave me with my torta.

This place is authentic and it is incredibly popular. Unfortunately my experience was not-so-good. I do want to go back and try the tacos though! And next time perhaps I will dine-in instead of hitting up the drive-thru.
