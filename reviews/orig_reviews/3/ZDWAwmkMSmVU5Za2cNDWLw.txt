Friendly and fast service. I ordered the hard shelled tacos a la carte and those were really good but there was nothing chile relleno about the chile relleno I ordered. It looked like it had been deep fried a hundred times. The cheese was liquidy and the batter was not cooked all the way through even though they deep fried it. I would still go and try something else though. Nice place and great service. No beer or wine though :(
