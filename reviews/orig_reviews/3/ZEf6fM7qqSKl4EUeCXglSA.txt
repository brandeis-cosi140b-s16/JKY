I'll start my review with a couple of negative points I feel should be addressed by the owner(s):

If you try to call in your order (believe me - I've tried several times) you will not be successful.  Your call will be answered immediately then transferred into the black hole of take out.

When you arrive at the restaurant, the two girls at the front desk are NOT interested in your business..they have so much to gossip about -  you just don't rate.  They were so busy talking we were ignored on the way in and on our way out.

Despite the lapse in customer service:

Queso was excellent, just the right amount of kick.  They gave us two different types of salsa with our order, both were good.  Guacamole was fantastic, though if I had it prepared table side I would ask for extra cilantro.  We ordered their Mole Enchiladas with cheese enchiladas, their Mole is fantastic - spicy and thick with great flavor.  

Hopefully they will fix these minor service issues since I do plan on coming back.
