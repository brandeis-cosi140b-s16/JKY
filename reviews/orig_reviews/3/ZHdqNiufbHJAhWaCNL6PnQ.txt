Went to Z'Tejas last night for dinner after the movies. Nice atmosphere,smells nice. The waitress was very good and accommodating. However, i ordered the lamb chops and they were over cooked..Not that good for such an expensive item. My Date ordered the special.It was Pan fried Halibut.   Very dry they really over cooked and ruined it.    The cornbread was good.    So my review is they are getting by on their name,food is not that great. Service was great though.
