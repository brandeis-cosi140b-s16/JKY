Border Grill overlooks the Mandalay pools and is much better for drinks during the day than dinner at night. Granted, some of my biases are not the fault of the restaurant. Such as:

1. Due to the economy, Mandalay in general and BG specifically were a ghost town this past Friday. It was kinda depressing.

2. I prefer Mexican restaurants that are rundown, that serves you margaritas by the pitcher.

However there are faults with the service and food of the actual restaurant:

1. We ordered the Queso Fundido. Never got it.
2. I asked for my margarita without salt. It of course came with salt.
3. My scallops were very sour.
