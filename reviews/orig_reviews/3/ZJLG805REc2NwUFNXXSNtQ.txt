Absolutely not as bad as some of the reviews here suggest.

Despite always being keen for some other options at Town Square, wife and I were scared off by the negative Yelp vibe which has ranged between 2 and 2.5 star average and only recently has climbed to 3. I would say the three stars is just about right, bordering on 3.5.

We went during the happy hour which was uncrowded and the food was more than decent. Service was fine, too.

The only thing I would suggest is to get in line with the industry standard of free chips and salsa (keep the guac as an optional extra that you pay for) and possibly do something about the chips which I wasn't so keen on. They had a bit of an oily taste and seemed just the wrong side of being overcooked. Perhaps try a different oil or change it out more often -- I don't know. The salsa could be more interesting and I would love to see a bean dip.

Overall, though, the happy hour specials on appetizers was a great bargain. I enjoyed my wings and nachos for a decent price.

I'm not sure I would seek Coconuts out, but if I am at Town Square and fancy a bit of Mexican, I see no reason not to return. It's not remarkable, but not terrible, either -- get some better chips and salsa and they are a solid 4.
