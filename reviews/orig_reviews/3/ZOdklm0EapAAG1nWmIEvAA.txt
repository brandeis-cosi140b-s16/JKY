Its confusing when you first walk in.  Where are you suppose to go to order your food? Is each line for something specific like a taco vs a bowl? 

They don't have what kind of meat it is in English on the menu and the employees were busy so I ended up looking up each word on my phone. 

The food is tasty and meat is moist. 

Lack of organization, dirty tables and trash was wanting to come out of the trash container. Bartenders were pretty slow. Good margaritas, but the two bartenders I went to at separate times made different types of margaritas.  I didn't question/complain to them about it, it was just a margarita.
