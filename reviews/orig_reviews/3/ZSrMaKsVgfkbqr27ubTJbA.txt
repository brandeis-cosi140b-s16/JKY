This little place had a small-ish menu that was big on flavor. The fish tacos were crunchy and a bit soft on the inside. Shrimp tacos were absolutely delicious - firm and flavorful.  Their little salsa bar had some great choices with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, onions, avocado cr√®me, and three kinds of salsas. The rock shrimp quesadilla was pretty tasty too. If you've a hankering for fish tacos, stop on in and pay them a visit. They've been in business about three months and are friendly and clean.
