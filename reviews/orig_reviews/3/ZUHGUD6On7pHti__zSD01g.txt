Last night we had a group of people so we hit Mi Amigo's in the Arizona Center since we were staying nearby. Most of the group are on limited funds, so we thought a pretty tasty chain would be ok. Now as I write this there are things that make me want to bump it to a four then other things that make me want to bump it down.

Let's see... I wasn't sure what to order and everything looked just about average in terms of dishes, so I ended up with Chile Rellenos. I rarely ever get this, so I figured tonight would be the night. Our waitress took forever to come over at first and I felt like she wasn't completely with it. She may be bilingual and a little less with the English, so she was very very quiet. She got half our table drinks and then disappeared. Eventual she came back with the others, but she could've fit them all on one tray. A few more minutes and we had some tasty albeit boring looking chips. They were so large that they could only get so many in each bowl. The salsa was terrible. Completely bland with little taste. Mostly it was chunks of tomatoes and some juice. Boring. After way too long our food came. No silverware or anything, just the food. I ate most of my beans with a knife (it looked clean!) I found on my table. We asked for sourcream and silverware. She brought the sour cream but nada on the whole silverware thing. Eventually someone found me a fork (I think from a place setting behind me) and I dug in. Great Chile Relleno! very tasty, and I think the sourcream made it for me. At the end of the meal, the waitress did agree to split the check between each of us to her defense, but overall it was a very average experience like you'd expect from a white-washed pseudo Mexican chain.
