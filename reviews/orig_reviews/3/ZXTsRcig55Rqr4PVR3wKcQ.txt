First let me say the atmosphere was top notch and I would say everyone should eat here at least once just to say they had. Second, both the servers and the managers were great. Third, the food was really well prepared and the presentation of the food was excellent. 

So why not 5 stars? As a life long resident of the Southwest and a fan of spicy Mexican food, I found their food to be bland. Also the twist they added to the flavors might be appealing to a lot of people, but I'm a conservative/traditionalist when it comes to Mexican food. 

In the end I would recommend this Taco shop to everyone, if nothing else just to enjoy the building and staff.
