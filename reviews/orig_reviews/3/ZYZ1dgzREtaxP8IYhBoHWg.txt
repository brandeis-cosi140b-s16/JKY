the decor in this place is great!  I loved the wood and blue contrast and the open kitchen!   Very nice Patio and comfortable seating throughout.  The service at first was slow but then recovered after drinks.  We started with White sangria and that was interesting.  Perfect drink for a hot day!  the chips and Salsa were very very good.  The salsa had just the right amount of heat and Sweetness.  The menu looks great and I waned to try everything!  The burrito my friend got was gigantic!  I had the grilled fish tacos and they were pretty good but lacked the flavor i was craving.  I would come back here for drinks and dinner .  Value... meh.... this is pricey for what it is.
