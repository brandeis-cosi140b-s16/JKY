First time at Rositas. Food was fabulous but the service was terrible. We sat down and were immediately given chips and salsa. But then our waitress took forever to come over, and when she did she took our food order at the same time as our drinks. It took what seemed like forever to get our drinks! In fact, we finished a basket of chips without them! Then it seemed like things were smoothing out. Our food came and was amazing so we were feeling good about it. Then the wait for the check was probably 10-15 minutes! And I saw at least 2 other tables in the same position we were. There were only about 6 tables total there. So, food is amazing; service not so much.
