Rosita's has some of the best Mexican Food that I have ever eaten in Phoenix, and has a great atmosphere. That being said, you might wonder why I am only giving it three stars. I have been going to Rositas off and on since 1998. I have had some of the rudest disconnected service there over that time period. Many of the wait staff seem to think that they are doing you a favor by waiting on you, and at points I have actually felt like a bother. I usually go back once every year or two to see if things have changed. Most of the time it hasn't. The only reason that I have ever wanted to go back was because of the food.
This all being said, the last time I went there was a decent experience. The food was great as usual and the service was noticeably better. The waitress wasn't as disinterested or rude like I have experienced in the past. She wasn't super friendly, but I didn't wish I had gone someplace else. Like I said, the only reason I go back is the food, so I was happy to see better service this time. This was a good and welcomed improvement. I'm not picky, check out my other reviews. This is the lowest one I have done so far. Rositas would be the Mexican restaurant of choice in the Phoenix area if the demeanor of the wait staff was better. I am happy to see that they are at least hiring people with better attitudes. I hope this lasts.
