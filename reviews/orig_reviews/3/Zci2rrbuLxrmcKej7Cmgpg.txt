I'm OK with Phat Burrito. 

I've had their shrimp tacos & they were just OK. Shrimp were very tiny & chewy.  Now I've had their steak tacos & they're much better.  
The chips are my favorite. Ooooh & the salsa bar! THAT is something to brag about! So many flavors & temperatures of salsa.

It really is a hole in the wall, it's kinda dark & not much ambiance.  The staff there is always nice & friendly. Service is pretty quick. They serve beer there, so for beer drinkers, that should make you happy. :)
