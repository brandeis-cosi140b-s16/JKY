Wish I had read the reviews first before dining here...

We stopped here for a quick lunch and a drink. Service wasn't bad, though the waiters were all awkwardly sitting at a table near the entrance just talking and waiting around. It was around 11am when we stopped in, so not super busy, but it was weird to have them just all sitting at a table.

The food was a bit expensive for what it was. I ended up getting the carne asada tacos -- not anything amazing or memorable. Roberto's Tacos off the strip is a much better choice. The margarita was strong, but also not amazing taste. Our bill for tacos, a salad, 2 margaritas and 2 bloody marys was $100. 

I'd pass on this place during future visits and try something else.
