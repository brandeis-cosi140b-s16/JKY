We were hungryyyyyyy after swimming one day!

Good lord everything is spicy here! Holy hell! If you know me, you know that I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy. Apparently that is what they are known for because all of their dishes are spicy. Even the salsa and chips that you start out with! 

We ordered the Posole with chicken. This was delicious!!!! Except it was extremely spicy. Well for me at least. We had to order sour cream with it to help with the spice. I think I would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't so spicy. It's a very big dish to share though. I ended up having leftovers to take home with me. 

It's a cute little spot, the customer service was good. If you really want some spicy Mexican food this is the place to go. I might come back to try their drinks, but I can't handle the spicy food. lol.
