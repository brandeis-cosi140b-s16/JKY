We wanted to try a traditional Mexican restaurant for the first time since moving to Pittsburgh from Phoenix.  Emilianos won the lottery!  The restaurant was open and clean.  We were seated right away at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday.  The chips and salsa were tasty (we love the traditional thin tortillas).  My wife ordered a sangria and I ordered a regular margarita.  Both were tasty and strong!  Wifey ordered Camarones Vallerta - we both loved it...especially the sauce.  I had fish tacos (I'm obsessed with them).  I was hoping for baja style (avacado, cabbage, pico, etc.), but they were just fried fish on tortillas with some side fixin's.  Overall, decent experience.  We will try again some day...
