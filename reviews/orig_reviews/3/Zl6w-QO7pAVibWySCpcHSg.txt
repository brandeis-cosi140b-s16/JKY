I came here with my friend last night for dinner and had an overall pleasant experience. Our waitress was super nice and friendly and was very thorough in explaining the menu to us. I ordered enchiladas and my friend got tacos. The portions are a bit on the smaller side but everything tasted pretty good. I got the white wine sangria as well, but to be honest it wasn't anything especially unique. Still enjoyed it nonetheless! 

All in all, it was a spacious and nicely decorated restaurant, the food was decent, and the service was exceptional so I'll give it three stars.
