They have a great patio for the over twenty one crowd! Full of bars, tables, fountains and crazy dcor this place seems like a great hang out. The only probem is it is quite big which means way overcrowded with sun devils and very noisey. Probably better to try on a off day. The restraunt itself is ok. Came here the other day and ordered the taco salad with beef. I noticed they have one up on most restraunts taco salads because it came with black olives yumm yumm as well as corn. You think that would be a common thing, but it is not.

Good food, but to busy of a location for this senorita
