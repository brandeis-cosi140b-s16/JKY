I was really unaware of the sheer number of different types of Tequila until I stumbled upon this restaurant. So thank you, Juan Jaime's, for that educational experience! 

My partner and I stumbled into Juan Jamie's for happy hour because we were intrigued by the tequila in the title. Sitting at the bar, we were entertained by the vast amount of liquor to choose from. Over the course of our time at Juan Jamie's, I got two house margaritas, and my partner did a few shots of the different tequilas. We enjoyed all of our drinks! 

Since I hate drinking without food we ordered the chips and salsa. This appetizer wasn't fantastic but it went well with the drinks! 

Overall, an a-ok experience!
