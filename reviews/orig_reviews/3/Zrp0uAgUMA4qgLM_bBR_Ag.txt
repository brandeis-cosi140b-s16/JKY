I was drawn in by the smothered sopapilla. I'm a sucker for sopapillas and had never seen ran across a savory one before! While fairly tasty it was SO FREAKING SPICY I couldn't even finish half of it. Places with stuff this spicy should offer things on a spice scale like a thai place or have warning signs up! Will I be back? Probably not, but I'm not a fan of New Mexican cuisine or spicy food so this place isn't exactly up my alley. I hoped being a lover of Mexican food meant I could love New Mexican food, but this isn't the case for me.
