Food was awesome.  Beer and service was problematic.  It's May. I ordered a local Cartel IPA and the server brought out a cloudy green pint with no comment. I was confused.  I ask why it's green and she matter of factly replies, "Oh it's still green from St. Patrick's Day" Ummm. What? Maybe some people are cool with that, but I don't come out to a restaurant for 2-month old green, cloudy local IPA.  So weird. That was a big let down.  I decided to replace it with a bottled beer (Dos Equis) instead of risk another weird draft.  She brings out a pint glass and...it doesn't taste like Dos Equis.  I am confused and it's not awful so I decide to cut my losses and drink it instead of sending back a second beer.  Then the check comes and I point out that we didn't order one of the beers on the check.  She says, "Oh, yeah that's (whatever she had brought me that wasn't Dos Equis)" and my suspicions were confirmed that I had just been some other blah draft.  

Conclusion: Food and the building was awesome all around. Drinks and service left a lot to be desired. The music was way too loud and maybe that's why the server couldn't hear (or didn't care) what beer I ordered.  I would come back for more delish tacos again and the cool vibe.
