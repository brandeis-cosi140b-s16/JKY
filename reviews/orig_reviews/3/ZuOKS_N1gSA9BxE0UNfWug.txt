i have been going to this place for years! and i love it.  not only is the food and atmospher amazing but the SERVERS are.  

if it were not for servers like Amy, Sal, John, and Adam i probably would not be a regular.  these 4 remember your favorite drink and make dinning out great! 

I was dissapointed to find out Amy was no longer with the hideaway back in april. :(

and WTF  i've watch a new hire(s) come and go since Amy left... and all i have to say is; what is managment thinking?   you are not hiring anyone who can compete with amy! 

i feel personality is priceless and i'd rather be waited on by someone with a warm smile who is sincere versus someone who just needs a job because the economy is bad and they are desperate enough to wait tables.  Come on! 

i really hope dicks hideaway starts seeing how amazing their staff is now and over time continues to maintain that quality.  

as for now i will continue to to keep dicks hidaway my #1 place to eat and have a drink but if Sal, John, and Adam are gone... i guess i'll go find the new place they are working at.
