I took my dear friend there for dinner. Great taste and well prepared. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and tasty.  Prices are quite high compared with other Mexican restaurants.    Most plates are above $17.00, shrimp cocktail is $12.00. I would probably not go back due to the high prices versus value. Cute interior design but exterior needs to be improved.
