I was close to giving 4 stars but just couldn't do it due to the food flavors. Atmosphere was great as it sits on the canal with great views. Service was good and friendly. The biggest draw back was the flavors. We got the 5 taco sampler and tried mushroom, chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were both pretty good with fresh ingredients. The mushroom tasted like they were almost pickled and the pork had decent flavor but was so dry it was almost not edible. The chips are very thick and overwhelmed the salsa that had almost zero flavor. Overall good atmosphere, just lacked great food.
