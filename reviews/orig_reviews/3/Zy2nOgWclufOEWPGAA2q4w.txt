Very good skinny Margarita. However service was poor and in the bar the empty glasses were pilled onto it and took up two seats. Service was o.k. we had to ask for place setting and other things. But it got better by the end. 
The food was good. I will try again but if that bar is pilled high with empty used glasses I would call the health department.
