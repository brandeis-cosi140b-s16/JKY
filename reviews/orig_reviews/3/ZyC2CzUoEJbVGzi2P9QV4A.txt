I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.

They have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.

I came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.

I would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!
