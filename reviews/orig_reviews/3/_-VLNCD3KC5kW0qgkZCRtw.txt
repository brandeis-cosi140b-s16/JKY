It is probably not corporate Border Grill's fault, but given that this restaurant is managed by Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino, where it is located, my primary complaint is that as a guest, one is charged $0.50 for TAP WATER.  Ok, it's only fifty cents, however, given how terrible the desert water is, it is a crime that a fee is charged for filtered tap water water, this should be done as a courtesy for guests.  We're not talking sparkling or bottled water here, it's plain water from the tap.  What's next, a fee for air conditioning?

There is no mention of this charge on the menu, it just appears on ones bill.  While it is a nominal amount, my guess is that most guests overlook it, however, when one is charged $24.00 for three enchiladas, charging for tap water is borderline abuse.
