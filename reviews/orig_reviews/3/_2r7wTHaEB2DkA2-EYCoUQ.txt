Ate at Juan's today for lunch and everything was ok, not great, not bad, but ok. The service was definitely lacking compared to what we're used to getting there after many, many times eating there. The fajitas were burnt on the bottom and that took away from our experience as well.

We haven't abandoned Juan's and hope that when we return everything is back up to par next time.
