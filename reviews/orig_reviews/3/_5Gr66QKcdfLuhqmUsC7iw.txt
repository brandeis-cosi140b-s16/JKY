Breakfast burritos only on Sunday mornings. Hash browns that come with are the deep fried kind from McDonalds. Aren't we at a place with wait service? Very disappointing. 

Chips and salsa are very unflavorful and the food in the kitchen seems like it's coming out from someone that hates their job. I'll have to try one of the other restaurants on Mill Avenue next time.
