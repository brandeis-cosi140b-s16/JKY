Last min stop because I was craving Mexican food and I'm glad we stopped by. 

1st the bad news- the service wasn't very good. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, all alone, like kids on a time out. And while our waitress was very lovely, I think she forgot about us a lot because service was very slow. The restaurant was slightly busy, but not crazy, so we expected a little more attention. We had to keep leaving our table to ask for water, or drinks, or the check- it was annoying. 

Now the good news: the food is excellent. Super yummy and very generous portions. Had the ceviche, fish tacos, and chicken enchiladas- all excellent. 

So overall, it was a great meal- but service needs work. Will definitely be back to try again. :)
