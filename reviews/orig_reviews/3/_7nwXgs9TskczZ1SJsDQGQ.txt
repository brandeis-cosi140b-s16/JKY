I love going to local establishments.  Having eaten TexMex, New Mexico Mex and California Mex, it was some time for Arizona Mex.  This place does not disappoint.  The tacos really rock and the choices were plentiful.  I didn't experience bad service as some of the other reviewers noted.  I enjoyed it, but maybe because of TexMex and CalMex, I acquired a taste for those places first.  Give them a try.  Located in Old Town, you can't find a better location to have a bite to eat.  Plenty to do before and afterwards as well.
