Ugh, I really want to give this place 2 stars or even 1 star .... but the lady there that makes balloon hats was such a delight !!! We basically ordered 2 drinks (BOGO yard drinks) I guess i can't really expect much when it's a BOGO deal. But we ended up getting this frog-arita drink (guava flavor) which was wayyyyyy too sour. it tasted so horrible and actually killed my buzz. We asked them to re-make it and it was exactly the same taste .... i'm sure they just took our drink back & didn't bother making us a new one. 

But the lady there that goes around and makes balloon hats for everyone was so sweet and creative! We were there for the ASD convention show and we showed her our company logo and she made an exact replica of our logo in balloon form!!! Quite amazing and impressed, I'll say!

This place is in the Treasure Island hotel and has many tables & seating. Not only that, they also have a MC and a dance floor. They were offering free shots to people that were on the dance floors, as well as KTV on the stage. I'll give them credit that they try to make it as festive and upbeat as possible, but the drinks and our waitress was not too pleasant.
