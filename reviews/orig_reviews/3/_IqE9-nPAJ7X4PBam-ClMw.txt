My boyfriend and I had been lusting over this place ever since we found out that they offered octopus tacos... I will quickly add that tacos are one of  my favorite kinds of food, so I've tried a lot. Anyways, I ordered 5 kinds of tacos and none really wowed my boyfriend and I, even the octopus which I couldn't wait to try. I had a pork taco with potatoes...I couldn't even pull myself to try because it was DRIPPING with cheese...and I love cheese, but it was over kill!!!The shrimp taco with truffle butter also sounded like a good idea but the flavors came in layers; first, all I could taste was butter, next it was cheese and finally just mushrooms...the flavors didn't work well together, this just didn't work for my palette. 
I'm giving it 3 stars because it had a nice environment, good servic, but the food just didn't work for my palette BUT I feel like it was more of a preference thing rather than a bad food thing if that makes any sense.
ALSO...if you do decide to visit try the chips and 5 salsas!!! Yum!!!
