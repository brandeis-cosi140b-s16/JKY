Located within the B terminal.  I ordered the 360 chicken burrito, with rice, lettuce and beans.  At 9.49, I was surprised the cheese and sour cream were extra, so I charged on without them.   The size was good, she had so heft to her.  It was just a little dry, but not bad.  It's the airport so for some reason it's ok so stuff to be sub par, if your hungry you could do worse.  Even being dry, it seems like the ingredients were fresh at least, you could do allot worse.
