This place was really cool and had a great atmosphere.  I went here for drinks along with 3 other people and we sat at the outside bar.  I have never eaten here so this review has nothing to do with the food...although it smelled delicious!

We sat in the back and all the tables were very, very close together.  So close that my chair was about an inch from the other table, it was hard to hang my coat on the back of my chair.  I understand it's a busy place located in the strip but I felt like I was trapped.  Our server arrived and he was very nice and animated.  We informed him that we were there for drinks ahead of time.  We had two mojitos and beer. The mojitos were delicious, but the beer tasted watered down, a little funny.

Overall it was a good experience, and the server was great.  I would go back to try the food but I would sit inside this time.  I hate feeling like I'm intruding on someone else's dinner!
