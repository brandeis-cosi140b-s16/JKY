Cantina is okay. Not great. I had a margarita flight that I probably should have asked the price of before buying. It was good but not worth $15. I went with a semi-large group of people and we got a great waiter. He told us what the specials were for the night, and my mother and I opted to try. It was shrimp and scallops with some kind of corn and cilantro aioli? (Maybe lol). He warned that we probably shouldn't share, but we decided to anyway. He was right. Two shrimp. Two scallops. On a PILE of corn. On top of that the shrimp were tough. (Also not worth the price. Close to $30) So I ordered some some chicken dish that was a chicken breast filet with a small wing attached? (Again maybe...lol). It came with potatos and peppers. It was a little bland. I'm glad we had a great waiter. Other than that it's nothing you should be in a hurry to get to.
