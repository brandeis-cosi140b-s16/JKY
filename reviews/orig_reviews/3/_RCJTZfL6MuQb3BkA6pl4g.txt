Customer service is great.  Love the ability to try different meats before ordering and all of the fixings are top notch.   I am not a huge fan of the meats, though. For instance, the al pastor reminds me of something that would come out of a slow cooker.  Not bad, but not the flavor and texture that I'm used to.  I will probably try it again and I'm sure others will want to go based on the reviews.
