It's good.  

The novelty of their story and the very well designed restaurant with unique  marketing flair doesn't move them to great in my book.  

Ingredients were fresh, the papa loco is a really cool concept that blended well and had great flavor.  Service was quick and overall was a good experience.  Priced right!  ultimately a trip here turns into a fun economical eating experience.  

However, the carne asada had a bunch of "bouncies" in the meat which may not be as much of a hinderance to other yelpers, but the flan may have been one of the worst I've tried.  

Again, it's good.
