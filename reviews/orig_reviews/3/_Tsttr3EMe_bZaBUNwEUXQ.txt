They just changed from half off on Mondays for locals, to only 25%. Boooooo.

I almost don't want to write a review, so that I can keep this my own secret place. Loved everything. Fantastic service, starting in the parking lot and ending with a personal visit from the chef. They made the guac and margaritas at the table fresh for us. All organic and gmo free. Great flavors, great prices. I've never had flan that I liked before, until we tried the chef's grandmother's recipe. Yum! A little hard to find, just go to the north valet parking lot entrance of the strip club...open 24 hours. I will be back! 

(The only thing I wish was that the TVs not be in the dining room...bar is understandable,  but they distract from the lovely red silk wallpaper and ambiance of the dining room)
