We went on March 12, 2011... and we were a party of 10... 6 adults and 4 kids... we had to wait like 20 min for our table... which I guess is average for a busy night....  but we had to wait a lot for our food and constantly remind our waiter for our apettizers... I asked the waiter to please bring the kids food before.. so it was like 30 min later and the rest of the food was served like 40 min later..

I had the spicy shrimp... ok.. but not wow... Rice and beans were good.. 

Overall it is ok but more like a Tex-mex restaurant not  authentic Mexican..
