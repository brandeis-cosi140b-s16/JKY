I've been a fan of Agave for about 5 years, and have seen the management change SO many times. The food is usually good, though inconsistent. Their patio is one of the best in the Valley, and they have offered great happy hour promos in the past including free tacos and margaritas on Mondays. Their margaritas are killer and the tacos are cheap and tasty at happy hour. I used to receive gaming offers when I played there, which were decent.
