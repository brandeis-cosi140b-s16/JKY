Cool place for the college crowd with the large patio and band playing... very cool.

Food is ok... but it's a chain.  I'm not much for rating chain food because it's the same at all of them.

One down point... the bathroom.  Girls restrooms are usually so clean... but this time, I walk in and it looked like a tornado hit the place. 

If you're gonna serve savages, clean up after them.
