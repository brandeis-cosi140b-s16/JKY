We ate here for the fist time today.  Like just about every other reviewer, I enjoyed the atmosphere.  Having just moved here from Virginia, we've missed ponds, turtles, geese, etc so it was fun to see a little taste of what we're used to enjoying. 

I also agree that the food is not terribly exciting.  I ordered a salad.  The description on the menu boasted avocados, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The entire salad was a large amount of lettuce, beans and cheese topped with 2 small slices of a tomato, about 1/16 of an avocado and 2 small slices of a cucumber.  So yeah, basically I paid $10 for lettuce and black beans garnished with the aforementioned.  I was disappointed.  I would have mentioned this to our waitress, but she didn't really hang out long enough to hear anything.  In fact, we had to flag down another restaurant employee a couple of times when our drinks were empty.

Water cups are already on the table before you are seated and they are placed rim-down.  Firstly, I do not think this is very sanitary because restaurant tables are not clean (they are usually wiped "clean" with dirty rags).  Secondly, there was something nasty and sticky on the table because I had to use a decent amount of force to turn over my glass as it was stuck to the table.  I just wanted to drink water but I ordered soda just so I wouldn't have to drink out of that cup.

The bathrooms are a bit icky and since they say that restaurant bathrooms are indicative of the cleanliness of the kitchen, I had to force myself to not think about it as I was eating.  Ew.

It was fun to eat at El Encanto because of the atmosphere.  I probably would only go back if someone else wanted to go, but I certainly wouldn't return on my own.  Cute, they just need to clean up a bit and better honor the descriptions on the menu!
