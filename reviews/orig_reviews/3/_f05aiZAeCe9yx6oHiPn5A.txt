I can't give Border Grill a better than 3 star review because it is the little things that matter just as much as the big things.

We went on a LivingSocial deal that for $59 for two we got guacamole, an appetizer to share, 2 $29 entrees, a dessert and 2 drinks.  Good deal, right?  

The service was good and attentive, in fact very good.  The margaritas that came with the meal were small and we finished them quickly.  Not bad but nothing special.  The chips and salsa were tasty but nothing much beyond what is found in every Mexican restaurant in town.  We had the ahi tuna appetizer and while there were spicy tastes, the tuna itself seemed to get lost and had no recognizable taste.

Our entrees were good sized, I had the tecate carnitas and she had the sauteed scallops and shrimp.  Both were good and certainly a cut above your average Mexican place.  The flour tortilla that came with my dish was really tasty.  The carnitas were not as tasty and seemed a little bland.

I complained when we first sat down that it was cold.  Nothing changed.  Towards the end of our meal a manager came by to inquire about our satisfaction and I mentioned that sitting and being cold took away from my enjoyment of the meal.  He did apologize with some story of doing some remodeling, that the hotel controls the heat and that the room they put us in was more of an overflow room with lots of glass and doors.  Regardless, I was cold and a place that has no control of the temp should renegotiate their lease.  I feel that Border Grill is responsible for my comfort not Mandalay Bay Hotel.  Why put people in this room when you know it is cold.  That night it dropped into the 30's.  I would have trouble hearing any excuse other than offering to move our table which was never offered.

If I would have paid full price I would have left unhappier.  While nice it was not superior and while the servers all did a great job there were enough little things that were only palatable because of the deal.
