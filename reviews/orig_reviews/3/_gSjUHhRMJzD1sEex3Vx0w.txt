Food was ok, drinks were ok. Ambience ok.... Mandy is Awesome!!! It was so good to be able to talk with someone who knew about wines. And not just trying to sell me another drink... Will definitely go back. Just for her though! Get rid of the cheap wines, keep the zin over the cab if you have to keep one...
