Well two years since I dined here on Tuesday, but I was back and it was jammed up with college kids on this night of the All-Star Game. The tacos have slightly increased in prices by like 50 cents each. The ground beef taco was still the same, but the corn tortillas were bigger and the ingredients mostly the same. The crunchy fish I heard was good as well, but the $4 frozen or on the rocks margarita was perhaps the best item. Free chips and good salsa of course and a fast efficient staff was handling the college kids (and me) just fine. The amount of TV sets was perfect also as you can the action from almost anywhere. Bravo.
