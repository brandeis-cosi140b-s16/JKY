The sign for this place is creepy. GIANT face of the owner surrounded by butterflies. Very odd, but at least I knew I was walking into a family owned establishment. 
Service is good once you get past the front desk chick. Pretty sure they need to educate her as to what a "Hostess" actually does. 
DÃ©cor is festive, perhaps a bit overdone, but not to the point of being ridiculous. Booths could use some fixing up. I had the delightful choice of either sinking into an enormous hole where the springs had given out, or perching on top of an overstuffed mound. I chose to perch. 
Food was, meh. I got the #9, a taco and enchilada with beans and rice. The chicken was so dry and yet dripping with grease. Beans had zero taste, like paste, only paste might have taste. The husband got the fajitas which were excellent, but they cook the tortillas so much you can hardly wrap them. We also had the guacamole, which was very good and made fresh in front of us, but not worth $8. 
The bill with guac, entrees, and sodas came to $44 plus tip. So a $50 meal. Not worth it in my opinion. I'm not against coming back and trying different entrees. But the prices might sway me on that in the end. 

Ok. My one major complaint. The music. They have a live mariachi band playing in the dining room. They're quite good, but my GAWD they are LOUD. We couldn't hold a conversation most of the time. I got so sick of shouting "HUH??" to my husband. Plus I think all that noise and added stress really affects one's digestion. Take it into the bar perhaps.
