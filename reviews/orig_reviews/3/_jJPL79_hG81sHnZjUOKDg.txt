I think my expectations of the food were set too high. Don't get me wrong, the burger was pretty damn good. Got it with everything: cheese, grilled onions, bacon & jalepe単os. The last two are what made it great. Thick bacon & roasted, peeled jalape単o that was actually HOT (not for noobs). Fries were ok.
The choco-chile shake was, well, a chocolate shake with powdered chile in it. I guess an extra dollars worth. It was good but no help against the jalepe単o. Luckily the waitress(?) was nice enough to refill my soda many times.
Did I mention the service? Very good, especially for a counter type setup. She even exchanged my hot salsa for mild after I tasted cumin in it (oh how I hate cumin, it kills the flavor of everything it touches). The mild was excellent, tomatoes, cilantro & chunks of garlic. If they put the jalape単os in it it would make a stellar hot salsa.
As for the short rib taco, disappointing. The meat was ok. No better than a barbacoa taco anywhere else. The pickled cabbage is a little off making the taco taste, as my daughter put it, "like taking a bite of cologne". And the dry, store bought tortilla crumbled making a mess. For $3 a taco it should be fresh-made.
All in all it was "ok". I'd come back for the burger or maybe the fresh squeezed lemonade but that's it.
