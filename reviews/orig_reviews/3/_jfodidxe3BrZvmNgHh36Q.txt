Food was good not great. Very authentic. Two lines one for spicy pork the other for beef and innards yes correct. Local Hispanic population mainly so I know authentic. 
It's very chaotic and know what you want when you get to front of line!!!!! Server will not help you order so be prepared for that. 
Limited seating for size of crowd. I attempted to eat in outside seating and helper looked at me like 'don't you see there is no available seating?"
This place is popular I believe because it's the ONLY place in town so they know if want this you don't have any other choice.
