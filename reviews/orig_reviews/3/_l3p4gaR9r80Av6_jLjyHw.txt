We stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and the place was very empty. Good service...chips and salsa were brought immediately and our drink order was taken. Good, strong Margaritas! I really liked the salsa too. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered some mexican pizza appetizer thing which I did not care for. I did try some of my boyfriends veggie fajitas though and I though they were very good! I would try it again and order something else. I haven't written this place off yet. :)
