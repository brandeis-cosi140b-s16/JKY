I have been hearing about the Two Hippies brand for awhile now, but was never near one around a meal time.  Now that my office is closer, I decided to try out the Mexican concept, because I love me some Mexican food!

I was a bit overwhelmed when ordering, it is not that they have a large menu by any means, but it is up on a chalkboard above the register, and I felt the pressure to order quickly.  It was not until after I ordered that I realized that they only took cash, and my wallet was filled with plastic!  I told the guy I would go run to the bank, but he pointed to the ATM machine in the corner, so I felt obligated to go ahead and pay the fee to get my $5 burrito.

I ordered the green chile beef, because I have been obsessed with that lately, and it also said that the burrito was served with rice, beans, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  Before I could make my way around to the pick-up window my order was ready.  I took my burrito back to my office and took a bite...it was good, but it was the green chile beef that I was expecting.  It was just shredded beef that had been seasoned with green chiles, it was good, but really just tasted like shredded beef.  The main issue I had with my burrito, other than it being the size of my head, was that it wasn't very hot.  I could tell that they attempted to warm up the tortilla, but didn't give it enough time to fully heat through, making the tortilla a bit stiff and hard to keep wrapped around the filling.  Another tell tale sign that it wasn't very hot?  None of the cheese even thought about beginning to melt!  I like it when the cheese starts to melt and blends in with all the other flavors, but nope, this cheese stayed in its purest unmelted form.

I might give this place a try again, while I wasn't blown away, the price is right and I see that there could be hidden potential.
