Have been here twice and wil go back for a select item or two.  The guacamole, made tableside, is good but frankly we can make it better and cheaper at home.  The ceviche is actually pretty good and worth the visit.  It's tough to find ceviche around here period but this is actually pretty good and a decent portion.  The happy hour tacos are reasonable and not bad.  The margaritas are too sweet because of the sour and fruit juices they add.  They are trying to make something that is supposed to be simple too complicated.  Look at my review on Barrio Cafe as that will explain.  The first time we were dissappointed with the margs ans then next time we asked for them to be made traditionally and they were much better.  The entrees we had the first time we went were average, not great but not bad either.  Be selective but it's a decent place, especially for an app and maybe a drink.
