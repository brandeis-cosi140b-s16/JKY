A creative concept, but execution is mediocre.

Honestly, the idea of a Chinese and Mexican restaurant usually would have me running in the opposite direction (I HATE fusion places), but the Jose Andres connection really drew me in. This place isn't a fusion restaurant, it's really just a bunch of Mexican and Chinese options. 

My sister and I got: chips & salsa, 2 tacos (hongos & pancita al pastor), 1 order of Dan Dan Mian, 1 order of Swallow a Cloud (wonton noodle soup), and 1 order of Golden Pigs (fried pork buns with condensed milk dipping sauce).

The chips and salsa were okay - salty chips but good chipotle salsa. The tacos were also okay; the hongos (mushrooms) one was way too citrus-y and could've used more guac to balance out, and the pancitas al pastor (pork belly) was good because of the pineapples in it. My sister did say that the pork belly could have been a lot more tender, though. Dan Dan Mian was not good. The noodles were off, and the peanut sauce was salty and too spicy even after adding the vinegar brown sauce on the side. The Swallow a Cloud wonton soup was also mediocre because of the bland noodles. I think the winning dish was Golden Pigs - who would have thought condensed milk to dip fried pork buns into is actually really yummy? 

The concept is creative because there are a lot of options, and the drinks menu looked good, but the food itself was just mediocre. Maybe coming from California set the standard high for Asian and Mexican food, but this place was a little too expensive for just the mediocrity.
