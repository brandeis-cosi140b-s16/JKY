I was super pumped to go here after many months of seeing it on my way home and super packed in Tuesdays. My roommate and I went one night around 730 which wasn't late at all. We got there and it was pretty busy. Easy ordering and the lady was super helpful on what was best to order. I order the tacos americanos and the queso and I received my free chips upon checking in there in Yelp, which was awesome! I received my tacos, which I ordered beef, and they where like a pile of grease. I was highly disappointed especially after everyone raved over these tacos. The queso and chips however was amazing!! The salsa bar was little to be desired was almost empty with very little salsa options. I'll give anything a second try so I hope they step up their game the next time I'm there.
