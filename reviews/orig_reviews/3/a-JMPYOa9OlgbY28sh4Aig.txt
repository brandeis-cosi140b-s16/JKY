*sigh*... i guess tiny little wings are now the standard. 

i only came here for the wings because ever since we got to vegas... i've been craving wings since someone mentioned it. we ordered 16 hot and 16 super hot (we had just eaten at a korean restaurant an hour ago). there were 6 six people and i ended up eating 16. guess that means it was good or the wings were too small so in reality i only ate 8. really though... i liked the sauce. the super hot ones weren't THAT spicy... but definitely had a good kick. i felt bad for eating so much so we ordered another 32. 

we had nachos before our wings came out... typical nachos. we asked for some jalepenos on the side and it came out to be $2!! it was in a 2 oz container. i know nothing is free in vegas (except parking) but come on.
