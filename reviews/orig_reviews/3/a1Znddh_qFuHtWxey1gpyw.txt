If you want the flavorful taste of New Mexican food, this is not the place. I am from The 505 and there are no halibut enchiladas there. The salsa (NY CITY!) was ok but my Wisc girlfriend didn't even think it was spicey. I ordered a chicken pasta dish because there was nothing very NM about the menu.  My food was really more of a Cali style Mexican dish and the chicken was like the precooked stuff you get in a bag at Fresh and Easy. In NM the beef burritos, beef tacos and beef enchiladas almost always come with ground beef, not shredded. The menu asks if you want NM chili or Hatch chili, Hatch "is" NM chili, its a town in NM. I think they are more Enchanted with the state rather than trying to serve genuine style NM food. The servers and wait staff were great and the place was interesting and clean. But not NM food.
