If I could give this another half star, I would, but unfortunately some of the service issues made this only warrant three stars. A girlfriend who was in town visiting and I decided to go here because it was within walking distance and we were in the mood for some margaritas. Got seated right away, and the waiter got us waters and (eventually) took our drink order. The first margarita came out (hers), but we waited another fifteen minutes for the second (mine). I had the beer-Rita which was terrible, tasted like ice with beer and absolutely no other ingredients (tequila anyone?)

We ordered the special of the coconut shrimp tacos, which were fantastic. I'm sad it was only a special because I would come back just for those. The mexican street corn was great too. The food comes out fast which was a plus (and surprising!) due to the waiters slowness. After we ate and drank our margs, we were going to order another round of drinks but it took our waiter about twenty minutes to come back to our table, so by then we decided to try another place on Montford. Good food, crappy wait staff!
