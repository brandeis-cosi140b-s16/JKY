First, let me say that if I had the option I would give this 3.5 stars...but I don't have that option and I'm not giving it 4 stars. The tacos are good here, but I feel like they are a little expensive. 2 tacos ran me $8 and that doesn't include any sides. Granted, the tacos are good-sized, but just not worth that much. The service was good, but not great.
