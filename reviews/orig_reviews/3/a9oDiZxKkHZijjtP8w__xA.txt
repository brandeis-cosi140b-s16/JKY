I used to work in the restaurant industry, I know what it is. However, the service I had received for my first time dining there was just okay. I walked in with such a not so friendly hostess in cutoff shorts to the point where her cheeks were hanging out (it's scottsdale, I understand, but you're not in a club.) and proceeded to tell me to sit wherever, no big. but didn't come off with a friendly or welcoming vibe nor was I given a menu to look at. Anyway, my server comes and I ask for a bud light with water, after several minutes of waiting for my beer she gives me a bottle (they have it on draft and that is what I wanted, not that she asked me for my choices anyway) and as I was going to say something, she walked off knowing I was going to ask her something which kind of ticked me off actually. Then I pull the hostess over and ask for a draft and not a bottle. Then the server approaches me and says it will be a few minutes for them to change out the keg. Major turn off to just hand me a bottle i  didn't want because they're out. Anyway, it was changed in time and she gave me a draft. Then I ask for the steak and shrimp fajitas to which about 5 minutes later I forgot to tell her how I wanted the steak done which was actually her job to ask from the start. Finally, I felt that I had put more work as a customer to put my order in than I should have.

On a positive note, everything did come in a timely manner, and the food was excellent. I really like the atmosphere and their selections. Pricing is decent, and I will definitely come here again.
