in Phoenix for new years, yelped for tacos and found this place. Turns out it had been on the Guy Fierri show but that doesn't always mean great food for me. Anyway, tried the rolled tacos and they were actually superior to all other rolled tacos I've had. I don't know if they put sauce inside, but it tasted like they did. Very good flavor. Howard had the carne asada burrito, also had a very different and spicy, smoky flavor than any other carne asada we've tried, but small for what he likes. Although, the price was like $3.95. There were people standing waiting for tables, but it worked out perfectly and we were able to sit and get served quickly. Would definitely go back. The menu is large and has something for everyone.
