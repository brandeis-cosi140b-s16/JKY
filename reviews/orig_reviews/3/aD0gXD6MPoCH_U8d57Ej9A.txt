Probably a little on the low end on the scoring here but it's the first taco spot I had after going to Cabo and I didn't find it that great since I was craving that authentic Mexican. I had the pinches combo with a carne Asada, al pastor, and a carnitas taco. Carne Asada was hands down the best, carnitas were a little dry and al pastor was lacking flavor. It came with beans, chips and rice and the chips were the best part of this meal and one of the best chips I've had in a while. Followed it up with elotes and while I'm not a huge fan of corn, I would give it a thumbs up for corn lovers to chow down on coz it's pretty decked out with some lemon juice, mayo and chilli powder! I washed it all down with a horchata and that was really good too so overall decent spot and price is ok for being at the container park.
