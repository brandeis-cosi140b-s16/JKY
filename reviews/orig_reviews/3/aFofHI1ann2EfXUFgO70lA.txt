We visited this spot in October, its a late post just because I totally forgot about this spot or I really wanted to forget! If you care about how much you shell out for a meal, this is not the place for you. Don't get me wrong, the fusion of the two cultures are successfully done here. Portions are extremely small so, ordering 2 items per person is ideal. Like I said, watch your wallet. For a party of 2 our meal was $88.
