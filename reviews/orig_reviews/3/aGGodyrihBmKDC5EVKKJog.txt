a lot of people LOVE this place, but the few times i've been here, it didn't not sit well with me.
i think i'm turned off that the chicken is pink. pink? i know, it's the marinating process or something, but i can't get over it, it's not natural. it's juicy and quick, like fast food, but a little better.
