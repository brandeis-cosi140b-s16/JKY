Blanco, a.k.a. exspensivo, is another of the Fox Concepts restaurants with "traditional" Mexican food, tacos, enchiladas, beans, rice, except with a "high end" and healthy ingredients. For example, the fish tacos are grilled Mahi instead of deep fried or the usual white fish.
The staff wears funny striped shirts. The decor is modern and pretty cool, their colors and branding remind me of Tammie Coe Cakes.
They have a good selection of tequila. And the food is just ok. If you want great Mexican food, I suggest finding the closest hole in the wall. You will feed two for the price of one at Blanco.
Not that Blanco was no bueno, but for the price, it should be great.
It is worth a try, though, so go and see for your self.
