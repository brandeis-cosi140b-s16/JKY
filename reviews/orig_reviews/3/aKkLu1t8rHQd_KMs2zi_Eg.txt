Not sure why the high star reviews. We went here with high hopes of a shining review. Instead I got bait and switched.  Chips were thick corn and the salsa was water but the guacamole sauce was pretty good. The 'drowning shrimp' was a nice start and I thought the rest of the meal would follow suit.  I thought I was playing it safe with garlic shrimp, but I was surprised that for $15 you get six medium (seriously the 25-40 size) shrimp. The 7 seas soup was watery with little to it...the main reason we drove 30 minutes to the ghetto...think Notorious BIG "Juicy" playing in the background as you roll up.  Homeless drunk lady harassing patrons as they waited for tables and the guy I told about it seemed to care less.  The mariachi band was a nice authentic touch and was fun, but a bit intense for such a small place.  

Don't get me wrong. It's a good mariscos restaurant and if you are in the area it's probably the best mexican seafood option for more than a few blocks.

My apologies for some reason my phone only saved the pic of the 'drowning shrimp' (raw shrimp over cucumber and tomato drizzled with lemon juice,salt,pepper and topped with avocado and onion ---like whole shrimp ceviche.)
