So I finally made it to the infamous restaurant with the euphemistic name, Mr. Harry Morton's Pink Taco. My verdict? It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. Just overrated and very, very average.

I decided to eat dinner there before the Big Bad Voodoo Daddy concert. Of course, the name is what attracted me, and I'm sure that's what attracts pretty much everyone who goes there that knows what it means. ;-) It was Happy Hour and they were having a half-off special on appetizers and drink specials. I didn't have any booze, but I did have taquitos filled with cheese and potatoes with sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole, and of course, tortilla chips, which are a staple at every Mexican restaurant. Both were surprisingly good.

However, when it came to my entree, chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, it was bland and tasted like it was pre-made, I kid you not. I believe that is the case with all their food, since my taquitos were brought to my table literally five minutes after I ordered it, and the enchiladas arrived not too long after that. I had "Mexican" tiramisu for dessert, which wasn't bad. Not the best dessert I've ever had, nor was it different from regular tiramisu. Decent service, nothing special.

So, this place didn't blow me away. Just because a restaurant has a name that causes a little bit of a stir doesn't mean it has the exceptional food or service to back it up. A little disappointed, but I wasn't really expecting much to begin with. Would I come back? Possibly...Maybe I'd give it one more chance and order something else from the menu that I like better. Perhaps that's the case. If not, I'd be better "eating out" somewhere else. ;-)
