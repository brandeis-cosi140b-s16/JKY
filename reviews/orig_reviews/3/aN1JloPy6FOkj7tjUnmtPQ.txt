We were here last and only time for the fight several years ago.  Because it was crowded then, we decided to go yet again but early this time, hang out for the afternoon in to the evening, and stake our place for the long haul until the fight.  A lot of the tables were already reserved so we choose to sit at the open spots at the bar which had the multi-TV coverage.  The cover was the best I found in town, as was last fight's cover.  The bartenders were very accommodating and attentive throughout the night, as we ordered standard drinks and typical bar food on a tab.   The band that played was a definite pick-me-up and bonus to listen to as we sat, ate, drank and watched the crowd pile in.  It was standing room only by the start of the fight.  Shall I say that the crowd with all the drunkies, including myself (not overly drunk but pleasantly buzzed) was loud, animated and quite entertaining.   The actual fight though- well was not so entertaining, But at least we were in a lively place where fun was had by all either way.
