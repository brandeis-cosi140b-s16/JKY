So first off, I have to say that what they have done with the church is amazing and renewing older Phoenix structures is exactly what Phoenix needs more of. Also, the inside decor is amazingly beautiful and it is obvious that it was thoughtfully chosen. The one thing I have to say about the ambiance is that the music was WAY too loud. I could barely have a conversation with anyone at my table. I would like a restaurant ambiance and not one that I would find at a Scottsdale club.   

Despite the awesome decor, I had many issues with the food. First of all I thought the guacamole was WAY over priced for the small little dish that we received. I honestly felt totally robbed for a guacamole dish that wasn't particularly special. Second, I thought the tacos were also way over-priced for what we got; $4 or $5 a taco left me again feeling totally robbed. Our waitress did let us know that if you order three tacos then you get a free side, which we all took advantage of. However, these sides are quite small and if ordered on their own are $2.50. Definitely not worth the price. Overall, the taste of the tacos was very good so they did get that aspect right.  

Finally, we went during the opening week so I won't be entirely harsh on the service, but what service we did receive was very poor. Once we were seated we waited 20 minutes for a waitress to come to the table and she wasn't even our actual waitress. She kindly took our orders, but we still had to wait ten more minutes for our waitress to come by the table and fill our waters. Thankfully, she took an item off our bill to show us that she was sorry. I'm sure the service will get better with time, but if prices stay where they are then I'm not sure I will return.
