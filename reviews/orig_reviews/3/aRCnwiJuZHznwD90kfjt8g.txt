Ok, so this is not life-changing Mexican food. It isn't the most authentic either, but it is tasty and it will fill a craving. They have the best chips. They are always warm, and thin, and just the right amount of salty. The salsa is okay.

I like ordering the taco steak which is chopped steak with cheese and it comes with tortillas, rice, and beans. I also like ordering the combination appetizer because you get to taste a little bit of everything. It includes 2 mini flautas, 2 mini chimis, a mini bean and cheese tostada, a tamale, and 2 mini beef tacos, all for around $10.

The restaurant is beautiful and festive. Sometimes I like to order ahead and pick up in the take out building. Like I said, it's not the best I've ever had, but I do crave those chips like nobody's business.
