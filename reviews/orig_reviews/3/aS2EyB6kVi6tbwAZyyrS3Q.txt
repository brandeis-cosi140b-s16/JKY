I have been here a few times. Its usually the same, the service is SO slow. I dont know if its because they want you to have extra time or what, Once you finally get your food order in, it arrives in a timely manner not longer than 10 min usually. 

The margaritas, frozen, are standart strip tourist once, unfortunately. You need to ask if they can blend you one by hand no slushie crap.

The food is ok, I still like Dona Marias better, but its ok. The prices are a little higher than I like compared to other off strip restaurants.

Food is always ok, fresh and not salty but spicy enough to not be boring.
