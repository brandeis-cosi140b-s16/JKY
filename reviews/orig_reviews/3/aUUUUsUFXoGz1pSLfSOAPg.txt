Been here a few times now.   At first I loved it.  And then service and food got worse each time.  And trying other taco places and comparing prices.  They are a little overpriced for the size of the taco.  Extremely small not much filling.  I do like the al pastor tacos still.  But i will be trying new places from now on.  So many out there to experience.
