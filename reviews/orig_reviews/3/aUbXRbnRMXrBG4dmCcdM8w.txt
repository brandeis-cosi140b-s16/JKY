For airport food, this is pretty good. The prices are typical of airport prices but not crazy. I had a glass of wine and the steak tacos (3 tacos and french fries) and I paid about $23.00.

The service: I sat at the bar. The bar tenders were friendly, One Hispanic guy and a lady who had a lot of tattoos ( I don't remember their names lol). The guy was great. he was super friendly and helpful and just fun. The lady was a little more reserved; she seemed annoyed with one of the patrons but she wasn't serving me so whatevs. The guy who was serving me was helpful with suggestions and was quick with service.

The food: Eh. The tacos were alright; nothing to rave about by any means. They had steak, a cabbage slaw and pico on top. It came with a side of mild salsa. The fries were the best part. They are seasoned and steak cut. The menu is a good size but not a lot of variety.

The wine: great! hard to mess up Chardonnay. 

Overall: If I was every in the airport again and wanted some mexican food I might stop here again. I don't think I'd spend that kind of money again on tacos though.

*shrug* I guess I won't be back.
