Your typical mex cantina food, nothing special you probably couldn't find in most cities in america. They have a few items on the menu for the kids and those not looking for mex food. Staff is knowledgable on menu and can make recommendations. The bar has tv's to watch your sporting events and the patio is nice during cooler months. Would recommend to anyone looking or a place to take the family. The wait staff very attentive and I always tip extra because of the great service.
