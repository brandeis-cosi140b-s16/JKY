Its not in a shell gas station anymore and i guarantee that Guy would never visit the new location on his show. I ordered the El Pastor burrito and i didn't like it at all, very dry and just not to my liking. I would never order it again but I'm sure there are alot of people out there that like it. The salsa was great and i couldn't get enough of it. I ate half of a bean and cheese burrito and i really liked that also, not the greatest tortillas ever but they are possibly #3. I would could back and id like to try some other type of burrito or some carne asada tacos.
