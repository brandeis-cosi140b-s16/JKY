I have definitely written a review on PTT's before but for some reason it isn't popping up!  So, out of pure bitterness I am going to keep this review short and to the point.

The best thing about this restaurant is what they could be in theory.  Creative tacos, great/fresh side items, housemade dressings, etc etc..But really everything is just OK in my opinion.  The tableside guacamole is incredible but that isn't enough to keep me as a repeat customer.  

The smoked chicken taco was okay, a little bland.  The pulled pork taco was decent but a little tough and once again, bland.

The side options are solid considering you typically only get lard...I mean refried beans...so I did enjoy my black beans and rice!

Overall--I think Paco's is okay.  They are a good alternative to traditional Mexican places and we don't have very many "tex-mex" places in Charlotte so I give them credit.  I don't think they are that great but they will satisfy a craving in a pinch I suppose.
