I really enjoyed the food and the seating available. The decor was also very nice, but the music the DJ played was so loud!!! I couldn't even talk to my boyfriend because he didn't even know what I was saying! Also the ordering is kind of strange too. Even though there was an assembly line set up, the food we ordered took 10 minutes to cook and we didn't know if they were going to bring the food to us or if we had to pick it up because there are no waiters and there were no numbers being given for each meal.... Anyway the food was still delicious. And they have free elote at a certain time everyday or weekday I believe.
