I would have to say that this restaurant is average at best. If it wasn't for the bust boys it might slip below average. The service is downright slow. We had to catch other servers as they flew by to try to get things like refills or some more napkins. As far as the food, it is not anything that I could not get anywhere else. My beans were crusty on the edges so I guess the plate had been sitting out under a heat lamp for a while. The salsa is a mild salsa with a strong garlic taste. I would say do not bring small children as their kids menu is really small so if your kid doesn't like the little bit of variety that is there, then they will just have to eat corn chips. Everyone was friendly, but I do not think that is enough to bring us back here.
