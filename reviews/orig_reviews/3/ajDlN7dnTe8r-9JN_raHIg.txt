My husband had heard of this place from a co-worker of his. New Mexican? I had no idea. So is it Mexican food made in a "new" way? Or food from New Mexico? I wasn't sure.
We got to the parking lot and I must say, I was immediately turned off. Cheesy decor outside and even cheesier decor on the inside. It smelled like if they just cleaned the place down, so I couldn't smell any food, only flowers and botanical junk.
We decided to stay anyway. The menu wasn't appealing at all, but maybe it was because I was already turned off. I ordered the fajita quesadilla (i think that's what it was called) and the Tequila shrimp. To my surprise they were both very very good. Very well seasoned for both dishes. 
I had also tried the house made sangria. Skip it, it tastes like hawaiian punch. Way too sweet.
All in all, the food we had was good. If you are in the neighborhood and your expectations are not high go ahead and try it. But if your dining experience includes decor and ambience, then go somewhere else.
