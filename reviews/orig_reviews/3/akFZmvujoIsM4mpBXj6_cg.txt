Very good tacos.  A bit small, but that is the nature of the street taco..  The vampiro is where it is at though.  Seemed to have more flavor and was more filling for sure.  Next time, I'll get two of those and skip the taco.

They have some good deals for two with burritos tacos and beer.  Going to try that next time.
