The following sentence should tell you a lot: I waited 24 hours to write this review to make sure we didn't get food poisoning. The good news: we didn't! But both of us felt a bit...off a few hours after we ate, but that could have been all in our heads. 

The reason for all the suspicion: Yayo Taco has their C rating proudly displayed next to the register. We made the mistake of looking up their violations while we were waiting for our food, thinking that maybe the violations were the goofy ones. Nope. Cross contamination, failure of employees to wash hands, inadequate food temperatures. At this point, we had already paid for the food, so we took it home and rolled the dice. 

The food is actually pretty tasty. We each got the taco combo: your choice of 4 tacos and two sides for $7.25, a screamin' deal. Seafood tacos and tacos locos are an extra 50 cents each. I had two carne asada (awesomely greasy/fatty) tacos and two carne molida (ground beef with an Italian-leaning red pepper and basil "salsa) tacos, with black beans and chips/salsa. Fish tacos got a thumbs up from Boyfriend. The tacos are street-size, so 4 is just about the right amount of food. 

I'll definitely be back when they bring their rating up a letter or two. The food is worth another trip, but the violations just make eating here a roll of food poisoning roulette right now.
