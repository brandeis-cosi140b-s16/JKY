We came here about a month ago late afternoon because we were in the area and a friend recommended this place.  The bar was full I think it was happy hour,  but because I am pregnant we sat in the very empty dining room. We love the beer selection and the ambiance.  I really wanted to give this place more stars because the food was actually excellent.  We had nachos,  tacos and tortilla soup... All were great! The service was pretty bad I must say.  At first both out orders came out wrong.  My nachos were missing meat and my husbands tacos were made with onions which he had told the server he wanted no onions, and if it hadn't been for the busser,  who also sat us at our table,  we would have had a much worse experience.  I wish I knew his name so I could give him the props he deserves.  He ran all our food and brought us everything we needed, including drink refills and also fixed the server's mistakes with our food.  When the server actually came to the table he didn't even acknowledge or apologize that our orders came out incorrect and just pretended like nothing had happened.  He had a completely careless attitude about his job. I give this place three stars because of the attentiveness of the busser who took care of us so our whole experience wouldn't be a flop,  and for the excellent food.  If our experience would have been handled differently by our server I would have given it five stars.
