A step above Robertos!

If you're looking for an authentic Mexican joint of tacos and burritos, this is not a bad place to try!

Tacos y tacos is located near Eastern and 215 in the same center as Cafe Zuppas, Smash Burger, and Twin Peaks.

Restaurant is roomy and clean. We went on a Friday night and they had a DJ which was pretty neat.

It was very crowded tonight and when we went up to order, it was so disorganized. This was a our first time coming here so we had no clue on how their ordering system went. We can see the different stations but we weren't sure as to who we place our order with etc etc.

We ordered the asada burrito, asada taco grande, asada nachos, and Elote (Mexican style corn).

Large portions for fairly cheap prices. Meat was a bit on the dry side. Definitely not healthy food so stay away if you're on a diet. 

I would recommend trying this place over Roberto's and if u want to venture out from Chipotle.
