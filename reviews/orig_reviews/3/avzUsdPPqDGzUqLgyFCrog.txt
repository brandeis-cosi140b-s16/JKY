I'm sorry, Revo - normally I'd give you a solid 4, maybe even a 5, but you're letting me down!

I have always LOVED the chicken machaca tacos and raved about your creamy white rice.  Unfortunately, the last 2 visits have been disappointing and tonight was the 3rd strike.

The chicken tacos continue to be great, but tonight they were really watery.  I'm all about messy food if it's yummy, but I took my food to go and the tortilla was pretty soggy by the time I got home.  No biggie - I can handle that.  But the rice.  Where was my rice??? The last 2 times the rice has been more dry than creamy.....but I ordered a side of rice to take home and enjoy despite having been disappointed. Mediocre "revo rice" is better than no "revo rice."  There was no rice in the bag.  No rice?? I paid for rice - it was on the receipt. I eat at Revo mostly for the rice.  But tonight there was no rice.  Revo! It's Cinco de Mayo and you left out my rice!

Why didn't I go back and demand my rice?  Because I was already home and settled in. 

Revo - please go back to the way you were! I miss your yummy rice and dependable service!!
