I really enjoy trying new restaurants and looked forward to trying a New Mexican restaurant at red rock. I heard good things about the gourmet street tacos at mercadito and tried it about a week ago. Although the happy hour drinks were tasty I was disappointed when it came to the tacos we tried. I felt the pork was chewy and lacked flavor. The service left a bit to be desired as well. Our waiter seemed ready for us to leave and hovered at our table after placing the check. Overall, I was kinda disappointed because I love most restaurants at red rock.
