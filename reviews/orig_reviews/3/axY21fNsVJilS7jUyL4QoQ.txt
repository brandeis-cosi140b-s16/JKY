This place is only open during certain hours, and the service is great, but the flavor for the tacos isn't all that great.  I've had better tacos, but if you're looking for a good price and you're a student.....then I guess you should check this place out.  Show your UNLV rebel card and get the student special for $5.67.  It comes with a drink, 2 sides, and four tacos.  The sides are delicious, but if you're considering the tacos get the beer battered shrimp sicilian style.  It's more flavorful than the others.
