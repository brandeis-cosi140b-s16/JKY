New in town, this place looked fun and I love tacos and ritas so... duh, I went in. I've actually been in twice now. The salsa bar is a nice touch, the tacos are pretty good, but the Margaritas were horrible. I'm pretty easy to please in this area, but they were BAD. The staff was nice and attentive, but all in all, it's just ok.
