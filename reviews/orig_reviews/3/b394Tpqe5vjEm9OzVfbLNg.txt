Just got home and read some of the reviews for Joyride! I agreed with most of them! There were great things about the food and some not so great things. I absolutely loved the chicken burrito!!! It was so tasty and the tortilla was perfect...crispy but soft!  The white sauce with it was wonderful!! The black beans were bland and did not impress at all.  I also got the tortilla soup but it had a funny taste to it. Not sure about that. 
I did enjoy my house margarita though! 
The service was great, but we were asked if everything was ok by 3 different people and if we liked out food by two of the staff (a little much).
The ambiance and decor was beautiful. 
I guess I wasn't impressed enough to rush back there, but I could go back (maybe).
