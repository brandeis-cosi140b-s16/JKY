i wish i had done my due diligence and researched more places on my visit to Pittsburgh. i was out there for work, and it was a short trip, so i didn't really think i'd have much time to explore. i took the suggestion from someone to hit up mad mex and, well... let's just say the thing about this place is, it's just not authentic mexican. i even prefer chevy's mexican over this place... but it reminds me of a chevy-like atmosphere.

i'm even more grateful for the good mexican food i can get at home. thank you mission district. :)
