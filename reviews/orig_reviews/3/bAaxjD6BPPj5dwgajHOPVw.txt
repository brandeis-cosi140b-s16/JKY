Loud most of the time.

It's annoying to go to a Mexican place and see sports channels blaring. I think the staff likes sports

The chips have no taste, flat, unsalted.....

Salsa has no color from jalape√±os, cilantro or anything. Tasteless

The chicken in enchiladas is not flavored with cooked onion or tomatoes, it is just tasteless blobs of chicken. They can do much better!

You won't hear Mexican music here. Just Loud sports which ruins the food and dining for me


Frozen margaritas are ok, but their mix needs some changes. There
Is a funny taste to it. Texans wouldn't appreciate this
