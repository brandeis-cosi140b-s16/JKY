Atmosphere: 
As noted in another review, Mundo is located on the ground level of World Market Center at one of the most architecturally interesting intersections in the valley.  I love the d√©cor and feel of the restaurant.

Drinks:
We were on a business luncheon so not able to try drinks...sure wanted a margarita.

Food:
Appetizer - good guacamole.
Entrees - carnitas, short rib enchiladas and chile relleno's were all good.
Dessert-churros and flan were nice ending to our lunch.

Service- I think the whole staff needs to be trained on service standards...service does not match up to atmosphere and food.  I mean offering more beverages, clearing plates at appropriate times and attentiveness to the table is very basic .  When you don't receive good service it ruins the overall dining experience.
