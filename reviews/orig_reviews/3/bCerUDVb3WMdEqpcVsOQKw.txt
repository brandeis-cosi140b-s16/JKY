The food was good prices were great. But customer service mediocre. You wait is several lines for you food depending on what type of tacos/burritos you want so if you like  a variety your in for waiting in line. We waited in two different lines which was about 25 mins so when we sat to eat our food it was cold. The chips were anything but authentic!! Tacos were great but would have been better hot. I won't be back unless I am getting to go and don't care if my food is cold
