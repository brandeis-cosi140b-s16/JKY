Made reservations online for a bday brunch. I thought it was weird that I made the reservation and with no one in the restaurant we still had to wait for them to set up tables for us. Waited quite some time for our "build your own" Bloody Mary bar drinks to come out but overall we had a good experience. We had a lot of fun making our own drinks and the food was great! Service lacked a bit. But we will definitely try this out once the weather cools off for dinner.
