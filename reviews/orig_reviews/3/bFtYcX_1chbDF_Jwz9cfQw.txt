Food-wise this restaurant is easily 5 stars.I have been here 3 times now and have had different menu items each time and everything has been fresh, delicious, and creative.I have nothing but glowing things to say about the cuisine! Their drink menu is pretty awesome too.

The space and concept are fabulous as well....

I want so badly to be able to call this my favorite restaurant and come back frequently but I have to say the service each time has been extremely "awkward" and it took asking the server 3 times on our last visit just to get water and 2 times to make sure our guacamole order was in. Previous visits were just as frustrating-including the time we ate at the bar. In fact, we had guacamole technical difficulties on a prior visit as well..

I get that it is a loud restaurant but servers should be able to work around that and make sure they clarify orders. I have honestly never seen such a confused staff.

It is frustrating because I feel like this restaurant is on the cusp of being something fantastic but they haven't quite pulled it together. I mean any other place I would not have returned after the sloppy service but the location, premise and food are that good! 

Ok Otro...I am going to give you one more try. OK...maybe 2 more tries...The burning question remains...is the end result (the food) worth the hassle/frustration of getting to the amazing food? That remains to be seen...
