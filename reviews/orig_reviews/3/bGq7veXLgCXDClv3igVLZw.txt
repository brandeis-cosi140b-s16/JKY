Trying to figure out exactly how, and why, this place is so highly reviewed. Honestly, it feels like a Mexican version of Claim Jumper. Portions are too large for an average-sized diner; hence, both my date and I felt guilty for leaving such large portions on the plate.

I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were sub-par. It's never a good sign when a restaurant uses baby shrimp in their dishes. This means the shrimp is either frozen or purchased cheaply in bulk. Not a lot of flavor in the shrimp but the sauce was pretty good.

My date had the taco salad with chicken and claimed it was okay. Like other reviewers stated, there's nothing necessarily "bad" about the food it just seems like your run-of-the-mill place. Nothing remarkable. That said, by the time I finished one taco my date's tostada was getting quite soggy. It was kind of gross.

So, I can't imagine returning unless it's for happy hour when a mariachi band is playing.
