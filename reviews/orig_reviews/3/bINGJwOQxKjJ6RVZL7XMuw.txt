I went here for lunch today and was not impressed, although the service was great. Our waitress was friendly and easily split our check for the 6 of us at the table paying separately. There is no lunch menu so the prices were $11-18 per meal. The chips and salsa were delicious but the meal left more to be desired. I got the chicken tostada with refried beans and rice. The chicken was pretty bland and the rice and beans were just okay. I probably would only be back if they offered lunch prices or happy hour.
