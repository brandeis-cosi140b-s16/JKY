I have mixed feeling about the place. I like the concept, a complete copy cat to Chipotle. its twist is all the ingredients and meats are hawaiian inspired. We tasted each meat before we picked our order: the chicken was so much like a teriyaki chicken, the pork was awesome: juicy and tender. We had burrito bowls. However, once you had all the ingredients in the bowl, it just came out so under seasoned. Even their salsa were under seasoned not packed with flavors. I asked for 2 additional cups of salsa and a pinch of salt to make my bowl become ok. 

I can see the place become something awesome though..
