The food was AMAZING! I was in LOVE with the spicy pork burrito. However, we watched our waiter serve himself many drinks. He dumped water on us twice and spilled our chips before they were brought to the table. He kept disappearing into the bathroom instead of grabbing our bill too, so it made for an unfortunate experience.
