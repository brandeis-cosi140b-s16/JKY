I was super excited to have been able to get dinner reservations at China Poblano on its opening day.  Having grown up eating a lot of Chinese and Mexican food, I was excited about this fusion of such different cuisines.  Furthermore, I had high expectations for a restaurant of Chef Jose Andres.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by my experience at this new casual dining restaurant.

First, service was not up to par.  Despite our 7 o'clock reservations, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  We were comped guacamole and chips for the long wait, which was a nice gesture.  Servers kept bringing us dishes which were meant for other tables, which became annoying after the third time.  

Second, the food was just okay.  The menu is split up between Mexican cuisine and Chinese cuisine, with a few fushion dishes.  I thought the whole menu would consist of fusion dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes from both sections of the menu -- nothing really stood out as being delicious.  The al pastor taco was good.  The fries with mole was interesting. The hot and sour soup was salty.  The dishes are all very small, tapas style and they bring out everything as it is ready. 

For dessert we ordered the chocolate warrior and giggling buddha.  Both looked interesting but neither tasted good. 

As for decor and ambiance ... the restuarant is casual, the atmosphere is fun.  The decor is kinda tacky looking.  With all of its bright colors and funky decorations, it kind of reminded me of Pink Tacos.

All in all, I love the concept and the history behind the fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. I also feel like the China Poblano has a lot of potential.  However, it definitely has a lot of kinks it needs to work out before it can be a big hit.
