Sam's Cafe at Arizona Center is a relaxed restaurant good for dinner or a weekend lunch. I've been underwhelmed by an entree or two (note: don't bother with the steak), but in general, the food is good. The margaritas are large and potent. They have a small but good selection of beers on tap. The chips and salsa are good. I enjoy their quesadillas and burgers. The patio is a great place to have a lazy Saturday afternoon drink with friends.

While I like Sam's Cafe well enough, I know some people who absolutely love it, so I can confidently say it is worth a visit.
