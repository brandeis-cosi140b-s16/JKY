A 'small plate' Mexican x Chinese fusion Restaraunt - a weird combination that Doesn't really work. Stopped here in an evening to get a quick meal. Staff were friendly and helpful and the decor was bright and vibrant. The food was OK, but for me the foods from the two countries don't work together and when you add the small plate format to that, then it was confused and un-satisfying -  the fact it is not cheap meant it was a bit disappointing.
