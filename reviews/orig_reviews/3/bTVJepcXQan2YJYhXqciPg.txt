Typical bar & grill type fare, but here you will be entertained/mystified by a never-ending rotating slideshow of images of the great Sammy Hagar, from his solo days to Van Halen to his slow melt into obscurity, lending his name to generic restaurants around the globe Guy Fieri-style.  Burgers, wings, sandwiches, quesadillas.  The sole salad choice is of the Southwestern chicken variety.  Vegas hangover food while you wait for your flight, and nothing more.  The service is decent and they have a full bar.
My traveling mate had a Bloody Mary and I enjoyed a mimosa; I did not enjoy dropping $30 for those two items.
