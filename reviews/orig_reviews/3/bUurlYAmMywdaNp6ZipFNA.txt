I came here because I was in the area and it was highly rated.  I had jus had Mexican food night before, lol, so here I go again.  I ordered cheese enchiladas which came with rice and beans.  The person who took my order was very friendly.  The place is very narrow and next to Albertson,s.  They do make use of the space here... It lost a star because the tables were not tidy and I had to search for napkins!
