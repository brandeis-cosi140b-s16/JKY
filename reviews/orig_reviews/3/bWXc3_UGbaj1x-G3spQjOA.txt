Cute and cozy restaurant in what used to be The original Firefly. Inside is lushly decorated and not your traditional obnoxious Mexican style. I went there on a Thursday and it was not very busy. We were eager to sit outside as the weather was just perfect, not a breathtaking view but sometimes it's just nice to sit outside. The server took a while to get to us and server seemed a little bit rushed. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. It was pretty good, not sure if the chips were made in house or bought. I ordered the margarita and the server kindly let me know they use "foam salt" I had never tried it prior to coming here and I was feeling a little bit adventurous so I decided to opt into it. It was more foam than salt flavor but it didn't really change the margarita, next time I would order just the plain salt grain. 
I had one carne asada taco and one lengua (beef tongue taco). The tortilla was definitely one of the best I've had in town, other than that, the carne asada was too salty and it did not come with limes. The lengua was pretty good. 

Overall I wasn't particularly a fan of the service but the food was decent. They do have an extensive beer menu and taco selection which I was impressed with.
