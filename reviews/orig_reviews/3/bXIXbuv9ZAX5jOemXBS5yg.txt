I was very excited to try Tako after it just opened a few days ago. A reservation is a must and it looks like you need to call ahead first as they do not appear to be on open table yet. This place is loud and by loud I mean that I could barely hear the person sitting right across from me. It was also difficult to hear the server and we were practically invading each other's personal space to place drink and food orders. The server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about pretty much every drink. I respect that because not every sever can recommend a drink based from what your likes and dislikes are. I started off with a Ramons gin fizz. Yes Ramons, not Ramos as we expected. It was served in a tiki mug and had a lot of ice in it. The taste was refreshing with hints of citrus and lime. Next, I ordered the aloe and elderflower, which had one large ice cube in it and was oh so tasty with just a touch of sweetness. The only good item that I tried was the queso. I felt it was gritty and had too much cilantro on top and was only served with three tortillas. Next time, I will be sure to order more food items and report back!
