Went for dinner while visiting Vegas with some friends. My friend had heard about the 20 vegetable fried rice on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" show. Funny thing was, that was our least favorite dish. They got the mushroom tacos, my husband and I got a couple of other tacos, the Cochinita and the Barbacoa de Res. We got the papas bravas to share and mole negro special. Our friends also got the chilaquiles which were insanely good. Everything was really good, with the exception of the fried rice, which was just okay. Would definitely go back again when in town.
