I always drive by this little restaurant and I've been wanting to stop by for a long time, so happy I finally did. Only had a few drinks and an appetizer. The atmosphere was very nice and private. They even had live music! Which I was not expecting given the size of the restaurant. The customer service was great! Our waitress was very helpful and accommodating. I know I will definitely go back in the future! For now they get three stars because I wasn't the biggest fan of their salsa. We shall see how they do next time.
