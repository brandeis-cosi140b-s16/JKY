Ouch, where do I start? I should have known better when I realized they only had valet. Our dear friends recommended this place and were meeting us there, that is the only reason we stayed. We asked for self parking and they said to park at Runner's Den.... now I am wondering if they have an agreement with them or if they send people there just because.
We sat and were welcomed by "Absolutely no split plates" and "no separate checks" notes on our menus. : ) Friendly business, uh?
Our server was pushing for appetizers (asked multiple times before and after our friends arrived), but once we were ready to order she was nowhere to be seen for a while. 
We also asked for straws and she gave them to us grabbing them from the top where your lips are supposed to go! I think that was by far the worse. Other than that she was OK and friendly.
I do not know anything about New Mexico food but I do not have respect for places that spell adovada with a 'v', and that do not peel the green chiles : o
Over all I thought the place was kind of 'uppity' for my taste (I am a very very simple gal), and I would at least have expected them to have options for artificial sweeteners, but they (oh surprise) only had the pink saccharine ones.
OK, enough bickering : ) The food was good, the portions (other than the adovada) were generous and everyone agreed they were tasty. I think one of our friends had the New Mexico plate and it was huge. I am OK with the food, but for the prices they have I would expect excellent customer service and Stevia, Splenda or at least Nutrasweet.
I am on a special diet but was even afraid to ask, lol...
The hostess was very nice and friendly.
