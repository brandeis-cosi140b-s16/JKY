Try to make reservations beforehand, convenient that they text you when your table is ready and it's nice that it's right across the sports book.  Overpriced tacos, but they are pretty good.  To be full you have to order at least a couple, and I'm not sure if they would do the job of prepping your stomach for a night of drinking.  This place serves small portions, even their Traditional Sui Mai (6 pcs) looked really sad in its large container.  They were pretty small in size compared to what I'm used to at traditional Chinese restaurants.  I had a soup since I was a bit under the weather, the Caldo Tlalpeno which had shredded chicken, rice, peas, carrots, avocado and chipotle.  It was a bit bland, but it was perfect for how I was feeling.  I don't think I'd go back to China Poblano again, unless it was for that same soup, but it certainly wouldn't make me that full unless I ordered tons more stuff.  The dinner definitely warranted another dinner #2 an hour or two later.
