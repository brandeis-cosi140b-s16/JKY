The husband and I checked out the Taco Guild's happy hour after yoga the other day. The happy hour is alright, it includes a 5$ marg, discounted beer, and discounted shot of tequila with a beer. Additionally, there is a special on the 'taco of the day' (2$). Pretty slim pickings, but not terrible. We each got a marg and we split a taco ( just to taste it). The frozen margarita was STRONG. It tasted like straight tequila. Some people may like this... I would rather it have more flavor. We had chips and salsa with our drinks. They bring out 4 salsas... one large container of red salsa and 3 small containers of other spicier salsas ( one tomatillo based, one orange sauce that tasted very acidic and maybe was made with habanero?, and a pink looking salsa that was spicy and tasty). 2/3 of the small salsas were good, but so small they were hard to eat. The large red salsa was terrible... it tasted like marinara sauce... yuck. The taco of the day was a pork taco with onions and peppers... Our server couldn't pronounce the name and I don't remember what it was, but it was fairly good. The meat was tender, but it was a little overly oniony. I would consider coming back, but it wouldn't be my first choice in town for tacos.
