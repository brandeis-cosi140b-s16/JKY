Ordered the Taco, loved the homemade taco shell but the beef was extremely salty. Chips and salsa were good, but again too salty. And I love salt!   My mom ordered the beef chimichanga enchilada style, she said it was not fried enough and the inside was very soupy. The green chili sauce was hot and they will not let your order it on the side and so it is super soggy. It was worth the try, but Seattle still has some of Mexican god ever!  And the search continues here in Arizona.
