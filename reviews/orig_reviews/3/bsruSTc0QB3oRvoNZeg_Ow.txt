Decent, but uninspired Mexican food.  There's nothing bad about Los Olivos.  The place certainly uses quality ingredients to make its food.  Too bad what end up on the plate was just plain average.

I had the fish tacos and was not impressed.  The fish itself had no taste.  All it really provided was some texture (and hopefully protein).  Without the lime and the sauce and salsa, which are all served on the side, it offered no flavor to the dish.  Couldn't it at least be seasoned a little bit?  My girlfriend had the chicken quesadilla with a side of guacamole.  This was pretty good and huge.  It could easily serve two or three people.

The chips and salsa are wonderful.  The hot salsa perfectly delivers quite a kick.  The mild was incredibly flavorful.  The cilantro really stood out.  However, I am not a fan of the tubes the salsas are served in.   They're extremely narrow, so you cannot directly dip your chip into them.  You need to pour the salsa on a plate.  That left a narrow liquidy mess on my plate, which doesn't make for good dunking.

The restaurant itself is quite pleasant, and there is a lot of space.  I wouldn't call Los Olivos overpriced.  You'll get a lot of food for your money.  But, I would prefer some more quality over the quantity.
