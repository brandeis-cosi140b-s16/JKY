Came here on our last night and vegas and had a great meal between 4 of us. By this point we had eaten quite alot through out the day so we each split a dish. Fajitas for 2 and Enchiladas for the other 2. That with the tableside guacamole was more than enough for us. The flavors in all the dishes were great, the atmosphere was great and our waiter was always attentive. Overall a great place and I would go back.
