Meh. I did not love this place. Bartenders were great. I'd go back if I wanted to chat with them. 

The house margarita (premix) was super sweet. The jalape√±o popper shooters were not served to us a shooters (they were out of shot glasses), but on a plate. 

My enchiladas (beef and pork) tasted good. BUT, to me, the meat tasted like pot roast. Like home cooked pot roast that Grandma serves. Good, but not really my ideal Mexican craving.
