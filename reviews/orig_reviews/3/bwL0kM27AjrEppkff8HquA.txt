I'm really not sure what all the hype is about.  The crab and shrimp dip is amazing and next time, that will be my entree.  My hubby got the tuvaroo (however that is spelled) wahoo tacos and they were really good, but too spicy for me.  I got the beer battered white fish tacos.  They were tasty but stone cold.  Like, the fresh from the cooler.  The place is super loud, unless you are lucky enough to be seated outside, and our table was literally in the doorway between the bar and the dining room.  I might get take out next time, if there is a next time.
