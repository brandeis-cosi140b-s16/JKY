I was not impressed at all with this place.  I went with my friend for happy hour.  Its located at the World Market Center and is beautifully decorated.  You're paying mostly for ambiance.   The food and drinks were just ok.  We ordered chicken taquitos, chicken satay, and mundo fries along with some cocktails made with alien tequila.  Not worth mentioning.   If you go to Mundos make sure you go with good company that will make it more interesting since the restaurant itself wont impress.
