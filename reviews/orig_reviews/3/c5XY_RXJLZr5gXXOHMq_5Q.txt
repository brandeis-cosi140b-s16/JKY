The menu has very unique selections. The service is spotty like a lot of local Mexican restaurants but certainly adequate. The drinks are over -priced but I do think the menu offers some nontraditional Mexican dishes that many people would enjoy. The skirt steak is solid. Used to go here when it was across the street in the shopping center but at least now it has more character.
