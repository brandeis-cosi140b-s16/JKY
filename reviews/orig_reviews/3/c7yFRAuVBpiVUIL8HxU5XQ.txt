I'm a frequent Vegas visitor but I rarely eat at places that are on the Strip because I'm a bit too cheap for that. However, since this one seemed more moderately priced and because my husband and I were staying within walking distance and we were starving, we decided to check it out. 

We ate out on the patio, which was a great choice. I really liked the ambiance of it, with the lights hung overhead and the fake tree branches. And it was cool to be able to look out at the Strip (or at least what we could see of it). 

I got the tacos and it was the best choice I could have made. The plate came out with every possible topping I could have wanted for tacos and everything was piping hot. The tortillas seemed fresh and tasted better than a lot of tortillas I've had. The chicken was well seasoned, and the salsa was pretty good too. 

I think our waiter had been assigned too many tables though because it took forever for him to even take our order, and then to bring us our check when we were done. But, that aside, it was an experience I would definitely like to repeat!
