I've been here several times over the past year. The prices are decent and they have free wifi, though it barely works most of the time and outside it's almost impossible to get a signal. I am vegan but some of my friends aren't and they seem to really skimp on the meat in their orders. I don't drink alcohol so I can't speak for the bar drinks but the staff is usually friendly (though I have heard the kitchen cooks make sarcastic remarks about other customers' food when picking up my order which was a bit of a turn off). Great location for walking around downtown and visiting other shops before/after the meal.
