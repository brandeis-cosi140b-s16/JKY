My friends and I had our Gobblerita friendsgiving at the Shadyside location.  The food was great.  My gobblerita and margaritas were exactly why we went there.  

The service on the other hand was sub par.  We went at an odd time around 4 pm with nearly no one in the usually busy place:  Right after lunch, right before HH.  We sat in the bar and seemed to be a bother until our waitress was on her shift.  I go out to eat often and the service makes or breaks the experience.  I will try again soon.
