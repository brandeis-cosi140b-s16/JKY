This place is definitely the home away from home for all of you who are from New Mexico. I had heard from 2 different New Mexican natives that this is the spot for New Mexican Cuisine. I came in on a Thursday around noon and this place was packed! I live around the area and I've always wanted to try them since I heard such good things about Carlitos. I finally had my chance last week. I ordered the sopapilla since that's their signature dish, right? I sat at the counter area right next to the cash register since I couldn't really find any other spots nor did I want to take an entire table to myself considering how busy they were. My order was served to me pretty quick and I was kind of shocked because it was busy and it's made to order type of thing. I was honestly a little bit underwhelmed by my order. The inside was just some kind of white fluff and the meat was just alright. I guess you really have to be from New Mexico to appreciate this kind of stuff. Although other patrons were ordering an assortment of different dishes that sounded delicious. I don't know if I will come back here and may just opt for somewhere like Cafe Rio.
