The burros were in alignment as we happened upon this joint one Sunday morning.  Not intending to do a brunch but just had to try the Mexican Brunch menu.

$8.99 for all you can eat ala carte with a fruit and yogurt bar.  Eggs and Carne asada were good as were the potatoes.  Wife had the Huevos Rancheros which were decent.  Portions were a little small but that might have been because they were served on huge plates.

After our first plates the waiter came back around to take another order but we were stuffed by then.  Service could be a little quicker but over all it was ok.

Will definitely be back.
