Yelpers....you let me down. I expected greatness but what I got was just...ehhh OK. The place is cute, the story is fun and the beer is cheap (during happy hour) but the tacos and ceviche were small enough to be served at my neices tea party. Seriously.

I'd consider this more of a taco tapa's restaraunt than a true taco shop as everything (and I mean the 5 or so things are the menu) are a la carte. Did I mention that I hate places that charge extra for chips and salsa?
