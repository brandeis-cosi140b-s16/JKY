The restaurant was packed on a Saturday afternoon.  Took a long time to get drinks and our order in. We Ordered tacos and fajitas.  Food came promptly and came with several sauces we could try with our fried chips.  Everything was delicious. However, once the food was delivered, the waiter never came back to check on our empty drinks or give us our check - we had to flag him down.  Food was a 5 but service was a 1. Overall a 3.
