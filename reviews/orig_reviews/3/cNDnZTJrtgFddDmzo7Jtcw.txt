The food was pretty good and reasonably priced...nothing like Barrio Cafe, but I truly wasn't expecting that.  The downfall of this place is the service.  Our server never really checked up on us and we needed to wait to long for drinks to come out.  I am hopeful they will get the kinks worked out and this place will succeed.
