I found this place by going through the reviews on  Yelp and they were all pretty good.  The place was almost empty when we arrived, it looked "brand new"  and the waitress mentioned that they just had a Grand Opening.  Well,  the food was pretty good but nothing to write home about.  The service was above average, but again, not many people in the place.  The prices were pretty fair. Would I go back,  probably not but it wasn't a bad place to eat.
