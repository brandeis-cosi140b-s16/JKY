I love the food here it is one of my favorite places. Problem is the service is horrible. I have been their over a dozen times and have only had great service once. I have walked in their multiple times were their are dirty glasses all over the bar because the bar got slammed with drinks for the restaurant and no one helped him clean. No presence of team work. No wifi available so doing work while enjoying a margarita is not possible. I would go their more often however it is hard to get people to agree to go with me due to their past experiences.
