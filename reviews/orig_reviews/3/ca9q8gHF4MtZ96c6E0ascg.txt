This rating should have been 5 stars, unfortunately over the past year or so since they have opened, I've slowly watched the service go down the drain, the food gets five stars but the people making it get one star. The only person who seems to always be on the ball is the cashier. Be prepared to have to explain multiple times what you want in your meal, and then watch them to make sure they do it right. Also if you order the taco special, I've been asked multiple times how many tacos I want ( the menu options are a one taco meal or a two taco meal...) but when I ask the guy behind the counter how many it comes with he said as many as I wanted and refused to give the correct answer even after insisting to know how many the meal CAME with. I've asked him this on three separate visits  ( same guy) to see if he will give the right answer and I always get the same answer. Its a good thing their food and drinks are great because it is a pain to have to supervise your own order being made!
