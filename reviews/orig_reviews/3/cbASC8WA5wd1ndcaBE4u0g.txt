We stopped here for a quick dinner on Saturday night...the place was empty! Now, I'm use to the La Salsa back in San Diego that is a fast food place, so this seemed pretty pricey to me for basically the same food. My husband had the Fajita Quesadilla and I had the chicken burrito. Both we good but not excellent. We also ordered the chips and salsa (which I hated paying $2.50 for...who doesn't give free chips!!) and I had a strawberry margarita which was decent. It was an okay dinner, but not worth the $$!
