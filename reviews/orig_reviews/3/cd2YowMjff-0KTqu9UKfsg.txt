It's just ok.  Not worth the price or the long wait.  The service was not good.  I won't go back.

The food is authentic and diverse but just doesn't taste good.  I tried three dishes, the slow roasted pork, the tamarindo duck and the stuffed chile.  They were poor, ok and good in that order.  The pork was dry, even with the juices poured over it.  The duck was lost in the tamarindo sauce.  I like tamarindo so it was ok, but some of the flavor of the duck should have come through.  The stuffed chile was really nice.  For the sides, the calabasas (squash medley) were good and so were the potatoes, I would have gone with roasted instead of mashed if there was a choice.  For portions, only the pork was a good sized dish.  The duck was just right and the chile was not enough food.

It is nice to see a Mexican restaurant try to expose people to things besides enchiladas with a side of rice and beans.  They just need to make the food better, lower their prices, take reservations and fire our dour waitress.
