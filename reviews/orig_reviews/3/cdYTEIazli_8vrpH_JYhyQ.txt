Can you say SALT?  Yep, lots and lots of salt.  Don't get me wrong, I have been frequenting Rosita's for more than a few years and I have always loved their bean and cheese burrito enchilada style...oh yeah..and of course their chips and salsa are pretty tasty - as long as you don't take a big bite of cold harden grease on your chip.  Totally blows the meal, as you could understand. Pretty much only go if you have to have some sodium after a  heavy night of drinking heavily or in dire need of some good ole hip widening comfort food.  You'll probably see me there on a Sunday afternoon with the biggest pair of sunglasses I can get my hands on while popping Advil.
