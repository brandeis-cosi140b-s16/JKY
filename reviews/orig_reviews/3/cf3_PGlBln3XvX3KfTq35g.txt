First time to La Ristra.  Immediately served chips w/salsa and water. Ordered silver margarita and that was a good start.  Took forever to get actual food order taken.  No refills on water or chips/salsa.  Waiter commented he was "freaking out".  He did recommend the ribs but admitted he hadn't sampled everything on the  menu.  Food arrived after a very long wait.  New Mexico Burrito was good but not memorable in any way -- underwhelmed is a good word to use.  Also temperature-wise although immediately served it wasn't remotely warm.  Veggie fajitas with additional green chile and jalapeno's had great taste and were served hot! (timing issues between both items being prepared perhaps?)  While there, numerous others tables with other servers were able to order and be served and probably at home long before we were able to exit. Tables adjacent to us were all having the same service issues.  Verdict?  I had friends visit the night prior with great food and service and they were surprised at my comments given their visit recommendation.  So hopefully just a bit of an off night for the place as it looks like a well run restaurant with great potential.
