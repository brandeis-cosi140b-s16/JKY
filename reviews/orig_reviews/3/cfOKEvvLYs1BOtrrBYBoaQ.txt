DJs is a nice find on The Strip - what appears to be a non chain spot in an outdoor food court a little bit on the quiet side because it is set back from the street.

Add in the 10% off Yelp check-in deal and you have yourself a winner. 

The tacos were not the best I have ever had, but they were a step above what you would expect to find in a mall food court.  At 2am I guarantee they would be nothing short of amazing.
