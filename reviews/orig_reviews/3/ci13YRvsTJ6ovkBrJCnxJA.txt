I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh and she suggested we check out Casa Reyna while exploring the Strip District. I was kind of bummed this place was in a basement, as it was a gorgeous day and I wanted to drink my margs in the sun! 

We were there right as Happy Hour was starting and I thought prices seemed a little high ($12 Margaritas // $10 on Happy Hour). What joy I felt when they came out in a large cocktail shaker. Really it's like getting 3 drinks! The girls and I had lots of fun sippin' and talkin'. The bartender was really great and made a mean margarita. He even made my friend a spicy jalapeno margarita by request. 

The ambiance is a bit lacking, as it is really just one big themed/decorated room with tables, chairs and no windows. 

We didn't eat while we were here, but I sure enjoyed those drinks!
