I gave Taco Guild a try for the first time today. From walking into the front doors to the end of my lunch, my experience here was stellar. Everyone was friendly and staff members even sat down to explain and answer any questions I may have had. The food is so fresh and is decently flavored. It is located inside of an old church. A cool place to check out.
