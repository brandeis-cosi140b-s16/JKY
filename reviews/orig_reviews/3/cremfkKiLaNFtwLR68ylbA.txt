Although the food was actually very good, I will not patronize this restaurant again. First of all it was unreasonably loud. There were several large tables of people and they were literally screaming and yelling at the top of their lungs. We were celebrating my friends birthday and we could not even have a conversation. I also did not care to hear about the sexual exploits of the "ladies" at the table behind us. Our waitress took forever to wait on us and when she finally did take our order she failed to bring everything we ordered. Very disappointing.
