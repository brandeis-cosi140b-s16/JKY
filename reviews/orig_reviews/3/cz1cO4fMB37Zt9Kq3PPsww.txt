Tip:  if you're driving at night along Rainbow blvd looking for this place, just look for the big ass Harley Davidson shop.

Got 3 bowls:  Kalua pig, steak, and huli huli chicken.

All the meats were nicely flavored and tender.  My favorite by far was the steak.  

Steak had nice crisp edges while remaining juicy throughout every bite.
Huli huli and kalua pig both had nice light smoky flavor.

Only bummer was the seaweed rice.  It was hard and kind of dried out.  

Grilled onion salsa and pineapple salsa were delicious.  I mixed that in together which distracted me from the hard rice. 

The bottled sauces on the counter were unnecessary.  I tried them anyway but didn't do much to add .  In fact, they probably take away from the flavor of the delicious meats.  Definitely able to create a well rounded meal if you add everything they offer.

Coconut bark - yummy.  Nice and chewy - sticks to your teeth so you can enjoy it a long time.  Don't forget to brush!
