I don't know why, and I don't know how, but my group always ends up here after clubbing every single time we go to Vegas. It's like every night  we have three main goals -- get drunk, get into our club of choice, and get these damn nachos. It'll be 4 am,  I'll phase in an out of consciousness, and all i see is a plate of gooey cheese, tri-colored nachos & steak. I won't even know how much I ate, but l know I'll be able to drunkenly pass out happy.

That being said, trying this place sober was a different story. Be prepared to wait forever, get things spilled on your or on the table, and have to ask multiple waiters for the same thing repeatedly until you get it. There is also enough cheese to have four people split this, get them all sick and not be able to finish it.

If you're a total rewards member, don't forget to show your card for a few dollars off.

But those nachos... oh, those nachos.....
