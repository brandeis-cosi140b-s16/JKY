I had lunch here the other day and over all my experiences was okay. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about either. 

My friend and I both had the Grilled Steak, which was flavored very nicely.  

The wait staff during the lunch hour were extremely nice. If you in the area and looking for a place to eat, give this place a try.
