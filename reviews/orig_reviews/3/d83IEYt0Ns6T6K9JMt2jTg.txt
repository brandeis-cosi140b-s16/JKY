Edit Update: The owner called me and apologized, waived the meal and sent a gift card. Also indicated he is implementing a new protocol for allergies. Good customer service. Still a painful couple days but will try the restaurant again. Upgraded to 3 star

I specifically requested a meal to be gluten and dairy free (I am allergic). The bartender taking the order assured me it would be and that they are very good about allergies. I get home with my to go order of tacos, take 3-4 bites and then realize there is cheese all over the bottom of the inside of the taco. Thanks Blue Adobe for the pain I am about to suffer for the next 4-5 days.
