It's kind of a cool venue and there's plenty of parking. The food is okay: more of an "upscale middle-class white people" kind of Mexican restaurant and less "actual Mexican people enjoy actual Mexican food." Chips and salsa were free and tasty and the drinks were pretty good! Our service wasn't great, we had a coupon which had no limits on it but both our server and the manager refused to honor it. This was particularly frustrating, since we had come because of the coupon. Also there's something about eating an old church that either creeps me out or bums me out (im not sure). It's not a bad place to go, but there's lots of GOOD Mexican food in Phoenix so why settle for okay? This place is fine, but nothing special.
