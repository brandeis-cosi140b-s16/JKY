Why am I giving this three stars instead of four that I gave the one in the Mandalay Bay, it's just not as good.  The menu is much smaller and lacks some of the favorites I've come to depend on when dining there.  My absolute favorite is the chili relleno and this iteration of the border Grill doesn't serve it.  I did have some chicken enchiladas that were very good and I'd have them again but think next time we'll go back to the one at Mandalay Bay. We always order the guacamole and while it was tasty, it also wasn't as good as the restaurant down the street.

One of the things that made our experience less positive was the person who showed us to our table.  Believe he was the manager and asked if we'd been there before.  When we said no but we generally ate at the one up the strip, he said oh, he'd be back to see how his compared.  Now the place wasn't that busy but we never saw him again. guess he didn't really care.  He also mentioned that one of the owner/chefs was there and when I said I'd love to meet her and give her a compliment, he said he'd make sure she stopped by, that didn't happen either.  Customer service folks, that's what it's all about.
