Average Mexican food! Prices were good but nothing too special. We were sat right away which was nice. We were staying at PH and needed to get a quick dinner before going out. I got enchiladas which were tasty and bf got pork tacos. Pretty average.

OH- I had a fruit fly in my drink! Not that big of a deal.. but still kind of gross. I would have thought they would have done more than just not charged me for my drink. Whatever, wouldn't be back either way.
