Excellent food. Huge portions. Delicious shredded beef chimi's & red chili burros.  The folded quesadilla with grilled chicken is mouth watering. Lets just say they have delicious food! 

The service,  yet to be desired. Even if you order take out. Check your bag before leaving!!

My sister went here on her bday. The waiter messed up on 4 out of 8 orders! No apology or anything. 

My family has been going to Nando's (Mesa) for over 2 yrs now.
