Younger crowd.  Good outdoor seating setup with outdoor bar and open air to indoor bar.  I was here for apps and drinks, and a second time just for a drink.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  Typical appetizers and beach themed drinks.  I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this place and I definitely was not.  Due to the location in relation to where I live, I will be back for lunch drinks.
