Good place to stop for a beer and grab a bite to eat. On a side street in New York New York. Outside setting was great. Waiters were on it, order taken and food recived. 
Food was decent and the beer was cold. Plenty of  people watching time, the staff didn't push you along after your meal. 
Last word... Relaxing.
