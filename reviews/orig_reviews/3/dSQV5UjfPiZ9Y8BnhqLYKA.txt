The food is legit but really- it's expensive!  The salsa is weak-sauce. Tapatio is spicier.  I asked the lady in the kitchen for a sprinkle of queso fresco on my carne asada tacos and she straight up had the audacity to say, "It's an extra $2.50 for the cheese, is that okay?" I said. NO thank you- I don't want $2.50 sprinkles of cheese.??!?!!?!? who charges that much for cheese? I could buy a damn block for that price. Their chicken soup is dope though!!!!
