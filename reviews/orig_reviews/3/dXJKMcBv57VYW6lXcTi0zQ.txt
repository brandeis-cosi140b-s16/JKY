This place has terrific Mexican food and their salsa is fabulous! My only complaint is that on our most recent visit we were waiting in the tiny bar area for what felt like an eternity and the woman would not make us drinks! It was odd. Once we were seated our server was awesome and told us about some cool local bars.
