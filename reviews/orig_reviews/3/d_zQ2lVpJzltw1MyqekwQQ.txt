Got an invite to meet my son, wife and grandson for lunch. This is a fairly new place. The food was good and prices reasonably. 
This place is a small building. You order at a window. If you want to eat there you have a few tables. I think two or three to choose from. These are located outside in the Arizona heat. There is shade. But when it is 110 the shade does not make comfortable to eat outside. Most people were just ordering and taking it home, to their work place, eating in car. None of these being my choice. We ate there.
I believe there would be more people eating there if there was more seating outside and some misters. I will be back but after it cools off.
