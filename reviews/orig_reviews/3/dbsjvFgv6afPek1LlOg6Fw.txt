I really wanted to like this place because we were starving and seriously craving some Asian noodles after a night of drinking. We came down here to eat after we couldn't handle Marquee Day Club anymore.

The three of us ordered the dan dan mien, wonton noodle soup and the beef lettuce dish to share. My favorite was the beef lettuce dish, only because the other two were  disappointing. Portions were pretty small overall, sadly. I really wanted soup, and the broth in the noodle soup was bland, but the wontons were yummy! There were barely any egg noodles.

The chewiness of the dan dan mien was perfect though! And the service was exceptional too. I also enjoyed the restaurant decor because it was really fun and cute, and loved the wallpaper and Asian style decorations.

The food is OK, pretty overpriced, but the restaurant is fun and the service is great. It's really a toss up since this seems to be one of the only Asian restaurants at the Cosmopolitan.
