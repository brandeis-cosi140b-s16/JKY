This place is way far away but to meet some quality people I made the drive! I love mexican food, I've been to quite a few parties where the families have cooked and its some amazing food.  So I come to this place and after the rave reviews expected a lot.  
The atmosphere is quaint and nice, and the service is spectacular.  It also probably helped they weren't that busy.  The chips and salsa were good, not overly salty and as usual addictive.  I ordered the tacos, they only had hard shells and the shell was overly greasy and fell apart immediately.  i ended up eating it like an open faced sandwich.  My friends got burritos and meat dishes and they looked pretty good, and i usually love fajitas so maybe I'll give it a second chance should I be up that way again.  
I did like that now they have outdoor seating and there is a lot of other nice places nearby.
