** No free chips and salsa***

I ordered the Meat Enchilada Plate with chicken and it was very tasty.  However, I didn't really see any chicken.  If there was any in there, it was skimpy.  I paid $8.30 which I thought was a little too expensive.  I think I'd pay more like $6.75 for what I got.

This is a good place to go for a healthy lunch (compared to Carl's Jr.), but not dinner because the serving size was a little smaller than I'm used to.  There was only about 3 tablespoons of rice.  Sour cream is an extra .50.

I'm wimpy when it comes to spicy food and this food was just right, not too spicy.

There are no child's menu items, but they have for example a bean tostada for 2.55.

Over all, I'd eat there again if someone else was buying!
