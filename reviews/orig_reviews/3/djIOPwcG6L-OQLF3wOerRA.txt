Oh boy, where do I start? Came here with my boyfriend to meet up with some friends of his and because I only came for the company and didn't eat or drink, I can really only comment on the atmosphere for lack of a better word.

Our waitress was awesome. She was incredibly busy, but checked on us frequently and without asking, split all of the bills. I know bill splitting is a pain for waitstaff, but she didn't make us feel like it was an inconvenience. 

It was a busy night because of a college football game (this is an Iowa bar FYI), so the bar was packed and wild as hell. There were two extremes of patrons that night: post-college students looking for cheap drinks and cougar town posses who were just there to dance. I was reluctantly pulled onto the dance floor which was sticky with sloshed beverages and possibly something else from the two couples humping in a dark corner of the dance floor. 

I probably won't be back because I am right in that sweet spot of too young to be in a cougar posse but old enough to know that I don't have to leave my house to have a drink spilled on me. I can do that all by myself.
