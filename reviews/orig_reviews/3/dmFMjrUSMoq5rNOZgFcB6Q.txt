OK....  I wanted to like this place.  cool location, building, courtyard.  But the service was lacking and the food was not what we were expecting. 

This is run of the mill Mexican food. Nothing more. Salsas were average.

Our table was dirty and the floor was also dirty.

The Fajitas were ok...  just lacking flavor and love.

Its a place you may want to try but I did not like it...  Its ok.
