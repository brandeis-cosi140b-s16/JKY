Another mixed bag when it comes to Mexican food. Juan's was pretty good; in fact, I really liked pico de gallo a lot as well as the pork and green chile burrito. But, I am a stickler for chips and salsa. Most places always serve fresh chips and refreshing salsa, but Juan's chips were stale. Also, the salsa tasted like tomato juice mixed with diced veggies; it almost had me saying, "NEW YORK CITY?!" (hopefully that joke isn't too outdated). On top of that, the tacos I got were also a bit stale. Again though, the pork and green chile burrito (served enchilada style) and the pico were wonderful! Ahh! Such a mixed experience!

I know I'll be back to Juan's eventually, but now I know what I'll probably stay away from on the menu (it is possible it was a fluke, but we'll see). The service was pretty speedy and pleasant so I can recommend it for a quick/cheap bite, but choose your food wisely.
