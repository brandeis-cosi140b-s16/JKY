Hubby and I came here for the margaritas.
Okay okay, I came for the margaritas and dragged my husband and kiddo along with me. 
We decided to just split the gigantor appetizer platter. A guy came out and made my kid a balloon puppy, which he was terrified of, but it was a really neat gesture. Everyone was so friendly. I practically had to beat the waitress off with a stick to get her to stop refilling my water and salsa after each bite/sip.
The platter came out on an XL pizza dish and smelled to die for. I had no idea what I was eating as it all kind of looked the same (good mexican should look the same going in as it does going out though, you know its true) but it was fabulous. Im not sure if the cheese was real, but I don't think I care. There was a ton left over to take home and attempt to reheat later, too, and they had to roll us out to the car.
But the margaritas? Nothing special. I didn't even get a refill, and thats rare for me when around cheap booze. The bathrooms were pretty gross. Hence the star deduction.

Its cheap, it's fast, and its a greasebucket. The folks are friendly and there are biiiig ole TVs and paintings of parrots. What more do you want!?
