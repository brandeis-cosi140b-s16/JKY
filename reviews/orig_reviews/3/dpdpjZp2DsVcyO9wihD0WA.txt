The boyfriend and I took our parents here around Christmas. The hostesses were very nice. Our server claimed he had a big Christmas party he was handling,  so we were very understanding to him not being very attentive. However, we later found out that the party was buffet style and he had help. Needless to say, this was a bit irritating. Our steaks, fish, and pork were cooked perfectly. Unfortunately almost everything we ordered was extremely spicy. None of us mind a bit of spice, but everything being very spicy overpowered the meal and made it hard to enjoy.  All in all I would consider this a decent meal. Although for the price and poor service, decent feels more like mediocre.
