We have been here twice now.  Everyone raves about the salsa, but I don't get it.  I have had better salsa.  My husband doesn't like the place a lot, but will go if I want to.  I like their shredded beef tacos and stuff.  The enchillads actually come out cooked in the middle.  They cost more than I was expecting and the al a carte menu adds up quick.  Service is friendly.
