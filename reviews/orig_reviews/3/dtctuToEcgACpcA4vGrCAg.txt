I HOPE SOMEONE FROM MANAGEMENT READS THESE REVIEWS !!!  3 stars because the food is really good, but very disorganized and disorderly when it comes to ordering. We stood in line over 40 minutes with people cutting in, and to make it worse,  once we got the food we went over to try to find a seat ...another 35 minutes , there were more people seated down waiting for friends to bring the food over than people actually eating.  It became a lounge rather than a dining area!   By the time we found a seat,  food was cold and it will never taste the same . WHAT A SHAME TO FAIL IN THE MIDDLE OF SUCCESS.  At least put signs outside stating that you cannot save seats if you are not consuming food!
