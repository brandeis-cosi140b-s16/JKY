3 stars based only on the food because the service here really leaves something to be desired.  I ate here twice during the week I was in Vegas because we had two Groupons to use among our group.  Food was quite tasty but they have very little on the menu that is vegetarian friendly.  How a Mexican restaurant doesn't have veggie fajitas or bean burritos or the like is beyond me.  They did have a great ensalada with apples, goat cheese, and walnuts but that doesn't scream Mexican to me.  In any case, it was good enough to eat twice.  The appetizer nachos were decent as was the tableside guac.  Both times we ate here everyone liked what they ordered.  They have 2 for 1 margaritas during happy hour as well as half price Smirmoff martinis for Thursday ladies night.  The ambiance is fun and the servers are upbeat and friendly when you can find them.  Expect a long wait for drinks, food, refills, the bill....  Prices are a little high but you can expect that seeing as it's Vegas.  You do save a little if you are a Total Rewards member.  Worth eating at if you are staying at the Flamingo and don't mind slow service.
