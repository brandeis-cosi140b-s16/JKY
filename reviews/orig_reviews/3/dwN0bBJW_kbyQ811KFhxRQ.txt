Overall this place didn't knock my socks off (or my husband, Dad or Mom), but I would say you could definitely do worse in the area.  Cocktails were strong & tasty (liked that they had low cal & low sugar options on the margarita menu), service was very good, food was ok.  

My husband tried the black bean plantain mash based on yelp reviews.  It was a little too sweet for the dish that he ordered.  Maybe if you ordered something very spicy & salty it would be a nice accent.  He & Dad had the tacos carnitas, and Mom had shrimp tacos. All said it was ok.

I had the cabo salad & felt there should have been more veggies (quantity wise) in the salad. I am wasn't expecting it to overpower or equal the greens, but the avocado, beans & corn felt a little stingy portion-wise vs. the greens.

Wished I would have remembered there was a restaurant at the Mint museum that we could have tried...next time
