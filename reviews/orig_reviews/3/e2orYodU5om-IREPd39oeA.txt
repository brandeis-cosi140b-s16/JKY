A group of co workers went here for Happy Hour last Friday. It was my first time here. The value for the Happy Hour menu was comparable to other restaurants. I had Green Chili Verde and a couple of beers. While m coworkers had some chips, salsa and guacamole . The additionally had banana's foster and some drinks. It was buy for a Friday , however it was still enjoyable. Our waiter was attentive and efficient. Food was ok nothing to write home about. But I would still go back to try something else or another Happy Hour.
