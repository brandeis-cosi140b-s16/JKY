Probably the best "hidden" patio in the Queen City, RuRu's has a lot going for it.  It's just a matter of getting there.  You can see it off the road, but the parking lot is a bit tricky as  you have to whip around the block and park.  I noticed while eating that people came in all disoriented since the host table is located at the back door where the patio is, so if you come in the front door you have to traverse the entire restaurant to see the hostess and get seated.

Food is solid... servers are friendly... however a bit slow.  It's fine if you aren't pressed for time, but when the dining room is half full and you have to flag someone down to get refills and the check, it's a bit disconcerting.

The food has some memorable names and you can tell the kitchen has some creative juices flowing back there.  The main draw would be the tacos, but they have other offerings:  quesadillas, burritos, salads, and rice bowls.  Something for everyone.

Great location in Myers Park, however you need to find it.... If you live in the neighborhood, it's probably best to walk here.  I haven't tried to ride a bike here, but then again I haven't seen any bike parking close-by.
