I wish Yelp had a 1/2 star option, so I can give three and a half stars!

My tacos were delicious! Generous amount of guacamole and I loved the beer battered shrimp and pollock fish (crispy on the outside and tender and succulent on the inside). My ceviche was also good. 

The negatives were the Napa slaw in my fish taco (more vinegary-pickle than slaw) and a third of my chips (that came with my ceviche) were stale and hard. 

Despite the negatives, I'll give this place another shot.
