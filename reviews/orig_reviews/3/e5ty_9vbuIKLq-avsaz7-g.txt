The restaurant is nicely decorated. It's definitely considered an upscale/ gourmet Mexican restaurant. They have a great bar area with a few tv's for sports nuts like me! They also have a nice patio, although last time we sat out there it felt a bit crowded and tight. 

One thing that never changes is we always get the table side guacamole. Fresh and prepped to order!! As far as all the other items we've tried the food is good but I never seem to feel like 'raving' about it. Service also has been great every time. All in all- it's a place on our regular dining circuit just not a special occasion place for us!
