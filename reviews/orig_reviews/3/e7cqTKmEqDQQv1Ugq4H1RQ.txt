Juan Jaime's is just kind of eh. Every time I try a new Mexican place I have these grandiose ideas that I'm going to discover some new and exciting taco's that'll blow my little mind and make me feel like I'm eating at a little taco stand in Mexico. Well... as you can probably guess, I'm usually pretty disappointed when that doesn't happen 99 out of 100 times. Well, chalk up another dead soldier in my search for amazing Mexican food in AZ. 

Juan Jaime's turned out to be pretty average... decent assortment of various standard Mexican dishes; okay prices, pretty fresh flavor... but no 'wow factor'. With Mexican food, you've gotta do something to separate yourself. I can close my eyes and point to almost any cross street in Arizona and be within walking distance of a dozen Mexican restaurants. So why the hell do so many of them play it so safe? I guess there's nothing wrong with places like this... the food is good enough; I just feel like I could make the same stuff if given the same ingredients at home... I want to be amazed when I go out to eat, not paralyzed by averageness! Maybe the tequila part of the menu is a little more fun, too bad I don't drink. 

Who knows if I'll ever go back to Juan Jamie's... probably will just file it under my ever growing list of average Mexican spots I only eat at if I'm desperately craving some south of the border food. Blaaaaah.
