After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a place to grab some quick lunch and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's patio fit the bill.  The second floor patio provided nice views of the Bellagio lake,and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!

We started with some guacamole and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn chips.  The guacamole was ok, the cheese was really runny, and the chips were in tiny pieces which make dipping a challenge.

For mains, between us we had the Baja fish tacos, the jalapeno chicken, and the southwest cobb salad.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the overall flavour was good and spicy.  The fish tacos featured grilled fish which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best I'd ever had.  The salad looked great, and was a huge portion.

There definitely wasn't any food that would be worth returning for.  The prices were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 banana mama drink that was not that tasty.  The waiter was attentive, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.

I wouldn't return, there are other restaurants in Vegas with equally decent patios that I would try first.
