This restaurant is decent. We decided to dine here right as the beer festival was ending, so it was extremely convenient. Of course, so did myriad other patrons. Understandably, there was a little wait for a table but not bad at all.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the wait for the food. I understand they were busy. I'll forgive them. When we did get our meals, they tasted good. Nothing extraordinary here, but a decent meal to cap our evening.

They had a DJ playing some nice old school beats. That may or may not be your thing, but I enjoyed it. Oh and by checking in on Yelp, you get a free house margarita. To be honest, it was bland.
