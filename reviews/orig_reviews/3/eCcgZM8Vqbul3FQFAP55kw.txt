This place is inside the New York New York hotel, friends in town for a visit picked it or I don't think I would have ended up there as I have my favorite Mexican places here in town without fighting the Strip traffic....nonetheless here goes. 

The service was great, it was a Saturday night but Jose was right on top of everything. 

They specialize in half yard margaritas, I had a regular size  one...Blue Beach Bliss margarita was very tasty. No complaints. 

They charge $3 for chips and salsa, call me naive but I have never been charged for that before. 

I had the chicken chimichanga, it was good I didn't find it fantastic. Just good.  Rice and beans were good, slightly bland. 

Atmosphere was ok, the roller coaster noise was noticeble but not a big deal. 

All in all the service was the shining star of this dinner.
