This was my firat time at the original los olivos. I was just as un wowed as the north location. Sadly there isn't a single thing that I can point out that was bad.....but nothing was that good either. We had a largish party and I arrived late. It was an early dinner on a Saturday night so no waiting and the table already had chips and salsa on the table when I got there. I am not eating chips but everyone else seemed to like theirs. I thought the salsa was very shallow in its flavor. I like a deeper more roasted flavor. I asked for lemon with my water and he brought me a whole plate. I struggled to find the right thing to eat that wouldn't throw me completely off my no starch low sugar diet. I ended up with a chicken tostada a la cart and left the tortilla. It was perfect for me and pretty tasty. I know others were underwhelmed. I wouldn't "not" eat there again if others were going but I think I would rather try restaurants with a stronger point of view anc commitment to excellence.
