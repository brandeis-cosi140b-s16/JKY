To be fair, I like the look of Pinches Tacos, but I only had one thing there to eat - Mexican Corn on the Cob.  Perhaps a more in depth review would give me the chance to add another star.

As one of only a handful of places to eat in the Downtown Container Park, Pinches had a shorter line.  But I wasn't particularly going for entrees here since we had some other food already from another eatery.  I did really want to check Pinches out though.  I ended up getting one of the biggest staples you can find on a Mexican menu besides rice, beans, and tortillas.  Corn on the cob!

The Mexican Corn on the Cob from Pinches Tacos was actually not bad, although I prefer mine grilled.  This one looked like it was just boiled or steamed.  It did have the requisite Mexican cream, cheese, and chili powder on it though.  A very good helping of it.  The corn on the cob was a good size as well, enough for two people to munch off of.  Overall taste was good, the sweet corn blended well with the hit of cream and the salty cheese.  The kick from the chili powder was most welcome.  I would definitely have this again the next time I come back to Pinches Tacos.

The thing that took 1/2 star from this review should be no surprise...the price.  Wow, $3.95 plus tax for one corn on the cob?  Seems really high priced for me.  I mean, you can go down to your local Mexican market around town and get the same corn on the cob (in some cases better) for like $2!  There's this Mexican guy I pass by nearly everyday from work who rolls around his little food cart and sells corn on the cob for $2 and his looks just as good as the one from Pinches Tacos.  I must say, the raise in prices must mean the rent at Downtown Container Park can't be cheap.  

Hopefully when I feel like braving the parking and the crowds at this park again I'll be able to stop by Pinches Tacos for another taste.
