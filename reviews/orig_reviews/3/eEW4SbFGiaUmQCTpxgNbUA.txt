Appetizers here were really good..we got the ceviche duo and bacon wrapped jalape√±os. The watermelon cielo was decent but I've had better watermelon drinks..we asked the bartender to change the channel when one game ended so we could watch another but he gave us attitude and said someone was already watching a game  when it was clearly over only highlights were showing.  Our waitress was pretty good. .honestly I say it was just a little overpriced.  Another thing that was good was that it opens out to where you can see their pool area.
