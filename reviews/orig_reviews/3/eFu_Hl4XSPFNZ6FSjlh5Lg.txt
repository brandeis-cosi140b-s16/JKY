First, let me just say that the food here is delicious. I come here weekly and can't get enough of their California burritos. Their tacos are great as well. You wouldn't think so because it's in a gas station, but you're in for a surprise. 

So why the less than stellar review? Well, there's a few things. 

There are only 8 or so stools to sit on. 5 in the front and 3 in the back. I guess it being in a gas station they prefer you to take your food and go. Don't plan on bringing in the family and having a comfortable sit down dinner. It ain't gonna happen. 

It's a one man show. Expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes for your order during the lunch rush. On two occasions I've seen a lady working with the only guy there. This was out of the 10 or so visits I've had. 

The hours are misleading. Please do yourself a favor and CALL before coming here. I came in at 6:15 only to realize that he closed when he was supposed to close at 8. This isn't the first time this has happened. I even called earlier at 12 and I was told they'd close at 8. It's a good thing I live nearby or else I'd be furious. 

My last gripe about the place is that the guy, or the both of them if the lady is working, will literally stop taking orders if they have a big order to fill. This, unfortunately, is not uncommon. There's a police station right across the street and the officers are big fans of the place. You'll see them carrying bags of orders from time to time. 

If it weren't for the amazing food with very reasonable prices, I would not bother coming here. Next time you're heading south on Rainbow off the 215, take the extra 3 minutes and drive past Chipotle and Roberto's/Don Tortaco and give Chile Verde Express a try. You'll be glad you did. Just make sure to phone your order.
