I went here for lunch with some coworkers. I agree with other reviewers they have great chips/salsa/ bean dip. The lunch specials are a decent value at 7.95 and come with beans and rice. I decided to be different and have the chicken taco salad and it was pretty good. It had huge chunks of chicken and I like that they don't put salad dressing on the taco salads like some places. Usually you can't get in and out in an hour at restaurants in the Scottsdale air-park but the service here is very fast. Arribas is right next door but I would much recommend this over Arribas. Next time I will go during nonbusiness hours so I can try there margaritas.
