I did a Yelp search for Taco Tuesday and found this restaurant, which was a little too fancy for the average Taco Tuesday. Their "taco tuesday" deal means you get $1 off your already expensive tacos.. While they were deliciously gourmet, and exactly the unique flavor experience I was looking for, you could eat one taco in two bites. :/

Tacos were delicious but way too small, and overpriced for the size. If you go here for the tacos, I'd make a night of it. Get yourself an appetizer, a couple drinks, and dessert if you want to be be satisfied by the time you're done.
