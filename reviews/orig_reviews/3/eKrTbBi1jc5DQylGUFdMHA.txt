Pros:
- Large portions.
- $2 Dos Equis all the time.
- Fast service.

Cons:
- Loud music and a crazy amount of sprinklers outside on some nights.
- The location and parking lot is a bit odd.
- Employees will not leave you alone!

In the end, the $2 Dos Equis will bring me back again, but not really much else.
