From the outside, you wouldn't expect the interior to be as modern as it was inside, but it was nice and unexpected. Their seats are not that comfortable, and yes, the restroom doors aren't "cool", but that's not too bad. My food was pretty darn tasty, which is what matters most. I ordered their chicken tamale and it was very good. Their salsa was good as well, but I wasn't that impressed with the guacamole. It was normal, nothing special. And I'm a big fan of Sangria, but I just didn't like the flavor in theirs. My husband liked it, but I wished I had ordered something else. Our waiter was good, and that's always a plus too. This was a good find, but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way again when there are so many other Mexican restaurants already on the strip. Deserves a try.
