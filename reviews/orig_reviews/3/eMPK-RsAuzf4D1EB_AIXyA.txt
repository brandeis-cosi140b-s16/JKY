What I love about Chuy's are the friendly folks that work there. I have never had bad customer service and I go there quite a bit because it is across the street from my home and it is VERY affordable. 

What I like about Chuy's is that I have found a few select items on the menu that allow me to fulfill my tex mex cravings. Being born and raised in Texas, this is def not the best, but so far I haven't found better in the Carolinas... aside from this place in South Carolina near the Angel Oak Tree, that place is swell!

It's also a great place to take children. I have seen them give out crayons and coloring books!

Their sopapillas were once huge and fluffy, and every other time they were small and crisp. Something is wrong here; Chuy's, please take note and fix.

I'll continue to visit on occasion. (:
