Went here with the hubbers to try it out.  It wasn't amazing but it was good.  The prices are fair but the food is not traditional Mexican food.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas which came topped with a sweeter/spicier version of enchilada sauce, really it looked like mole.  But it was good.  The hubs got a chicken burrito which was tasty but not as large of a serving as you expect with mexican food.  The atmosphere is great if you're into sports- seems like a great place to get some chips and salsa and watch a game.

We'll probably give it another shot- it just didn't satisfy my Mexican food craving.
