Relieved to know that there is good Mexican food in Scottsdale.  I was really beginning to wonder...

My co-worker found this restaurant on another internet site and we decided to try it out for dinner.  From the outside (Scottsdale Rd), it doesn't look like much.  We were tempted to keep driving and find another spot.  Fortunately, we pulled into the lot in the back and saw the very nice patio and true restaurant entrance.   As has been mentioned, the service was just okay; however, the food made up for it.

I recommend the tamales as an appetizer or a light meal.  They were divine!   Also, the crab enchiladas were very good.  You could actually taste (and see) the crab.  I loved the fact that the entree was served with freshly prepared veggies and that you could substitute those for rice and/or beans, if you so choose.    

This wasn't a cheap dining experience.  We skipped the margaritas and had iced tea.  The check for two ended up being right around $62 (tip included).  However, I'd definitely return.
