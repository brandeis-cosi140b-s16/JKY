Not really my choice for lunch today, just went along with coworkers. 

First time trying this place. I've passed by the restaurant many times but never followed through with trying it. 

Overall, I'm not a fan of Mexican food. I'll take Chipotle any day and after today's meal I'm reminded why.

Not that it was bad. But definitely not worth the price. I got the shrimp and lobster enchilada and it came with beans, rice, and pico. Prior to our main meal we got chips with 3 dips (beans, green sauce salsa, and regular).

When I think lunch special, I think the meal should be below $10.00. I think my meal was the day's "special" but I did peruse the lunch special menu and most of the items were over $10.00. Mine came out to be $17.00 with tax and tip, ugh.

I like the setup and decor of the restaurant. It's also a cute touch that the female servers are in their outfits (sorry I don't know what their called). 

I just don't know if I want to pay this much for Mexican food.
