Saturday was a great day to be out and about, weather was perfect in the valley. I had made plans with a friend to do hang out with them and have lunch and told her that since I was on her side of town, she needed to pick the place, and she picked Valle Luna.

Now I have been to the Valle Luna by my house and was not very impressed but I went with an opened mind and hoped things were better this time.

I ordered the exact same thing as last time, Fundido burrito; chicken inside a fried tortilla topped with jalapeno cream cheese sauce & melted cheese with beans and rice. This time the burrito was not burnt to a crisp, it was lightly fried and with the melted cheese and the jalapeno cream sauce it was a great combo! 

Thanks for not letting me down Valle Luna!
