Last day of our stay in Vegas for a catering convention and came to the shops to hang out till we got picked up for our trip to the airport. Had a hankering for Mexican. 

I ordered the fish taco beef taco combo and it was good. Nothing to write home about but was flavorful and the steak wasn't tough. 

A good end to a nice vegas trip
