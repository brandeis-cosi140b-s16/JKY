Patio is great. Service was slow but it was Jimmy Buffett weekend. Not sure that made a difference. Shrimp tacos were to die for. A little pricey but I don't spend a lot of time in Vegas and don't  know how it stacks up to other places. Highly recommend the tacos though.. Hopefully next time service will be better.
