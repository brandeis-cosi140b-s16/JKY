Cute little place in the down town area. It is open air and has a few little tables on the patio. I am from Texas so I am hard to please when it comes to Mexican food or Margaritas. 

It was dinner time, but we came specifically for margaritas. There was some chips and salsa brought out to us that were whatever. The chips were not very crispy and overly thick. The salsa was more chile based and thick like marinara, which in theory is ok but this missed the mark. There is really great selection of margaritas made with fresh juices. We ordered the blood orange, guava and passion fruit. The guava was my favorite. It didn't pack a huge punch, which for me means they were being stingy with the tequila. They were mostly sweet except for the passion fruit which was actually overly sour for my taste. If I wanted fresh juice they would have been fine. 

Over all you are paying for the downtown experience and the trendy little neighborhood they are nestled into. I would come back here and remind them to kick it up a little with the tequila. I really enjoyed sitting in their airy dining room on my last night in Vegas.
