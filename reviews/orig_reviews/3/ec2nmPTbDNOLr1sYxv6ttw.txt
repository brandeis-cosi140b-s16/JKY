Good atmosphere if you like noise. Good mix of people. Great happy hour deals...two for one drinks. The nachos are good, guac has no onions which is a big plus for me. Waitresses were very friendly but the bartenders were assholes

It's close to where I work and a decent place to chill after work but I don't think I'd drive from my cozy Northwest suburb down to this place just to eat and drink
