I find Mexican Food in Vegas to be lacking overall so none of the places here are Tex Mex which is my preference. Went with the family and for 3 adults and 1 child it was over $100 which I think is totally outrageous. My cheese enchilada plate was about $15.00! We didn't even order drinks so I feel violated. 

The food was better than average for Vegas but for the amount of money the portions were small and chips and salsa were not free. 

Service was excellent however so I'm willing to give it another try. Perhaps lunch is more affordable. If I'm spending over $100 then I'm headed to the strip for gourmet vittles.
