A solid throw back burger with some 21st century "I give more of a damn about the quality of the products I eat" adjustments.  Sit back and think about the origins of this great concept...I say sit back because that is what you'll be doing waiting at the drive-through.

One quick suggestion: The standard is probably too much for most of us.  Take off a patty and sell it as a 'sub standard' or something....well maybe come up with a better name first.

One more quick suggestion: Avoid the drive-thru, I've had root canals that have taken less time then it takes to get through this thing.  They get dinged a star until they can figure this out.
