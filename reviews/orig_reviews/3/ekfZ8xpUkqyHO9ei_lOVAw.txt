Located in The Cosmopolitan - I have to say what first caught my eye about this place was their viewing window where I could see them making pork buns, and also the fact it said there was take out. Pork buns + Take out = Win! (not quite what happened but probably would have gotten more stars had that been the case.) 

Chinese cuisine + Mexican Cuisine = China Poblano. I'd say this is a fusion of the two but on the menu literally its two separate cuisines you can order from, no mingling at least not that my eyes could see. 

Order consisted of: 
When Pigs Fly (4 pieces) - steamed pork buns $13.88
Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce $12.00
Lychee Sour - yummy drink $12.00 

So our waitress warned us that portions were small and that we should most likely order multiple things hence my pork buns and noodle dish. The pork buns to me were correctly portioned, I split the order with a friend thankfully because she had ordered a single $10 Lobster Taco and $14 Tuna Ceviche. The waitress really wasn't lying on small portions I give her credit for her honesty. 

The food was overall pretty good. I loved the flavor of the meat in the pork buns but was a little turned off by the meat being lukewarm/cold. My noodle dish was the kind of spicy I enjoy but I had to "pace" myself with the small dish swimming in a large bowl (I didn't understand this presentation, the lets make our portions look even smaller with using larger serving bowls?). The lychee sour, was probably my favorite part of the whole meal. It was a different type of cocktail, tangy yet sweet, and oh how I love lychee.

Overall a bit pricey for my taste given it wasn't anything overly special or wow factor. Perhaps I'd order the steamed pork buns again from the take out window given I could request the meat be a little more on the warm side.
