Stayed outside by the Strip and people-watched. Guessing where everyone is from and if it's their first  right time in Vegas is relaxing and entertaining somehow. Had a few drinks right under the heater, it was pretty chilly outside. They have different options for food, Mexican style mostly, nice loud music and all kinds of characters. Great spot to watch the Bellagio water show.
