Went here with my manager last night and saddled up at the bar for dinner and drinks. The bartender that was helping us was super friendly and helpful. We wanted to start off with a shot and she walked us through the different types of tequila and we had a shot of the Casamigos blanco and tasted the same line in reposado. You can definitely taste the difference and this would be a great spot to do some tasting. 

We started off with the chips & salsa they brought out and added guacamole and the fresh seafood ceviche. All of which were okay. The guac wasn't anything extraordinary, I could have done with some heat and salt. The ceviche was sweeter than your typical fare and also super chunky, which I wasn't a fan of. I had a hard time deciding on an entree, but you can mix and match tacos so I tried the baja chicken, carne asada, and bbq pork tacos, all of which I enjoyed. I had a mix of the black and charro beans, and the rice was okay. 

The star of the night was the white peach & hibiscus margarita which I would have drank by the gallon. It's very sweet so if that's not your style don't get it, but it tasted like sweet alcoholic candy :)

It's a cool spot, nice location, I'll be back.
