A fellow Yelper and I stopped by Loco Lime for dinner the other night.  The feel and decor of the place was great - it seemed to be a converted warehouse or industrial building - and I really like walking into a place like that!  We had the option of sitting inside or out, and the football game was on inside, so we opted for that.  The service was pretty good and the staff was friendly overall.  The food was good, but nothing amazing.  My friend got a margarita, and honestly it didn't seem to impress!  My fajitas were decent, but the tortillas were soft and almost gooey - so a big thumbs down there.  The overall experience was a good one, and I'd recommend it if you are looking for decent Mexican around plaza midwood.  Dont' expect to be wow'd by amazing food though!
