Atmosphere, Vibe, Staff, Music - Thumbs up.   Fresca's refreshing.  I like this place, just not a big fan of the food...  one of our crew from both evening visits stated "Great vibe, till you get the food".   Your taste may be entirely different.  Regardless I'll likely be back...

Let me tell you how to have a good time here all the way around...  Start at the bar and wait to get a booth inside near the bar (especially in winter).  Enjoy the free chips/salsa.  Stick to the standard Taco's - they are pretty good.  Don't have expectations for the sides.  The people at Upward Projects I think have a lot going right at this place.

Winter notice:  The outside patio surrounds the seating with door entries at several points.  This past visit we were seated next to a door to the main patio - it was being opened over and over with the cold winter air coming in.  After the door was propped open a couple times I told them I would let them in when needed (and the parties around us thanked me - they were feeling the cold too).

I think I might rate this a 4 during another season :).
