The idea of this restaurant sounded very appealing but fell short of my high expectations. 
I'm a fan of Chipotle and a bigger fan of Hawaiian-style meats, so what better than combining the 2 together! 

The staff was very friendly.. we were given samples of the Huli-Huli Chicken and Kalua Pork. I decided to go with a Huli-Huli Chicken bowl with seaweed rice, black beans, pineapple verde, lettuce and cheese. The chicken by itself was excellent with its sour marinate.. but loses its flavor when mixed in the bowl. It just seemed a little dry, like it was missing some sauces maybe?.. probably my fault for not adding more. 
I actually wouldn't mind just the chicken and seaweed rice.

I definitely want to give this place another try and hopefully make a better combination.
