Wasn't all that impressed service was slow salsa bar was dirty food was OK not horrible not great with only two people working on Saturday it slows things down and for the prices that they're charging I'll go back to Faustos. Nothing was really bad about the visit other than tables were wiped down salsa bar seemed a little bit dirty and just very very slow service not impressed.
