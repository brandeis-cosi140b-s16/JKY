Ah, Bakersfield. How you try. This place is way too hip for the average commoner - make sure you dress accordingly. The food is great, if you don't mind the occasional hour-long wait. The ambiance is cool, when they're not vacuuming all the seats around you three hours from closing time. Basically, Bakersfield has a lot of potential, but it's got a few kinks that could be ironed out. Bring date, not kid
