Excellent lobster tacos.  Salsa has a nice heat level.  The margaritas are sadly under par.  I ordered high end margarita and it was seriously burnt.  I also disapprove of having to pay for chips and salsa when the drinks are $14.  I would give it a four for free chips and salsa and maybe a five if they made a better margarita.
