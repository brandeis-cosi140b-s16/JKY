If you want an upscale-looking place with a taqueria-size price tag, bookmark this place. After hearing so much, it's hard to see how the reputation fits in with the reality. Coming from San Antonio, I'm used to quality taqueria fare, and though this place tries to do an upscale version, I'm not fully on board.

Between the line backup (there's not enough space for separate meat counters!) and the music being too loud for employees to hear my order (a live mariachi in a cavernous space?!), there is a disconnect between the concept and the actual facilitation of business. 
Salsa bar has ridiculously tiny cups (without lids) and upstairs seating area lacks any sort of napkin/utensil station, warranting multiple trips up and down the narrow stairs. I appreciated that there were grilled onions, though. 

Execution issues aside, the food was just okay. By the time I got my corn and paid, my tacos were cold. The lengua, asada, and barbacoa were all mushy to the point that I wasn't sure which meat was which, and they should all be distinct. As others have said, I didn't care for the pineapple salsa on the asada. The corn was tasty, but the chips tasted like they'd been sitting out. I've been happier spending $12 at a taco truck, but I'd come back here at someone else's request.
