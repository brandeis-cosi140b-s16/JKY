Pretty good place. I can't give this place 5 stars because there are sooo many other Mexican places that are better but their food is decent here. This location is often very busy but service is very fast. Food is pretty greasy but that's to be expected when you eat at a fast food joint. The ingredients seem fresh though and they have a nice little condiment bar too. The main downside is that their food always makes me super tired and sluggish. Would provably be in your best interest not to eat here all the time.
