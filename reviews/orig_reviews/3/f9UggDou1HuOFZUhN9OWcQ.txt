The Blind Pig is certainly an interesting establishment.  A butcher shop, restaurant and a bar all rolled into one business.  I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around the concept.  But no matter... no matter that my big scientific brain can't get itself wrapped around the idea.  The food that I tasted and the drinks that I had were yummy.

I stopped in here one evening to have a quick dinner.  The restaurant is small and it was almost full, so I sat at the bar.  Discovered that this restaurant/butcher shop is a member of the Uncle Sal's/Side Door family of businesses.  I also like it when I go to a restaurant and the regulars are chatty.  (this place is new and it already had some folks who say they'd been there every week since it opened)  I'm sitting alone, so it was great.  Just about everyone in the restaurant engaged in the conversation.  

The ladies waiting at the bar were extremely helpful with my selection.  I wanted to taste something prepared with the bacon infused marinade that they sell at the butcher counter.  Unfortunately, nothing on the menu is prepared with that.  However, the bartender was nice enough to suggest the closest item on the menu to that kind of taste.  That item would be the pig wings.  Yummy, what an amazing dish.  I think pig wings are starting to take flight!  The wings were flavorful, juicy and succulent.  They had a nice BBQ flavor to them, yet were not too saucy for my liking.  I also ordered their version the Mosow mule.  That was a 3 star drink.  

I did not take home anything from th butcher shop.  The meat from the butcher shop is from the acclaimed Hobe Meats of Phoenix, also owned by the same owners.  Perhaps when I want a standing rib roast, I will check here the next time.  

There is a large area out front for seating as well.  this is a solid place to go to after work or a baseball game during the nice spring evenings.
