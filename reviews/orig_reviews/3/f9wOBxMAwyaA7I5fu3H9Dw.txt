Met up with Rand H and Norm R for lunch here today.  We had been talking about going for Mexican food and Rand had been here before and liked it.  We got here right at 11am when they opened and all decided to do the buffet.  There weren't a lot of food choices - I had a cheese enchilada that was pretty good, a chile relleno that was just okay, some beef fajita meat that was fatty and tough, average rice and beans.  Nothing spectacular but not bad.  I think if I came here again I'd order off the regular menu and skip the buffet.
