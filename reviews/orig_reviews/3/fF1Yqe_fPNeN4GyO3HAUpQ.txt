Oh, it's ok I suppose. 

It's one of those places that promises so much in the way of a great time that one can't help but be disappointed. Kinda like a cruise ship.

It also reminds me of what art critic Robert Hughes said about Las Vegas: "The land of instant riches and perpetual orgasm".  

Party party party. Fun fun fun.

Anyway, they have bars and sell drinks and have Mexican food. The waitresses are young and cute.

Oh, and I do suspect -- as others here have suggested -- that many of the patrons are not entirely self-actualized and thus are not acting in a state of full existential freedom in attending this place.

In other words, they tend to be drunk and horny.

It also can be hard to find a place to park some nights.

And no, in fact I didn't get laid there, and that fact is probably weighing on this less-than-enthusiastic review. Thanks for asking!
