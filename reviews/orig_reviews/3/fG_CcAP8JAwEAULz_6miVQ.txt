Looking for a fast and reasonably good lunch option around Desert Inn and Eastern? Lindo should make your short list. They have reasonably priced lunch specials and they are slightly overstaffed which helps to get you in and out pretty fast if you need to get on with your day. 

I've had my share of experiences with Lindo...look at my previous reviews, it's a love - hate thing. They've messed up my orders. They can't seem to refill the salsa and sometimes the chips. And no not everyone wants fried fish tacos. But sometimes none of that crap matters. You go in and don't have to wait forever to be seated. And you'll don't pay out the nose for what you get. Sometimes...that's all you need. 

Back up to 3 stars...and removed from a special list.
