I had been looking forward to going to the Mission since the Yelp office hour event I was unable to attend.  The restaurant is quite beautiful, sophisticated yet relaxed.  Absolutely impeccable service from the hostess and our server.

We started with the tableside guacamole.  Although expensive ($12), I really enjoyed the option to adjust flavors or add-ins to my taste.  It is only made with one avocado, however, so if you're with a group larger than 2 or 3, you'll definitely need more than one order.  Chips were hot and crisp.

I ordered the tecate skirt steak tacos.  Simply prepared, tender, and delicious.  But I will warn you, these are little itty bitty baby tacos (3) with no accompanying side dish.  Nice for me since I'm trying to learn the art of having a light meal, but not for everyone.  I was a little put off by the serving size given the cost ($10).  I actually would not have even minded that if the tacos were priced individually, and I could have the option of choosing a variety of fillings.

So, by now you're on the edge of your seat just dying to know why only a 3-star rating.  It was my husband's lunch.  He ordered the pabellon, which is a sandwich of braised beef and peppers.  I will admit I did not try it, but I observed the eating experience.  The filling had so much grease that the entire bottom half of the roll was ruined.  The top half of the roll, however, was like a stone.  He attempted to cut it with a knife (he couldn't pick up the sandwich because of the grease), and could not.  He probably should have sent it back.  Thanks to the Mission, I am now trying to get the stain out of his new shirt that resulted from this eating fiasco.  Therefore, my own experience was tarnished.
