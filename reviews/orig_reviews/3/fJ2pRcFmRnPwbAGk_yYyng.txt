5 ladies
10 cadillac margaritas
2 pollo quesdillas, ahi tuna tacos, burrito combo # 2, burrito with salsa verde
HUGE bill.

The food was delicious, the drinks were strong. A bit pricey tho for mexican food. Seemed like it was quicker to go get a drink from the bar than to order it from the server. This place is good for groups.
