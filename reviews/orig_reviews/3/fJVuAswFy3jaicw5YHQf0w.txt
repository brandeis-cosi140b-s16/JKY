My girl and I used to really love this place due to the fact that there is very nice man my son loves to hear sing during the evening. The food though has gone down tremendously in flavor and quality. The meat is mostly lard and fat these days and the tortillas were not fresh and and home made like another yelper pointed out. This is only referring to one meal we split while on our visit. It was the pork carnitas if I remember correctly. I cannot comment on the other dishes though.

The wait staff was very kind and professional when I had issues they tired to fix our complaints very fast and within a timely matter. I was very pleased to see management on the same team as on the servers. We always over tip here cause of the service.

 The fideo soup is kid friendly and tastes great. My son loves this as well as the beans with his chips. Again, our kid loves to come here.

I also have a problem with the prices of the food. The dips for the chips are just OK and the service is decent. Margarita will kill a diabetic though cause of the amount of sweet mix they use. They actually ran out of the salt rimmer mix for the margarita and had the audacity to use regular table salt on my damn drink. 

In short, we will give it another shot after the economy gets a little better. Maybe their food will be better at that point and time.
