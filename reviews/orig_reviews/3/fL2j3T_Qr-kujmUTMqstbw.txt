I mean honestly.....Could the service/servers at this place be any worse if they TRIED?? Every time we have been here, we get stuck with a miserable, personality-less waitress.  Seating is hard to find if you go during a busy time, and you feel like more of a hassle or burden to the people than a customer.

Regardless, I love tacos. I crave them at all hours of the day.  Especially fish tacos, and this place has my favorite fish tacos in Pittsburgh.  We usually order fish, shrimp and chorizo.  Made the mistake of ordering the chicken tacos recently and I will never make that mistake again.

I'm personally not a huge fan of their confusing extensive drink menu filled with things Ive never heard of before, and the corona last time we went was canned and room temperature.  No bueno.  Have had their sangria and margs before which were pretty good.

If you want decent food in a different atmosphere, this is your place...but don't come if you are easily offended  - because their wait staff is honestly miserable lol
