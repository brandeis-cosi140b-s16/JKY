Like others have said. VERY LOUD. It's a great place to drink and have a good time. At times the whole bar/restaurant gets up and does a Congo line. They give out "free" shots. Really they just taste likes juice. They have a cover band that place a wide range of different music. The food is over priced and not that great. And seems to usually have a 30 min wait later in the night. Overall fun place for drinks as long as you don't plan on having a deep conversation
