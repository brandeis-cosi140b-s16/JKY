I was really hoping to love this southwest restaurant but after  2 visits nothing stuck out except high prices.  We ordered the outlaw steak fajitas because the server recommended that they would be a good to share.  When the tab came they had charged an $8 split plate fee.  I wouldn't have a problem with this if it were disclosed.  And $7 for one taco?  In today's economy I have to love the place to pay those kind of prices....
