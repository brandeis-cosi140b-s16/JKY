I had high expectations coming into this restaurant based on all the reviews on here but overall it was just okay. Diego Pops does have a very nice presentation going for it and I did like the decor. For lunch I decided on the cheese quesadilla and the shrimp taco. The cheese quesadilla was better than expected and I loved the presentation that it came in! As for the shrimp taco it was decent but nothing too special as far as tacos go.

Service was a bit of a letdown however as once the restaurant got more busy it took a while to finish up my meal and get the check. Perhaps they were short staffed or just wasn't expecting so many people to show up but it wasn't too big of a deal.

Overall I would say that Diego Pops is a nice addition to the area but with the service being a bit of a letdown due to the slowness that I experienced at the end of my meal I would probably think twice about coming back here again. Also with so many Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area there are definitely better options for food.
