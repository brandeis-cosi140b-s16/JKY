Nothing great, nothing terrible. The fajitas were oh kay- nothing super tasty or amazing. Price is a bit high, but hey it's Vega$. 

The drinks were not my favorite. Order the $8.50 Patron Margarita for a decent tequila at a good price. However mixing that good tequila with really cheap sweet and sour mix instead of triple sec and lime makes it not so fantastic. 

Maybe a bit cleaner in the restaurant would make it a bit more appealing as well.
