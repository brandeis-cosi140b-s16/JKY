During our family vacation, we ate here twice - once for brunch and then for dinner.  Brunch was really good - food had a great taste and very spicy, so we couldn't wait to go back for dinner.  Unfortunately, while dinner was good, the margaritas were awful.  My local joint in Georgia is way better.  We were so surprised with all of the Tequila ads everywhere, one would think that margaritas in Phoenix would be awesome - but not here!

By the way, this place also brews their own beer - it is the WORST possible - by no means should you attempt to try it, SOUR - YUCK!
