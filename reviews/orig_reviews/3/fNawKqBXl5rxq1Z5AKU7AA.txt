What do you eat after a night out drinking and feeling a little hungover? Yup! seafood and a beer. We drove about 15 min off the strip for this place that my friend recommended. It's a little hole in the wall in a shopping center that you would not notice it was there. We walked in and got seated and were brought out chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and crispy and salsa was delicious and spicy. We all ordered and I had a shrimp cocktail and a ceviche tostada de pescado. It took a while for our food to arrive because we were a table of 9. To start we also had agua chiles that were fresh and spicy and enjoyable. My michelada was very good and hit the spot. A little spicy but not to much and nice salty rim to compliment the beer. It was a good experience and the staff was very friendly and always asking if we were ok. If you want seafood off the strip take a drive and see what you think.
