I personally love this place but I think more for the decor than the actual food. and it is part of the reason why I'm being nice for the review so really 3.4/5 stars. you come in and you feel like oh this is definitely not Robertos! lol btw

we loved the whole different lines they had it was a cool cafeteria concept. we ended up going with

al pastor tacos (3.5/5)- watching them slice the meat in your taco gave it a special homemade feel to it. as far as the meat itself loved the texture, it was juicy but it had either too much cinnamon or something but maybe that's authentic for them I dunno.

chicharon tacos (4/5)-these were my personal fave because it was sliced pork belly and they put the crispy chicharons on to to give it that texture and obvious with the garnishes it made this so good!

street corn (2/5) I'm sorry but the version they have brought here does not taste anything like the lady pushing the cart in your neighborhood. it had too much cheese and the flavors were not authentic.I think they need some work in this particular dish.

If you ask me if I might come back to this place but then again I probably would come with a lot more people I think this place had charm because the space can accommodate a lot of people. I could see eating here after a night of drinking and just taking with your friends and hanging out while enjoying some cheap tacos! oh btw I love the salsa bar...so many different kinds can't wait to try some more.
