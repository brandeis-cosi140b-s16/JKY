This is one of the oldest still-running restaurants in the area. It shares a name with one of the newest restaurants on Park Avenue in New York, but is completely unrelated. In fact, I'm sure the experience you'll have here is just about the opposite.

It's in a location that the 70s Historical Preservation Society must be fighting to keep alive. I'd like to say it has character, but this old poorly designed strip should probably be nuked from space. However, you can't really complain too much when it's one of the few remaining old-school Mexican joints in town. 

It's clean, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere inside is cozy. As my mother said... if you eat here, you can pretty much plan on going home smelling like Mexican food. Whether that's a good or bad thing can be up to you. 

The food is just slightly above average for this type of place. Chips were okay. I put the salsa as below average. It was flavorless, but hot. The cheese crisp was good... not too oily. The guac was good. My entree was decent. It's the type of place that serves you standard old-school dishes - generally an ugly 70s plate full of grease with a sea of beans and slop and cheese and whatnot on the side. Same story as many other places. Too much to eat, and basically none of it is healthy, and basically all of it will either constipate you or clean you out.

The margaritas were pretty good. I would eat and drink here again I suppose if someone else was paying. This is your mom and dad's joint. Wish it was better.
