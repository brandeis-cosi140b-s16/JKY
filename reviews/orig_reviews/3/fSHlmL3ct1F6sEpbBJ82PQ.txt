My boyfriend, brother and sis in law went here last weekend and the deal we got ,$20 all u can drink beer on tap from 9pm-midnight, was AWESOME!  And it wasnt cheap beer. they had blue moon and XX! The bartenders were nice at first but then all of a sudden started ignoring us and walked everywhere except for near us. We pretty much had to wave tip money in front of their faces to get their attention. The atmosphere is cool and some of the body guards were chill. Overall it was a good time. But the bartenders need to change they're attitudes.
