This place had potential but we were not impressed. It was pretty much empty when we entered and this is never a good sign, but we were willing to forgive that if the food was good. It wasn't.... They had Mexican food, international food, russian food and one other type of cuisine - hardly any russian food, which was weird considering they are a russian restaurant.
