I was expecting my Sunday lunch at Barrio Caf√© to be one thing but got another. They are recognized by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, for their tableside guacamole. 

I was expecting tableside guacamole but they don't offer it during lunch. Which, I'm not sure if they did it would change my opinion. What made it unique (not necessarily good) was the addition of the slightly sweet pop of pomegranates seeds. But still, pomegranate seeds or not, I can't justify paying $10 for any guacamole.

What I liked most about Barrio was the service, the live acoustic guitar, and their Chiles en Nogada. Their Chiles en Nogada dish; roasted poblano pepper; stuffed with perfectly seasoned chicken; onion; garlic; pecans; apples; pears; apricots and pomegranates, finished with a creamy slightly sweet almond sauce - was spot on and truly a great surprise. 

Overall, I had a really good meal (expensive for Sunday lunch) that surprised me and intrigues me to try other entrees. Their dishes incorporate seasonal produce with, what seems to be, authentic Mexican cuisine. Hopefully there will be more surprises for me when I go back.
