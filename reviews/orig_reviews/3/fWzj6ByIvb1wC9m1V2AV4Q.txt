If you want to know what the real core of Phoenix--and I am not talking about the extreme East LA suburb it's become in the last 15 years--is all about, you need to experience the Tee Pee.

The food is Mexican in the same way that Pat Boone singing "Tutti Fruitti" is rock n' roll or Justin Timberlake is an actor, but that's to be expected. TeePee offers you their take on the GringoMex genre and does it well, with mountains of cheese piled atop mildly spiced traditionals like enchiladas and hard tacos, complete with sides of refried beans and rice crusted over by spending a bit too much time under the salamander. The chips are obviously made in the restaurant because they are too greasy to have travelled far. You pay a bit more than would ordinarily seem appropriate for this level of cuisine, but then there's the show.

And the show--on weekend nights, at least--is a parade of dapper, vigorous men in their 50's and 60's who have the appearance of scratch golfers, or at least the clothes for it.  They are accompanied either by one of two types of women: Those about the same age who look like they spend a good bit of time at the hair salon and getting rhinestones custom-embedded into jeans that actually fit their butts, or younger ones with great make-up and pneumatic breasts. Together they float on a cloud of real-estate development money, ferried to the place in various standard-Scottsdale-issue Lexuses Acuras and BMW's. Jocular phrases are bandied about by the tanned multitudes: Trips to Hawaii, facelifts, scapegrace kids being sent to military schools.

And all of this happens in a building that probably started out as a private home at one point, has been added on to over the decades, and still features formica tabletops, painted concrete floors, and vinyl booths.

So go for the show. You can eat anywhere.
