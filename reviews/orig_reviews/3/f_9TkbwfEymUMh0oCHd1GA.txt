Awesome neighborhood place! After scoping out possible places to dine in this area on yelp we settled on La Pinata because of the promising reviews about their stellar enchiladas! Never one to miss up on a good enchilada, we gave it a go and were very happy!!

The salsa was good, as were the chips, they kept 'em coming! I especially loved the lady with the salsa in a pitcher who wandered around the dining room giving our lil bowl refills on the regular! The tacos were awesome and so were the enchiladas!! YES! 

The food was fantastic, our only complaint was that the service was shit. We had this guy as our waiter, sorry didn't catch his name but he was ignoring us like CRAZY! We'd call for him, he'd give us the errect index finger asking for a minute and would never come! We didn't get refills on our sodas, until we asked for them from the salsa chick! Other tables that were seated after we arrived got their food before us and were out the door before us because he kept forgetting to bring us our check! 

We weren't especially rude, but after being fed up, I asked him if he was slammed that day. I knew he wasn't because there were three servers and about 12 tables filled, that's around 4 tables each and most of his other tables were just drinking and hanging out. He said no, and I asked then why are you ignoring us? No apology, nothing. He just laughed and walked away and kept on ignoring us. We tipped the salsa chick, paid and then left!

The food is AWESOME! don't get me wrong... but the service is reeeeally awful. Or atleast this guy was. The other servers seemed to be doing a better job. To my yelpers, I say: if you want good neighborhood mexican, go here. That is, If you have a lot of time on your hands and are very patient with crappy service. If you have neither of these things, then don't fret - there are PLENTY of other places nearby!
