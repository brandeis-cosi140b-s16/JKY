Mundo is a  nicely decorated space, modern and chic. The lights are dimmed for dinner which highlights the beautiful ceiling lamps and wall art. We were a party of 2 with reservations. We were seated immediately at a table that seats 4. The larger table is always appreciated. 
Complementary chips and salsa arrived immediately. We were ready to order cocktails but no waiter approached our table. After several minutes I asked the hostess if we had a waiter. I was told the wait staff was backed up and a bus boy offered to take our drink order. A few minutes later our waiter arrived to take our order. I advised him the order was placed and he offered to follow up. The waiter was friendly and helpful. The Mundo Margarita's were excellent.

Once the food order was placed the waiter checked on us periodically. It was a very long wait for the food to come out. Our waiter said the wait was because the pork chop was ordered well done.
The pork chop was huge, enough for two and prepared as ordered. The Shrimp Diablo was spicy as described in the menu and delicious. The shrimps were served over a mix of rice and corn, very tasty.
The restaurant was not full but the bar packed. The bar and restaurant share the same large space. With the bar being packed the noise level was high. The main contributor was 3 people that were overly loud. 

Since the Smith center had several events this evening I believe the restaurant should have staffed the room and kitchen accordingly. Improved service would add an additional star to my rating.
