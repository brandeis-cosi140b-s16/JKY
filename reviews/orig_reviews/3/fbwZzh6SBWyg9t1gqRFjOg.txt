I read really great reviews about this place and had the impression that I HAD to come here while I was vacationing in Scottsdale. The tortillas were good, no doubt. But everything else was just kind of bland. We did sit outside and the mister system they had was leaking on our table, which didn't help matters. I wouldn't rush to go back if I were in town.
