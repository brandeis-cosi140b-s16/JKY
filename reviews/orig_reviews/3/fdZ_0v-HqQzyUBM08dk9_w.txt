I went here with my mother and wife for a birthday dinner celebration.  The reservation was for 8:45 pm. We were seated promptly, in the inside eating area. The atmosphere is very dark, which is great, but made reading the menu slightly difficult. The waiter was very attentive. Drinks and food were good. Price was high, but that was expected going in. 

Biggest issue: noise. It was sooo loud that we were practically yelling to have a conversation. The noise (just from other guests talking) even continued to be extraordinarily loud after 50% of the guests had left for the evening. I think the building could seriously benefit from some acoustic barriers.
