The food is worth 4 stars but I took a star away because their hours suk.  They're closed Tues - Fri from 2:30-5pm. They're also closed on Sunday & Monday. Their food does taste authentic but it's on the more expensive side.  Their margaritas are pretty weak - they're poured from this pitcher that's refrigerated so they're not freshly made.
