3.5 stars. I don't like to go against the grain...yes, this is a Mexican joint at the airport and I live in LA so I should know better, but I liked this place. 1-star? 2-stars? It wasn't that bad...

May be I was being generous after a week of poor convention food I'd been eating, but my enchiladas verdes was nicely packaged and definitely hit the spot.

Hey and this is leaps better than the nearby McDs etc.
