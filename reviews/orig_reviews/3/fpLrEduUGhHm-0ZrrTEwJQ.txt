They try too hard with the decor... crazy big chandeliers??? the menu is ok... we sat at the bar for a few apps and some drinks but the bartender was so miserable that he made our time there uncomfortable... he wasn't friendly... he didn't make any conversation... we had some questions about the menu but he was to apathetic to help us... overall food was decent but the service could use some fine tuning...
