It was clean and nice inside for a strip mall joint, but food was nothing great.  Not sure about the other reviews.  Tacos were not bad, but nothing over the top.  Rice was fine, but only so-so.  Not a bad place to grab a bite, but don't expect too much.  I will try it again and get a burrito instead of tacos.
