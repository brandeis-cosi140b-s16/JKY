The food is pretty good as are the drinks.  I had two rounds of Patron, two rounds of Tecate, half of a plate of calamari, and a rack of ribs.  I wish I could give 3.5 stars because of the price.  For my share, it came out to almost $50.  I feel like it wasn't a good deal for the food quality.  

The waiter was nice and wasn't too distracted when I tried to get his attention.
