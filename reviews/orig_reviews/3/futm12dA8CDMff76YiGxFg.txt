When we hadn't made any other plans for Cinco de Mayo, and we didn't feel like putting in much creativity - yet wanted to keep up the "eat Mexican food on May 5th tradition" we would occasionally end up here.  Not that it was near where we lived, as all of us were in North Phoenix, but it was because we wanted it to be "special" than the other normal times we ate at the same Mexican food restaurants.  

I think that is the highlight of this location.  It's a little different than other locations.  They have great happy hour specials.  Things get insane on Cinco de Mayo (at least 2 years we just ate at the bar because we couldn't even get a table).  It's Macayos level food, and a slightly more interesting physical location.  There are usually a few attractive college folks either working there or dining - and that can at least add to the overall atmosphere.  That said, occasionally large groups of said college folks can have the opposite effect.  You have to take your chances.
