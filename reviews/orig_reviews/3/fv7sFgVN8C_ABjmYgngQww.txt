Who knew they had Adam from Man vs. Food?
Overall I was rather impressed with this place.  I wasn't even hungry when we came in.

Been back twice now and we like this place.
You should try one of their specialty drinks.  We split the Esquimo and it was delish.
More like a refreshing chocolate shake.
