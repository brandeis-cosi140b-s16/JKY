We went there for lunch last week...and we went very early by my standards- 11:15 AM.   Fifteeen minutes later, the place was jammed, and this was on a Tuesday.  I ordered the Mexican Pizza and the other person I was with ordered their famous Chile Relleno.    I enjoyed the chips that came out and the salsa wasn't too bad either.  We did have to wait a bit due to the time it takes to make the Chile Relleno.  

As far as the food, I enjoyed the Mexican Pizza-not only was it huge, it was very tasty.  I did not try the Chile Relleno-not my thing- but the other person enjoyed it as well.  It was incredibly large-it was easily larger than a football.

I will probably go back at some point.  I'm not one for waiting in lines so when I do go back, I will go before 11:30 AM.
