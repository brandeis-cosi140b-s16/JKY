It's 2 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon and I'm wondering how I got from planning a light scone-centric lunch to sitting in South End polishing off a burrito the size of my head. Now matter how, I suppose, the point is that I was having Phat Burrito for lunch. A chicken buritto with black beans (you get your choice of black, red or refried), rice, sour cream and onto which I was forking heaps of hot salsa from the salsa bar.

It was good. Fairly similar to your standard massive burrito chain, say Qdoba or Chipotle, but with that good feeling you get from eating at a local joint. The counter staff looks like a flashback from my days of frequenting skater punk and ska concerts but they were friendly and handled my corny humor well enough. I like that they had counter space that I could park my lone wolf self at because nothing makes me feel more alone than a 4 person booth to myself. The salsa...it said hot, and maybe to someone else it would be, but i feel like if you are going to offer a range of heat levels one of them should actually live up to the name hot. No dice. I must admit I was a little bummed that there was no pork option. Chicken, beef, spinach, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken or veggie, sure. Pork, no. Dang.

All in all, if i were down in south end and really hungry I might head to Phat Burrito again, but you probably wont hear me raving about it at the next UYE.
