If only the tacos were as good as they looked. I got two of their "popular" tacos (forgot the name). The presentation was awesome, but it lacked flavor.  

I also got a strawberry margarita. On a scale from 1-10 (10 being fantastic) I would give it a 7. 

The vibe is great, a very young energetic atmosphere.
