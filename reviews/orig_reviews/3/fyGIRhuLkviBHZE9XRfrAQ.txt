Interesting place...it's a local fave for a lot of people. As a vegetarian, there aren't a lot of options for me, but I can usually find something. Big thumbs-up for the free cookie. Ditto for the free samples. Thumbs down for the ordering process -- it's a bit of a pain, to say the least. The quirky decor -- pandas in sombreros -- is hilarious. The place is a dive in terms of atmosphere/decor, but the food's pretty good. That's usually the way it works, I guess.
