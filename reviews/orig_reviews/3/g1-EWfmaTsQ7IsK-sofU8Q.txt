If you had told me a week ago I would order, and enjoy, a $17 burrito I would have said you were nuts.  A $17 burrito!  $17!!!  

But, the strip has a way of warping your sense of value and hey the $17 burrito and a few beers kept me from the casinos for at least two hours so that probably saved me money.

There was nothing wrong with the food itself, our waitress kept the beers coming and they had the game on.  This place is INSANE at night but a fine place to hang your hat for a while during the afternoon, if you can stomach the prices.
