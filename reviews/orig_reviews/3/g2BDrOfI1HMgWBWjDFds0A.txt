We came here for a bachelorette party brunch before going on a Pink Jeep tour. I originally made the reservations for 11 and changed that to 8. When I called to make the change the concierge picked up and acted like she didn't know what I was talking about when I said "China Poblano" but apparently she knew what "Cheeena Poblano" was. I was irked by this and was expecting horrible service when we got here but the service was great as was the ambiance. The food was a bit overpriced but it's Vegas so not really complaining. The "fresh juice" was not fresh at all but it was decent enough. But overall, food wise:
The 20 vegetable fried rice was really good
Queso Fondido was great but very heavy
Tea- everyone who had it loved it
Setas taco - extremely good
