My visit to Paco's Tacos was mixed.

I was immediately disappointed to learn that they no longer offered the option to "build your own" margarita. I had been looking forward to that after reading about it in a number of reviews.

Instead I ordered from their decent list of "specialty" margaritas. I had the Paco's Eldorado on the waitress' recommendation. It was good margarita, but perhaps a bit too sweet for me. In fairness, the waitress said it was one of the sweeter ones and she was right.. For my second drink, I had the Firestarter which has their homemade jalapeno-infused tequila and ginger beer. This drink was really good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a low tolerance for spicy food but I would definitely order it again.

For my meal I had the three taco combo.

First up was the Paco's Taco, a beef brisket taco "slow roasted chili rubbed beef brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce."  This one had come highly rated from a friend and several of the online reviewers.  Honestly I don't get it.  What I got was a tortilla with a huge lump of dry flavorless meat. I didn't detect any onion or bbq at aall. A huge let down.

Next I had the Big River Fish Taco. This was better than the Paco's Taco. The mango salsa was a nice touch. 

Finally the Shake Down Shrimp Taco. This was by far the best of my three tacos. Nice flavor and the right amount of shrimp.  The shrimp were not as hot as I would have liked but tasty nonetheless.

The complementary chips and salsa (both red and verde) were good and the staff did a great job keeping our chip bowl full.  Our waitress was also quite good and checked on us frequently but not so much as to be a nuisance.
