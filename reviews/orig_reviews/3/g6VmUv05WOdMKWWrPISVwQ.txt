The experience of coming to Sandbar was decent but i don't think i would go again.  The service was the most disappointing aspect of it for me. To be fair they were very busy and I understand that but it was one disappointing aspect to the service tol many. To start off we didn't have menus for a good while after we got here. When our food did arrive finally i was left silverware-less for longer then I wanted to be when I was hungry from waiting for a good while earlier to even get my order in.  I had shredded beef enchiladas that were actually not bad. Not the best I've ever had but they were better than others as well with good black beans and rice as well.  

My friend had fish tacos, and this part of my review is hearsay admittedly, but he didn't like them too much. He could tell that they had used frozen mahi. If you have fish that's been frozen you're not going to have a good time. Truth. 

So while I had food that was good enough my overall experience did not merit a return visit.
