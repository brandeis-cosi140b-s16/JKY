Cool tex-mex with a twist.

--something for everyone, vegetarian, bargain hunter, splurger alike
--ideal for a romantic and private dinner out.
--dented polished copper tabletops fun to look at, but smell like a sweaty penny held too long in your hand on a hot summer day
--pewter plates (like the copper) are straight from rokerij up the street. rokerij serves salads on them ice cold, here they bake your dishes so they're searing hot.
--whole beans were dry on outside from the roasting. unusual.
--red chili beef relleno platter serves 2. chili with nice spicyness, 4 out of 10 on the "globalthermonuclear" scale.
--shredded beef very flavorful and not overseasoned. NICE.
--they were out of the matanzas savignon blanc tonight (darn). big pet peeve and enough to cost a half-star.
--dark room, no windows, candlelight and cool faux adobe half walls make you feel like you're in your own little world at your table.

I've been waiting for the building and parking lot construction to be complete to try this old favorite again, and it was worth the wait. No more signature turquoise awning outside, but it's in the same spot. We arrived for a "late" dinner at 8:30 and found the restaurant pleasantly sparsely peopled. Unfortunately the host was nowhere to be seen and I started to seat myself before someone noticed us.

I hate that I am considering asking more regularly if there is anything out of stock on the menu or other problems. I'd rather know up front so I don't get excited about something I see. Tonight I saw one of my favorites, the Matanzas Savignon Blanc, and of course, they were out of it. That's a ding. A pet peeve.

Very glad that the staff didn't hover and seemed sensitive to our slow pace and chatty demeanor. Either that or he just plain forgot us several times and we happened not to mind it. I'm going with glass half full this time. The ambiance of the restaurant and relatively high volume on the music also helped to make our conversation private. This is a really nice place for a private-time meeting or just to get away from it all.

I need to make more visits before I make "overall" statements about the food. revisit soon.
