i am a mexican food maniac, so this restaurant with a catchy name and just 5 minutes from home, immediately moves up my favorite places to stop list and who doesn't LOVE the skull and crossbones artwork on the patio right now?!

i stopped in with a friend for lunch yesterday around 1pm, we indulged in the corn salsa and chips & an order of the guacamole (all of average quality, but i am a sucker for a starch dipped in avocado mush, yum!) i proceeded with one of my favorites the carne asada tacos sans cheese with a side of mexi-slaw and it did not disappoint.  

everything on the menu is fairly priced, the specials are always an option worth exploring and the mexican beers available make me happy :) 

only issue i had yesterday were some hiccups in the service, while seated immediately we waited awhile for our waters, waited even longer for our tacos and then again for refills and the check..but it was A-OK and i will definitely be back!
