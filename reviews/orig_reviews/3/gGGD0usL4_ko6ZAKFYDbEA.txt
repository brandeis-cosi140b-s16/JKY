Was at a event at Westworld and we drove around looking for a place to eat and came here about 8pm on a Saturday.  Not a lot of people inside, especially for a Saturday but we were hungry.  When the waitress came over she was very nice and chatty.  She took our orders and repeated everything back to assure she got it right, that's a good thing!

Problem is than we waited and waited for our drinks and chips & salsa.  I am use to getting chips & salsa as soon as you sit down not 15 minutes after you have seated and ordered.  When we saw her come out with our drinks and chips she first went to another table and chatted for a little than came over and dropped off our stuff.  I figured she could have dropped our stuff off than chatted with the other customers.

When our food came, it was good.  Nothing spectacular.  I had just truck tacos and got lots of steak with it.  My mom got hard taco and enchilada and enjoyed hers.  We also ordered mini apple chimi with ice cream.  I think that was the best of the meal.

If I come back to this area may try out other restaurants before I make another visit.  Fun to try new places and see what another city has to offer!
