I came to Richardson's straight from the PHX airport.  I was eager to eat good food and be outside as I had just came from Chicago aka Chi-beria (-9 degrees).  I was on a business trip, so I sat alone at the outdoor bar.  The bar tender was really friendly and whipped me up a skinny margarita (which was very refreshing).

The menu is huge and they also have a lot of specials.  I should've looked on Yelp prior to ordering to get some guidance on what was best.  I ended up with a fish special - Mahi Mahi w/ mango salsa, ranchero mashed potatoes, and broccolini.  I wanted so badly to give Richardson's four stars, but two things held me up:

1) Side salad was served w/ ranch...maybe I am being too harsh, but ranch dressing is one of the worst dressings for you and they could've offered me another alternative.
2) Mahi Mahi had a bit of a sour flavor (not sure how to describe it) and was kind of tough

Otherwise, the dish was plated very lovely - very colorful!  The mashed potatoes were served in a jalapeno.  The broccolini and asparagus were cooked perfectly and had a corn sauce over them.  The mango salsa was not very ripe, so it was not very sweet as I had expected.

I love the ambiance here and I would definitely come back to try one of their other many dishes.
