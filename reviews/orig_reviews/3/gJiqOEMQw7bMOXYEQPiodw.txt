It wasn't horrible but it also wasn't great.  I was expecting to be wowed, but wasn't.  The service was not very good and the food was just ok.  The pork I got had a lot of fat, the guacamole was a little too chunky and therefore was just like eating a cut up avacoda with every once in a while spice added.  Oh well.
