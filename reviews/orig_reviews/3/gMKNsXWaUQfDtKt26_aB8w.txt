Pre-Yelp days this used to be our go to spot after work for some margaritas. I don't make it here as much as I used to, as there are several other places in the neighborhood we choose to go now. The food and drinks here seem to be inconsistent. This goes for the other Michoacan properties here in town. I used to frequent the Flamingo/I215 one for happy hour, but the drinks are so hit or miss, we stopped going. I love the chips & salsa and bean dip here, and I used to be a huge fan of the tableside guac, but my last visit, it tasted he put an entire onion in the guac, I couldn't taste anything else. So I started adding stuff to it to doctor it up, salsa, salt, whatever I could. Didn't work. Margaritas are hit or miss. If you get a decent bartender who understands "I don't want triple sec or grand marnier" they can be pretty good, I hate artifical tasting margarita mix. Will I continue to go here? Probably, just stick the usual and don't stray from the chips & salsa & bean dip.
