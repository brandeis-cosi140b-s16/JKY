A good place to stop on the Strip for dinner, a snack or just a drink.  The prices are a little steep (even by Strip standards) so take advantage of coupons or HH specials.

The place is aptly named, as they seem to specialize in the two "T"s.  The tacos are quite competent and their guacamole is an addictive substance.  However, I wasn't overly impressed by their cadillac margarita...at $45 a pitcher I expected something more than syrupy sweetness with a hint of lime and--I *believe* there was some tequila in there somewhere.  Next time I'll get a tequila flight...it's pretty hard to water down straight tequila...right?

Now for a bit of a rant:  the first time we came here (2009) they were cranking classic rock through the speakers.  Solid.  The second time (last week) they were cranking the CLUB MIXES of classic rock hits.  Sorry, but I'd rather swill tequila to a tape of dogs barking incessantly than to "Riders on the storm"...oomp tsss oomp tsss oomp tsss oomp tsss..."riders on the storm"...oomp tsss oomp tsss...
