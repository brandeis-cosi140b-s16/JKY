This used to be a little hole in the wall restaurant off of Flamingo my husband and I loved going to.  The food was great but now not so much, it's just OK.   I was so happy and excited when I finally found their new location and that the restaurant had gotten so much bigger.   I'm so disappointed.  The food is not the same, seems like it's more about quantity than quality.  This used to be a great little hole in the wall Mexican joint but now it's just like any other franchised restaurant.
