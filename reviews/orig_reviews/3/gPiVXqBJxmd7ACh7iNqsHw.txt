I went to Rosita's Place yesterday after reading the Yelp reviews. I have to give this place 3 stars. The food was great. They give you a great portion of food. The waitress was friendly and attentive. The only issue I had was upon initially walking in, the hostess sat me right near a large group of people. I was alone and didn't really want to eat near a lot of people,  especially when there were other areas that were empty. I had to ask to sit somewhere else. She let me pick. I found another spot, but I was initially overwhelmed by the smell of bleach. I guess they use that to clean the tables. It went away. But I thought that was worth noting. The food was good though:)
