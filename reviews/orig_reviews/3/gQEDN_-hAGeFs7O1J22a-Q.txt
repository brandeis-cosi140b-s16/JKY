Once upon a time, I was hungry and my mom happened to be hungry too. Deciding we wanted Mexican, I opened my faithful Yelp app and searched for bookmarks. Frijoles was right around the corner, so to Bean Town we went.

Back in the day, this location as a Pizza Hut. The whole place was updated. The same layout, but now without a tacky salad bar in the middle. Ample table and chairs and several booths. The dining area had soft accents of Mexican art and was incredibly clean. 

Frijoles is Roberto's Taco Shop crossed with a Chipotle with a casual cafe feel, with it's simple menu, which consists of Mexican styled meats, you then take the meat a spruce it up as a: mini taco, salad, nachos, taco, fries, or a platter. Drink-wise, your standard Coca-Cola products, Mexican Cokes, and Agua Fresca.

I got a carne asada and an al pastor mini taco, Mexican street corn, and a strawberry-mango agua fresca; my mama ordered the salad with shrimp and an order of chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh. The chips and salsa were chips and pico. My tacos and corn were good. Not Taco y Taco good, but definitely well above Robertos or Pepes. The shrimp salad was stellar. I had order envy after I tasted that creation. Definitely know I will be venturing that route next. Agua Fresca was also a happy surprise. Feeling fancy, I combined two flavors. Sweet, but not in the "I'm gonna get diabeetus way," but in a perfectly ripe strawberry and mango way, just FRESH.

Frijoles is nice option. Nothing that knocked my socks off, nothing that I hated. Authentic, no. Tasty, yes. How can i not like anything that bears the same name as my beloved cat, Beans? Me gusta Frijoles.
