The menu seemed to imply that the tacos were very good, so I decided to order a plate of fish tacos for myself and some fresh guacamole to share with my friends. The guacamole was good, but a small portion (especially for the price). The tacos were good too, but a bit smelly. My biggest critique was that they were over-priced; if I'm paying $12 for three tacos, then they better be some incredible tacos.

On a positive note, Emiliano's had a nice atmosphere. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves with their giant margaritas. Overall, it's a nice restaurant but simply over-priced.
