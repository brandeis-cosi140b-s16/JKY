Very convenient location right at the 101 in a little commercial area next to a gas station.  Can be busy at peak lunch time.  Breakfast all day too.  Reasonably priced, rather "gringo" Mexican food (perhaps the name was intentional for this reason).  The spicy salsa isn't at all spicy, which is just silly to me.
