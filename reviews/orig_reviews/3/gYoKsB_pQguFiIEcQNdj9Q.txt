the atmosphere was pretty cool and there's an artificial pond in the middle of the outdoor area  which is good for photos and for the kids. The salsa and chips were great and ate a lot of them since we were so hungry.  I ordered a Fajita Taco Salad. It was huge and looked so good. But, looks could be deceiving. The chicken didn't really have any favor and the salad just felt like I was eating lettuce. It was sort of a let down, as we were leaving my date (who grew up in the area) said she wasn't impressed either and she said it wasn't as good as she remembered.
