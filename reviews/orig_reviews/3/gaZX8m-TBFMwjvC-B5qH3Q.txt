Went there on a Saturday. They have a live DJ and he was playing good music. I had a mojito it was good. Ordered the lobster tacos. The lobster meat was kinda cold, tough and very salty.  The tortillas that housed the tacos was cold and had a strange gummy texture.  The rice was not a Mexican rice but rather just plain steamed white rice, which was ok with me but was strange. The pinto beans meh..
No chips and salsa was given to us but I did see it on other tables, so I don't know if our waiter forgot or if it was by request..
