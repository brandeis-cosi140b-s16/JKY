I usually write a more complete review, but I just don't feel like it right now

Overall rating: average (good but not great. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there)

Food: 3 stars
Service: 2 stars. No wow factor or friendly banter. Not rude but not friendly
Ambience: 2 stars and set up is poor
Prices and quantities: 3 stars

If you're close by try it but I wasn't impressed. Cheese enchilada was bland and cheese not melted at all. I can get that at any Filibertos. Salsas are good and a few varieties. They put a red hot sauce on everything which makes each dish taste pretty much the same. Pastor and carnitas (although they really aren't carnitas - fried) are your best meat choices. Chicken to dry. Like I said...average
