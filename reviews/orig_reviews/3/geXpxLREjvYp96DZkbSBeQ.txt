A-OK is the best way to describe Blanco. 

First, the chips and salsa were great. Much much better than most Mexican places I have been to. The server was very nice and she stayed on top of our drinks and chip refills.

I ordered the Chicken Burrito with black beans on the side. The chicken was shredded and tender. The marinade was also good but a lot of it came with the chicken in the burrito and it got pretty messy, not surprising for shredded chicken though. The rice was VERY good.. pretty sure it was soaked in butter, still delicious. 

Overall this place was fine. I would maybe go back again and try tacos but nothing blew me away.
