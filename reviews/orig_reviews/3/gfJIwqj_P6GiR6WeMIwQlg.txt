It's a better Roberts. Went here the other night. 930pm on s Friday so I'm sure everything had been sitting out so I can't say it was fresh. Either way I watched as 2 people brought their food back on mistakes. My food came out hot and the way I ordered it. They do have Mexican corn if you like that. The favors of juice is very nice. Loved the mini tacos. Not so much on the burrito. Coulda just been the last of the chicken but the mini tacos were great.
