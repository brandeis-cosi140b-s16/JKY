I love the convenience of Mad Mex, and the spacious-ness of the restaurant. Very rarely have I had to come here and wait for a table, unlike the Oakland Mad Mex, where I practically had to wait every time I dine there. 

I really love the margaritas here. If you go during happy hour (4:30-6:30 p.m.), you can get their 22 oz Big Azz Margaritas. I get mango or strawberry, it is a light fruity drink with just the right amount of tequila. I get pretty buzzed after drinking one, so I'm glad I'm a five minute walk from here.

Their food is great, but I think out of everything I have tried here, I really like ....the nachos. Yea. I mean, the burrito is good, and fajitas are nice, but they aren't nachos. When I eat the nachos, I feel like I am eating a perfect harmony of textures, flavors, and toppings. When I eat the burrito or the fajitas, the meat flavor falls a little short and is sometimes bland. The guac and sour cream add something to it, but I want to eat a burrito where I don't need to smother it with guac to add flavor, you know? 

Anyway, while I have my gripes on their select food items, I will probably frequent this place for as long as their happy hour exists. And their nachos.
