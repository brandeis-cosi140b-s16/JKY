The price really wasn't bad considering you're paying in part for outdoor dining on the Strip.  The food was good, not great.  The guacamole was fresh and tasty, and you can order it mild, medium or spicy.  We ordered medium and it had a pretty good kick.  But it sat on our table for a good ten minutes while we waited for the chips and salsa, which were also very good.  We ordered a cheese crisp, which was very good, and the nightly taco platter special, which was the tenderloin.  The steak was marinated and cooked nicely but it was a very spartan taco with nothing else going on but some slices of steak and some small corn tortillas standing up in a metal cylinder, with rice and beans.  Again, the wait time was terrible, probably 30 minutes from the time we ordered the entres.  It was a Saturday night but the restaurant wasn't that busy so really can't understand what took so long.
