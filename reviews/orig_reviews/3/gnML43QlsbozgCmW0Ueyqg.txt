Food was pretty good.  My wife's margarita was too sweet for me (it was the coconut one).  My margarita was very good (not really worth the cost, but this is a touristy place).  Got the tequila "flight" which was 3-shots, one of each style of tequila and it was very good and a pretty good price for 3 shots of alcohol.  I probably don't need to return, but it's worth a first-time visit.
