The happy hour drinks were extremely watered down. Yes its happy hour but at a prime location like this one I expected more. The atmosphere was enjoyable. The only reason they didn't get one stars was because the appetizer we had was AWESOME!! We had the Queso Fundido - i posted pics. YUMMY!!  Mind you that was the only thing we ate. I would go back just to try the other food even though it was over priced for it being so basic. $14 for a cheese quesadilla is ridiculous! So if you want to spend on arm and leg and not get drunk but have good appetizers go here - or if your a tourist- which I'm definitely not. Sorry your not hot enough for me Diablos!
