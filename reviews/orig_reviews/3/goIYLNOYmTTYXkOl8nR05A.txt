I dined on a Wednesday evening and the restaurant and bar were busy. I sat at the bar so I could enjoy the company of video poker if the mood struck. 
Shrimp & crab enchiladas "stack"- the seafood should be the star of the dish, but it wasn't. I think the sauce didn't complement the seafood well, and there were too many tortillas. Overall, was so-so. For $19.95, I expect better. 
Rock shrimp chile relleno appetizer- this is delicious! A bargain at $11.95. Flavorful, with a yummy sauce and ample shrimp. 
Chocolate creme brulee with almonds- tasty, but lacking whipped cream. Very rich. 
Dulce leche milk cake- LOVED IT! Another bargain.
I was given a free dessert because the entree took a long time. Kudos on that!
