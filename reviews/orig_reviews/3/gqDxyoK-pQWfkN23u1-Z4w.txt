I'm not sure how I feel about this place after my one visit on early Sunday evening.  It's walking distance from my house and they have an outside sitting option which is a bonus for me if I have my dog(s) with me.   It's an expansive and varied menu but pricey in my opinion for a neighborhood bar.  The server suggested the tapas menu on the back since we weren't really interested in a meal.  We ordered a pitcher of Sangria for $26.  Way to high!  It was about 6:30 when we got there so we just missed happy hour but really for a local neighborhood bar I would probably be a frequent visitor if that happy hour was all day or even if there were more drink specials available.  Like John Cutter next door you can get a free drink by signing up by text.

For tapas we chose the calamari, ceviche, and the chicken skewers.  A complimentary bread basket with dipping sauce was also provided.  I have no complaints about the food and the tapas were fairly priced.  The restaurant was larger then it appeared outside but almost empty minus a couple other tables.  The bar is large and offers gaming so that's an option if you're a fan of that.  

Because of it's proximity to my house I can't say I will not find myself here again but I will make sure I arrive when happy hour is still in effect.
