You Pay for a good time, not for good food.
I like this place because of the atmosphere. there's always something going on. Vendors coming in and out offering you the latest movies or CDs. Mariachi, Banda  or conjunto norte√±o playing constantly. this place is always full. It seems to be the place to entertain friends from out of town. Now if you looking for good seafood this may not be your place. Food is not bad but for the price you pay  it should be excellent!  Which brings me to the conclusion. you pay for a good time.
