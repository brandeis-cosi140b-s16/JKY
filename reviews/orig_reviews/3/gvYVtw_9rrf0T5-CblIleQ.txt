One of the best things about Yelp is that it sets expectations.  I went here knowing that it wouldn't be great, but that it would fit our purpose.
Sometimes, however, Yelp makes you lean too far one way or the other - like that time I went to a brunch place expecting out-of-the-world scones and was disappointed.  The food at Chuy's was better than I expected (I had chile rellanos) but I think I prefer Paco's.  However, what people said about the prices was spot on - very affordable for a family dinner on a weeknight.  The patio seating area was great, and if your kids misbehave you can throw them in the fountain.  You can also look longingly over at the diners at Cowfish and wonder how long they waited for a table.
