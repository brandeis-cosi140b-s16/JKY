Got in for Happy Hour last night.

The watiress was nice - she was very recognizant of the fact it was 10 til 7, and wanted us to make the HH cut-off. The bouncer was very nice too, surprisingly.

The patio has nice heaters on it, so we were okay to sit outside after dark in December.

My vodka cranberry was strange - no ice, the cranberry was NOT juice. It was a water consistency but tasted somewhat like a cranberry syrup. Friend's pineapple/Bacardi looked like real pineapple juice though. Weird.

The wings were pretty good, just fatty. The mini tostadas were apparently really good,  though they were topped with parmesan (what?)
