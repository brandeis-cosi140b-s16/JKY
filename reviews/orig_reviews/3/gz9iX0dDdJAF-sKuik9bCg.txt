When I first started going to Arriba years ago, they were truly a New Mexican oriented restaurant.  I don't know if they changed owners, but now they are more focused on being a microbrewery and less on Hatch/Santa Fe style foods.  Their guacamole is still a very good buy - great with some of their freshly made flour tortillas to make guacamole burritos.  Most of their other food is too salty and too cheesy for my taste.  I like minimalist Mexican food so I can taste the rich sauces and fresh corn tortillas - I think Arriba lacks this freshness.  Chips and salsa are very good.
