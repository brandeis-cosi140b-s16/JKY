This hole in the wall was my first taste of Phoenix.  I came up to the front and asked the guy what was in the Machaca burrito.  That's a legit question, right?  He looks at me like I'm crazy, then starts naming things off slowly... 

him: "you wanna know what's IN the burrito?"
me: "yeah"
him: "ummm, machaca, beans, cheese" 
me: "nothing else?"
him: "ummmm, naaaa"

Well, I got it, not really any beans in it, and there was a liquid that looked cheesy, but not sure if it was actual cheese.  It did have some sort of sauce though and plenty of meat.  Overall, cheap and not bad, but also fell apart too easily.  It needs a stronger tortilla.
