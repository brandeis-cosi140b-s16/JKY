The food and drinks are decent here...if you ever get a chance to order any!!!!!! WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! Every single table was waiting to get service....with one couple waiting over an hour and only got 1 drink (needless to say, she threw her bill at the manager when he expected her to pay)!!!! 
I bet you're assuming they were busy!?!?!? NOPE!!!! There was no one there!!!! We finally got service from the one waitor who was workin his butt off to pick up the slack from the other servers! We enjoyed the food when it finally came, and tipped him well to show our appreciation.
