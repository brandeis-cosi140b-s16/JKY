I came to Steel Cactus a few weeks ago on a Sunday night.  It was a little too chilly for the outdoor seating, but I think that the selling point is their outdoor seating.  The atmosphere indoors is loud and bar like.

My major complaint is that Steel Cactus is overpriced for serving the same quality of food as Chipotle, but the prices are double.  I wouldn't chose to come back here on my own, but I guess I would think about returning.  At $12 for 3 regular sized tacos and $11 for a burrito, I would say it's just ok but nothing special.
