Not that bad but honestly a hybrid of Top Shelf, Garcia's, Manuels, Macayos.... Sorry, but really not sorry. It's just ok at best Mexican food. My wife had the #15 combo, 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I had #8, two shredded beef tacos, with rice and beans. Of course chips and salsa were served. The salsa was weak and was just a notch better than Pace. The taco sauce could have been from a jar also. 
My tacos lacked any rich flavors, and not only were the shells stale, they were cracked beyond even being able to be held. Would have made a good taco salad. The rice and beans had an odd odor, which I think was old grease or lard. The beans were super bland and the rice was just nasty. If I am going to raise my cholesterol level, I usually expect top notch artery clogging fare. This isn't a place to obtain Crestor helping levels. Two other places are better if you ask me, hands down - Carolinas and Guadalajara.  
I will leave this joint to the local area patrons looking to get their buzz on in a run down (basically a bar) joint slinging some premium tequila and cheap house Margs. 
I don't think I will circa de Los santos instead of traveling via the saints!
