I have been to The Mission several times now... Am I blown away by the food, not particularly. But it's a solid place to go if your looking for some good guacamole, killer margaritas and if you get their pork shoulder special and your willing to drop some $$$. 

I highly recommend their blood orange margarita! 

Def a fun spot to bring out of town visitors, make sure you make a reservation as this place gets slammed during season!
