Tried them on a whim in passing by today, it was just ok. .my carne was well seasoned and flavorful,  my pork was horrible, they screwed my order up only to correct it...then when i got home I realized it was still screwed up...

My total for 3 tacos, small rice & beans came to $14 and some change, I don't think it was quite worth that but i may be inclined to try them again - at someone else's expense. I'm a little salty that I didnt check groupon before going lol.
