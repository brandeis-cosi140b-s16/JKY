I hate to break it to you, but I'm not sure why this place has all the hype (#39 on yelp's 100). Maybe it was an off time, maybe it was an off day, but me and my group did not think this was anything worth writing home about.

I got the 5 street taco platter that was so highly recommended. Bacbacoa, Green Chile, Adobada, Cochinita Pibil, and Tinga (mixture between beef, chicken, and pork).

All of the meats resembled mush. Maybe i'm used to california and texas tacos, where there are real chunks of meat, but none of these were too satisfying. 

On another note, it's located in the corner of a small strip mall, the waitstaff is friendly, and there's plenty of space for big groups. Overall, not my cup of tea.
