Bring back the fajita pizza! :) We used to come exclusively for this entree but sadly it's no longer on the menu. It's too bad that only a few people knew about it.

I'm not really sure why Maverick doesn't draw larger crowds. Chips and salsa are great, service has always been good, the pizza used to be one of my favorite dishes in Charlotte, atmosphere is fun (would be better with a larger crowd).. but I haven't been on a night where it was packed. Aside from salads, I can't speak on the remainder of the menu since I haven't tried it.

I've had not so stellar experiences like some of the recent posts but if you're a regular anywhere it's likely to happen at some point, and not the norm here. This is one of the places I root for and hope it succeeds.
