I went here with my boyfriend for his birthday because it's his favorite restaurant.  I just don't love it as much as he does.  We went around 6:30 and only had to wait for maybe 20 minutes.  

For an appetizer, I had the Queso Fundido.  It was yummy!  I don't like their chips because they are too hard.  I like them light and crispy.  But I was able to get extra bread from the waiter, which was good.  I like that I was able to order the dip without mushrooms too.  

For my entree I ordered Torta de Filetito.  It almost looked like a hamburger.  The beef was okay.  I wish I had ordered it without the roquefort cheese.  I didn't know how strong it was.  I absolutely hated the taste of the cheese.  Nothing special here though.

I did love the churros for dessert!  So delicious!  It came out with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and ice cream.  You definitely have to try it!

Overall, it's okay.  I just don't get all the hype about it.
