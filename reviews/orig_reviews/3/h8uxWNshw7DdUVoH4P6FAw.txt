So today is my first visit to this place.  My boss took the whole group here, with much hype about the food.  Overall the place was OK.  Had some pluses and some minuses.  I'm thinking I will come here one more time and try something else before I decide if I should make this a regular spot, or relegate it to "yeah, I've been there" status.

I was surprised to see chicken mole on the menu.  A very traditional dish that most places don't serve.  Normally I order a chimi when trying out a new place, but I made an exception here and ordered the mole.

The rice was very ordinary.  Not bad, but I can't really say I liked it either.  Plain white rice would have been as good or better.   The chicken mole was very flavorful. It was very intense, and good.  I believe it when they say "22 herbs and spices".  I enjoyed it.  The tortillas that accompany the mole started out good (warm, soft), but they cooled pretty quickly and became rather brittle.  Kind of annoying.  

And there was a long wait for food.  Nearly an hour after we ordered.
