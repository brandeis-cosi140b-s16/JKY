El Hefe is the newer "hot" bar on Mill.  Good nightclub atmosphere on the weekends, but it is literally shoulder to shoulder if you dont have a table. Waitresses are all nice, as well as the bouncers which is real cool. 

Drinks are overpriced (Mill Ave prices) but usually pretty strong.  Overall you get what you pay for as far as drinks go. Shots can get expensive, but the tequila selection is very good (as it should be). 

Tables for a birthday or something is a great idea, but way too expensive (200$ for a table and 1 bottle of skyy..yes SKYY.) 

Never eaten here myself.
