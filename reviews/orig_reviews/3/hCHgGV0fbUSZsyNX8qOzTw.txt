Ok, so after the scathing initial review, I went back. The food's just that good. 

Service was MUCH better than my first visit. Granted, I've had better service at 3:00am in the Jack in the Box drive-thru than I got the first time around at Blue Adobe. It HAD to be better.  Not great service, but acceptable.
