This is located inside the Silverton Casino. Overall, I had a good experience here, but the food wasn't tasty enough for me to come back.

There was a 5 minute wait on a Saturday night. There were lots of empty tables. There is a bar with seating and lots of TVs, which were playing the NFL playoffs. Interior decor was really nice. 

Service was great. Our server kept the drinks coming and was really patient with our group of 10 (including children).

I had the chicken tacos for $11 and they substituted the beans with extra rice. It was a bit spicy, which was not mentioned in the menu. The rice was good, but I think the tacos at Del Taco taste better. Their tacos only cost $2 each.

The fried ice cream was pretty good. The strawberries in it were fresh & the ice cream was creamy. It wasn't too die for though.

I think this restaurant needs new chefs and better tasting menu items. The service was great, so that's why they received 3 stars instead of 2.
