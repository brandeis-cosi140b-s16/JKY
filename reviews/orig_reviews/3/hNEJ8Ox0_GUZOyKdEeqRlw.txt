This place has so much potential. Cute shabby shack feel outside but clean and neat inside. Small menu but everything looks good.

Today i opted for a short rib taco and a chicken taco with pico de gallo. Pretty decent size and the meat were covered with two tacos. My only complain is that the short rib taco sauce tasted really salty... Almost too salty.. The flavor is almost good tho. Chicken taco was pretty good as well. Got the hand cut fries, again great flavor but the kitchen put too much seasoning that it was crusting on the side of the plate.

I wanna try their burgers again. My experience wasnt the best but it wasn't too bad.
