Not the best food I've ever had, but pretty good for the area. 

We stopped by for lunch and at first I was overwhelmed with the amount of choices, it's a pretty big menu. I ordered a chimicanga and it was very strange. Not crispy like you'd normally expect. 

My husband ordered the Fajita burro and it was very yummy. HUGE portion, easily sharable (in fact that's what we'll do next time.

Margarita was tasty (not the best, but what you'd expect).
