I've been here on every vegas visit, the food is consistent and good. The staff are friendly and happy to help. 

They used to serve the chips and salsa with an array of different salsas, they were more authentic and so tasty, now they seem to serve them with basic bottled salsa you get everywhere else. It's disappointing, but the rest of the food is still good.
