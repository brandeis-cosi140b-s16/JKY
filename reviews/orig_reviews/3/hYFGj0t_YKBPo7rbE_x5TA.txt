I've been a Rio-er for quite some time. It didn't help that I used to work at a frozen custard place right next to a cafe rio.

But tonight, I'm quite upset. Service was slow, food was great, but it seems like shortcuts are being taken and quality is being hindered.

I'm highly upset because my freakin' horchata was empty! I came to drink the milk of the Hispanic gods, but to my dismay the fountain was dry.

They ran out of corn tortillas, an aluminum pan is used to catch the soda fountain water, and the staff didn't make me smile. I'm unhappy. 

I'm gonna go to the other location. Sorry Henderson Rio.
