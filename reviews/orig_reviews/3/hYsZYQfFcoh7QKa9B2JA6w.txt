Make sure you bring your bullet proof vest to eat with you when you go to Carolina's Mexican Food because you are going to need it! Carolina's is located in the most ghetto neighborhood in all of Phoenix. It doesn't matter how hard they try to make this neighborhood look good with new fire stations and the like, it is still going to be ghetto. 

I had three tacos. I was hoping for taquitos but they were no where to be found on the menu. The tacos I did have cost $2 each and they weren't any better than what I could have gotten at Dell Taco. If I had gotten three tacos at Dell Taco I would have only paid $1.28, but here I paid $6. Tacos don't even have tomatoes on them! The food comes in take out containers regardless of whether or not you are eating in or out. Don't expect a lot of food because the containers are not that large. The food my co-workers got didn't look that much better than mine. 

The inside of this place is a real dump. For as much money as this place brings in, you think they could update it or add more seating. Even a new paint job on the interior and exterior would go a long way. Somehow they think people enjoy the charm of a dirty Mexican restaurant. I don't think that many people care, because they are there just to eat and get back to work as soon as possible, not to enjoy themselves. 

If you go here for lunch, you will end up waiting in a long line. And seating will be hard to find as the place is packed during lunch. Carolina's is probably better suited for take out. They serve food like a cafeteria; you order from the menu and they call your number. It is quick authentic Mexican food, without the fast-food nostalgia.
