The Sunday brunch is delicious. You can order as much as you want of tapa style plates. The quality of the food is high. Unfortunately the service was severely lacking. We waited quite a while for every round of food and even for beverages, got food before drinks!  We were served food we hadn't ordered & sometimes didn't get food we did order. They started bringing desserts we hadn't ordered when we were still waiting on more entrees, then when we ordered churros for dessert we never got them.  If the service could parallel the food, it would be epic but the poor service very much hurts the experience.
