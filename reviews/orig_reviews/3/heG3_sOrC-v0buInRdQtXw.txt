Staff was very friendly, and the shrimp tacos were tasty with a little bit of lime juice!  The bulgogi plate was delicious over rice and the only reason I didn't give them five stars was due to having driven all the way here to try their spam musubi.  I ordered two orders (four pieces) which totalled $8 and drove home to eat, only to find out they had been left out completely.  Everything else was good outside of that disappointment.
