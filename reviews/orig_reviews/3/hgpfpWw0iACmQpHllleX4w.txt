Two best things about this place:

1- Location.  We had a table right on the Grand Canal and could watch the gondolas and listen to them sing.
2- Gauc.  Not sure why this guac is good, but it really is.  Since they charge for chip refills anyways, just get the guac.  It has a strong good taste of cilantro - my fav.

We both had the chicken enchiladas- they were good, but nothing too memorable.

Good service- worth a try for the location, and reasonable prices.
