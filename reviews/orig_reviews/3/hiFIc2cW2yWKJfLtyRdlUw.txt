Very average Americanized Mexican joint. Chips and salsa are excellent (salsa is very fresh) but food is on the bland side. Service is as terrible as others have said. I went with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and most were satisfied but 2 hated the place, mostly because their food was cold. I got chicken fajitas and they were ok, comparable to a chilis or 99 restaurant unfortunately. Salsa alone would bring me back though
