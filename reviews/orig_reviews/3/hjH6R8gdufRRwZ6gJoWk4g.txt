I would give it a 5 for the food.  YES, the service was THAT bad.

I used to go to El Jefe in Henderson which has been closed for a while.  Pink Taco shares a common origin/chef and I really missed the Carnitas.  They were as delicious at PT as they used to be at El Jefe.  Ceviche appetizer was delicious too.

So, if I give it 5 stars for the food and a 3 over all, I guess I'm saying the service is a 1.
No need to go into details.

Also, they charged $1.99 for 2 extra tortillas! And $1.50 to split our carnitas and put them on separate plates with beans and rice!  We didn't even ASK for separate plates - they took it upon themselves to do that.  You gotta be kiddin' me.
