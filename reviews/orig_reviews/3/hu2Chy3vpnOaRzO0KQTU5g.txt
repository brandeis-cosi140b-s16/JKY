I think I was having lust for new flavors and a mystical tortilla cooking wheel. I don't really like Cafe Rio, I decided. 

The staff seems pretty flustered/annoyed most of the time. It's nearly impossible to hear what they asking you over how loud the kitchen is. I know there's a lot going on, but if they would just calm down, everything would be a lot better.

The drinks still get a big set of stars, though. I love the lemonade and limeade options and horchata if you are into all that. I might try again something I haven't had before, but sadly, it no longer tops my list.
