We ate here before in January 2015 and expected as great a time tonight. Previously had a superior server and the prior manager was very responsive. 
We were thrilled with the crickets and jalapeno margaritas.
Staff seemed scattered tonight, and the new manager was present but pretty much not engaging with customers a lot. A few times my husband attempted to wave for assistance and got the eyes- averted skillfully response.
We had the lettuce wraps with marinated steak, the appetizer which is like spicy shrimp ceviche, and the Tinga tostidas.
Food was good. Drinks were very slow.
Our server was ok but seemed new and maybe was a bit hesitant explaining things to us.
Not enough to keep us from returning but the evening staff on duty at 6pm were somewhat disconnected I felt.
We will consider this an off night for them but because we are fans of their non GMO and fresh ingredients will continue to like the place.
