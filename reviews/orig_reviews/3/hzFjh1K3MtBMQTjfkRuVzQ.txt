Aside from Frontera Grill, I can't imagine fancy Mexican being a successful venture. However, if there was one place to open a restaurant where the rich can blow some cash on expensive tacos, Vegas is the city to do it. While Border Grill has a pretty well-known weekend brunch, their ceviche bar is also a big draw. 

While I'm sure all the waiters are trained to push the border guacamole as a tableside show and appetizer, it felt a little too Chili's to me. There were three ceviches to choose from and I figured the closest one to being local, the Baja, would be the freshest. Unfortunately, there was a metallic aftertaste. Hopefully, it wasn't the taste of mercury poisoning and we won't get Jeremy Pivened. 

For entrees, we tried the quesadillas and tacos. At first look, they may seem overpriced, and they still very well could be. But, I have to admit that most ingredients for quesadillas and tacos at these types of restaurants are haphazardly thrown together. The hope is that the overcooked meat is covered up by the melted cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. But, I found the citrus grilled chicken to be juicy and tender. The grilled fish tacos were great as well - I loved the substitution of grapefruit as the acidic component. 

The portions are pretty large and the service was excellent. The drinks were refreshing and went great with the meal. If they still have the coconut mojito, it's a must try.
