I waited with 2 other customers for almost 10 minutes at the door. No hosts. Got the fish & chips for lunch. First, no tartar sauce. The ranch & chipotle sauce are both very runny. The food was hot, but under-seasoned. And the music was very loud. In addition, the managers were standing right next to my table talking very loudly while putting up a sign on their miniscule salad bar. I dont have a reason to drive here again. It's ok at best.
