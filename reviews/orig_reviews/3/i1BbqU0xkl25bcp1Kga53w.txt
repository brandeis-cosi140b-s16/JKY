After having multiple people telling me this is the best mexican food around, I figured I had to try this place. I was no where near impressed.  The only upside was the salsa and chips, hot and fresh and the salsa had zip but a great flavor. I got the sampler meal and it was subpar.  I can think of multiple places better than this for Mexican food. Ohh well atleast I can say I tried it.
