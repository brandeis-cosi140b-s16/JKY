There is nothing special here.  The atmosphere is fine but it really is just the typical American version of Mexican food without any flare.  I'm even struggling trying to figure out what to write.  My enchilada was goopy as were the beans and rice.  The chips and salsa were good but again not special.  

Therefore, come here for an average, boring Mexican dinner but don't expect anything unique, special or particularly tasty.
