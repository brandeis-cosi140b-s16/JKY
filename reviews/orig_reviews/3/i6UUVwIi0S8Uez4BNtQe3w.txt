I say 3; boyfriend says 2... Went for Sunday brunch... Thank goodness we had a coupon or I would have been even less pleased. No chips or salsa served-- or if we were supposed to serve ourselves, no one told us. None of the oft mentioned jalape√±o muffins-- cold or otherwise. 
I had the chorizo burrito and added the avocado and sour cream-- it was pretty good. Really liked the potatoes that came with it.  Boyfriend ordered chorizo nachos-- pretty good, but the chorizo gravy served with it for dipping was very good! 
I did not receive my tortillas for my meal until I was almost done and asked for them.
We had a buy one brunch entree, get one free coupon, and the server was nice enough to give us the higher priced one (mine) for free. As usual the coupon did require the purchase of two drinks-- $2.95 each for iced tea and a diet coke.
