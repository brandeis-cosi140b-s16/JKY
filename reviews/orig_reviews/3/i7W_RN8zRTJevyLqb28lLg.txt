For what it is, Los Compadres is great. The place is small (looks like it was once a house) and not the place for a bitrthday party or celebrating a co-worker's borthday or anything, but great for a cheap weeknite din-din. Looks kinda shabby-chic inside but I looked around pretty intensely and it was actually VERY clean inside.  

The whole dealio is very "no frills"  the food and utensils are disposable and they process are very cheap for pretty good Mexican.   My better half and I each got the same chili relleno commbo platter.  Everything was hot, savory and delicious. Fast service, cute staff and cheap eats.
