This place really is a dive. You're greeted by Gay Fieri's picture at the front door just to remind you how it is a dive. We waited in a long line to order at the left counter, we filled out our order sheets only to find out that it was the line for help ordering and tasting different menu options. If you want to order, you can bypass this line and go to the ordering line. I wouldn't have been offended had I known this line was sampling but I waited for literally 10 minutes while some fat, white trash family tasted everything and then walked out without ordering. Hmmmmmmm free meal for them! To find out I could have skipped that line, I was pissed.

The "burrito" I ordered was the smallest damn thing I have ever seen. Get 2-3 of them if you are hungry. The tortilla was delicious, the filling in it was awesome, but the portions were so amall for $3 I felt a little screwed.

I went and tried it and it was slightly better than average. It's too much a kitschy tourist trap.
