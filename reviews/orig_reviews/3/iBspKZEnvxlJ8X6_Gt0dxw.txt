I liked Diego's. We had a HUGE group, I mean like 20 of us so this place definitely gets 5 stars for service. Our waiter was awesome, got all the orders right, and was very attentive. The food was just ok. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't anything memorable. I had the fish tacos, and again they were pretty good. They do make guacamole to your liking which was fun to watch, and it was tasty. I also thought Diego's was reasonably priced for Las Vegas. We basically sat out in the mall area which killed the ambiance, but I think if we were farther back in the restaurant I would have enjoyed it more.
