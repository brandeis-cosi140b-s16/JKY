I must say I was disappointed. Salsa bar had been so hyped up and was just 4 salsas not sure what people were raving about. The mild tasted terrible, like tomato paste. Couldn't tell the difference between the medium and hot but they were good; and then a salsa verde. Nothing extraordinary... Not even the best salsa in town. Food was good, not great. Would go back again as a good spot for a group, but not expecting any thing amazing from the food.
