Those of you from Southern California know what I mean when we start talking about amazing Mexican food. You can't really get that here especially from the SW Vegas. Now I have heard that north Vegas has some good Mexican food but who really wants to travel that far?
Los Tacos is my to go place when I get tacos al pastor. For all al pastor fans must understand this isn't the traditional al pastor on the stick slowly roasting with the flavorings slowly dripping down. It's just the stove top grilling with small pieces of pineapples. 
Service is good. Now do expect a bit of a wait at the drive thru. This is not Taco Bell or Del Taco. The wait just means that my food is just that much fresher. Don't even think about going to Robert's or some other place. Just head to Los Tacos if you're in the SW.
