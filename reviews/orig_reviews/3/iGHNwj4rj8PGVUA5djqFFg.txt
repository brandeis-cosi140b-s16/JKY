This is the final of the three locations that I visited while staying in Las Vegas.  I bought a beef taco and a carnitas torta.  I did not go inside, but instead used the drive through.  The order they initially handed me was incorrect, so my length of visit was over 15 minutes (in the drive through).  It was about 7am in the morning.  The food was excellent.  The torta had a lot of meat and was just perfect.  The taco had the finely shredded cheese and the perfect compliment of meat and lettuce all held together precariously with the very crispy taco shell.  It was cheap and tasted great!

The service was kind of lousy and they got my order wrong, although they did correct it.  That is why this location only gets a three star rating.
