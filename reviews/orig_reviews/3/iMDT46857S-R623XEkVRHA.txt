Wasn't great but wasn't horrible. My sister and I went here on a saturday night last weekend. The main reason for choosing this place is because we were visiting out other sister who had to work that night. We had limited options of where to eat as we didnt want to go to downtown charlotte (or uptown I guess as it is called down south).......with that said we had this and two other sit down places within walking distance of the hotel we were staying at (not the day's inn that this is attached to). As my sister was craving a margarita this place was the winner. 

I liked that we got sat right away- even though it seemed busy for a saturday night around 6pm. They offered us indoor or outdoor seating and we chose the indoor. We got a booth seat stat. Our waiter was at our table in a flash. drinks out fast as werer the chips & Salsa and someone came by to offer us fresh made guac. We ordered some and it was good. Not the best but good enough. Portion sizes were decent- I got a house burrito of some sort that they were known for- it was huge. My sister got some combo plate-  taco and enchilada I think? And it came with rice and beans. Huge serving. She couldn't finish and I could barely finish mine. We left full and happy and satisified. And they gave us some treat at the end of our meal- a fried tortilla with strawberry sauce and whipped cream.
