My aunt had a birthday there awhile back. They had a separate side for us to enjoy with a room for a DJ with was wonderful. The food was not good, we had appetizers and I also ordered  a chili burrito. It tasted like it was frozen food. There was also a singer on the other side in the bar and it was competing for sound..poor guy. The owner/bar tender was great!
