I'm not a big fan of Mexican food so I ordered what I thought to be the "safest" choice on the menu- the sweet pork tacos. I would have ordere the grilled steak or chicken but I don't want to pay the extra $1. I ordrered 1 sweet pork taco meal that came with rice and beans. I thought that paying $7 for a meal with no drinks is pretty steep. Overall, I paid $8.50 for my food and drink. The pork was pretty good- it lives up to its name- "sweet" indeed. For all you guys out there who like your meat savory, order something else. 

Also, I felt rushed when ordering. It seems like the staff wanted their line to move as fast as possible. I felt that  giving me 3-5 seconds to decide on what I want in my taco was a great inconvenience. Overall, the sweet pork taco was good and the service was mediocre.
