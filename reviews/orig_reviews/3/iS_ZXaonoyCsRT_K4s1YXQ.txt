Food's good but not worth the price; extremely overpriced. You're actually paying for real estate because it does have an amazing view of bellagio. I think it's dumb to charge for tortilla chips; most Mexican restaurants doesn't charge for them.

I did like my margarita though, cabo wabo tequila is actually pretty good.
