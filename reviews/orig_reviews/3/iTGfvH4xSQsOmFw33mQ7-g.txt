Good spot to come and eat after a night of drinking. I don't speak Spanish so it's hard for me to communicate to some of them but I do like the tacos. Other than the spanish....It's good! 
I would just recommend the carne asada tacos or the "pastor" tacos?  Everyone says these tacos are "real" and "authentic" so I trust that!  Better than taco bell haha.
