Went here for happy hour Friday, after looking at the menu, I don't know that I could justify going any other time. I mean I will go back and have dinner once, and then decide then, but this place is pretty pricey. Happy hour is $1.50 tacos and half price drinks. The tacos are little street tacos and are so perfect. They have duck, carne asada, chorizo and avocado, shrimp, halibut, shredded pork, poblano hash, but with a more fancy name. I think they all pretty much had an avocado slice, and the sauce that comes on the shrimp one is not the same as the one on the halibut. It comes with only one corn tortilla per taco which I love cause I usually either split it into two tacos anyway or throw one out . The hot sauce salsa stuff that comes on the platter was pretty good too. Of course there is a little lime wedge for each too. We started with 4 of the flavors, 2 each, and because they were so good, we tried 2 more flavors, soo the only one I haven't tried was the carne asada, but it has to be good. 

Now the drinks, holy moly they are StiFF. Started off with the "Sangria" which had the description of Red Wine, Mango Puree, and Jack Daniels. Ok, at Jack Daniels is where I should have said no way you will like it, get something else. My intuition was correct again, and it was terrible, it was Jack Daniels on the front and back end. Thankfully my boyfriend took it down. He started with the LowRider Margarita, which was perfect. Didn't taste any sweet and sour! I then moved on to the Jamaica Margarita which was patron, grand mariner, hibiscus flower, it was pretty good, but super strong. The BF then had a Pink Cadillac, which wasn't that good, but I could probably see people liking it's strangeness. Definitely not for the premixed bottle margarita drinkers. 

If this place was simply a taco stand, I'd given it 5 stars. I will definitely update when I can get back and try their dinner, cause it all sounded fantastic.
