They have a huge marguerita on the menu.  The nachos are huge, enough for 2-3 people to share .  Chips and salsa are not complementary. If not complementary, they should at least give free refills. $4 tacos were small but tasty.  It has great atmosphere at night since its directly on the strip.  Spin the wheel while you are there
