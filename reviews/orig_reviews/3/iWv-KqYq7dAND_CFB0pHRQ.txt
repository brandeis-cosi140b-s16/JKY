First impression, poor service... Walked in to no greeting or instruction to seat yourself or to wait!!! Finally seated and waited for menus for literary 10 minutes,only received them because the server came to take our order and was told we hadn't seen menus yet!!! After placing our order and waiting another 10 minutes was informed they didn't have the marinated steak for my wife's order and would have to get something else... Shouldn't you have known this sooner than that!?!?!? I only give It a 3 star for good solid food... Although could've been better if they had what I really wanted!!!
