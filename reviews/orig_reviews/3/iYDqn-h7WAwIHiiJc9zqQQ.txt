Just to be objective in my assessment, this is visit #3.
I ordered Enchiladas de Mole, traditional Mole Poblano made from Ancho and Pasilla chiles, sesame seeds and peanuts. It was good BUT, what I should have ordered was the Pollo en Mole Verde with a green cilantro lime rice. The food after three visits here both at lunch and dinner is consistently good, spot on high quality ingredients. 
The service: in all fairness, my first visit was chaos because it was opening week. The following two visits both dinner and now lunch, the bar staff is exceptionally engaging and gregarious (Kelly & Jessica). 
The Margaritas: base tequila is Cuervo Gold. Total liquor is 2.25-oz. at a painful $10.50. The three closest competitors within less than a 5mi radius use a 100% Agave tequila unlike Cuervo's (mixto), pour 3-oz of liquor at $11. One establishment has it at $10 using Patron at 2.75-oz.
The bottom line: Food is good, service is good, booze is above average albeit value-wise it fails. One final note; it is truly a shame that anyone can Google their Manhattan Beach menu and see that the Las Vegas pricing is a whopping $3 more straight across the board! Did they not think that the Las Vegas locals were not smart enough to investigate that??? The happy hour is loooong! Starting at 2/2:30 through 6pm but, it is so complicated!! And, worse yet, of no real value. A $2 savings is not a happy hour although, I suppose if you milk it by staying the entire 3+ hours then MAYbe it's a better value.
