This is good(ish).

Salsa was average. Guacamole was average. Service was slow but not outrageous. But I did like the atmosphere. We ate out back and it was beautiful - I could have used a space heater, mostly because I'm a weather wimp. They have them they just weren't on that particular night.

My food was good. I'm trying to remember exactly what I had (an indication I go out to eat a bit too much) I believe some sort of bean burrito thing that ended up being average to good. 

I don't spend any time really in Old Town or Scottsdale for that matter, but if is this the best they have for Mexican it will suffice - the charm wins it a lot of points and maybe even a return visit in my book. But I've definitely had better in the Valley.
