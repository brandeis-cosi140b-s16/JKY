Was at the southpoint this afternoon and thought we try something different beside steak and shake. Me and my boyfriend had he $7.95 lunch specials. First off you get chips, salsa, beans, and guacamole to start off with for free and the guacamole was delicious!! Most Mexican restaurants always charge for guacamole so I was shocked it was free. I had the carne la plancha with beans and rice and it wasn't that good. The meat looked and had the texture of cat food. My boyfriend had the flautas and he really enjoyed them. Next time I come back I will probably go with my gut like I should have this visit and order the fish tacos. Oh and the raspberry margarita was amazing!!
