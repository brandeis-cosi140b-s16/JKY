Went there on a recent vacation (2 weeks ago) and already forgotten anything about the atmosphere, service or what the other people with me ate or thought about it - so that puts it at an average for me. I do remember (after a quick glance at the menu) what I got - the double-stacked enchiladas, Christmas style - and it was just fine, but nothing I would've ordered again or complained about - just average.
