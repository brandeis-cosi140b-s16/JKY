A bit hesitant to do the Mexican place in a hotel with the Italian theme, but we weren't in the mood for pasta at the time. The experience at Canonita was OK. The service was up and down. They changed waiters on us mid-stream and without notice. It was VERY slow to get a check and so forth, even though the place had pretty much emptied out.

Fortunately, the food was pretty good. They do have this annoying thing about trying to up-sell you on stuff. Like they charged for every little side you ask for.

The mushroom enchiladas were really good and the veggie fajitas (not explicitly on the menu) were decent. It was "happy hour" and we were tempted by the drinks deals which ended up not being very happy. Just a weak showing there.

Overall, not bad. We did get a really nice seat next to the canals of Venice. Gotta make the best of the fake world we were in.
