We went for happy hour and had the tacos. I had a beef and a chicken taco, my husband had a beef and pork taco. The chicken and pork tacos were good. The beef tacos were dry and bland. They warned us before that the beef tacos were fried. I love fried tacos, but not these. The house margaritas were delicious. I am not sure we will ever return, but it was decent.
