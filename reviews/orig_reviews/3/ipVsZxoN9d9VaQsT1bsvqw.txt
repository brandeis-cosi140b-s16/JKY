i've always thought that it would be great for a wahoo's to open up in vegas.  they finally did!

if your in the mood for some fish tacos, this is a nice spot.  they don't have the fried kind (which i prefer), but the fish they do have is a good as its a mild fish taste and meaty.  the other kinds of meats, like the beef and chicken, are good - but nothing out of the ordinary.  in my opinion, they could use a little bit more kick.  this is a good option if your eating healthy as you could substitute for brown rice.  brown rice and fish = a meal to not feel guilty about.

the portions are really large and the prices are decent.  i love their white rice..its seasoned nicely. not a big fan of the white beans though.  i'll like to stick with the normal black.

its brand new and clean so the ambience is great.  theres also a bar with happy hour and i think they even have some slots (only in vegas!).  its kind of hard to find since its not on the main road.  keep on the look out for it near rainbow and sunset.
