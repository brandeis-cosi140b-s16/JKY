Skinny margaritas here are great. I don't know what makes them skinny because they still pack a tequila punch and they taste great. 

The food was pretty decent too. Upscale Mexican is never my favorite. I always feel like Mexican is done best by Mexicans. Not rich white people. Don't get me wrong the food was good it's just weird to get a hundred dollar tab at a Mexican joint.
