The place had an upstairs and a downstairs; the ambiance was pretty nice. We were asked if we wanted to sit outside and we said yes since it was such a beautiful day. We sat at a table where you could see part of the pool and it was very nice,

Service was quick and friendly. The server was very nice. She brought chips and 3 types of salsas. Two of us order the Grilled Fish Taco's. I am sorry but I have had much better. The fish tasted as if it was old and chewy. They were not very good. It was $25.00 dollars for 3 small taco's and an Iced tea.
