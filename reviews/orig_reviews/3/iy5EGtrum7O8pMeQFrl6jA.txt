A mixed bag of great and average. When the weather is nice, their outside patio is a fantastic hideaway to grab a bite or a drink. Their margaritas are tasty and go well with the spicy food. And, most importantly here, they know how to use those hatch chilis.

On the down side the staff always seems to require flagging down, especially right before Happy Hour ends. Would have been nice to get in one last order beforehand, but couldn't find anyone. Had the carne adovada, one of my favorite dishes, and it was a mix of tender and spicy with burnt and unchewable. Seriously, I spit out one whole chunk of meat I couldn't chew through after several minutes. There was enough good meat in there that I was full by the end (though the chips and salsa helped), but I should never have to eat around bad bits to get to the good.

My wife had the chile rellenos, and they were spicy and tasty. Might be a better bet to go with if you try the place out.
