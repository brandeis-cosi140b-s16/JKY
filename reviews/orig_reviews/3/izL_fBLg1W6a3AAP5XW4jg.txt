Not a bad choice for Mexican in this part of town. Atmosphere is open and relaxing. No complaints on the service, but then we were there on a sparse evening. 

I had the Sizzling Enchiladas, which is a sort of enchilada/fajita hybrid. Memorable? Not really. It was ok.

It's very worth the price of a Groupon, but even without it would be an ok value.

The most remarkable part of this place remains the leggy logo.
