Smallest water glasses I've ever been given at a restaurant. They were so tiny we probably had to flag the waiter down 25 times for refills. I came on a Monday for 50% off for locals and the service was below average. We sat down quickly and then it took 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order. We are in and out people and we were there for 1 hour 35 minutes. We got one appetizer and entrees. I would come back and sit at the bar but not at a table. Way too slow of service.
