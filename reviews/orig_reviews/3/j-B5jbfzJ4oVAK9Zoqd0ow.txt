My girlfriend and I went out pretty late on a Wednesday night... We were trying to find something, anything that was open. It seemed like all of the restaurants in Mandalay Bay, except for the Burger Bar (which neither of us wanted to go to again) were closed. So we walked thru to Luxor and then Excalibur... Still nothing... So we made the decision to go across to MGM Grand and see what we could find in there...

Walking thru the hotel towards the restaurants I saw Diego and asked if she would like to have Mexican. But of course! I shouldn't have even needed to ask. LOL.

We decided to order off of their Prix Fixe Menu... For anyone that hasn't done this, it's a great way to try out a restaurant for a pretty reasonable cost. 

Diego Prix Fixe Menu $32/person

We each had a Margarita to start out with, then I had a tortilla soup and my girl had a salad. For our entrees my girl had a chicken mole and I had the Tacos al Carbon which came with freshly hand made corn tortillas... I could have eaten 10 of those pillow like dreams! LOL

The food was very good all around. The price perfect for a late night meal, especially when you get a good strong drink with the meal too.
