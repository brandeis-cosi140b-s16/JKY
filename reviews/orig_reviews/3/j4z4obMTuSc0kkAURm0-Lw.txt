I am from Texas, love Mexican Food and consider myself a connoisseur. Nonetheless, Yolos held up pretty well. 

We went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. 

They start you off with some delicious salsa and chips. The salsa was tasted great with some smokey undertones. The chips though were a little flavorless, but that was remedied by a dash of salt. 

For drinks we ordered the house and cadillac margaritas on the rocks. I am purest and would drink tequila and lime juice if they offered it. I am not sure how "pure" the house margarita was, but it past the taste test. I don't like cadillac margaritas as there are too many liquors in it so I won't review it. 

I read some Yelp reviews about the street tacos so we had to order them. One order of chicken and one order of fish.  They brought out 3 soft tacos with sides of pico de gallo, guacamole, rice and beans. This what Mexican Food is all food: simple and inexpensive. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The fish tacos were made with Mahi-Mahi, but I would have preferred a more authentic fish taco made with Tilapia. 

I think I will try some other Mexican Restaurants before I come back.
