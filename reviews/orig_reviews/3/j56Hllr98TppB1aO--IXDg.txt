Party of 12 and took an hour to get food and they had to keep running back to get items that they forgot. We order build your own for 2 and they did not being rice or ranchero beans which were part if the meal. When I asked I was told it can come with the meal if we want. When we asked that they bring it they never did.  The manager came over and I complained about the time it took to receive our food and that we never received our beans and rice. He profusely apologized and he comped the table dessert which was absolutely delicious. My husband and I asked for regular coffee (and honestly thought that would be comped) and they added that to the bill. 

Food has a good taste but service sucked
