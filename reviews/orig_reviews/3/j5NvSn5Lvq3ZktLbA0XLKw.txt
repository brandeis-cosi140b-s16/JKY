3.5 stars... started my night out here while attending a foodie happy hour event. A drink and appetizers were included in our ticket. The food that had (nachos and a chicken quesadilla) was eh..not good..not bad..just eh... the guacamole saved my night there...chips and guacamole was really all I needed and once it was gone so was I. 

I don't drink but ordered my "free drink" that came with my ticket and ordered the pineapple mojito. Knowing I was giving it to a friend anyways I took one sip and it was way too strong and bitter..and it wasn't the i don't drink so it was strong kind of bitter..it was just bitter. My friend thinking I was just being dramatic tried the drink and had the same reaction and at the same time we both said..it's like it has tonic water in instead of club soda or soda water...she took another drink to make sure. Went back to her watermelon Margarita which she says was fabulous and I went back to water...guacamole ran out and so did we...round the corner to souther rail...eh...
