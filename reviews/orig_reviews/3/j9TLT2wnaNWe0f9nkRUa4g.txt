I was visiting family for the Thanksgiving holiday and my aunt and uncle wanted to take us out to their favorite Mexican restaurant, Jalapeno Inferno. The restaurant is very clean and on a Friday night, very busy! But that just means it's popular, which is a good sign. 

However, I expected better service. Our waitress didn't bring my uncle's 2nd beer; maybe she was new, but luckily we weren't charged for it. All the food tasted great, except my aunt received chicken instead of beef, and my cousin found an inedible object in her food.The manager promptly came by and apologized and comped the plate and gave us a free fried ice cream.

I'm not going to dock this place too much because the food and drinks were tasty. Unfortunate things happen on occasion, but if I ever come back and service lacks again I doubt I'd go a third time.
