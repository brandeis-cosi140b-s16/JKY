I read the reviews so decided to try it since I was in town. Service was excellent, beer was cold and they have a wrote variety of Mexican beer.  The food was less than expected however.  I got the queso fundido, all I tested was peppers, the cheese cake out scalding hot to eat and then cooled way to fast and I was stuck with just globs of cheese.  The soft tacos were runny and had sour cream on them which was not noted on the menu.  Been there done it, don't have to go back.
