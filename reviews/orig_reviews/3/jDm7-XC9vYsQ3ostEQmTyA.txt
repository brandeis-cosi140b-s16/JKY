I love Mexican food and this place is the closest Mexican restaurant to me and that's the main reason I go there. 

The food is generally pretty good but on multiple occasions I've gone there at later hours and noticed the chips to be extremely stale to the point where you can't really eat them. The salsa is good but not my favorite. The entrees I've had are always the best part though, which it always should be. I typically get the stacked enchiladas with shredded beef, which is good but could have more flavor, with rice and beans. On other occasions I've had a chicken chimichanga which was also good. Compared to some other Mexican restaurants, I can say there are other tastes out there that I prefer. 

If they could make sure to have fresh chips and salsa the entire time they're open, I'd give them at least one more star. The food is good, but isn't out of this world amazing. I will be returning and plan on being a repeat customer thanks to the proximity of the restaurant to my house, and good service.
