I've been to this restaurants a few times now to get some take out & it's starting to deteriorate in quality. The chicken was always plump & delicious along with the beans & salsa. Lately, however the size of the chicken has become smaller & the last couple of times the beans were really salty. Very disappointed in this, especially because the food was worth the money .. Now, not so much.
