So I should've of know not to trust the reviews when they were mostly written by Caucasians (no offense) but their Mexican food knowledge usually not the same as ours

I gave it 3 starts only because the service was by far one of the best I've ever had everyone super friendly and very attentive loved it. 

The food was not at all what I expected portions were good but lacked the authentic Mexican food flavor.  
 
We would only come back for  the customer service
