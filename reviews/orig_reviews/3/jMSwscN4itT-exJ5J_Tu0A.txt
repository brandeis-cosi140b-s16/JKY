Mmmm... Our food was delicious. Service on a Saturday night on the other hand was a little slow. But understandable because it was busy. With the guacamole we ordered we had a total of 4 dips and it was hard to choose which was best. They we all great. My husband preferred the spicy bean dip, but I'm sure I'll regret that choice later. I got the hatch chile relleno and it was pretty spicy but tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant. I'm sure we will be going back.
