Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. There were 12 of us and our waiter took great care of us in spite of the group size. We asked for separate checks and he didn't show any signs of an attitude at all. At the end, when our checks came some of us realized he had forgotten to charge us for our sodas. When we pointed it out to him, he brushed it off and said, "If it's not on the bill, it won't be there at all. Don't worry about it!" Now if only all our waiters can forget about charging us for alcoholic beverages...

As for the food, my favorite was the free corn bread. Fresh from the oven, piping hot, sweet, with whole kernels of corn baked in and served in a mini baking pan. I could have eaten an entire pan of it and called it a night. In hindsight, that's what I should have done. The birthday girl suggested I try the Grilled Miso Salmon since she knows I LOVE seafood, adding that it was "pretty decent salmon considering we're in the middle of the desert." I'll also admit I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Well, let's just say I'm sure there can be better salmon found in the middle of the desert than at Z'Tejas. The salmon was overcooked even though I asked for medium rare. The mashed potato cake on the side was just a lump of dry mashed potato that tasted like it was leftover and sitting in the fridge since last Thanksgiving. I definitely should have gone with a salad or Mexican dish.
