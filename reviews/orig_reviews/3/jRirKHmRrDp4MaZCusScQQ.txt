Heard about MRT opening on Montford and was stoked to finally have an opportunity to check it out. Made it in on a weeknight for an early dinner. 

Dropped off my wife to meet with a friend, so I was flying solo. Sat at the bar and enjoyed the rather large TV screens. The bar is a nice set up with comfy seats. There is also a long table directly behind the bar which is great if you want bar access, but don't want to be nose to nose with the beer taps. 

Started with a nice Dogfish Head 60 minute and the pineapple guac. All I can say is WOW. The chips are warm and thick cut. The guac is mostly smooth with a few small avocado chunks. The pineapple, which I wasn't sure was fresh or from a can, made guac a whole new revelation. Really underestimated the combo. They also had a haba√±ero version, but I wasn't willing to venture down the capsaicin highway. Definitely would order this again. 

I went with the Ahi Tuna burrito sans cusabi (cucmber and wasabi) as I'm allergic. I was a little stunned with the blandness. The rice tasted like instant rice, thrown in to a lime juice/cilantro mix. Really unfortunate addition to the burrito. I'd go without next time. The Ahi was a little overpowered with blackening spice. It was a perfect rare, just a little too overwrought with spice. I'd probably go for tacos next time 'round. 

All in all, I really like what these guys and gals are doing. Love that guac and looking forward to checking out more the menu! Cheers1
