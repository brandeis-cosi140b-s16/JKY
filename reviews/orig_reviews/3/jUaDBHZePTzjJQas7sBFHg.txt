I would say it is actually about 3.5 stars.  We had a group of 8 at Cantina Laredo for happy hour and we had a great time!  The happy hour menu is quite large, half off the regular price (equaling around $4-6), and some of the items are quite unique.  

I had the Steak Fajita Flat-bread and the Ceviche.  The Flat-bread was outstanding and perfectly crispy!  I loved the taste of the caramelized onions with the steak marinade!    I was not a big fan of the ceviche. It only came with two 'fancy chips' to scoop up the ceviche and there was a ton left, so after that I had to use the tortilla chips that came to the table earlier.  It also had olives in it, which I thought did not taste well with the fishy taste.  

I also had a HUGE margarita for only $5!  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but for $5 I would drink it again! 

Many in our group ordered taco plates to share.  The plates come with 3 decent sized tacos; they all tasted good, but some were more exciting that others (one set was pretty bland). 

At the end our server brought out a dessert platter!  We almost ordered all of them (4), but instead we opted for the apple, chocolate and pineapple desserts to share for the whole table.   We all decided the chocolate and apple deserts were the best and came on a sizzling plate of caramel with melting icecream on them.  I highly recommend either of those desserts; they were quite impressive to look at and eat (see picture)!

Our server was just okay.  We had to repeatedly ask for a few things and we waited quite a while after we ordered.  But, he was busy and we were a big group.  He did however, split up our check very efficiently, which seems like a burden for most places!

The atmosphere is pleasant, warm and inviting.  It definitely qualifies as a 'fancy' Mexican restaurant.  I will definitely come back, and I am excited to try more things off the extensive menu!
