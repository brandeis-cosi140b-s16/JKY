Modern Mexican food by celebrity chefs Mary Sue and Susan Feniger. This hip , urban cantina overlooking the river of Mandalay bay beach, 2 floors of patio dining, main bar area in the front. 

We were going to shark reef aquarium at Mandalay bay, saw this restaurant on the way, decided to give it a try.

Decor: 3.5
Food: 2
Service: 4
View: 4

Total bill for 2 with one margarita: $93

Complimentary chips and salsa: delicious, loved the 3 sauces 
Soup of the day with bread: not so good
Baja Cecivhe: very good , liked the crab, shrimp and fish in it, very flavored 
Caesar salad with chicken: the chicken was burned, not much Caesar dressing in there, very plain, yuk... 
Kobe beef tacos: disgusting according to my hubby... 

The food was bad, the service was great, our waitress was super nice and attentive. The view from our patio table was great, it would be even better in summer. 

Not impressed by this 2 celebrity chefs, liked this modern Mexican restaurant, but didn't like the food, Americanized Mexican food didn't work for us. :(
