I've heard some excellent things about Leticia's, and I finally went to try it out myself. It's a drive that's for sure, so prepare for a roadtrip. The place itself and the area where the restaurant is located are both very cute. It's not a huge place, but the decor is really nice. The bar area does have gaming, and there is a separate restaurant side as well.

We sat down and were immediately brought water, chips, and 3 dip options: bean dip, a smoky mild salsa, and a very cilantro-y smooth guacamole. All were very good, and the chips were fresh. Our server Saul came to take our beverage order (2 Dos Equis), and then disappeared for at least ten minutes, if not 15. When he came back, he had no beer, ran to the bar, came back and said they were out of Dos Equis.... Not okay with that delay, or paying for the Pacifico that I didn't really want. Anyway, the service got a little better from here on out, except that when my mother ordered her chicken enchiladas, he tried to push a different style chicken on her, which was very awkward. I kind of interjected and said no, she's good... Very strange interaction. 

I consider myself quite the connoisseur of cheese enchiladas, so of course this is what I ordered. They were very good, not the best I've had, but very good. The beans and rice that came with the enchiladas were great, extremely flavorful. My mom loved her shredded chicken enchiladas, and my dad loved his steak fajitas.

Loved the decor/restaurant itself, liked the food, and was unimpressed with the service.
