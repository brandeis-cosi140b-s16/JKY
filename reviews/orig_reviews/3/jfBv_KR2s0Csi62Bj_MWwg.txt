Breakfast burritos are great.  Other things not so great for us.  We ordered chicken and beef burritos.  We actually ended up throwing them away.  Bland and just not good.  Which is to bad, because the breakfast burritos are soooo good.

We've been there four or five times now.  Customer service has been pretty good, with only one exception.  The girl seemed irritated by our Groupon.
