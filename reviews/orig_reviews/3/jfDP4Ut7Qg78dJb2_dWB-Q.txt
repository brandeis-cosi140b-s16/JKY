I was with my coworker on a business appt in this area today and he suggested we eat lunch here.  I was a little hesitant because the places he has mentioned in the past as being his usual haunts usually don't agree with me but I was actually surprised.  

Now, the part of town is a bit sketchy and the interior is nothing fancy but the quality of food and the prices were right in line with what I wanted.  I decided to be safe and get the Taco Salad with Chicken Lunch Special (since I had a bad experience with Los Olivos only a few days ago).  They actually give you large strips of flavorful, tender chicken.  The chips were yummy and they offered 2 salsas. One was a bean style salsa that was mild and the other was a standard medium flavored.

The wait-staff was polite and quick on the refills (I am a big water drinker) so I appreciate the promptness.  

I probably won't go out of my way to eat here but if in the neighborhood I will certainly stop by for a quick, tasty, and affordable lunch.
