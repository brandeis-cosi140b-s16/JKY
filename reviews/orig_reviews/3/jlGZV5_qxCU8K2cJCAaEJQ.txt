Love the tortillas! The service despite being packed with customers is quick. The food was hyped up pretty good so maybe I expected more.  (Thats my fault for overly high expectations. I should know better.). Anyways, it is well worth the visit if at least to see what the talk is about & check it off the bucket list. Just remember rough part of town & yes, a homeless guy happened to ask for money. But hey, the homeless are all over downtown so not fair to judge this place on one homeless man. And he wasnt rude. Plus, you don't have to eat there & we didn't. Order to go. The tortillas make this place what it is. I'm a fat kid when it comes to tortillas & butter and could live off just that order alone. :)
