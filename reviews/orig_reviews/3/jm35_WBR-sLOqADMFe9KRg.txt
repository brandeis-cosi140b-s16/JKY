Update: The Bf and I went here for dinner tonight to use our Living Social deal. Yet again, I felt that the prices were inflated and the flavor was nothing special. We got the steak tacos, the queso fundido, arroz con crema, and platanos. They serve the food 'tapas' style (so small portions). Our deal also came with 2 margaritas. The margaritas were very good. I liked how fresh it tasted. The steak taco had decent flavor, but the steak was very chewy (like you bite into the taco and couldn't cut the steak with your teeth)....that was not pleasant. The queso fundido was mediocre. It did not have a ton of flavor and the duck was also kind of chewy. It does come with a bit more food though, so that's a plus I guess. The rice was probably the best part of the meal (which it should be because it is expensive for a small portion). It was creamy, yet fresh as it had corn in it and fresh herbs on top. The plantains were alright, although all of the cheese and whatnot on top was somewhat unnecessary in my opinion. I probably would not go back to this restaurant unless someone else was buying :-P
