The chicken chimichanga was REALLY HUGE! And quite tasty. I couldn't finish it, though I really tried!

The chips and salsa cost a dollar. IN TEXAS THAT IS NOT A THING!! Chips and salsa are free in Texas, so hopefully other Mexican restaurants will 'get with the program'. 

Their fajitas come with homemade tortillas (DELICIOUS), and the salsa was tasty. The mango drink tasted canned but their horchata is great!

It's a very kid friendly environment. There's a waterfall near the entrance (with fish in it!). Service was okay. Could have been better, could have been worse. I would go back for the food and hope for better service (that's why the 3 stars only, not 4).
