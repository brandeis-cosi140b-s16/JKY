Stopped here for lunch after truck shopping. Salsa was tasty, as was cheese enchilada lunch, but hubby's Tampique√±a steak was overdone & served with rice that we'd asked to be kept off his plate. Guacamole was also good. Service was friendly (even if she was literally in hubby's face!), though drink refills took a while to do & at the end, nonexistent. Won't be back, just too far from home.
