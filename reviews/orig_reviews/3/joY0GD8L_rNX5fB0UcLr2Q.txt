I usually love this place and take all my out of town guests, but on Sunday we were disappointed. We ask for guacamole with our chips and they brought a very small cup of guac and no chips. It literally took an additional 5 minutes to bring out the chips, while we just looked at the guacamole. We got a pitcher of the house margarita and it tasted like mix. I got the combination plate, like i always get and it was not that good. Food was on the colder side and our waiter seemed like he couldnt wait to leave. We asked for to go boxes and he stood over my girlfriends shoulder and shoved it in her face.
