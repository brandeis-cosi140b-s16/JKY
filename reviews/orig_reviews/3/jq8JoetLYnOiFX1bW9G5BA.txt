Yelp I finally admit you wronged me on this place.  It's the first time this has happened and I am a little sad about it.  

I don't get it Best in Phoenix Carne yes I admit it was good but nowhere did I go wow this is the best I ever ate.  

So it's a small little joint Owner/Chef was very friendly and nice.  The food was good or A-OK in Yelp terms but nothing that blew me away to think I totally need to come back here.  Prices honestly a little steep for what you get.  These are street tacos not vanity tacos.  

Green Chili Cheese dip was nothing I expected and very very greasy.  

Horchata was um weird I can't say anything else it wasn't Horchata I can say that.  

So overall the Tacos were A-OK but that was about it.  So I'll be nice and say 3 stars when really more like a 2.5
