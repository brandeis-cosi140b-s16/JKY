Mehhh just ok. Tacos were alright, I wasn't a fan of their tortilla is was kinda gritty tasting and fell apart. Queso with black beans appetizer was delicious. I think this place is over priced, especially their drinks. We sat at the bar and the bartender/server was cool, but kept trying to get us to order shots and it was 2pm on a Wednesday, that got a little annoying. Good place to chill, cool atmosphere but food is just mediocre.
