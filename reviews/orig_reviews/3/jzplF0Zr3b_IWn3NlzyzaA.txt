There are so many outstanding AZ Mex, Tex Mex, and New Mex Mex restaurants in Phoenix. This just isn't one of them.

Everything here feels generic and mass produced, buffet or cafeteria style. Which is a shame, really, as the location is so prime and I have great memories of this place back when it was Tony Roma's. Does anyone else remember that?

Anyhow, it isn't wretched by any means, but in a city with so much outstanding Mexican influenced food everything else just falls away by the wayside.
