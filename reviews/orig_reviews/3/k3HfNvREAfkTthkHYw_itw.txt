The tacos were awesome! My boyfriend and I shared 6 of them. Yes, sharing tacos is weird, but we wanted to try lots of different flavors. The shu Mai were ok, but not more impressive than a typical dim sum restaurant. The hot and sour soup was bad. We actually asked for chili, lime, vinegar, and salt to correct it. Our server was awesome. I would not go back, but then again I wasn't too impressed with staying at the Cosmopolitan in general.
