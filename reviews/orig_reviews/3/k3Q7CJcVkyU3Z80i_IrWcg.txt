Really good service. Quick, efficient and pleasant.

Food had nice presentation, was hot and drink refills came quickly. Plates weren't overly garnished and I love the sour cream in a mini fluted tortilla bowl.

Cute decor, I'm sure the out of town folks eat up the Mexico theme.

Food was ok. Sort of bland. Not great, not horrid. I'll give it another try for sure.
