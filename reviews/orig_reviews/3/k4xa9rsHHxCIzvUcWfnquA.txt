We've been here a few times, and I have to say the 3 stars are an average of our visits. I don't find them consistent. 

Our first visit was very good, and what lead us to return. The highlight was the ceviche. Super bright and fresh, and very plentiful. The four of us shared it and had plenty. The daughters loved the fideo as well.
Next visit, was ok. The guac was good., enchiladas not bad. 

Our most recent trip was a mixed bag. The fideo was a salt lick. The girls bean and cheese burritos were good. The guac was excellent. Phil and I each ordered one of their signature steak dishes. He ordered medium rare, I ordered rare. His was cooked perfectly and was very good. Mine was the sole of a shoe. Not only not rare, it wasn't even pale pink...just ash grey. I don't usually get fussed about such things. If it's any kind of medium, or at least juicy I'll just eat it anyway. If it's really well done, I'll politely send it back (these were thin steaks, about a half inch, so they can get away from a chef if not watched). I sent it back, the waiter said no prob, then shortly after brought me out a piece so rare it was red on the outside! hardly any of the meat had even changed color from the heat. We actually started laughing because we couldn't believe the nerve to even carry it to the table. A second server rushed over and couldn't believe what I'd been served and tried to insist I send it back again. Uhhhhh.... NO! lol... not bloody likely!

The place has a few bright spots (the bean dip several yelpers mentioned is pretty good), but with a surly chef in charge, there is no way I'll go back.
