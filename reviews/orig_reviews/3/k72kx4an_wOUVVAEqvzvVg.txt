Went with the wife and 3 other couples for a quick bite before the hardcore drinking last night. I must say, for a Friday night, and a group of 8, they got us right in and took really good care of us. Our waitress was really nice, they were quick, the food all came out at the same time and everyones was correct! Shouldn't be such a big deal to say that, but such are the times.  

I got the carne asada and I couldn't tell you what everyone else got, but I know I saw some fish tacos, a burrito plate and some other stuff, most importantly, everyone seemed to like it. For anyone else that happened to be there last night- I apologize, we were that table- louder than everyone around us, but we're a nice group so back off! 

Anyway, I have not been the biggest fan of the AZ Center in the past, but this place totally did the job and set a good tone for the night!
