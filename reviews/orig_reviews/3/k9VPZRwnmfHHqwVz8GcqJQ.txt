Like many have said, the tacos are average and WAY over priced. The ambiance is the selling point! Go for the cool decor. It's an experience. The cherry steak taco is worth trying ($5) but is not worth the price. I had a $11 margarita that barley had any alcohol in it. Pretty dissapointing! 

Service was great though. Ashley was really helpful and friendly. 

All in all, over priced for what it is. I'll only go back if someone else is paying for it!
