First, the only reason this place gets three (3) stars is because of the food. The food is great! Probably the best Mexican food on the (very) west side. The reality of this place: It doesn't seem like anyone pays much attention to cleanliness. The two (2) times that I did dine in were enough. Food left on tables for over an hour; workers handling food after mopping (granted it was their own food, but if they do it to their own food...); and trash on the floors. 

All-in-all: The food is great, but the facility is a dump. Do yourself a favor and get takeout.
