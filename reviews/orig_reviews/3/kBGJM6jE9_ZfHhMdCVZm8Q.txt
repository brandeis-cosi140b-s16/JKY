Bar was pretty cool to hang out with as all of the bartenders were awesome and very friendly. Jake, I think that was his name, was cool to talk to and gave me and my girlfriends a round of free drinks as it was my bachelorette party. Woohoo!

We were seated promptly and our server whom looked like James Blunt was okay. Very serious attitude which I wasn't expecting since it was Vegas and all. We ordered guacamole and was so disappointed to see that they tried to jip you by putting a bunch of tortilla chips on the bottom of the mortar so that they didn't have to put as much guacamole in the mortar. WTH? 

The entree's were okay. Unfortunately, I got full quickly from the guacamole and so I didn't get to enjoy my piles of cuban pork nachos that I ordered. It looked good, but it was just way too much. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entree's.

Its a great casual place to hang out in Vegas if you want some cerveza's and some good old fashioned nacho's.
