Food was very good and ingredients very fresh! The hostess was beyond rude and not at all inviting. She didn't look up when we entered but proceeded to hold up a finger signaling us "one moment." We asked politely to move tables from inside to outside shortly after we were seated. The same hostess acted like this was the most difficult task we could have asked. The restaurant was less than half full. We even caught her whispering to another waitress about us. Outside area is very pretty and nice atmosphere. Service was extremely slow to get to us outside. Once one waiter realized no one had attended to us for about 15min after being seated he took charge. He provided us speedy service and was very friendly. Overall I liked the food here and was grateful for the waiter we finally did get. This will not stop me from sharing my poor hostess experience with anyone asking about this new restaurant. It is inexcusable.
