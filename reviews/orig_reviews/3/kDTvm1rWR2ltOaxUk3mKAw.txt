Saw this place on food network show DDD and had to try it. It was ok. Not mind blowing but not blah or eww either. Jade red chicken was good but I could taste ketchup when eating it. Fried rice was ok nothing amazing. Service was very friendly and helpful. They let us sample ever meat on the menu before ordering. For the service I would give them four stars. But yeah the concept of this place is much cooler than the taste of its food. Fun idea, I'd try it again if I was in the area but I wouldn't crave it. Go there... See for yourself.
