An odd combination, taco joint/chinese dim sum under one roof. I mainly ordered tacos. Lobster taco was amazing! Duck tongue taco was over powered with (soy sauce) that I couldn't really tell what it was. Lamb potsickers was different, in a very good way. Had one of the best bloody mary here. Service was terrible!!! Our waitress, Megan, did not know how to smile. She totally ignored from start to finish. The food was really tasty, but Megan's attitude was so horrible that I couldn't enjoy my food! I just wanted to quickly get out of there solely because of her. She cleaned my spot when I arrived, then took a million years to come back to take my order. Every time I needed to order more it was impossible to get her attention even though I was practically sitting right in front of her.
