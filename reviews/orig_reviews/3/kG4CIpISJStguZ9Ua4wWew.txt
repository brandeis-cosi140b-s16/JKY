I've been to Cantina a few times and every time I go I'm in love. This joint has grade A food and the drinks are on point. Definitely one of my favorite places to seek out. The service is typically perfect. I love how the waitstaff is straight foward, not ass kissey, and on their stuff. My recent experience wasn't really on par as my other times. To be honest, when I walk in, I never know if I'm allowed to seat myself. I love how in the patio there's a sign, it'd be really cool to have one up front just cause walking into a place one's never been into can be a sensitive moment. Anywho, we sat down and waited 7 minutes to be greeted and our waitress didn't really give me her name. Anywho ordered our stuff. Our order was messed up but she didn't check back, so we  hailed her, she fixed it, was really cool about it. We got the right food and no napkins, she didn't check back, so we got resourceful.  Finally when we finished, she came back and cashed us out. 

Food and drinks were on point, service this time was eh, but seriously people, go to this joint. It'll still be one of my favorites despite the recent experience. I just think check backs would have made it so much better, but eh, no one's perfect.
