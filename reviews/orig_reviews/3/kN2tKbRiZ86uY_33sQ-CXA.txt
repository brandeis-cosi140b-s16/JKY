Hole in a wall taco joint. It was decent and quite average taco. The menu looks better than what the food was. I came here to have a late afternoon snack. I had taco and sliders, which portion was very generous, but the flavor was not as refined. Perhaps, the portion was too generous that i get tired of eating it? I would like to return with more friends and sample other things in the menu.
