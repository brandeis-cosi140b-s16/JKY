Awww - I'm so sorry to see all these horrible reviews on here! I went with my husband and a friend to check out "the place that just opened in the old El Jefe's" and what do you know - it was Nacho Daddy. 
The setup inside is pretty standard - dining room on one side, big bar on the other - and the atmosphere is typical "fiesta" style. No problem there.
The menu IS kinda random because it's centered on all the crazy nachos they have (regular, sloppy joe, buffalo, veggie, cuban, etc), but then on the other side they threw in a bunch of other Mexican dishes, some sandwiches, and hamburgers. I didn't try anything from the back side of the menu, but figured we better stick to the namesake nachos. We ordered the traditional (large size to split) and I thought they were really good. Nothing outstanding - I mean, hey, we're only talking about nachos - but they used some really quality ingredients and everything had a nice flavor. At ~$13 for the full platter (2 of us almost finished it), they are a little more pricey than other places, but I think they're also a little better.
Bonus to Nacho Daddy for a decent beer selection, and big (22-oz I think) domestics are only $4, and $3 during happy hour!
Service was pretty average - nothing to write home about.
Overall, I'll go back to Nacho Daddy if I'm in the area and feeling nachos (NOT Mexican!). 
Seemed to me that they're earlier service issues have been cleaned up, so hopefully everyone will be back to support a new local joint!
