I love the chicken poblano, best dish!  And I'd give it more stars but the salsa is boring, tastes canned, the guac needs help, not fresh tasting, the enchiladas with red sauce was boring and the sauce is bland sometimes and sometimes too spicy to eat.  My mother loves their California burrito, but sometimes it's cold inside.  So the food is inconsistent.  I hope it improves, but they seem happy with the status quo.  I'll go back for the chicken poblano unless I find it better someplace else.  Service is fair.  Cleanliness of restaurant could be improved, floors and booths need cleaning.  :)
