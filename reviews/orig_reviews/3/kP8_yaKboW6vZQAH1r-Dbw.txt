The 3 stars are mostly for service which was excellent. Drinks were just ok. We had frozen peach Margarita and Long Island. We started with Chips & trio salsa which wasn't anything special and also had the crab cakes which where good. We order for the main course the burger with fries & the grilled Ruby trout salad. The burger was cooked perfect but the bun taste like dough and was kinda comparable to wonder bread just soft and tasteless, and ruined the burger. My bf took one bite and was done with it, fries were good. My salad was ok, dressing was a little sweet, and the grilled trout on top had no flavor and just tasted bland.
Overall the service was the best part about having dinner here, but the food was just not good. Don't think we will be returning.
