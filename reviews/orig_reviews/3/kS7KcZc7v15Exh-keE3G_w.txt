A decent Tex-Mex place near where my mom lives. I got the enchiladas and had more than enough food for an entire day of eating. 

This place exists in a strip mall with several other places to eat and they all are basically in the same category of being pretty good. They won't blow your mind but remember where you are: Phoenix, Arizona. If I wanted my mind blown I'd be in New York or LA or SF or some other arrangement of letters. As it is, I was fairly happy that I wasn't subjected to Taco Bell or the like. So check this place out for lunch.
