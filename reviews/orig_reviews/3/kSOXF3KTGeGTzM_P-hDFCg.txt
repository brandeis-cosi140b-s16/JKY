When her friends greet you back to town with, "we're VIP at 'the best steakhouse off the Strip' let's meet up for dinner..." And then later says, "oh it'll be too late for HH - we'll miss the $1.99 deal..." Monkey say, "WHY THE FUCK would you be VIP at 'the best steakhouse off the Strip' for a $1.99 deal!?!?"

With the bar is now set at a new low... this place ain't bad.  I mean, it'll do.  Clean joint for pretty clean fast food.  Really nice, friendly service.  

Monkey do:

BULGOGI BURRITO- got mine without rice and it was still huge.  Good and bad that it wasn't filled with bulgogi, thankful for plenty of veggies.  

LETTUCE WRAPS w/Chicken- two giant cups of diced chicken and veggies in lettuce

Good post workout food without the food coma or the dent in your wallet.  Shared parking in strip mall, There's Korean, Korean/Mexican fusion and Mexican food as well.
