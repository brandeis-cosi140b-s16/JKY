Woke up early about to head out of town for the weekend decide to stop and try this place based off of the yelp reviews. We live right around the corner from this place and I've never tried but my son and husband has and loved it. They insisted on coming here. 

Lady that took our order was nice and cheery. I ordered the Conni's favorite. It wasn't too bad but not my favorite it so far. It had steak meat and green chile. It was really messy to eat and maybe if it had a little more vegetables and less green chile it would of been better. 

Will try this place again but definitely a different burrito.
