Normally I'm completely in love with everything I get here but tonight... not so much. The Carne asade nachos were lacking meat and there was no tomatoes or salsa.
The lady at the register,  apparently a newer manager, was not paying attention. She was so busy saying hi to other people she didn't hear what I was asking and kept deleting the wrong part of the order. 
I hope she isn't there the next time. Javier is amazing.
