If you're one to pass Arizona Ave on the Downtown Chandler area, you'll probably notice the adobe color painted building of Elmer's Tacos. Beautiful mural design of a desert landscape outside and more colored details ala Mexican motiff inside. They have patio tables up front and on the back, with plenty of parking for day and night customers. The restaurant itself is small and has a sufficient flow of AC air during Summer. It is also well-lighted thus it helps one to see clearly the picture menus on the upper wall. Casual and welcoming atmosphere, casual because it has the street-appeal eatery that customers in their Summer shorts and shirts, even on pajamas, can enjoy a meal, and welcoming because we were greeted when we walked in and friendly service on the counter. 

I had a fish taco and horchata and would say they can do better, not really a big fan of fish and coleslaw filling, and the sugar on the horchata could use a cut-down. Price on all of their food is very reasonable. We were there at around 8:00 p.m. on a weekday, and at this time, the tables and floors have not been wipe out. Definitely a cheap eats, and although the food did not win me, i will still give this a try because of their casual ambiance, and hopefully my next order will be satisfying to my liking.
