So many reviewers gave this 4stars but i'm not sure at all why.  When in Arizona and you live in Washington, getting good Mexican food is a treat.  After a Mariners spring training game we decided to treat ourselves.  Used mobile Yelp on my phone and found this was close so we decided to try it.  The service was very good and the waitress pleasant and helpful especially when we asked what she recommended.  One of my friends had a grandma who made authentic tamales so he ordered those as did my husband.  I opted for a green corn tamale because i love green sauce.  On all the tamales there was more masa than filling which made them heavy and dry.  I guess it was green sauce on mine but it sure looked yellow to me.  Friend said it wasn't like grandma made.  All in all it was just a so so meal which was sad since the place got so many wonderful reviews.
