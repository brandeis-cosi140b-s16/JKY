The food is excellent! The atmosphere and decor are beautiful. But the service is lacking in a big way :-(. Management is snobby and uncompromising. 

Last year I contacted them to have my company Christmas party and their prices for the private room that seats approx 15 was outrageous! I think the budget we had of 2500 without drinks was fair for 12 people. We passed by after our dinner and the palace was empty! The back room empty. Guess they didn't need our money or business.

Today I called to book my bday party of just 12 and they are unable to accommodate separate checks. I won't be booking there.

I am sure their tourist business is good! Sadly, they are not embraced by locals and don't appreciate local business'. This isn't the OC!
