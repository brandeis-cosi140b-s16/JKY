Came to Charlotte on a business trip and decided to try this place since it was conveniently across the street to my hotel. It was a nice restaurant and seems like a good happy hour spot since it has an outdoor area that faces the street. I was disappointed that with only 4 strict combo options that you aren't able to substitute any of the items. I decided to go with the combo that had a carne asada taco, chicken taco and pork avocado enchilada. The tacos were really tasty but really greasy. The enchilada had a cinnamon flavor which I thought was weird; not bad, just different. The margarita was ok; nothing too exciting. I was surprised that the service wasn't better since it seemed like a light day.
