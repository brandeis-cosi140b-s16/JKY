I was reminded of the original Matt's Big Breakfast when we walked into this place!  It is ridiculously tiny, but what space they do have is maximized.  I had the Standard burger and it was super delish!  I am not the biggest pickle fan, but that was my favorite part of this burger.  The shakes are also fab.  I do think it's a bit over-priced and the menu is limited.  My husband had the short rib tacos and said he enjoyed them.  My friend had the elote and did not feel it was worth the price.  Over $2 and it was not even a full ear of corn!

The staff was very kind and patient as I tried to figure out what my kids would eat.  I won't be a regular, but I did enjoy the experience.
