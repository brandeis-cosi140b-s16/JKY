Some gals from work have been here before and wanted all of us to go here for our last lunch before our winter work break. I'm always up for something new. I wanted to try a few different items so I ordered the 2 Item Combo with a Crunchy Chicken Taco and Shredded Beef Enchilada.
 The Wait Staff was great, 4 Star just because one order was incorrect and it took a few extra minutes to pay our bills at the end but otherwise awesome.
The free chips, salsa and bean dip were tasty, not "hot" but had good flavor, chips were warm and fresh. 
Now on to the meal, the Chicken taco was full of meat, the chicken was flavorful and tender, the taco shell was not greasy, but the red sauce on it tasted like marinara sauce, it threw off the taste of the whole thing and it tasted like I was eating at an Italian restaurant. A couple of the other girls got tacos as well and found it to be strange. I ate some of the shredded beef from the enchilada and it was overly salty. The food over all was edible but if your looking for good Mexican food or Mexican food period, I say skip this place. 
Prices were pretty equal to most Mexican restaurants. We ordered ahead of time so we had plenty of time to get there, eat and get back to work in an hour.
I doubt I'd return to Jalisco since there are plenty of better Mexican restaurants in the area.
