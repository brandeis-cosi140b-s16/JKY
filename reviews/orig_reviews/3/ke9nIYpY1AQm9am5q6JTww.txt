Almost every time I'm in Vegas, I come here. Their flautas are an appetizer big enough for a meal. That's all I ever really order and they are delicious. Unfortunately, I sat at the bar on a Sunday afternoon and the guy was quite inattentive. I had to ask for chips and salsa, refill on my water, and the check. Not the best service guys! But the waitress who was behind the bar really stepped it up.
