Came for lunch and was given the dinner menu which was really interesting but it was replaced by the lunch menu. We sat inside looking out over the patio. We ordered 2 drinks-Agua Fresca pineapple-ginger 'where's the ginger'? and a margarita - good enough to order a second. Then we ordered traditional guacamole to start, chips great guacamole bland and an icky color like it had been made way earlier. Then we ordered two Taco plates..one Carne and one hongos (mushroom) delish. Three corn pico de gallo - good concept could be tastier and last but not least Corn Mesa Quesadillas good. We'll be back to try the dinner menu and maybe improve the rating. Loud 80's music playing. Friendly knowledgeable staff. My fav the William Sonoma type towel napkins (5 stars) side note: no flour tortillas only freshly made corn..yea!
