3 1/2 stars. I thought this place was really solid. I came in with Angela and ordered the nacho plate while she ordered two tacos and shared one with me. It's all you can drink, you self-serve at the fountain and when they're making your food, you can totally ask for extra whatever and they'll throw it in gratuit! So I had extra salsa and guacamole with my nachos and it was really solid. Their tortillas they hand make from scratch and you can really tell the difference. Their really solid. This place is definitely way then any other chain Mexican place.
