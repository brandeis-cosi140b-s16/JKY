I ate here twice during a conference. After my first experience I would not have chosen to return, but we had a big group, and I was more interested in being with friends than pushing restaurant choice. 

I judge Mexican places on four basics: guacamole, tacos, salsa, and margaritas. I set out to give Vida two stars, but had to bump it up to three when I realized that the only terrible thing out of these four was the tacos. But the tacos were bad. So bad. If I cannot finish a taco? Bad. The salsa and guacamole were fair. The margaritas were excellent., especially the pomegranate variety (but $11? Really? Stupid.) 

The ceviche was not good, and was also not technically ceviche. I don't know what the sauce was they drenched it in, but ease up there, chief. Simple: lime, garlic, a little spice -- that's all you need. Not whatever the red stuff was. Ick. I also tried tortilla soup on the lunch visit, and didn't care for that either. 

The service was accommodating both times, especially for our large dinner group, so that also ranks the extra star. But really, in my heart, it's two for a bad taco.
