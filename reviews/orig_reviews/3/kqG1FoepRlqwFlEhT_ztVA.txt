Let me start by saying the food here is definitely 5 stars...but the customer service is one. I call to place a to go order on Sunday's and this is the third time they have been incredibly rude. They speak very condescending and act as if when you are calling it is a burden on their life. Too bad too since the food is great they should try being a little more welcoming to their customers.
