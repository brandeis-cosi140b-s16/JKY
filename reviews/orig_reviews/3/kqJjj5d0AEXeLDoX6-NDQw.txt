Pretty good mexican food. My wife had the fish tacos which she liked and I liked the chorizo tacos. Nothing special, but a good dinner. My 4-year old also liked her cheese quesadilla (she's not ready to write her first yelp review yet).  

Would definitely come back for the drinks / bar - my wife really liked her peach margarita. The outdoor seating on the 3rd floor was also a plus (especially where it's hard to come by in Shadyside).
