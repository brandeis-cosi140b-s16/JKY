Came in on a Saturday night.....crickets!! We were the only ones there. The door is off to the side so glad it was propped open as we wouldn't have know it was open. Music going immediately greeted by bartender. Ordered the pomegranate fizz something. It was awful. Pomegranate juice instead of syrup would have made all the difference I think. My husband wanted a beer, they only have one on tap and don't offer Dos Equis amber. Strange since there a Spanish bar. We also tried they sangria sunrise, that was tasty. The bartender was great and made lots of suggestions. We must have brought a good vibe because after about 15-20 of being there it started to fill up. All the while he was on point with everyone. We ordered a  Siracha chicken sandwich on their reverse happy hour menu. It was basically a chicken sandwich with siracha on it. it was gross. So the menu needs work but bartender was attentive and suggestive with out being pushy. 

 Also gaming machines all around the bar......way too many. I don't gamble so when there's a lot of machines it makes me feel like I'm taking up someone's spot. I think they could take out half of them and still have a great flow of gaming. I don't know if it's offered but maybe some live entertainment on the weekends. We in Summerlin love a spot we can lounge, eat and drink with live entertainment.
