We've had much better and we've had much worse.  

For starters, the valet refused to valet our car.  Well done valet! Thankfully the hostess was friendly and our server was spectacular! Stellar service, truly.

The food: Tablemade guacamole was not great, very slimy and lime-y it lacked a truly fresh guacamole flavor.   Chips were light and delicious as was the smoky salsa.  The mexican chopped salad was decent but I HATED the dressing and needed a lighter vinaigrette instead of this cumin/mayo option.  Crab quesadilla was fantastic in all it's buttery, cheesy gooey glory It needed no salsa, no sour cream and definitly no guacamole.  My man had the Mexican meatball sandwich with jalape√±o/cheese bisque and it was apparently out of this world! 

All in all, I thought it was pretty good but I know when it comes to Mexican food in the south, I am nearly impossibly to please!
