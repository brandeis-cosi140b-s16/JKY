You really want this place to be good. You just know you're going to like it. The atmosphere is outstanding, tucked away in a convenient location in Myers Park, 10 minutes from home.Tacos, everyone loves Tacos. A great looking place with a great looking crowd. Unfortunately the food is mediocre and the service is non existant. Queso with Chorizo is one of my favorites, their's is so runny it drips all over the table when you try to eat it. Wrong Oyster tacos had two oysters....OK. All four in my party agreed their food was kind of boring. And the service is sort of a sweaty overworked crowd that is so disorganized you want to volunteer to help. Lot of missing in action and oh I forgots.  But the place looks just great. You really want to like it because its a great concept in a wonderful location. It wasn't expensive less than $100 for four with drinks. I expected to pay twice that for such a cool looking place, but then I expected it to live up to the hype. I would rather pay double some where else. Friends said it was overrated, listen to your friends.
