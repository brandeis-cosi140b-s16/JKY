I went to Hecho before seeing Kà.  I had a reservation for 5 PM when they opened and I was seated in a short time.  I was taken to the back left of the restaurant.  I really like the way the place has been changed.  The large room has been subdivided into several smaller areas that keep the noise to a minimum and also give you a feel of being in a smaller place than it is.

Complimentary chips and two salsas were brought.  The chips were nondescript and the salsas were OK.  The green tomatillo wasn't as flavorful as the red which also had some spiciness to it.

I started with pozole.  It was good tasting.  I was surprised that the corn had been not left whole but had been chopped.  I guess it's just their way but I hadn't seen pozole like this before.  There was a nice seasoning to the soup.

For the main course, I had pollo barracho, drunken chicken.  Along with the chicken were some mixed vegetables in a cream sauce and what I call and open face tamal.  The chicken was cooked and sliced and was served with a sauce that was more a tomatillo than a barracho.  There were no olives and there was no olive flavoring, something I expect with barracho.  The vegetables were good.  It was a mixture of carrot, corn, zucchini and tomato cubes  coated with a thick sauce.  I called it an open face tamal because the masa filling was placed on top of some fold corn husks and one didn't have to open the husks to get to the filling as you normally do.

Time for dessert and I got the raspberry tres leches.  The menu describes it as vanilla tres leche trifle with raspberry compote and a cinnamon sugar buñuelo (Mexican style).  The dessert was really good.  The trifle with the raspberry was great!

Service was good.  The pace was perfect.  There was ample time between courses.  I was never tapping my foot waiting for something to be brought, either.  My server checked on my several times while I was there and my iced tea was refilled without asking.
