Let's get straight to the point. This is one of the biggest burritos I've ever seen. Lol. Felt like I had a 5lb weight in my bag.  What I don't understand is why can't they put all the stuff into the burrito? I don't want my guacamole and sour cream on the side. What am I supposed to do...dip my burrito? Is this done for speed purposes? It's just weird. Having enchilada sauce on a burrito is also weird. Turns everything into a wet mess! I like burritos because it's a handheld meal...not when it's covered in sauce and cheese.  Even though most of that was complaining, it didn't taste so bad.  Lol. Picked up a veggie burrito and it lasted me a couple days...that doesn't happen in chipotle.  Will I return? It's open late so most likely.
