Very average dishes. Bland rice. No refried beans with the steak dinner, however the bowl of beans was very well spiced and good. The steak itself was decent. My sister said her enchiladas verdes were very good. I had a combination plate of a tostada, taco, and enchilada. It was all okay.

Relocated here from Chicago and we are still on the search for a real good taqueria that serves up some carne asada that is tender, well seasoned, and juicy. The food here is passable but it's not great enough for us to want to return. However, it is probably better than others in the area so give it a try.
