Everything about this place was mediocre. The service was friendly enough but not overly here to service you attitude. We arrived for lunch and the whole restaurant had maybe two tables and the hostess still told us it would be a 10 minute wait. Then we asked her if we would have to wait if we just ate at the bar and she said no, so we went to the bar. I asked the bartender what was good and she recommended the shrimp quesadillas , so I ordered that and a Strawberry Agave Margarita which was very sour but I liked it. On the menu it says its made with fresh ingredients. Once we got our drink that's when the waiting began, it was probably a half an hour later that our food arrived. So thank goodness for the complimentary chips and salsa. I can't say I was a huge fan of the salsa but I'm glad they had something while we waited for the food. The Shrimp quesadillas were good. but lacked ingredient especially for the price. We had also ordered a chicken fajitas but it was bland and I was not impressed! They had very cute dishware though and again not a lot of food for the price. 
Overall I wasn't hangover nor was I getting tanked, so this place just didn't hit the spot for me. I might go back if it was a different occasion , but I doubt it.
