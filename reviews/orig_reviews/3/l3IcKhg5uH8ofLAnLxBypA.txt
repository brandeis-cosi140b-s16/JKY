Excellent value for money Mexican on the strip.
The decoration and atmosphere is great (makes you feel like you are around in mexico, not far form the beach), super friendly staff.

4.95 for a breakfast is unbeatable. 0.99c spicy bloody marries are killer.
Good margaritas as well.

Very good hangover cure place for those staying around MGM! Highly recommended!
