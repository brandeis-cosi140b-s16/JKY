of all frank scibelli's culinary magnets in charlotte, this is my favorite.

cantina 1511 is a really fun place to eat.  an extensive drink menu, colorful d√©cor, and an eye-catching wall mural of "gone with the wind" in spanish all make for an eclectic mix of quirky and predictable.

the food is reliably good, and it's not your average mexicamerican masquerading as latin american cuisine.  the utilization of atypical spices, sauces, pickles, and other unusual accoutrements showcase the chef's savvy.  this is definitely not your middling shredded meat, rice, and beans dinner.

the "top shelf" guacamole is great, and i'm a fool for the tacos.  i usually mix and match them to my heart's content.  the milanese and the roasted chicken tacos are especially cross-eyed inducing.

i eat here relatively frequently, and i've had the occasional bummer server, but they are few-and-far-between.  if there ever is a problem, i notice that the manager takes care of it quite quickly.

on a sour note, i brought a vegan friend here, and chicken mysteriously wound up in her meal after we sent it back to the kitchen on three separate occasions.  the manager was very apologetic, but i was extremely frustrated to see such a simple error occur multiple times in succession.

parking sucks here on the weekend, but if you can get over having to look for a spot or fork over the money for valet, you're definitely in for a night of good fun and wonderful food.

if you're not disgustingly full after dinner, please try the desserts.  the chef's variation of tres leches is delicious and very shareable.

hat's off for the umpteenth time, maestro scibelli.
