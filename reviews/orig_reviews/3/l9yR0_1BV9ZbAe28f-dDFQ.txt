If this New Mexico style restaurant was in New Mexico, it would not be open.Although it is not the worst place for Mexican food, it is easy to see why this is one of few places you dont have to wait for a table on busy nights.

Tonight our service was decent and the food was ok, just as expected. The hot salsa is way better than the mild and the bean dip is tasty with a spicy kick. I ordered the NM style red which was tasty but had no heat to it. I regret ordering the Margarita because it was too sweet and had zero tequila flavor. I can't stand when you pay for a Margarita and get triple sec over ice. 
The total for five (3 kids and 2 adults) was $67 (not including tip) for the meal, 2 beers and a no tequila margarita. Our money could have probably been spent better elsewhere. The best part of the meal was not waiting for a table.
