I liked the food here. Jose Andres is very creative, and I have enjoyed all of his restaurants that I have been to, thus far. Highlights were the pork belly sandwich (in indian bread). Please order this, especially if you like pork belly. The other highlights was the carnitas taco. For drinks, if you like a little kick/smoke to your margarita, then get the one with the "special rim". I also had the salt air margarita, which is fun and tasty, but I actually preferred the special rim. Hmm, that sounds strange to say. Oh, and queso fundido was pretty good. 

Don't order the 22 dollar expensive seafood noodle dish. Not worth it. Also, the scallop shu mai was just okay. My friend and I tried 2 desserts, and neither were impressive. I ordered the mango with sticky rice. Well, there is no rice. They put what tastes like rice krispies on the top. Fail.  

Service was good. Very friendly young male server.  But, I hated the seating there. Most seats have no back to them, and they are very uncomfortable. Good thing it doesn't take long to eat here.
