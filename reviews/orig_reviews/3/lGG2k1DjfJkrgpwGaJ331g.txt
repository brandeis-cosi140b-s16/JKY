Bar area has nice seating outside (with heaters and real sand). It has much more ambience than inside the restaurant. When we sat down outside I wasn't too sure about the service. Had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to come by our table and no one was sure who our waitress was but things quickly improved. Fun happy hour from 3 to 7 with all appetizers 1/2 price and drink specials. We had 2 orders of  the queso dip we liked it so much. Shrimp tacos are unique and a "must try". Maybe a little younger crowd but fun for all ages.
