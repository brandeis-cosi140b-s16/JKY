Good little place to grab a bite. Too bad the 'town square' it's located in is just one street. The rest is empty lots and dirt. Economy of course...what can you do. Service was good, staff friendly. Chips, salsa and bean dip, gratis of course. Had one good salsa, decent flavor. Me and my girlfriend shared the carnitas for 2 and let me say this, you could probably feed 4 people with this bad boy. Huge! Meat was good, not greasy like the carnitas at another local place ~cough~ macayos ~cough~ Rice was typical, nothing really too special, beans were good. Overall good, nothing to crazy spectacular.
