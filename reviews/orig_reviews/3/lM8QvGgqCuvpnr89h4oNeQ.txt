I came here for lunch on Friday.  It was pretty quiet- only a couple other people eating.  I had the chicken quesadilla and what was supposed to be a carne asada taco with no onions.  Prices were fairly low and the food came rather quickly.  First off, they messed up my order as the taco wasn't carne asada.  Then when I sent it back and it returned, the meat was carne asada, but was covered in onions.  By this point, I was over it, so I didn't bother to send it back a third time- just didn't eat it.  

I was expecting more from this place because of all of the rave reviews.  To be honest, my quesadilla was really oily (on the outside!) and extremely bland. It was missing heat, spice, anything to liven up the taste.  

Overall, I wasn't too impressed and doubt I'll be back. It just wasn't all that.
