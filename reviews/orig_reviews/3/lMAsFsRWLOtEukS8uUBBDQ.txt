This place would be absolutely perfect if It weren't for the bad customer service! The food is great! And prices are reasonable, however you will wait because, they have too few servers. 
The restaurant has a very authentic Mexicax feel and its very cold so bring a light sweater. 
It always is very kid friendly.
