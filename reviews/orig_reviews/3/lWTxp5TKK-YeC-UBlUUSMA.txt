I did like this restaurant in its old location and I miss some of the homey-ness of the old building, I think that they certainly lost a lot on the atmosphere monitor when they moved. The new location is roomier, but not as nice.  Surprisingly, that does make a bigger difference than you would think.  The old location had booths which were almost private, a big fountain in the middle of the room, and some charm which made up for the fact that the food was about middle of the road.  It was a "family" place for us when the kids were growing up, and I haven't been back since the first try since they moved.  There are just too many other choices.  I don't DISLIKE it, but it's really not as special. They have the standard combination plates/rice/beans/red sauce, but not as many unusual offerings as, say, Michocan on DI, so I think they are falling behind the leaders as more come on the scene.
