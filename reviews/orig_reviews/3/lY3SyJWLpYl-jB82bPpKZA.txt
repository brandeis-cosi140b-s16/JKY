Border Grill isn't anything mind-blowing & I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there but it's a solid option if grabbing a bite while at Mandalay Bay. In my case, I like to make reservations there before events. The service is lukewarm but not bad. The chips, salsas & guacamole are yummy... as are the chicken enchiladas & quesadillas. But both flavors of rice & the black beans are quite bland. The restaurant itself is kinda cool, with several different dining areas with different personalities.
