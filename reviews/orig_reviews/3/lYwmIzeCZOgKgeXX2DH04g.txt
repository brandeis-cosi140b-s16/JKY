Cafe Rio strikes me as morph of Rubio's decor and Chipotle's (slightly expanded) menu. It was clean, brightly colored and the service was quick.

I ordered the Sweet Pork Barbacoa Burrito (pictured) and found the title to be spot on. I was a bit put off by the sweetness of it, finding the sauce to taste like an extra sweet BBQ sauce. It completely overpowered the flavor of the meat. The pico de gallo topping would have been just average, but I must say the diced tomatoes were ripe and tasted just off the vine.

Be aware, the acoustics of the restaurant and the music over speakers make for a loud environment. I couldn't even hear the employees' questions!

There are so many dining options in the area that I'm not sure I'll return. If I do, I'll steer clear of the sweet sauce, but give the yummy raspberry lemonade another swig!
