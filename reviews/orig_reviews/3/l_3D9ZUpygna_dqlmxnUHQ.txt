3 Stars for a dirt bar that knows it's a dirt bar.  There is no Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde here, only a cheap Hyde that loves to peak at the waitresses' whaletails and a decent Happy Hour special on Mexican beer.  That's all.  

I guess my one gripe would be that every guy is a tough guy at this place. Really.  I used to have it as my Happy Hour destination, and it was pretty good for that, but once the darkness sets in, the real Scottsdale lunatics emerge!  

(Oh, and it's obvious that the owners rake in a ton of money and are the greediest bastards under the sun for not changing simple things like the water misters that spew water constantly.  Ladies, don't wear anything nice to this place because the seats are stained from the misters and tough guy sweat.)
