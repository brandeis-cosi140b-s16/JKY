My wife wanted to go to the Bodies exhibit next door to T&T and I decided to come here for a drink or two.  They had an early happy hour that started at 2:00PM which was a plus.  They had $5 Dos Equis, $5 well drinks and $5 HH appetizers.

One thing that they didn't have on HH was margaritas.  I asked the bartender about this and in a nice condescending tone she stated that they only have the highest quality tequilas and they can't waste any of it in some cheap margaritas.  I looked at the HH menu and they had $5 Jose Cuervo shots.  Couldn't you make them with Jose Cuervo since when I last checked Cuervo was an inexpensive tequila.  Go figure.

The food wasn't bad, had the nachos that were topped with melted cheese, black beans and jalepenos.
