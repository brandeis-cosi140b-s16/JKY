This was my first time eating here. I was a little confused on how to order. The signs aren't exactly clear. I had the steak nachos and they were pretty good. I brought my 4 yr old granddaughter and was very happy that I was able to order her a kids cheese quesadilla and it was free! I've had better mexican food but this was not too bad for a quick bite. Service was good.
