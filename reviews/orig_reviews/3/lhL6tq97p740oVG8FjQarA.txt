Z'Tejas is not a place I would go out of my way for in terms of the straight-up quality of the food. It's somewhere between ok and good.
I've tried a few of the entr√©es but none of them really stick in the memory. The cornbread is good.
I do end up there alot for after work margaritas and the Tejas Trio (chips with quac, salsa and queso). The chips are good.
Also I wish they were open later. It's hard to find a quiet place in this hood that's open late night.
Also, I've ended up having some pretty great conversations at this place and that must mean something... they just haven't been conversations about food.
