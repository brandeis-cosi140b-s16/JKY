Sigh. I hate to do this because I love, excuse me, LOVED Nacho Daddy. I hadn't had the chance to go in awhile and when I was finally able to go pick up some food, I was disappointed at how the prices had skyrocketed. It was Wrestlemania night and I went to grab some chips and salsa and queso to-go. I believe the queso went from around $6 to $9. That's fine, I guess, but I think I'll go to a mexican restaurant and get it cheaper. Additionally, when you get it to-go you get it in small container. Okay, fine, but at least fill it up. If I'm paying that much for a small container, the least you could do is fill it up! The salsa was a bit on the salty side too. It looked like pretty much everything on the menu had gone up, so beware if you haven't been in awhile. I'm sure I will still go back(not for to-go), it just won't be as often as before.
