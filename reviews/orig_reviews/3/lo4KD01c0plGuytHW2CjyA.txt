Stopped by as i left town for lunch and was delighted to find a Mexican place serving soy chorizo.  Then I got even more excited, because they have a version of Tiramisu made with tequila.  As disgusting as that might sound, I could not WAIT to put it in my mouth-hole.

Sadly, they were out of both items.  Completely out.

That's not why this place has 3 stars, however.  It's a perfectly fine Mexican restaurant, but it's a little pricey for the kind and amount of food you get.  I got tacos that, normally, I could get with better ingredients from my local food truck - and I'd get three tacos instead of 2!  Also, the menu makes pains to express "Lettuce and tomato is not normally part of a traditional Mexican cuisine, but can be added per request."  To me, this sounds like a kind of snobby authenticity game that is meant to shame the consumer.  Maybe I was being overly sensitive at the time and reading into things.  But, if you want to make traditional style food, just do it.  Don't apologize.  Perhaps their clients had a lot of complaints or something, but, again, if you just put it out there, the customers you want will come.

Otherwise, it was a nice meal.  A great selection of salsas of unique varieties.  I don't think that I'd head back, though, because nothing was that memorable - and the strip district has much more to offer.
