After driving down Gilbert rd and seeing the infamous barrio queen sign, I immediately told my partner that we were going there instead of another taco place around the corner.

Barrio queen is a place that is always on lists to try and I knew it would be my chance that Tuesday night! 

We got seated immediately, and our server was nice. They weren't that busy and I ordered a margarita, the spicy one, de los muertos, it was okay. Not really the spice I was looking for. But since it was Tuesday we both ordered three tacos each, and the table side guacamole that was divine. The guac was fast. My food came out after twenty minutes. Then my partners food came out five minutes later...the issue was it wasn't his food. The orders got mixed up, which was the food runners fault. The table behind us got my boyfriends order and my boyfriend got their order. It took a bit to track a server down and when we did the table behind us got their food (as my boyfriend didn't touch it) and then we waited for his. 

I will say that it was nice of the manager to comp my boyfriends tacos! And the tacos themselves were definitely tasty. We'll be back and hopefully I can give them a better rating because I really do like the food! Just the food runners and wait times for food were less than stellar.
