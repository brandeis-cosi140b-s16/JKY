Hmmm . . . The quality seems to be diminishing at Chevy's.  Can't exactly describe it, but the "Fresh Mex" just hasn't seemed as fresh lately.  Too bad, as they used to be terrific.  Hard to describe what exactly it was.  Seemed like the beans were a little older, like they'd been overnight in the fridge.  The meat was a little drier and bouncier than it used to be.  The food just didn't taste as . . . well . . .. "fresh" as it used to.

Even their formerly amazing salsa had a bitter aftertaste that it didn't used to have.

Worst of all, last two times we stopped in they'd stopped making watermelon margaritas for the season.  

They're still pretty good, but we really hope they'll get back to the food quality they had last spring.  Chevy's used to be one of our favorite feeds, but if Chevy's doesn't  get their act together pretty quick we may have to give up on 'em and move on.
