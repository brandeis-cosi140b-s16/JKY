I pass by this place EVERY day on the way to work and I've always been curious if it was good or not. My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.

This time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.

I am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.

This joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all.
