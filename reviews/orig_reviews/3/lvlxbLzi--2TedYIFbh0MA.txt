Always tasty and delicious! I'm a huge fuzzys fan back home in Dallas! The soft tacos with chicken or pork are my favorite, and you can't go wrong with queso or salsa with chips (with the famous Fuzzy dust!)

This location seems to take a little longer to get your meal, and the service is not as welcoming as the Dallas locations. I also think they could have more outdoor space! Set up is kind of weird.
