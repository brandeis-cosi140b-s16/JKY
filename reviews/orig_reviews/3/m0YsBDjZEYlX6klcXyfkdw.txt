I really wanted this to be a five star rating; but alas the decor and ambience didn't make up for mediocre food. I ordered fish tacos with the understanding they were made with grilled grouper.  When I could find the fish (a search was required because of the mounds of lettuce and cheese) it was a piece of gray matter that was passing as fish. I will give kudos to the waiter;  he was attentive and knowledgeable but my daughter's margaritas was all mix and he offered no apology or explanation. There are too many good Mexican restaurants in Gilbert;  avoid this one.
