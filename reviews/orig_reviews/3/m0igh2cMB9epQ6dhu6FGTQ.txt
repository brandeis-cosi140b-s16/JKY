Meh. When it comes to Mexican food, I'd rather have something a bit less fancy.

We had just come back from the ACM Awards show in the MGM, were starving,  wanting Mexican food, dressed up fancy, and this was right in front of us. So we went and it was ok. It looked nice inside, but the lights were so dim I could barely see my food in front of me. 

Food was also a bit meh. My friend and I split an enchilada entree, ordered a guacamole appetizer, two drinks (Margarita & a Michelada), and it came out to $65. Ouch. The enchiladas were fine, but I've had better for a lot less moolah. However, I would definitely come back just for the guac! Made right in front of you (entertainment value) and probably one of the most delicious I've ever had. So I guess it evened out with the enchiladas.

Overall, ok place. The drinks were strong (unless it was just the lack of food & sleep?) and service was super friendly. I'd skip it next trip, unless I was craving some mighty fine guacamole.
