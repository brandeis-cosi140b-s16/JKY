I'm writing to give this three stars because as a whole it is A'Ok.  Vegas is all about the glitz and bright lights and most of the restaurants around the strip are pretty pricey. 

This is a great place to stop into if you are looking for something a little less expensive.  The food is decent.  I ordered a steak salad and it was better than the one that i order at the Sugar Factory.

Good service, but it's a little small of a space so probably not good for groups.
