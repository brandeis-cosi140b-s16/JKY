I now can no longer eat guacamole without orange slices mixed in it!  Oh wait no.... that's not true but that is how Salt and Lime serves it. The queso fundido was a complete disaster. It came out bright yellow and looked and tasted like nacho cheese from a gas station.  If anything it was a fondue not a fundido. 

The service was the best part of the meal. Everyone was very friendly and we got fast service. I felt like we were well attended for. 

The burrito I didn't care for but my 8 year old liked it. The shrimp and carne asada fajitas saved the meal. They were very good. The vegetables tasted very fresh and the flour tortillas were excellent. The street corn side was also tasty.

All in all I wanted to give this place 2.5 stars but it wouldn't let me. It probably deserved 2 given the price but I couldn't bring myself to do i it.
