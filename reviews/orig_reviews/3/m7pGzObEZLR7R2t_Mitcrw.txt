The food and the service was fantastic.  My grip is about the margaritas.  They were horrible.   Three of us tried different on the rocks specials and all tasted exactly the same.. sour or bad mix or something.   I ordered one with Grand Mariner.. couldnt taste it at all.  Figured it was fluke.. ordered another one with a "floater".. nothing.. tasted exactly the same as the other one.. maybe worse.     Typically a floater comes on the side and you pour it in yourself.   For a mexican or texmex place.. bad drinks.

the place was great for food, atmosphere and service though
