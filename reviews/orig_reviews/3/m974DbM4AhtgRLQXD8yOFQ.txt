This place is cute and eccletic. We took out of town guests here because frankly we aren't into the 'chain' of Mexican restaurants in the valley. The restaurant area is actually small but there is a ton of seemingly wasted 'bar' area space in the courtyard. Jon Taffer would turn that upside down and have that area hopping with tequila specials! Great food; Great menu; Great decor. You get one smallish basket of chips though and then you are charged. It's on the menu and yeah maybe us dumb American's should pay attention to those details, but cmon! Really??? So get ready because extra chips;$1. Extra salsa; $1. Hmmmm. That's a bit lame. Oh well, the silver lining is that you don't fill up or expand your muffin top before dinner, right? The other kicker is that this place is not open on Mondays! We always just call before driving over there. Several times we have tried to give this place our money and patronage and they are closed. SO, take my advice, call and be sure. Strong margs. Hot salsa. I like it! Good food and generous portions. Sent back a plate because it was wet and had 'residual' on it. Ick. The queso app was a little coagulated too; pass on that next time. Sour cream for the enchiladas on the side.. here we go again. Bam.$2. Seriously! That buys an entire 16oz. container at your local friendly grocer! All in all I really liked the place. It's fails are all fixable. Clean dishes; don't charge your guests for chips that cost you very little; and enough with the being closed all the time! Oh yeah open that patio up.. DRINKS!!!
