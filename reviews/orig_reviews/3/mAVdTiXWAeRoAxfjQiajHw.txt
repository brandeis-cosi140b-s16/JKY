I live 5 minutes from the valle luna mex. restaurant.  I have eaten their numerous times because of locality and party invitations.  I have never been crazy about their food.  It is" valley of the sun sonoran style mexican food"  but it just doesn't hit the spot with me.  They have a big following, crowded all the time.  Alot of the reason is they run specials tuesday (reduced price for seniors) and wed. (family nite).  I think some of the reason I don't care for the place is I have been treated poorly 3 times in the past.  Have you ever noticed that a place that has alot of business tend not to go out of their way to make you feel special?  Well if I'm going to spend alot of money and make them money  I expect more than the food, I expect service and made to feel that I'm important and they are willing to go out of their way to make me happy.  Unfortunately I don't get that feeling from the waitresses or the management.  But, there is always a but, if you like fajitas, I think they have the best around and on wed. you can get the single for 10 bucks.  They have really jacked up the price the last few years.  1 order is usually enough for 2., but if your really hungry, don't order the double, order 2 singles, I think its a better deal.  So now instead of turning left to valle, I turn right and go to Manuels on cave creek, better food, better service.  Oh and sit in the bar eddie the bartender is a crack up.   Bob: and there you have the truth.  Ciau.
