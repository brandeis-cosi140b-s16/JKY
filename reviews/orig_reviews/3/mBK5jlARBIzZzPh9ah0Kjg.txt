In the blistering heat at more than 100 degrees that Las Vegas had to offer, I was in dire need to find a drink to start my vacation and get something in my tummy.
We planned on another spot, but it looked so pathetic we ran off in the other direction.
Into  the heat again, we came across a pretty devil woman figure on top of the restaurant. Looked good to us.
The guacamole was ok, but they cheated us on the quantity by layering tortilla chips on the bottom.
The quesadilla was simple but past my gooey cheesy test.
Margaritas were strong and refreshing.
The best is the spinning wheel for HH. I got to spin the wheel and "accidentally" landed on the $5 silver patron shots....wow, exactly what I wanted. So after 2 shots of patron and a pitcher of margaritas, we headed to our hotel room to take a 4 hour nap..;)
