If you're looking for a place to grab some simple, inexpensive comfort food and are in north central phoenix, this place is worth a stop. The Tacos de Pescado satisfied my fish-taco craving and the Oaxacan Hotdog just screamed "try me!!". Including avacado, bacon, jalepenos, grilled onions and a tasty sauce, this is not a traditional hot dog and doesn't claim to be. At the price, it's definitely worth a try. 
While the presentation isn't fancy, each order seemed prepared with care, and most likely brought to your table by the owner operator. 
The seating area isn't large, or very cozy, but with the attention this place seems to be getting, I'd have to imagine the owner has planned for expansion and/or improvements. It's definitely a taco stand to watch for. 
Plan accordingly if you'd like to wash down your meal with a Corona (or a can of PBR), and bring it yourself. This establishment is currently BYOB.
