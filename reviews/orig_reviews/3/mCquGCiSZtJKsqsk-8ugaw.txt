We ate here in July 2013. I heard great things about their nachos. They really were good!! However, after being blown away by the nachos, I was a little disappointed with our main entree. I wasn't sure, but the rice and beans weren't as good as other places.... but this might be a location thing. 

I will definitely go back to just eat nachos!
