Don't like this location! Rude staff and they are always out of everything! I feel like Cafe Rio used to be great but now they use cheap ingredients and don't take the time to make it right. My mom actually just took back her salad- which is not like her- because it was so sloppy...sadness! Miss the old way cafe rio was!
