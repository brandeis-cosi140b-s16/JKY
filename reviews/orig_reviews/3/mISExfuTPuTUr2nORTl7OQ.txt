Good nachos, solid salsa, good happy hour margarita (I think they call it "the original")... Dos Equis 2 for 1s...

Attentive service, but confusing as hell on the billing. Nachos were a happy hour special, they asked what meat we wanted so we said chicken  but on the side, since one of us was vegetarian. Little did we know, that would cost us $2 extra. Not a biggie, but still. Seriously? That shouldn't be a surprise to your guest when they unexpectedly actually look at the bill you probably don't want them to look at. The Dos Equis were more than expected because apparently the "special" at the bar did not apply during happy hour. What the hell!? Still cheaper than they would've been regularly, but that's sort of weird...

They were cool about it though, and we'd go back.
