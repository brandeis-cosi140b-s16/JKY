While this place is good, it's doesn't bring the Bonito Michoac√°n wow factor.  There's nothing wrong with the place, it just failed to live up to the overload of editorial hype in every locals magazine.  We stopped in on a Friday night around 8 about 2 months after they opened, and there was a 40 minute wait.  It took 20 minutes to get our beer order.   The presentation and delivery of our carnitas fajitas for 2 was fantastic; they flambe them.  And whoooosh!  A giant ball of flames erupts over the serving dish.
