For this to be the right fit it depends on what kind of mexican food you are looking for. It kind of fits into the Chipotle, Baja Fresh Rubio's world but selling point is farm raised organic etc etc. So slightly smaller portion slightly higher price but all good food . I have had both steak and chicken burritos and both were on par with restaurants mentioned above maybe even slightly better. You pay the premium for higher quality ingredients but not such a premium in taste.
