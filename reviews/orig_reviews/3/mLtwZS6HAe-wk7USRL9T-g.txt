Great drinks, good service and food.  Not inexpensive, but a nice meal and experience. Took the waiter's suggestion for a mushroom queso dish as appetizer and it was good--melted gooey  cheese. Had grilled fish taco platter and roasted pork platter.  Both were very good.  If you have sodium sensitivity, expect your rings to be a little tight.   kids had burritos, which were great.  Enjoyed the drink offerings and atmosphere.
