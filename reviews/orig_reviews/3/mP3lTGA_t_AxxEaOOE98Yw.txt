last nites nightmare just confirms my dining out on a Saturday  is for the very patient . some friends are in town and they wanted to go here for dinner ,mind you the setting is quaint and the food is good (not killer) but good we showed up right at prime dining time ...well at least east valley dining time 630 ish and the place was packed ..we decided to go for it only because our guests were wanting to eat here ..fine i have no problem i decided to go with the flow after a hard day of working and a bitchy wife ragging in my ear . i gave the very nice young lady our name and she says ...it will be a 45 minute wait.....i NEVER wait more than 5 minutes ,45 minutes  OK I'm going with the flow as we stood there for 20 minutes i asked one of the employs if we could get some chips and salsa while we waited  ..he says   I DON'T KNOW...??? i said can you check he walked away and  then when he returned he 
said yes its 3 dollars ...i said is that the same chips and salsa you get for free at the table ???yes he said hmmmm never mind its not the 3 dollars its the principle. we were finally seated after some more confusion on what table we were to be seated at ,we were brought water and that FREE bowl of chips and two small ramicans of salsa  and then we sat for another 10/15 minutes before our server got to take our order ,she says look s like your ready to order ....YOU THINK! as we sat there for another 30 minutes waiting for our food i was bound and determined to get my fill of those free chips and salsa although it looked like they were starting to ration the salsa since i had to ask 3 times for more salsa. The table next to us were seated before us and we got our food first they were starting to get a little pissy ,they asked for somthing to hold them over and the wait person said the only way to get ??? was to order ???  the women said just forget it and asked for the manager .the manager came to there table and said were serving over 700 dinners tonite like it was those damn customers fault this table had not got there food and told them there was 4 tickets in front of theres but there food should be up in the next 15 minutes .....wow really maybe bring this table the bean dip or whatever it was as a justure of CUSTOMER SERVICE....CHIPS SALSA RING A BELL ... ok i cant be to harsh on them it was a zoo but i really think they need to work on there customer service a little more
