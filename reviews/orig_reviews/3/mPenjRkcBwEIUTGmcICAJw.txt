Good basic Mexican food,  nothing really outstanding or really spicy.  Group of 5 so we had quite a variety of meals. All were good, stick with the Mexican rice and skip the  "cheesy potatoes " which seemed more like grits than Mexican food.  Service was slow, we were told the kitchen was slow because of a big group in the rest of the place. We ate chips and salsa almost until we were in danger of needing to skip the meal.  They did bring out lots and kept the drinks filled so it wasn't the wait staff delaying the food.
