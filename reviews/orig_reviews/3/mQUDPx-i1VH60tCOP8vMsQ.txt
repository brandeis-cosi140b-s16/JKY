30 minute wait on a Friday turned into 90.  I'm not saying that is something i don't expect on a busy weekend night, but if it's 90, tell me 90 or something close to it.  I walked over to a Wendy's and ate a hamburger so i didn't expire during the wait.  Service was good, food was excellent and fresh Mexican fare. The margarita flight special at 15.00 dollars equates to a 21oz margarita. Not a great deal and a bit showy for my taste. Variety is the spice, but I can do one margarita at a time if it costs half as much.
