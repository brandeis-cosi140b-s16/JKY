Another Average Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas.....


Dona Maria's is the lovely green eyesore resting near a strip of wedding chapels in the downtown area.  It advertises itself as a Tamales restaurant, but features quite a bit more on the menu.

The best Tamales I've had were wealthy with flavor, prepared with love, and sturdy without being dry.  My excitement for Dona Maria's tamales was met with disappointment, because really they were nothing special.  

I had the Red and the Green tamales.  While both were alright, they lacked vivid flavor and reminded me of lots of Americanized Mexican cuisine in the valley:  good enough.  The flavors in each were a muddles mix of Mexican staples (onion, chili, paprika, etc..)  I wanted to love these tamales, but really wouldn't return for them. 

I also had the Enchiladas Mole.  The mole was rich without being chalky or powdery, suggesting it was made from scratch and not a prepackaged mix.  It tasted more of cocoa than the chiles, which for me was less than wonderful.  I like my mole to be both smoky, spicy, and rich with a touch of sweetness, and these were mostly sweet.  


I can't say that I had a bad meal, since the service was spot on, and the staff was friendly, but the food left a lot to be desired.
