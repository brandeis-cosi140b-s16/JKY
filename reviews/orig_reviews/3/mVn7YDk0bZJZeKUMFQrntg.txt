I went last night for dinner with friends -- however the mariachi band was playing, and was super loud (so if you're wanting to talk and have conversation with your fellow dinees, don't go on Mondays between 6-7pm).  Thankfully they only played for the first 20 minutes of our outing and we were all able to catch up! 
My first impression was a fancier Tacos El Gordo (still my number 1) with smaller portions.  The food overall was a tad salty for my liking, but then again I like sodium in low doses. 

I ordered two chicken tortas with everything (this included onions, pico de gallo, and guacamole - which was amazing).  They were small but delicious and reasonably priced.  With this I ordered a side of chips and guacamole (because you can never have too much guac) and the serving was a large quantity and every one at the table was able to enjoy -- although, like mentioned before, a tad too salty for me. 

Overall, I enjoyed the venue (modern, artsty) and the ambiance was nice.  I'll probably be back but this won't become a regular spot. 

PS. I wish they didn't use paper and Styrofoam cases and plates....so bad for the environment and I don't think they recycle. ):
