I Chino'd your Bandido! 
Translation: You sunk a rock into my belly 

Fun concept (they can explain), mediocre to good food. 

Pros: 
- They let you sample their most popular meats 
- 2 tastes in one (Mexican and Asian fusion) 
- The Panda has a Mexican style mustache (almost got them 4 stars)! 

Cons: 
- The food is ok, and sits like a rock in your gut 
- Atmosphere in the dining room is nonexistent 

The best meat was the Jen Red Pork. 

This is a place I would definitely recommend to try once, especially since it so light on the wallet. However, once will be enough for me.
