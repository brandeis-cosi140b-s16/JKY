I stopped by here on a recent trip to Vegas.  One afternoon we were tried of the expensive and heavy meals and decided some cheap tacos sounded perfect.  There was a little bit of a line, but it went fast.  I got the taco plate with rice and beans, opting for beef, but they had lots of options they all looked good.  My husband got just fish tacos.  We enjoyed all the tacos, the rice and beans were bland.  There was plenty of room outside to sit.  Not the best tacos you will ever have (at least not when compared to Texas), but I recommend it for a nice, quick, cheaper meal if you get tired of all the fancy, excess of Vegas or need a good hangover cure.
