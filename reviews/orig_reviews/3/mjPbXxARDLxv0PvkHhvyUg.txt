Right not a Mexican joint... Because Mexicans don't eat Duck....For tequila 5 stars. Great tequila choices. Mmmm Bloody Maria....Beautiful place. Great Crowd. Nice atmosphere. The food is..eh mediocre. What is this Mexican fusion. I'm sorry Mexican food is great but when you make it Duck Quesadilla? What about Mole Beef and broccoli? The thing with mexican food is...Jalisco, Oaxaca areas...food is more complex than TJ or Ensenada. Ok but give me a dollar fish taco any day. If I want mexican. I want barbacoa, or cabeza, etc...What next duck tacos? Are there even ducks in Mexico? So I'm kinda on the fence with this place. Maybe I'll go home and make house special fried rice and beans with some kung pao carne....So the bar and decor was made in mexico. If it wasn't asians that made it....it's asians that designed it.
