First time I came here the nachos and beer were bomb. Came back two weeks later to show my friends and husband (out of towners) and it was a disappointment. Kitchen was behind 25-30 minutes according to the bartender. Which is cool whatever we'll get beers. Tried ordering a Dos and they were out so we tried ordering a Tecate and the tap was frozen. So we stuck with bottles of Tecate instead. I was bummed because the food, beer and service were great a few weeks before. Kind of looked like an idiot for talking it up to everyone. 

P.S. Picture I posted was from the first time I went
