We came here while waiting for Carrot Top and it was average at best. It's located on the 2nd floor in the Luxor across from all the shows. I'm assuming it gets a lot of business due to location not quality. First off, the good is way too expensive. 20 bucks a plate?!?!? It's Mexican Food. It's really just Mexican Food and taste like average at best. The bartenders we had did rock which helped my review, and the drinks we had were well made but for the price, I would hope for better food. I will skip this place next time, but if you don't mind spending 20 bucks on tacos then this will be the place for you.
