Only time of many that have been here and a bit displeased. Four couples at hi-tops in lounge. My burrito hatch green chili pork was great. Wife loved the con queso. Took a lot of begging to get the bills not that busy on Sunday eve. Two of the 4 bills were wrong. Chip/salsa lady did good job love the habenero salsa. Service was the downer tonite.
