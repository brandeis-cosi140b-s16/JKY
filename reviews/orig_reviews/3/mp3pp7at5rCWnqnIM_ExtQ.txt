Average inexpensive mexican place

Enchiladas are pretty good.

Their meats all taste strange for example, the carne asada comes in a watery sauce, FYI carne asade is supposed to be grilled!

I'm glad robertos exists for moments of desperation if I'm far from pepe's or komex is closed

Bottom line:      If you are leaving the club at 3AM and haven't found someone to hook up with, try Roberto's, you feel much better about not having any game.
