Good but not great.  I like the tacos, specifically the pastor and asada on white corn.  And the queso and guac are great.  I can't find anything else on the menu that is particularly good after so many visits.  I've tried the new things they have added but they just taste cheesy, not authentic.  I know they can do better...
