Cabo is a very busy place- even on a Tuesday night! Luckily we were a party of 2 and were seated pretty quick. The food tasted good and fresh, but I had very high expectations based on the reputation they have in Charlotte. I was hoping for a little more flavor.

Contrary to some of the other reviews, I didn't feel rushed even though they were jammin'. I went with a friend and we were catching up for quite a while, but our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us, which I appreciated. Parking can be difficult, like most places in NoDa, so plan to cruise around a little. 

Overall I think Cabo has a fun atmosphere for grabbing drinks and something to eat, but it isn't a "go out of your way" establishment.
