The food was average to be honest. I saw a few people talk about how good their salsa was... Really? Tomato  Paste salsa???? 
Little pricey too.
I have had worse but I have also had better. Took my family for dinner and had to break the piggy bank. I had something simple like a tostada.. Again nothing to write home about. I saw their Sunday buffet table and was dissapointed.  Service was slow.... I did like the beans and salsa with the chips until I tasted what they called Salsa.. I made better salsa last night at home. Like I said tomato paste has no business in salsa!
