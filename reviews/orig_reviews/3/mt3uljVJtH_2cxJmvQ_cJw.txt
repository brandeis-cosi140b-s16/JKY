I am a Cantina 1511 connoisseur so when it was suggested we go anywhere else for Mexican I was reluctant. However, it was good. 

Now... they don't compare in the frozen Margarita department but the Margarita on the rocks was very good. I just enjoy the frozen kind so Cantina wins hands down for me. The table side Guacamole was just as yummy though which pleased me cause I'm a fan. 

The bar staff was friendly. The place was clean. I didn't indulge more than the guac and the Margarita but I would go back again. I don't know that I would choose them as a new fav but it was a nice change up to the norm.
