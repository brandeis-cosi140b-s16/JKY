I really wanted Mexican food the day we flew in to Vegas. It' s just one of those things, you crave it and you have to have it. So I found this place, it had okay reviews so I decided to try it.

The restaurant had good ambiance. I thought we were going to be seated outside but we were sat inside which wasn't too bad. They have a huge projection screen where they were playing some channel I cannot remember. We were also next to the bar which looked to have a great selection of Tequila. 

I really wanted chicken flautas which they didn't have so I settled for crunchy chicken tacos. The server told us their sangrias were really good so I decided to try one of those too.

The sangria was actually pretty good, served with bits of green apple. That drink got me started for the night. 

The crunchy chicken taco plate came with three tacos, black beans, white lime rice with cilantro, charred tomatillo salsa, guacamole, and sour cream. Put that all together and it made for a yummy meal. I feel the chicken could have had more flavor and also the menu stated they made their own shells but they looked more like the Taco Bell variety which I wasn't expecting. 

A downer to this restaurant, no free chips and salsa and the food was a bit pricey for the food. We ordered one sangria, the chicken taco plate and a ceviche appetizer. The tab was $40! Not too much bang for the buck here. Many will say that's Vegas but a different dining experience totaling the same dollar amount the next evenings makes me say I beg to differ.
