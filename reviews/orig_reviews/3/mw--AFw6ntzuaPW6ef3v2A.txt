When I first moved to Phoenix I was so excited for great Mexican food, coming from New England, that shouldn't be too tall of an order. My initial search for "Best Mexican Food in Phoenix" actually brought back Macayo's (this was long before the days of Yelp). I tried Macayo's a few times and it was ok, then I moved on to greener pastures.

Fast forward 5 years, many mexican restaurants, and a major diet change and I am at Chase field enjoying a veggie burrito, beans, and rice all courtesy of Macayo's. I actually craved it the next day so finally we decided to head to the original location and give it a whirl.

The building is quite ugly but I liked that it at least seemed to have some character. The inside leaves some to be desired, the atmosphere just blows. I don't care if a place is kitschy or mildly tacky but the whole dining setup just feels awkward. The cantina actually looked a bit more lively but we still opted for the dining area. 

The waitress was actually very friendly and well rehearsed if nothing else, can't complain there. Come to find out they don't have the veggie burrito that I enjoyed so much at Chase Field! WTF?! The salsa here is good but the chips are kind of bland. The meal was decent but I kept wondering why I can't have what I had from the menu at Chase? My girlfriend's side of rice also tasted funky, again the Chase rice was much better - what is going on here?!

The best part of my meal was actually the house margarita. It was slightly sweet but had enough tequila in it and went down nicely.

I hate to say this but Chase Field food is actually better then this place, the sad and ironic part is it's the same restaurant!
