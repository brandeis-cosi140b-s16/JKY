Not a huge fan  of Mexican food, but this was my second  time and I think it's pretty good.
  My daughter got a chicken  quesadilla, which came with rice and chips. Not a bad size kids meal- wish they offered other things in a kids meal.
 I got the tacos with grilled chicken  I was pleased with it just wished they put a little bit more meat.
 Most of the people working were very friendly except one girl. Who was very rude when we were asking questions. My daughter left her purse on the chair and after calling the place as soon as we realized it they were able to hold on to it for us... thank goodness for honest people
