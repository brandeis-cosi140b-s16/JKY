Even though my husband and I have been here several times because it's the closest mexican restaurant to where we live...I will still give it 3 stars. Out of the about 6 or 7 times we've been there, food is always GREAT and Fresh...but unfortunately, we've never had great service. Either something is forgotten, they don't come around often enough to check on us, they bring out the wrong order, etc. I hate to only give this location 3 stars because the food is so good...but as far as the overall experience, I hate feeling "forgotten about" or a "burden" because I ask for a refill on my drink, then have to wait for 15 min to get it. : /
