So, after reading the reviews on Yelp, I took the lunch crew to America's Taco shop and found it to be pretty good. 

It's a small little house off 7th Street with a little, tiny entrance to their parking lot that can be hard to miss and easy to nail the sidewalk if you aren't careful (or I'm just a bad driver! :) There is parking in the back and you can also park on the side streets too. We were a pretty big group so finding a table to accommodate all of us was kind of annoying (survival of the fittest style), but we made do. 

I had the Vampiro and found it to be pretty good. I'm not 'crazy' for carne asada to begin with, but it was pretty tasty (although I didn't really taste the cheese or guac). I also ordered the corn which was delish...totally recommend it!!! Finally, I'm a total sucka for "real" Coke with "real" sugar, so it was an absolute delight to have a frosty bottle of "real" Coke with my lunch. Even at $3 it was heaven sent! 

All in all, a pretty good little spot.
