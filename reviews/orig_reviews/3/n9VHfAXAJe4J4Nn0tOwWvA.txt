A good friend that I worked with for years was making the move to a new job so a group of us went out to celebrate at the Sandbar in Desert Ridge this past Thursday night. 

We all met up around 5pm in time for some happy hour drinks and appetizers. Decent beer selection and your typical Mexican food options. The atmosphere is supposed to make you feel like you're in Mexico on the beach drinkin' with your buddies, and it pretty much delivers. It's a good place to go for a casual relaxed hangs with people after work, but as the late night crowd starts to roll in it becomes more like your typical club with loud music and more tipsy patrons. 

Fun place to go on occasion, but the service was mediocre with several people in our party opting to go to the bar to get drinks because our server was absent and slow.
