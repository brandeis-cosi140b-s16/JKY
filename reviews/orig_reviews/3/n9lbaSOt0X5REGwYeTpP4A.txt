Great atmosphere and outdoor seating area. Terrible service! We waited a long time for drinks, some of which never arrived. Food was very good, but again we had to ask multiple times before getting napkins and never did get silverware.  We eventually gave up and just ate with our hands. We had an equally hard time finding someone to take our money at the end of the night.  Yes, this was Cinco De Mayo, but judging from other reviews this was not out of the ordinary.
