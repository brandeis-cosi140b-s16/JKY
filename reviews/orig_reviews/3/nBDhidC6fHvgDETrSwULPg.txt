We love the owners of Sabor (brought to you by the same people behind 3 Amigos), and are really glad to see them venturing into the Latin street food side of the business.

Not totally in love with everything on the menu here (surprisingly!), but there are a few must-try's:
Get the Elote Loco (Mexican street corn), it's amazing!!! Just make sure you order a few so that you don't have to share.
The Carne Asada fries: delicious! I can't believe we are here a few times before discovering these, but they're now my go-to. The steak is really tender and the toppings are perfect. I always ask for extra cotija cheese, and I eat them immediately or they get soggy.
Margaritas: need I say more?

Word to the wise: this place gets CRAZY on taco Tuesday, so either come early or be prepared to wait even if you're getting take out!
