Really torn on this place.

1) Food was pretty good (yummy calamari) and we went during happy hour on a Saturday, so half off apps and drinks! Love that. 
2) I was throwing a bday dinner for my roomie, they split checks easily, decorated the table and brought him a bday shot. Thanks for that.

That sounds good, right? Well the 3stars are because my credit card was charged twice. I called and left a voicemail- was never responded to. Called back several days later, got the manager (Aaron) on the line. He was very nice, admitted they had some computer glitches and that he would check it out. So he called back and said he didn't see the charge so it must have dropped off. Well, 2 1/2 weeks later, Amex and I still see the charge, so they are now disputing it for me.
