Finally made it to this place! the last trip back to Vegas in Jan. we let this place slip out of our hands. 
The idea of the place is cool, i love it! right on the corner kinda and tons of people watching to do. 
I'm going to have to disagree with the "strong drinks" though. Makes me wonder who many drinks people in Vegas actually need to drink. I've been to Vegas a handful of times and maybe once hand a bartender HOOK it up. My margarita was Eh at best. I think my water had more booze in it. 
On to the food. I ordered up some of the Baja Fish Tacos. OK not bad but not the best i have had either. The Rice however was dang good!! The GF ordered up the Chicken Enchiladas and I'll give those some props. 
I liked the setup of the place, nice and big with lots of room to walk around and not hit everyone. It was Final 4 time so the place had some noise behind it. The vibe was mos def a good one. I might need to hit this place again jut to make sure I'm not taxing it too hard!
