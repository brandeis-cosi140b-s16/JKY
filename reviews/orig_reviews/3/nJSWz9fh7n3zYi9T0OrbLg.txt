My first time. Went for lunch on a Saturday with 4 friends. We ordered an the tejas trio app; very good. There was s happy hour menu on the table so I ordered what I thought was a $4.50 draft beer but it wasn't happy hour yet so I was billed $6, no fun. I asked for spinach in my mac n cheese, they accommodated w no extra charge, that was nice. My gf asked why there was no cornbread; I guess they used to serve this free like chips n salsa at a Mexican joint. Server told us that the cornbread was replaced w free chips and salsa, which we never received. When we pointed that out the server tried to song and dance around it rather than apologize and move on. My husband enjoyed his entree, the fajitas, but was disappointed at the volume and the fact that he was up sold without being told. The server had asked if he wanted steak shrimp or chicken or two of the 3, it's extra to have a combo. It's not close enough that we will go back.
