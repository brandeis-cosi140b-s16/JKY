I can't say I hate it but I can say I probably won't ever go back.

The service wasn't too bad until we tried to pay. It's like they didn't want to take our money.

The drinks were good as was the queso dip. The food came out in a decent amount of time.

BUT

The nachos were horrible. The meat on them was not even seasoned. That was disappointing, bad nachos at a place called Nacho Daddy? The shrimp taco could have been great if the shrimp wasn't undercooked or so greasy. You couldn't even pick it up without it falling everywhere.
