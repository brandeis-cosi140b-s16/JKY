I'm so torn on this review.  I grew up with Azteca,  and I love the food.   I've searched high and low for a Mexican restaurant to rival their carne asada,  but they remain the reigning champs.   My issue is with the service at this location.  It has been consistently poor.   Every server I've had, and even the manager,  has seemed annoyed to be waiting on the clientele.  Requests are greeted with eye rolls and then carried out in a very droll manner.  

But alas,  I love you carne asada.   I need you in my life.   For richer or for poorer... for bad service or good.
