Don't let the silly name of this restaurant fool you like it did me! I should have gone here a lot sooner.

Don't get me wrong this is not some amazing find, but rather an excellent fix for much needed Mexican food, margaritas & sangrias. 

I had the fish tacos which were good, they have a million different kinds of nachos you can get!

Yes the place was quiet, our server was great, and the prices were affordable.
