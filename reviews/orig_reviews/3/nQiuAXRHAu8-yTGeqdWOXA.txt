I really liked it here, I was a little tipsy for 1:00 pm but hey it's Vegas wth lol the food was good, drinks were the bomb and the waitresses not to bad either ;o). The food wasn't over or under cooked the drinks were not to strong but not weak either. It is pricey for the portions and the service, well they were busy, but our waitress seemed like she cared and she did her job well.
