I went here last week. This place seemed okay, I have never heard of it before, but my friend suggested it and really liked it before. So, we went there, and the staff was really nice but everyone was quite 'blah'.  Not too happy to be working or something? (Who really is, right?!). So not too many smiles coming your way if you go here. Anyway, the salsa/chips that they bring to the table were pretty good. They have hot and mild on the table and I didn't know which was which (usually I can tell), but found out right away! If you like hot salsa, then you'd like the one on the table!  But def. good flavors. 

For dinner, I ordered the fish tacos (Tacos de carnitas is what the item was on the menu) . And the flavors were quite good and good portions I must say. However, the fish was overcooked so it was a little rubbery. 

**Just a note, they do have a Vegetarian menu which I found very interesting at a Mexican restaurant. So there is food for everyone!

Overall I had a good experience here, the prices are a bit high to me, but that was really the only downfall. (And that I wish some of the staff would of been more personable.) But no matter, the company I was with,  was entertainment enough! :o)
