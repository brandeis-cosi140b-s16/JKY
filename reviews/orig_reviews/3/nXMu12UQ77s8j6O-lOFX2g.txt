I was very disappointed in this place, two out of the 4 plates that we ordered were not that great. The chips and salsa were good and so were our drinks. One plate we ordered was a burrito and very dry, the 2nd plate was a chile relleno and it was mostly cheese and grease. I think it has potential and could be great if the cooking was changed up a little bit. Our server was great even though it was a bit of a wait before he got our order.
