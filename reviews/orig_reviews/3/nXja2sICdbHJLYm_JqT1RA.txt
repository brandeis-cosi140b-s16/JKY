Was in Scottsdale at the awesome AZ store across the street to purchase local fare for my NY besties and they suggested David's hamburgers. It is like an old fashion 50's dive diner. Little hole in the wall place. I got a Gauc hamburger with fries. It was surprisingly, very good. I loved the old fashion looking bar. I would go back maybe for breakfast. That coconut waffle sounds good. The service could be better, not horrid but not great either.
