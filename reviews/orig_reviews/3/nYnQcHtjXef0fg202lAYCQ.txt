This is an open restaurant and bar located in the shops at Luxor. They had some signature margaritas that were very fruity and didn't seem to contain much alcohol. It was definitely more of a bar-type atmosphere as there were several tables that had some very loud people at it that made it a little hard to enjoy being there.

The wife and I both got the enchiladas, which were a little spicy and tasted all right. It seemed like not a lot of food for the price, which sucked. Service was good, though, which is always a plus in my book.
