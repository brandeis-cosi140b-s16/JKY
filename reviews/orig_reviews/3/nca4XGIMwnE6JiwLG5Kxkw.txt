Slipping.  We live in San Diego but get here at least once every two months.  Our last visit May 16 was not up to their standards.  Service was unprofessional with our waiter making stops asset other tables while holding our 'hot' food.  Furthermore they have reduced the portion size of their table side guacamole and our entrees just did not have the snap they used to...we will go back but will stick to their great happy hour and margaritas.
