Diablo's was just outside Monte Carlo where I stayed in Vegas for my birthday. It was a nice place, service was a bit slow coz of having a lot of people for the weekend. Food was okay. I'm not really a fan of very noisy places when eating dinner, but hey... it's Vegas. Everybody seemed to be noisy all the time. Just let it stay in Vegas. LOL
