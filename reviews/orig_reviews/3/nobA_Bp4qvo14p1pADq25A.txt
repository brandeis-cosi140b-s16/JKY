Some good things: Tortilla chips, Tostadas de Tinga, Flauta de Pollo, and the restaurant itself is clean, good parking. 

Things I didn't like or were just so-so: The salsa - I'm just not a fan of this style, which seemed to be very thin/liquid. Didn't taste bad, just wasn't what I was in the mood for. Neither were tomato based, which is what my preference is. The service - one waitress seemed very pleasant and responsive. Our waitress clearly did not want to be there, and did not want to be working. Our waitress misunderstood the order of another customer, and when the customer insisted that she get what she actually ordered, the waitress made a face as she walked the other customer's dish back to the kitchen.  My husband did not like the Pollo en Manchamenteles. Sauce was too sweet for him and price for what you get was high. 

So, hit or miss.
