I went to Fajitas with an old friend while on holiday in America. First thoughts upon entering were, "wow, this place smells good!" and "wow, the interior is kind of dingy looking."

Our server came and brought us chips and salsa and I ordered the margarita that was on special that day- i believe it was raspberry. The margarita was delicious, but the salsa really needed some salt or something...I was not a fan of it. My friend and I ordered the steak fajitas to share. The food was brought out super quickly. It was basically steak and onion with 2 slices of peppers on top. Most fajitas I've had or made have lots of peppers, but oh well. I know we were sharing, but even so, I found the portion rather small for the price. 

We shared the sizzling apple pie for dessert which was also brought out very quickly. It was delicious.  That was definitely the saving grace for this place- that and our excellent waitress. She was so nice!
