The patio is nice and on a pretty day I would love to sit there and enjoy a glass of wine. It was raining on the day I took my family. Not the most kid friendly place however they enjoyed the steak burrito that they split. I had two tacos and the were ok. As far as Charlotte I think Pacos Tacos sets the bar and RuRu does not meet up to the great flavors at Pacos. My wife taught her tacos were good and would defiantly be back. It was a little pricy for 4 tacos, burrito, two beers and a app for $60. For me it was ok however good atmosphere so I would recommend giving it a try.
