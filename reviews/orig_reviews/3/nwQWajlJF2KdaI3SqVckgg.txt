Simple mexican food at its Vegas best...best at overcharging simple dishes.

We ordered the guacamole fresca and chicken street tacos.

Now the guacamole will be made right in front of you fresh, the server will bring out the ingredients in a mixing stone which already has fresh lime juice in it.
At which he/she will mix it for you then place it on the table.

Food came out fast but it's street tacos, it's simple.
Nothing really stands out with the Mexican rice and black beans.
Same goes for the chicken as well.
Overall it's something that an ordinary cook at home could make and that's exactly what it reminded me of.

I was eyeing the ribeye but I figured I'd save to eat a steak from a steakhouse. 

For those two items and one soda total came out to $31.
You could find better options nearby but if you're in a pinch to get food this place will do you some good.
