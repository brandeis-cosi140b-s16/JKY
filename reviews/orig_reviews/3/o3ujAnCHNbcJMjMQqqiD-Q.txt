Like Tortilla Fish.  Very simple menu,  fish tacos (steamed or fried), shrimp tacos (fried only), a few salads and quesadillas, that's all.  No rice or beans. But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.   

I did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.

Dining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.

Good value..
