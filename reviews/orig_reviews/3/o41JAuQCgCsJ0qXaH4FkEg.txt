Similar to Chipotle, but on a local Phoenix mom n pops level, and with enchiladas instead of burritos. I really like that it's local!

Pros:
-Local
-Simple decor with good ambiance
-Fast friendly and helpful service behind the counter.
-Plenty of choices to fill and and top your 'lada

Cons:
-The menu is way above your head on the wall and hurts your neck to read it.
-Maybe too many choices and somewhat confusing what to add and when to add it.
-Food tastes decent,nothing special, not terrible but all kind of tastes the same. We had four ladas with four different meats, sauces, and toppings and couldn't really taste much difference between the four.

I would probably give this place another shot, but maybe try tacos and soup next time.
