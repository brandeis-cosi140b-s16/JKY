We came here for lunch one day at work and we were all super excited to try the habanero burger.  The three of us who went all like spicy food.  While the burger itself was good, spicy would be a loose description of it.  I would come back here but I would ask for the burger to be way spicier.  We will come back I am sure but hopefully the peppers will have some more kick.
