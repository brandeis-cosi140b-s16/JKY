Nothing was especially bad here, but neither was anything notably good.  I suppose they brought refills of salsa & chips without asking, which was nice.  Portions are rather modest in size, and prices are a little high for what it is (entrees here).  Drink prices were very reasonable though.  Just doesn't have a nice feel to the place, cleanliness and overall vibe.  Feels like a Spring Break party place except the patrons are older.
