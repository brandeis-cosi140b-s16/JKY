I ordered out from this restaurant because I work a block away.  I was born and raised in New Mexico so I was pretty excited to have some authentic New Mexican food so close.  The chili is pretty hot and the food is authentic.  It's actual hatch.

The atmosphere is quiet and personal, a genuine mom-and-pop place. 

My only reserve about this place is their overload of cilantro in their salsa.  New Mexican salsa doesn't have cilantro and even so, they are quite heavy with it.

I would recommend it and would go again.
