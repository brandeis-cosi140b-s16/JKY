It was just that A-Ok, nothing that special.

We got a red and a green burrito enchilada style. The meat was really tender, but other than that it lacked that over the top flavor I'm looking for. The prices are pretty cheap, and the place is definitely authentic but that doesn't always automatically put it in the awesome category.
