We've been here a couple of times and both have been good experiences.  I just haven't found the "perfect" food that I love to eat but what I have ordered has been decent.  This most recent occasion I got the tamale dinner and had one meat and one corn.  The tamale's were a decent size and it also came with a generous portion of rice and beans.  It was good but I wasn't dazzled.

I will say though, their tortilla chip is delicious.  It's soo flavorful, even without putting any salsa or other dip.  I joked with my friend they must fry the chips in some sort of super lardy oil or something.  We pondered and decided to not ponder any further.  Ignorance is bliss.

The service is good.  I just haven't found that one dish I love and have to have but I like it enough to come here again.
