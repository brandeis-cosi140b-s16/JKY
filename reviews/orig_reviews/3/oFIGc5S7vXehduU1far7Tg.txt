Me and a few friends stopped by to grab a bite to eat the other day after seeing the photos and reading the reviews on Yelp. It's a small spot where you order at the window (not unlike Roberto's) and are served shortly thereafter. The owner/server was extremely polite and helpful, even allowing substitutions in my case. The interior was very clean and well kept and the dishes were served on unique metal plates which was a nice touch. The complimentary chips and salsa were also a welcome addition to the typical taco shop experience. We ended up splitting plates of Enchiladas Verde, Chanclas, and Pelanos and I'm glad that we did. The portions were on the smaller side so as a stand alone meal I'm not sure it would be enough to fill most people up. There was nothing bad about the food but at the same time the flavors didn't standout either. I liked the salsa verde but the chicken seemed kind of bland. 

Maybe I had too high of expectations due to the overwhelming positive reviews on Yelp but it was only OK for me.
