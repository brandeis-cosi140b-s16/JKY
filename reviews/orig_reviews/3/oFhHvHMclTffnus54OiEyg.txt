Vegans/vegetarians get no love here, carnivores and tequila lovers..this is for you. My hubby and I came here for our anniversary and it was packed so we said we'd sit at a table at the bar. They smushed us into a corner with a wobbly table and no room for my hubby to stretch his legs so we decided to wait for a real table in the dining room which they were happy to accomodate. Restaurant and atmosphere is spot on and romantic. Amazing architecture and very polite staff.  

We got a tequila flight which was sloppily poured, each shotglass had differing levels of tequila which was the first turnoff. Then our vegetarian taco appetizer came which was like 3 mini dumpling sized buns with unseasoned veggie inside with no toppings. I figured ok, hopefully the main entrees make up for it..

my husband's plate arrived and it was very pretty and he loved it. My vegan tacos on the other hand were just as bland as the appetizers and was the exact same size as the appetizer!  I asked the server if there was anything else they could offer because I was not happy at all with my dish. He said he would talk to the chef and upon his return told me that was all they had to offer me and sorry.  Our bill ended up being well over $200 and it was definitely not worth it for being happy with 1 out of 3 offerings. .

I would get a picture taken in front of this place again because the building was very cool looking but I won't be stepping inside again.
