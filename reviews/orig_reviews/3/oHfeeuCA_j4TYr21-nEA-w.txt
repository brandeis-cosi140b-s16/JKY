I used to love this place when it first opened but the quality is starting to fall a bit and the prices have gone up.  It is still a fun place to go for food and chill.  I take first dates there to see if they can "hang".  It is my way of testing them.  If they can't appreciate a good hole in the wall then they cannot hang with me.
