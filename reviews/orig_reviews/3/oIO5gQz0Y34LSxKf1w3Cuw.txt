Why are there soooo many people hating on Macayos? The food is awesome. The service sucks! But...

Macayos is a Vegas staple. There prices are reasonable. It's not the most authentic place, but it does it's job. I've never had a BAD meal here.

I recommend: tortilla soup, baja burrito - shredded beef, pollo con espinaca,  enchiladas (any will work here), fried ice cream, and their signature margaritas!

If you want tasty Mexican delights at decent prices and are in no big hurry, this is the spot. Word. Ole!
