We were staying at the Wigwam and wanted to grab some dinner.  I found this via yelp and thought why not- since it was right across the street.  

We were seated right away and sat outside.  The salsa and chips were probably the best part of the meal.  We also ordered some guac, but it was just ok (didn't really have a punch of flavor i was hoping for).  I had the spinach enchilladas and they were just ok too.  I wasn't really impressed with my entree and was hoping to have a bit more flavor.  Either way, its a good place to get a quick bite if you're in the area, but nothing spectacular.
