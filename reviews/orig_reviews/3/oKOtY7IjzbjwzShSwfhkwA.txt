Never been here I have lived on this side of town for over 10 years. For some reason driving by this place NEVER made me want to stop here that Circle K corner just never appealed to me. Well everyone talks about this place so I finally broke down last week. The parking lot was PACKED so I felt good going in. 

Everyone seemed pretty cheery and the guy who helped me didnt seem to mind that he had to explain everything to me. I ended up ordering chile relleno burro w the Tijuana veggie quesadilla beans and rice. I was surprised there was no Mexican rice on the menu. Anyway my friend tried the Machaca in a burro. Overall nothing stood out to me as fabulous this trip. Not with the food sorry. 

The relleno was nice and crispy with good heat to it but no flavor. I tried the machaca and it was nicely cooked but pretty flavorless as well. Beans were beans. I have a feeling the Mexican food here just isnt great and I am willing to come back and try the Chinese next time. On the other hand I found that all the hot PHX firemen grab lunch here and that alone will probably get me here again very soon. I feel safer eating just in case I forget how to chew and need to be saved with some mouth to mouth. ;)
