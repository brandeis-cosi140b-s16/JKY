Not worthwhile! 

I used to go to Cafe Rio restaurants all the time when I was in Utah and I only had good memories of my experiences there. 

This restaurant is a bit different. I didn't feel the service was adequate. Passable at best.  

I had the salad. It was fresh and the ingredients were also fresh for the most part...except for the tortilla bowl - it tasted like it was made a week ago. 

With all the competition in fast food, and with Chipotle practically across the street from here (0.5 mile West on Camelback) there's no reason for me to ever come back here.
