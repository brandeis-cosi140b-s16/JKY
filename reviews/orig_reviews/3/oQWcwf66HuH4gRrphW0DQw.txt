I hate to knock this place because of the high ratings, but my experience was not anything to rave about. Chips and salsa is great! Service is excellent! Their cilantro rice is great. I had the street taco combo. I chose chicken, carnitas and al pastor. The carnitas was the only one that was ok. I took one bite of the others and that was it. My boyfriend ordered seafood enchiladas and was very disappointed. The shrimp in there were no bigger than a quarter and the scallops as well. Their prices are on the high end for Mexican in my opinion, $17 seafood enchiladas, $14 taco combo. They do offer 25% off for locals on Mondays.
