We often stop at Arriba after a Dbacks game, or anything downtown. The menu is huge and everything is delicious. My husband had a steak (carne asada), wanting a low carb option. I drank the huge 1800 margarita and it was yummy, not all ice like some restaurants will serve you! I had the mini chimis and they were greasy but good, very little filling, though. The rice and beans were good, but I would order the charro beans instead of the refried. The reason for 3 stars, the bathrooms.....not awful, but need a good scrubbing. The walls, floors, maybe even the ceiling....look like they need some attention.  I just had to wash my hands and left the bathroom wondering if maybe I was worse than before I went in.
