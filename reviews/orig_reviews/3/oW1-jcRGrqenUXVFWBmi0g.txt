The food at this very large cantina was above average but not packed with flavor.

The $5 we paid for chips and salsa should have been a sign of things to come. Three salsa choices which was nice, but only one was flavorful and it was hot!  My wife and I split two meal orders. The shrimp tacos and the pork antijos. tacos were smaller and the sauce that comes on them was good. The antijos were dry and boring. The mesquite flavor did not come through. The star of the show were the margaritas which were needed when it came time to pay. Skip this place.
