Went on a Friday night and it was busy.  Waited forever only to find our that they had crossed our name off 20 minutes earlier because they don't communicate.  Both greeters started arguing about who's fault it was.  After being stated the waiter took our orders but no drinks and no refills afterwards.  My nachos were very good, my wife's fajita salad was drenched in vinegar (drenched).   It is worth trying once, but due to poor service and not so good food  we won't go back.  

After writing this review I had a message from Nacho Daddy management offering to review my experience with their restaurant.    As a consumer it is refreshing to see that they do listen and want to make an effort to provide a quality experience.  Thank you Nacho Daddy
