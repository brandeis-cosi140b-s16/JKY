I feel uninspired to write this review. The people here are so nice but the food is mediocre. If I were feeling sad, I could come here and feel better because of the friendly staff. But if I want amazing food, I'd go elsewhere. 

I've tried the chicken tacos here. The ingredients tasted fresh. But like everyone has already mentioned, it's a Hawaiian Chipotle. They do have a saving grace: coconut bark. Coconut bark is good and I don't even like coconut anything. It's toffee with chocolate and coconut shavings.
