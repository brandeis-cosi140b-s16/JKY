Food was good, but not worth the wait. We were the first people in and it took about 20 minutes to take our food order. I could understand it if was busy, but it wasn't.

Server started clearing our table before everyone was even done eating.

I'm only giving this three stars cause the service wasn't good, but the food was good.
