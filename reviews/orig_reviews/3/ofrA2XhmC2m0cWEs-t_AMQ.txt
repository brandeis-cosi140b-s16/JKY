I have a friend who DJ's here so we hung around with him a for a time while he got us some free drinks. This is a straight up Mexican restaurant. They don't serve Corona which is kinda weird. Supposedly they have a contract with Dos Equis to only serve their beer and not Corona. They also serve the beer Sol. Lots of people come here because it's free entry and they can dance.
