I've heard a lot of conflicting reports about this place, from "It's fantastic" to "It's just meh". I finally was able to try it for myself. And the verdict? It's just A-Ok. 

With a two hour wait, I was expecting to be blown away by their food. The only thing I was slightly blown away by was $2 modelos. 

Fish tacos - grilled - were dry and bland. Pass the cholula please. Rice and beans to round out the meal = lots of food. That's nice. But lots of bland food is useless. I did like the tortilla though. 

Drink specials make me happy. Baja cali decor makes me happy. Friendly waitress and bartender got me through the meal. 

Way too crowded for their own good, 2 hour wait for mediocre fish tacos. Maybe just drink specials on off-peak hours.
