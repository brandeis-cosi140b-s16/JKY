I tried this place based on the recommendation of a co-worker and I thought that the food was pretty good.  The menu offers an array of tacos, all of which are just a little different than you might expect.  These tacos are small "street" style, but the flavor combinations are unique.  I have tried most of the tacos on the menu and all of which I have liked, namely, the pastor, carne asada, texano and carnitas.  The prices are fair at around $2.25 per taco and the ingredients are usually falling out of the tortilla.  The ingredients seem fresh and the unique act of adding flavors such as wasabi, curry or balsamic cruda to a street taco is a tasty concept.  This place will not replace your favorite street taco stand, but it was a nice change.

Now, I ate at this place twice before I got around to writing a review and when I did, I came across a health inspection on Yayo Taco.  My above review stands and I did like their food, but I can not give more than 3 stars to a place with such a spotty health record.  This place was shutdown in Aug. 2012 by the health district.  A week later they reopened with an A grade.  However, just four months later they received another C grade and then most recently another A grade.  If this place could produce some consistency with their health inspections I would feel better about giving them a better yelp rating.
