The food was decent, but the service was terrible. We went there during the "lunch rush" which was only 5 tables that I could see, and we barely saw the waitress. 

The place does have a really cool vibe though if you are looking for some place that you can go to relax. I probably won't go back again because the food wasn't good enough to deal with the service again.
