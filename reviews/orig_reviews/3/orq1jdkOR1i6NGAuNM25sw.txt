Cute, old mexican restaurant tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale! 3.5/5
We were there for lunch with AJ and J this Sunday. My first time there and love the decor. Frank & Lupes reminded me of the mexican restaurants we saw in Mexico City.. cute, colorful and friendly! Per AJ's recommendation, I ordered a chicken green chile soup topped with a scoope of sour cream. It was delicious! J and J both had beef burito. I personally didn't like their chips and salsa (a little bit too mild) but it was a perfect place to enjoy your lunch on Sunday!
