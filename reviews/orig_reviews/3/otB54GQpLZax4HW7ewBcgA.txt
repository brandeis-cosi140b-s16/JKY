I recommend mainly for the fish tacos and VERY AWESOME margs.  I do love them margs here.  It's one of my two "go-to" marg spots in Old Town Scottsdale (the other being The Mission).  Happy hour is the beset value, and my family and friends LOVE the crispy chicken $2.00 Tinga Tacos they have during happy hour.  I've been here numerous times, at various times of happy hour, and my sister (who LOVES this place) had her graduation party upstairs.  That was very nice.  Them margs will kick your ass.  Prickly Pear is nice, as is the Cadillac, and the organic marg is a treat as well.

Interior looks like it's off the set of The Peach Pit from Melrose Place in Mexico City.  Outside patio is nice, especially in spring/fall at the fire pit.

No matter what, I always seem to come back.  Waiting to get a glimpse of Tori Spelling lurking in the back...
