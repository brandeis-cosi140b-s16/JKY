It's great to have a something new in the area. I don't think the food is as great as everyone is posting. I believe there are better taco shops out there. Very limited menu. Would like to see some fish tacos. I think they could have some success with late night hours. And what's up with not having sour cream? Employees are friendly.  I hope this place grows and takes on more food options in the future.
