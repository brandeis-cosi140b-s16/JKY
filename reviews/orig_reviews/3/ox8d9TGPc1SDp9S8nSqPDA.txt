The three stars is due to the wait, 20 minutes on a Monday night at 730? I don't think so. And they only had a tiny portion of the restaurant open so there were tables everywhere that couldve been filled. 

Most of the staff, while friendly, made apparent how much they hated their jobs. The manager ran around picking up and cleaning in a frenzy, everyone else rolling their eyes as they went. But SUPER friendly when talking with you. So I commend this place for the friendly service. 

For food I got the fajita nachos. Very very good. Individual nachos are made so that you're definitely getting your money's worth on each chip. They skimped bad on the spur cream and it took 10 minutes to get a side of sour cream so the second half of my nachos were cold by the time it came around. 

Dessert-- ordered fried ice cream. 5 minutes later, queue waitress not holding my fried ice cream but instead informing us they "ran out".... Uh what? 

Nice staff, pretty good food. but not prepared for even twenty customers total at one time... Not cool.
