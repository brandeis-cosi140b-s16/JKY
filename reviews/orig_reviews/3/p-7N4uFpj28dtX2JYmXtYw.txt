Nice atmosphere and not too busy during the week.

The good: Chips were free and tasty and my veggie wrap was pretty perfect. My side for my wrap was rice and beans and the rice actually tasted authentic- reminded me of the Puerto Rican home cooking I had while visiting Miami. And lastly their salsa they give you at the beginning is fresh and unique (full of fresh onion, corn and etc).

The bad: The waitress was a bit short with me and my friend- which wasn't cool. She took a while to get us our drinks and checks (When it wasn't that busy).

Oh well, I probably won't drop in here again unless I'm just hungry and stranded in downtown NoDa.
