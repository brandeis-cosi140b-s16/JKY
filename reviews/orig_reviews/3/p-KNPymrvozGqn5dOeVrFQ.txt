A weird mash-up of hip typography and craft beers with very traditional Mexican and Dominican offerings. The service was strange: I am still not sure which of the three peopl who tag-teamed our table was our actual server, and in spite of the group effort, it was weirdly slow to get our order taken and drinks refilled. The dip trio was not worth getting--the table salsa was significantly better than the pico (and I like chunky salsa!), which had a strange aftertaste. The guacamole was chunky and needed the piquancy of limes. The queso was served with a skin. The rice was dry and the beans were mediocre--but for me refried beans are only worth eating if they taste like bacon fat. My chicken chimichanga was fantastic. And the sweet plantains (I know, odd combination) were heavenly. It was a relatively inexpensive meal, though perhaps I'm just used to Alaska prices, and I left full. A solid choice but I've had better.
