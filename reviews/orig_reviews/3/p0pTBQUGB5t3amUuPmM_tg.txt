My fiancée and I are looking for a good Mexican/Southwest restaurant at which to have our rehearsal dinner.  We have many relatives coming from the East Coast as well as overseas, and want them to have a unique experience.  We saw this restaurant from the outside and thought it looked nice.  After reading reviews we decided to try it.

We were greeted by the host who told us to pick any table and he would follow us with menus.  We sat at a booth but the host was nowhere to be seen.  We waited about 10 minutes before the manager finally brought us some menus.  We considered leaving right then, but we were curious to see how long we could sit there with no menus before anyone noticed.

Anyway, we started with the chips and salsa appetizer and I got a margarita.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charged for chips and salsa.  They were not very good, but the margarita was fine.

I ordered the enchantment platter and the fiancée got the carne adovada plate.  Both were very good.

All in all, the food and margaritas are decent to good, the inside is a little tacky, and the service was subpar at best with the servers and bartenders looking like they would rather be at the DMV.  We will probably not return.  The manager who served us (did not catch his name) however was very friendly and attentive.
