I don't live near any good mexican food, so for me, it was good.  Went on a business lunch so I couldn't try their tequilla, I'll be back.  Good chips, not the blase crap from a bag.  Great service, especially in Scottsdale, no attitude!  I had the carnitas tacos and shrimp tacos.  Fillings were great, but way, way too much cabbage!
