Mexico City Mexican food ...ok... 
We were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The interior is much nicer then I expected it to be. We sat in a booth and they brought out the chips quickly. They have three sauces that accompany the chips. One is a coarse chopped pico de gallo and the tomatoes were actually red instead of pink (what a concept), the second was a hot smooth red salsa (my favorite) and the third was a creamy cold avocado dip. The drinks were delivered and they have really clean glasses, no scratches or anything, I notice these things. The water was good, it must be filtered. The silverware was super shiny and looked like it had never been used. I love that! 
The menu is a bit different form a traditional Mexican restaurant. I ordered the shrimp melt and my friend ordered the pork flat taco. They are both very similar, but the melt has bacon in it. When the food arrived we were shocked. Where was the greasy gooey all mushed together food we had come to expect with Mexican?? It was on a clean white rectangular plate and was a normal serving, not the massive "this will make me gain 5 lbs" size we are used to. I thought everything tasted very good and it was just enough to be full without needing a nap. 
I like that this place is not full of screaming children and obnoxious people. Its a grown up Mexican lunch spot.
