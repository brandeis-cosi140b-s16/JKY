The atmosphere is great, as was the service. Unfortunately the food was just OK. Looks appetizing but lacks flavor and skimpy on the meat. Definitely overpriced for what it is. I hope the quality of the food improves because appreciate the attention they have given to everything else.  Until then, go to Mo's or Zaba's if you are at Downtown Summerlin and have a taste for Mexican food.
