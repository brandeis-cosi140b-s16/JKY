Not bad! I've been here a few times for their $1 beef taco lunch specials. Some days the beef is more flavorful than others, but it's never bad. Great portions and you always get chips and salsa which is nice. I've walked out of here paying $6  for my meal (4 tacos) + tip and left full and happy. This place gets a little busy around lunch time, but they do the best they can to serve you as quickly as possible.
