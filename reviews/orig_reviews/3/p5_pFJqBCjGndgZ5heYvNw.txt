Pink Taco - food and drinks are good, not the best.  The funny thing is that I haven't found good Mexican restaurants in Vegas yet.  I hate when I go to Vegas and crave Mexican because I leave disappointment.

My last visit I ordered chicken enchiladas and it came with some dried chicken inside the two enchiladas.  Thank goodness I had a full beer in hand to pass the food down.

Anyway, I'll still go to Pink Taco's if I ever step a foot inside HRH again.
