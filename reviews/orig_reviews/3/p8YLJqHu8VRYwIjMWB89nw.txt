The scenery as others have noted is stunning. The renovated church is awesome, the food, not so much. The guac was divine, but everything else was uninspiring. You can't be a great Mexican restaurant if your tortillas are mediocre at best. Go for the drinks, the atmosphere and the guac, then go someplace else for dinner.
