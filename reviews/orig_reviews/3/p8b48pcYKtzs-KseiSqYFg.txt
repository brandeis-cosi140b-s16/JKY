Food is great but today is the second time I've driven from Goodyear for lunch only to find them not open at their posted time and a little cardboard sign saying "open at 11:30 today". I arrived at 10:45 (to be first in line) and had a limited time for lunch so I could not wait until 11:30 for them to open.

I was so looking forward to their fish tacos and a Horchata.
