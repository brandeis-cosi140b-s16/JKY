Food - The food here is pretty OK. By that I mean it was good but didnt stand out. My friend had the mole and swears by it so that is a plus I guess.

Service - piss poor. You would think paying $3.00 for a soda you would at least be offered 1 refill.

Value - See above! 2 small baskets of chips and salsa for 6 people. If you want more they are $2.00 each!! Meal value was average. 

Overall - we waited almost 1 hour to be seated for a party of 6. When we were seated, we got a table for 4 with 2 extra chairs. Not complaining about the table, just the wait. I would understand if they had to pair 2 tables but we all sat at a standard size table. Service was aweful. Probably would not return. There are a million other mexican joints within a 2 mile radius.If it wasn't for the great company we had, I probably would have been mad but we were with good friends and just rolled with it.
