My girlfriend and I visited this place the other night for drinks and appetizers.  I think I am undecided on this place overall.   The food and drinks are pretty good but I think everything is overpriced for what you get.  For a couple rounds of drinks an appetizer and a sushi roll I think we paid $70.   Its not outrageous there but I just found myself wanting to be wowed more based on other reviews.   I will say the bacon wrapped dates were pretty excellent and the pork belly roll was pretty good as well.   Service was okay overall, not anything special.   I think i will have to give this place one more visit until I can give this place a final verdict.
