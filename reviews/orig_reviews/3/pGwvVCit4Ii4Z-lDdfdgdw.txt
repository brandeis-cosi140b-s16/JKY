The food here is not good.  Let's just start with that.  It does have great outdoor seating though and they allow you to reserve tables for happy hour.  We often will walk down there and have a drink, grab some free food from the happy hour buffet and head home.  I never go to eat dinner or anything, but really enjoy just sitting outside with a beer.
