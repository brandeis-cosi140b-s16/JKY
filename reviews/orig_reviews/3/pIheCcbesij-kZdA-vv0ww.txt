it's good but I expected great.  I had the chopped salad, carnitas and tried the roast chicken.  everything had a hint of sweet.  my biggest disappointment of the night is the server recommending corn tortillas with my carnitas. I would have gotten them anyway but he made it sound like they were house-made.  they could have been right off the smith's grocery store shelves.  lame.
