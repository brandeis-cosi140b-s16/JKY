Overall we had an ok experience. The customer service was on point, my margarita was delicious, and my husband's pork burrito was amazing and was enough for 2 people. No complaints from him. I got a chicken enchilada and pork tamale. I asked for all rice and no beans, but they gave me beans anyways. The server took it back and within 5 minutes I had the correct order. My food however was not as delicious as my husbands. Everything was pretty bland. The enchilada was flavorless, the tamale had very little pork and was mushy, and the rice was plain. We will most likely return, but definitely getting the burrito or tacos.
