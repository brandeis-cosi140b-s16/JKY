This was our second attempt at Nacho Daddy. I looooove the green sauce on the enchiladas. I also tried a chicken burrito. However, this place's water tastes WEIRD. Like old or stale?

The service was good, the Mexican corn appetizer was good too! 

I just don't know if it impressed us enough. There are a lot of amazing Mexican places in  Vegas. If you're interested, I'd recommend just trying it out for yourself.
