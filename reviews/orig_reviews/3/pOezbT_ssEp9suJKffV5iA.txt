This place is no longer worth the value for what you get in quantity and quality. Almost $10 for a meal special of the day? We use to get a lot for your money, but the last few times it has been a quantity that leaves you hungry.
It's no longer a great value, I suggest you go to the Sweet Tomatoes salad bar for all you can eat!
