Mucho Macho Taco is a small fast casual Taco Shop. You place your order at the counter and they run your food to you. You come here for tacos as I didn't notice them offer side dishes of rice or beans. The ceiling is decorated with bags hanging like flags with interesting graphics. Some of the bags are from Beans but many are from Medical Marijuana. ????

We shared a variety of tacos and ALL OF THEM WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! But the day I was here they had a really bad batch of tortillas. I was only here once and I don't know if their tacos always fall apart or not. All five tacos that we tried ALL FELL APART and we had to eat them with forks.

The Grilled Maui Maui Taco had a delicious wood fired taste to it. It was so good they should turn it into some kind of dinner platter. The fried fish taco was tasty and the brisket was prepared well and had supreme orange segments in it that was interesting and different. The chicken had a similar fired taste like the grilled Maui Maui. My husband liked the 50/50 best.

Pricing is very reasonable I think you can get three delicious tacos for around ten dollars and bottles of water are only one dollar. Parking might be difficult because this is a small stripmall with only so many parking spots.

Great tasting Tacos but I have reservations about the soggy falling apart tortillas I received so I don't feel they are worthy of four stars to me. I think someone on Medical Marijuana made the tortillas.
