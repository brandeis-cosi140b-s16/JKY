Stopped at Barrio Queen with friends for a few drinks and some apps Saturday.  Very impressed with the Cerviche and their fries w/ pork and cheese.  

Also had the skinny Margaritas which were very tasty, but very small and expensive in comparison to similar restaurants.

Followed this with an awesome Chili Rellano taco.  Great selection of street tacos, and great decor, too.  Service was a little suspect with long waits for drinks and visits from our server.  

All in all a good dining option, but bigger Margaritas or lower prices coupled with more attentive service can definitely earn them another star.  None the less I'll go back, and recommend you visit them.
