why do i still order margaritas from here, knowing full well they are 50% insanely sweet, sugary, yucky pre-mix? yes, i did. it was cinco de mayo. i was trying to be festive. my margarita was terrible. 2 other girls beside me at the bar said the same thing. they tried to get new ones....i didn't bother because the bartender seemed highly irritated to be working. 

but it's still a good, go to bar. the food is decent when we've eaten here, but i have to stay away from the margaritas dammit!
