everything is bigger at valle luna - from the food, to the margaritas served in 19oz mugs, to the menu.  as an indecisive foodie, this is definitely a place where i would study the menu before arriving.  with multiple dining areas, large sized food and drinks, and a colorful decor, valle luna looks like it could be a great place for celebrations.

this was our final stop before taking a red-eye home so we were happy to load up on some comfort food.  the pepe's sizzling fajitas, baja fish tacos, and complimentary chips and salsa did not disappoint.  we were so famished that the waitress even brought us a second serving of chips.  if you order carefully, there are some items suitable for 1 hungry person (i.e., baja fish tacos), but most entrees are large enough for 2 people (i.e., pepe's sizzling fajitas).

the food is average and the A/C is strong for those brutal phoenix summers.
