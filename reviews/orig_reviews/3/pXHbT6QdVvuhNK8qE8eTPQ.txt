My sister and I found ourselves quite thirsty after making the trek from the Mirage to Planet Hollywood, so we stopped in here for some drinks. I am really picky about my alcoholic beverages, and I have to say that the pineapple mango mojito was THE BEST mojito I have ever had. My sister enjoyed her beers, and we were both crazy about the complementary chips and salsa. The salsa was just incredible, just a little different from the norm, and thoroughly enjoyable.

The atmosphere was nice, as we had a nice sunny spot at the edge of the restaurant, outside, with a view. A great spot to relax and people-watch.

UPDATE: I changed my review from 5 stars to 3 after trying their food. Nothing terrible, but I would not eat there again. We also ate inside this time, which was a little tacky. In the future, I would come again only for drinks, and to sit outside and people watch.
