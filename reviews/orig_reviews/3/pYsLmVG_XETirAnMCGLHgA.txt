Totally unique combination of Mexican and Asian food.

The food is reasonable, but it is mediocre Mexican or Asian as solo fare.  Combined it is unique enough to want to come back to explore more variety.

It definitely has a charm that is hard to articulate.

More than anything it is FABULOUS for large groups.  Beyond accommodating.  This is one of those must try at least one time restaurants.
