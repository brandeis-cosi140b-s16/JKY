Macayo's happens to be one of few (only?) places open til a strange hour on Sundays, which I'm all for.  It was literally the only place we could find at 9pm on a Sunday to go for not-bad food.

I personally love their red-corn taquitos.  In fact, I love them so much, they are the reason I go here.  When someone has Macayo's catering, I can count on those little red devils to shine over all else.  Yum!

Typical Mexican beer selection.  Tryin' to push a zillion different margaritas.  May or may not get your order right, which for me isn't an issue (see: you can't really screw up a taquito order), but I've seen it more than once the wrong thing is delivered to the table.
