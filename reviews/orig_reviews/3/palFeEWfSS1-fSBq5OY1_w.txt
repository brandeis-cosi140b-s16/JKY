I REALLY wanted to like this place.  I had heard about it months before it opened.  I waited in anticipation as they passed their soft opening, and were up and established.  Finally on the day of my birthday, I decided to finally try it out.  I salivated over the menu.  DH & I finally decided on a few appetizers and sharing an entree.  I ordered one of their specialty cocktails - it was so hard to choose!  They used very interesting ingredients, I wanted to try them all!  I started off with a Baja Eden that had passion fruit, pomegranate mixed with a delicious tequila.  It was divine..... served with a beautiful flower.  Next up we ordered two appetizers: Ceviche del dia (shrimp & scallops) & Chicken Flautas: Fried tortillas, smoked chicken, poblano slaw, crema.  The Ceviche was OK.  It didn't have a fresh taste to it, and the spices were way off.  It almost tasted like spices from a packet.  The flautas on the other hand were delicious!  The smokey flavor along with the fresh crema were spot on.  The appetizers were pretty sizable so we ended up sharing an entree, the enchiladas de pollo.  They were just plain horrible, there just are no other words to describe it.  The beans and rice needed a good dousing of salt, and the enchiladas were plain and boring.  After asking for about every hot sauce in their restaurant (btw they do not have any good hot sauce) the manager ended up giving me a house-made smoked sauce.  That actually tasted pretty damn good on the enchiladas, and I think they should actually use this rather than what they have on their menu.  I was pretty disappointed overall because of the entree choice.  I don't need things to be spicy, I need them to be flavorful.  They are missing the mark on this, and it's sad!  Such a beautiful restaurant, with great drinks to boot.  I will definitely be back here but for happy hour only.  Drinks & appetizers seems to be the right combo.
