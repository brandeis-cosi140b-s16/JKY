It's cool in the sense that you can get really cheap tacos (other items aren't worth it) really late at night, either while clubbing or on the way home. We don't have enough places after 2am that are accessible on foot, so Los Yaquis is gonna be in high demand. 

My quesadilla was definitely small and bland for the $8, and nachos are just plain old nachos, like what you'd get at the movies or something. I will admit the meat tasted rather fresh, unlike other late-night spots, where it can sometimes sit around for hours. 

Apparently, I was also fortunate enough to avoid really long lines. It was pretty busy around 11pm on a Sunday, but there's no way in hell they have the capacity to fulfill the 2am rush. What drunk person is gonna chill out by a trailer, with no restrooms in sight while waiting for their order? Who is gonna keep people in check when people are (and i saw this firsthand) dramatically yelling at each other, or beggars are accosting every table? I can live with all this, but there's no way in hell you're going to eat in peace, something I don't deduct any stars for because it's not a real restaurant (it's a food truck that never moves).  There are totally times in which this will be the only option, and it won't be a terrible one. But at the same time, I can't imagine any reason someone would go out of their way for just decent Mexican fare.
