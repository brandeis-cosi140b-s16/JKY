We stopped in because they were open late and a friend said it was really good. It was good but as many others have said the price is a little steep. For some things there is a reasonable price and for some things not at all. We snacked on the lotus chips and they were great. We got the lamb gouza which sounded good but didn't blow us away. I liked it more than my BF did. The duck fluatas on the special menu sounded interesting and the mole was good but the duck was dry and lacked that fatty rich duck flavor. It was a disappointment. The BF said both of his tacos were pretty good. The stand out was the shu mai sampler. They were REALLY delicious. It was around 65 dollars before tip for two tacos, lotus chips, gouza, shu mai and fluatas and no drinks. Honestly we could eat a lot of really delicious things in Las Vegas for less and I am a person who would happily pay more for food it it delivered in both quality and taste. You could tell the quality was there, the taste was inconsistent across our dishes and that leaves me feeling like there was not a value to our meal. 

With so many places to try in Las Vegas I don't know if I would return but maybe for a snack of chips and shu mai because they really were special.
