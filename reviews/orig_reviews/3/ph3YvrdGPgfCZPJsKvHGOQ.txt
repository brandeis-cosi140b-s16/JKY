The Good: Seasoned Chip's and delicious Guacamole! Insane portions, many selections to choose from, clean & tidy restaurant. Food presentation was very nice. Very liberal with the avocado as a garnish ( a huge plus in my opinion)

The ok: 
Not a huge deal since it's only a dollar but still, the server was friendly but didn't disclose up-charges (i.e $1 extra for more tortillas). My boyfriend is pretty easy-to-please so he liked his steak fajitas but I thought the steak was sinewy though the flavor was really nice. My enchilada roja was way too spicy (for me) so I probably would order something different next time. 

The bad: We called ahead to use our yelp deal, which was a good thing because the fine print says it's not valid on Fridays and Saturdays.....but according to the person on the phone, for some reason it's not valid on Sundays either. It's fine if you're  not going to accept these deals on certain days, but at least have that information clearly printed at the time of purchase.
Also, 
I despise canned soft drinks at a dine-in restaurant mainly because I am the type of person that needs a sip with every bite. I found myself finished with my Dr. Pepper well before my entree even arrived and I didn't want to pay $2 or so for another canned soda.
