Old Town Scottsdale is a mecca for three things: tourists seeking cheesy and sometimes obnoxious knick-knacks, twenty-somethings seeking overpriced novelty cocktails and easy ass, and middle aged well to do women spending money at boutiques while their husbands work to keep them wearing the current trends. Frank & Lupe's falls in the first category, appealing to the knick knack buyers after they are done shopping and have worked up an appetite.

That said, I thought I should try it on a Tuesday night with no plans. My initial reaction after seeing the drapes in the dining room was I would be in for an overpriced-underflavored meal that would only appeal to someone from Nebraska. Quite the contrary. I proclaim Frank & Lupe's one of the best (border style) Mexican restaurants in the Valley. The Green Burro owned and acutually contained fresh green chiles. their chips and salsa were also very tasty. The biggest surprise? the price was right in line with your Arriba, Abuelo's, Macayo's, etc. No complaints there.

The reason for the downgrade from four stars? the service. Quite frankly, the server, and server assistant that were assigned to our table were inattentive at best. They made no effort to give us exceptional service, and worst of all, every time I emptied my water glass they asked if I wated more. It's empty isn't it?
