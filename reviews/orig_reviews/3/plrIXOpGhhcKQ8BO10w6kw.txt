We stopped here for breakfast before our flight. I love Sam Fox, but I was SHOCKED to learn that the huevos rancheros is served sans tortillas and if you want tortillas you have to pay for them. Seriously?! Not cool, Sam Fox, not cool! Huevos rancheros issue aside, we ordered 2 bloody mary's (AMAZING, the spice was just right!) and 2 chorizo breakfast burritos.  The burritos were huge and fresh and delicious.  We could have split one because it was so big, but ended up taking the leftovers on the plane.   The food was good and the service was prompt, but I was really put off by the huevos rancheros thing.  I really suggest the restaurant look into that one because honestly, we thought about walking out when we were told that, but I'm glad we didn't because the food we ordered was good..
