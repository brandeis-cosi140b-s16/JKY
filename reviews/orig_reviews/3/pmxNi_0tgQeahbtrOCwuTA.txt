Comedor Guadalajara in S Central is housed in a great building.  Large restaurant - absolutely beautiful - high ceilings, with a comfortable waiting area, and spacious table arrangement.  Family oriented.  They definitely cater to the Mexi brethren.  

The host guided us to the table for what seemed like the distance of an average Phoenix block and I was like, "Oh this is still part of the restaurant?!"  The menu is large enough for a nearsighted grandma complete with a few pictures for folk like me who are constantly asking:  what's that, how's it, who dat?  

If you're short on cash that week or forgot your wallet you can easily fill up with the sopa appetizer (a vegetable pasta soup) they bring upon seating and the obligatory corn tortilla chips.  

The chips were warm.  Mmmm.  And delicious with spicy salsa.  I also ordered some churros.  Made-to-order.  Hot hot hot and yum yum yum.  If I return to CG, it'll be with a different flock, and I would like to have a peck at one of the molcajetes or something out of the mariscos category because my own snobbish preference is for more upscale dishes.  

Word to the wise:  if you want to eat here, you best be an early bird because they're not open all day.  And prepare to wait about 20 min for a table, even at the break of lunch time.  This place is more popular than a high school jock and cheerleader couple.
