I heard about Cabo Fish Taco from a friend who lives in the NoDa area. I was so excited because I absolutely love fish tacos. The first time I visited, I ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and the Cabo Fish Taco. The ingredients were fresh and the tortilla was delicious but there was nothing spectacular about the flavor profiles. I visited a second time and ordered the same dish to give it another shot and I was again left wanting more. The side dishes also leave something to be desired. I would be willing to visit again and try something new but definitely no time soon. It is also incredibly loud which is somewhat of a downer if you want to actually talk to your dinner companions.
