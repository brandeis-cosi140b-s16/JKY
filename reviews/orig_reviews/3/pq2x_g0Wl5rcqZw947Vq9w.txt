Awesome Sunday brunch with great patio. Small menu, but strong selections and great cocktails. Would give this place 5 stars, honestly, if it weren't for two things:

1. It's *slightly* overpriced for what you get. Taco-wise, I think Smoke is a MUCH better value (better tasting, too), and it's just down the street.

2. The music is loud as all hell. Had to scream across our table to have even a semblance of a conversation. Like I said, the patio is beautiful, especially on a sunny Sunday morning, but the DJ kind of overpowers/ruins it. I love good music at a restaurant, but Cantina seems to insist that their brunch is really a rave. Cut the volume in half and this place would be unstoppable.
