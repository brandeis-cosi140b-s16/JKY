Cashier has terrible customer service. She's doing like three different things at once. While you're telling her your order, she turns around and starts handing the food to the drive-thru customer and doesn't hear what you ordered. And when I told her to please pay attention to me, she got snappy and gave me attitude.  
There were only two people in front of us, and it took 10 minutes to take our order and she still took my order wrong.
already 3 customers complained about the cashier getting their orders wrong. 
Cook staff are friendly and they work super fast. 
The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars us because of the cooks and my burrito was good.
