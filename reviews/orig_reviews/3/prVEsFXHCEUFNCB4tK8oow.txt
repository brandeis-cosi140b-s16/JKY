Great food...  I'm from Las Vegas so robertos is a normal thing for me, but anyway the food is great at this location & the fact that they deliver is AWESOME & very convenient as well.  My only complaint & also the reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because they don't have Carne asada fries.. I guess it's just a Vegas thing but when I tried ordering Carne asada fries they told me that they don't do that :( ... If you are trying to boost business & get even bigger I recommend adding Carne asada fries to the menu.  You wouldn't believe how many people out in Vegas go to robertos just for the Carne asada fries alone but  yeah the horchata here is very good as well and so are the prices, unless  you're a low baller cheapo who's used to eating at fast food prices lol just my opinion though!!
