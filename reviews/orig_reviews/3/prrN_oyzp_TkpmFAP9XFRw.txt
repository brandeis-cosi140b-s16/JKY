First time here

Service: great!!!! Kelly was welcoming and very friendly and fast on service.

Food: ok. My wife's nachos were great. Big fan of them. The ribs though said they were very spicy but not at all. They were juicy so that's good but I love spice so a little disappointed on that. 

The worst part of this visit was how hot it was in this restaurant. I don't get hot that easily and was very uncomfortable sitting with my wife and 2 year old son. I will be back but seriously, turn down the AC!!!!
