Unfortunately we were not fortunate enough to meet Frank or Lupe (unless they were the ones trying to sell carnations to us while we ate....hmm) 

What a cute place! 
I love the decor and the ambiance of this place! Everything from the lighting to the music to everything was wonderful! For the first time in awhile I felt like this was truly an authentic restaurant (rare in the concrete jungle!). I like the little quirks of having to go outside to the restroom, and the cool back patio. 

This place came highly recommended by the other couple we went with and to be honest, we had such a damn good time with them that I hardly remember the food (which does not say much for the food since I just ate dinner there last night!). The chips and salsa were great but not amazing. The salsa was definitely fresh but a little too thin for me. To drink, I had a prickly pear Margarita which was wonderful! I was not all that impressed with my meal. No doubt it was authentic but I didn't really care for all the extra grease. 

As everyone said, the service is SUPER slow but we didn't really mind since we had great drinks but based on the food/service, I doubt we will return....
