If you know what a CUBAN sandwich SHOULD taste like you need to go here for one, haven't had a better one in Vegas. Fried plantains on the side? Yes!!! My favorite sandwich dish, and the texture of the Cuban is not easy to master. I'm not fond of the location but customer service is decent, I say give it a go.
