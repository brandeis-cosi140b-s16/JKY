After promising our kids to tape the TI Siren show for them, we noticed that Senor Frog's had moved into the patio overlooking the show.  Thought maybe this would be better than fighting the crowds, so we called and got reservations.

Senor Frogs was fun - the DJ was getting those in the restaurant up dancing and doing silly things, which of course was a blast to watch.  The signs all over the restaurant were fun to read too.  

As to the food, it was okay, but nothing really great.  I don't remember it being extremely pricey - but the drinks were very expensive.

And the reason why we came - to see the show - not the best seats in the house to do that.  We got to see the guy's pirate ship from behind, but couldn't see the girls at all (and of course that is where the action is).  

All in all, we had a good time - the wait staff was helpful and friendly and besides price of drinks not alot bad to say about it.  Of course not alot good to say about it either really.

I don't think we'll go back.
