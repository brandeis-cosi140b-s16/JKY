If you're the type that hates crowds or obnoxious "gangsta" types, don't come here on a Saturday. Typical Arizona strip mall bar that I was at previously on a Thursday and it was great.  Desiree (she said that was her real name) took care of us and  was terrific. Drinks are reasonably priced. I didn't eat here based on previous reviews.
