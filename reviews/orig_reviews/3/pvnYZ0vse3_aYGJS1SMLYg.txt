This place has a great happy hour, $5 Mexican beers and a wheel of fortune on liquor.

The food here is good, easily as good as any Tex-Mex style restaurant, but it's a damn rip-off! WAY too expensive for the portion sizes and quality of food. The Super Nachos are a good value. But when you consider that they're just tortilla chips in guac, sour cream, cheese, and tabasco- that's a damn rip-off too!

I doubt I'll go back, except for drinks at happy hour.
