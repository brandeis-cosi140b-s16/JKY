I've been going to Chino's since 1988 and, although the food is still good, the place is beyond filthy!  Yes, its casual atmosphere is part of its charm, but really, it's borderline call the Health Department disgusting.  The floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks and you can carve your name in the grease build-up on the tables.
