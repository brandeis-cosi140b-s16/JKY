A restaurant that is owned by an iron chef should have better training for food allergy info..the hostess was just guessing when I asked about the gluten free options.the server did a little better..(I think)..should never be an answer when asked about allergens...please update menu..to denote the menu ...the last thing I want is to have to ask so many questions about what's safe for me to eat...
