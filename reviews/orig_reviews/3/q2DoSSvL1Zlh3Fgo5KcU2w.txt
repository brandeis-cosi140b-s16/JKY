Food was just ok here, the best part was the chips, salsa and guacamole. We ordered pineapple margaritas that would've been better if the sour mix was toned down a bit. You really miss the pineapple taste because the citrus from the sour mix overwhelmed it. We ordered the carne asada, chile relleno and cheese enchiladas. They were all just ok. The service was very good, the food just needs improvement.
