We had a reservation and they sat us outside where there was no fans or AC and it was sweltering.  We asked to be moved inside and after waiting around 20 minutes they accommodated the request.  The inside is loud and there are activities going on so it was not ideal for easy conversation.  The food was alright, but they got one of our entrees wrong and offered to replace and along with not charging us for it.  With a groupon it was on alright deal.
