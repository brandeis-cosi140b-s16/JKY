Think Dinty Moore canned roast beef...just like my mom used to make it for movie night at Town & Country's AMC. She'd make it with a can of Ortega diced green chilis, diced onions but this version adds cabbage and tomatoes. And all for $4. Love it. Before you go off on it, remember how much you're paying for this burro! Four bucks. You haven't had it this good since you had medium pizzas for "regular price, four bucks, four bucks, four bucks."

I ordered the beans and rice on the side (they're normally served inside the burro), so I got to taste the sticky Spanish rice seasoned with chili powder on its own. The whole beans were pretty good too. Great as a side dish; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side. You can even take one of the bottles of habanero sauce to the table to impress and double dare your friends!

I have to agree with others' comments on the "homemade" lemonade. Like the beef burro It also took me straight back to my childhood, remembering sugary (think corn syrupy) Freezees at Circle-K. Definitely not fresh (except for the wedge of lime which was dry) but oh so memorable.

Don't forget the success of tiny Lenny's burgers at 15th Ave. Hippies pops at lunch being so close to the Brophy and Xavier campus. Great value, and location location location. I hope it's in the running for a permanent spot on the "square" (7th St to Ave, Camelback to McDowell).

Yea! Can't wait to try their special shrooms at the other location.
