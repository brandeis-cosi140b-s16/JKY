Been here two times in the past year and both times have been completely different from one another, so I guess I'll break it down for you:

First Time -- 1/5 Stars (A few months ago) -- The waiter had NO CLUE what he was doing. I have a Rock Star card at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, so they were supposed give us this deal where you got 99 cent tacos and margaritas for Happy Hour. He said he'd take care of us and he'd be right back with our food. 15 Minutes later, he came back and said he couldn't offer us the deal for some reason, because it wasn't the right time, or something but because he messed up, he'd give us a few tacos for the 99 cent offer. The guy literally took 45 mins to get us our food and drinks!! Definitely a bad experience and I was not too pleased at all. 

Second time (2 Weeks Ago) -- It was awesome!! Waiter was real friendly and gave us good recommendations. The quesadillas and the enchilada platter were awesome! My only complaint was the margarita, while tasting great, was kinda small since it was like $12 and I finished it pretty quickly. Otherwise, the place had great food, a good selection of modern mexican food, and great service. 

Overall, if I had a great experience both times I was there, I would probably give the place a 4, possible 5!
