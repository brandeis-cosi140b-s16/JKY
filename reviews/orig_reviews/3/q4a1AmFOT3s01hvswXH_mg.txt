I'm a fan of Cabo Wabo when I'm in Cabo San Lucas, so I got excited that I could get a Wabo'Rita in the Las Vegas airport.  So, I decided to stop in for dinner.

I had a burger, and one drink.  My bill came to $30.  Add a 20% tip, and I was at $36 for dinner for one!

The food was ok, the drink was great, but it was all WAY OVERPRICED.
