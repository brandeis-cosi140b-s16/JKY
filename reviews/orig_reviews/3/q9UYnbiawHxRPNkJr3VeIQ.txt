I mostly go here for Sunday Funday or on weekend nights and have a good time. It gets busy and trying to get a drink can be vexing at times, but that comes with the territory. Most of the time I have a pleasant experience. But, the last time I came in, I did not enjoy myself nearly as much. I came in with three friends, and they did not have any tables inside, so we decided to sit on their patio which was very hot (not their fault, damn this weather).
At first we tried to track down a server, but were unable to, so we ordered drinks from the bar. This took a very long time, and the bartenders seemed more interested in talking to each other than serving patrons. It was relatively busy, but waiting fifteen minutes is a bit much to ask.
Finally, once we got our drinks we grabbed a couple menus and were finally able to track down a server. It seemed like she was the only server for the entire restaurant. We ordered our food and it came out in around 20-25 minutes. The food was pretty good, but when my girlfriend asked for her tab she was given the wrong credit card. It then took another fifteen minutes to track down the server again, and she gave her the right credit card back. She wasn't exactly friendly.
I'll be back because I like this place, just not to sit down and eat.
