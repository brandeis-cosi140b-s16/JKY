Love the food, lots of healthy options and love that kids can take in their Halloween candy for a free kid's meal. We usually sit in the restaurant section with our toddler. Cashiers have never been friendly. We have been there probably 10 times now for the food. They don't even greet you. They are always rushing us through even if no one is behind us and if we ask a question they either don't know or have told us, "look at the menu". One time I just asked what was in the guac. The cashier didn't know. We love the atmosphere too:)
