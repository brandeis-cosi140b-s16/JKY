The very first time I came here was for a Yelp event and Nacho Daddy treated us like duchesses and dukes; great service and lots of food.  This was my second time in a more everyday setting:  happy hour on a Thursday night with three of my gal pals. We arrived by 5:30pm with half an hour to spare to get our cheap eats and drinks going.  Nerds that we are, my friends and I had already studied the menu online, so we had 99% confidence in our order hours before we arrived.  I knew I was getting the 2-for-$4 street taco deal(chicken, even though I'm reaching my chicken limit these days), and the Mexican-style corn on the cob (elote), plus one margarita, because that's really all I can handle for alcohol.  I figured that would be a fairly safe and healthy meal for dinner considering I was going to avoid rice, tortillas, and chips.  Well, I was disappointed in my street tacos.  I know they're supposed to be smaller, but there really was not that much chicken in them and no way am I going to reach my protein quota with those-not even 3 ounces between the two of them.  The corn on the cob, though, was muy delicioso!!  It's one ear of corn per order, cut in half.  I could have had two more orders, at least--who cares if the stuff gets stuck in your teeth?  I would return just for that.  Service was meh--no one really came to check on us once the food was delivered, which is always frustrating when your mouth is on fire (not mine) and/or you need to order more beverages, alcoholic or otherwise; I mean, we were sitting in the bar, after all.  I don't go to happy hours on the regular, but since this place is in Henderson and it's convenient for after work with many of my friends, I'll come back for more corn and maybe another adult beverage.
