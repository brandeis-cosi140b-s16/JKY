Decent food. Way over priced for what it is.  Chicken fajitas were just ok. For $23 I'd expect a bit more flavor. Steak burrito was tasty. The cocktail servers uniform is a bit too revealing and their hair wasn't tied back which is really disgusting. It was good, but because of the prices, we won't be back.
