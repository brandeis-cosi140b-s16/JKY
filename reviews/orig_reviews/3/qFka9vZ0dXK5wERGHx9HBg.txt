The food isn't very good. I had ordered a quesadilla and the cheese wasn't even melted. The only food item that was good were the chips and salsa.

The margaritas on the other hand are delicious! The bartender made some awesome drinks. I ordered a grateful dead and he actually knew how to make it! I've been to other bars asking for that drink and they never made it right.
