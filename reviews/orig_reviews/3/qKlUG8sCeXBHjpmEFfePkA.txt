This Mexican restaurant is located inside the Venetian. If you eat here, make sure to get a seat "outside" next to the canal. Eating here is quite mind boggling when you consider that the whole atmosphere is a sham. No, you're not in Venice. And no, you're not outside. It really doesn't matter when you're sipping a delicious strawberry margarita and watching the gondolas float by. No matter how odd it may be, everything just works together to give you an interesting, if not wonderful, eating experience.

The sangria's and margarita's are great, the service is good, and the food passes in my book. The chips and salsa are delicious. I definitely suggest getting some guacamole to accompany your crunchy treat. The soups and taquito's were also yummy. I got a chicken ceasar salad as my main course, and unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. Let's just say I've had better. Aside from that, I really enjoyed my experience at Ca√±onita's and wouldn't mind giving it another shot in the future.
