Should be 2.5 stars...
Their chips and salsa, delish. I die. every time.
The pollo queso something something...yummmm, so greasy and cheesy and spicy and chickeny and fried 
$4 dollar margaritas? ok!
The food here is typical yummy greasy Arizona Mexican food. It's nothing extraordinary, but it isn't terrible. What's terrible about this place is the service. Yikes!
Every time I come here I am first ignored by the depressed 19 year old side bang lip pierced hostess. She really never makes an effort to say hello. I feel I need to overcompensate for the brattiness she exudes by being overly nice. Hello? I'm on the opposite side of the hostess podium, do your job biotch. 
We are often sat at some odd random table, on our most recent visit being one with 2 or so extra chairs, that also doubled as the iced tea, water, and to go container station. I think it's best if you come here with large groups for this reason. They seem to reserve all the "nice" tables for them.
Our waitress is usually a moody 40 something woman, that acts like everything she does for you is a favor. Literally, the waiters and waitresses here don't even bring your food, drinks, take your plates, etc. Now the men that do all this, I like. They're friendly, and helpful!
I think it's a large extended family that still owns and operates this place. Which is most likely why the service sucks so much. 
I still occasionally eat here, as my boyfriend loves the food, but the service needs some upgrading. If this wasn't such a tourist trap this place would have gone out of business long long ago
