As many other yelpers have noted, this is not the best Mexican food you'll ever eat and definitely not the most authentic, but it was definitely reasonably priced and fairly tasty. 

The restaurant is located at NY NY near where the theater for the Cirque du Soleil show Zumanity is. The atmosphere is nothing all that special, but it's got strings of Christmas lights and a decent sized patio to give it a little ambiance. 

The food was average Tex-Mex at average Tex-Mex prices. They've got tacos, burritos, salads, combo plates, chips, salsa, guac, and a comprehensive list of tasty margaritas (even a 3-foot-tall one!). 

One thing that made this place great was the service -- I was staying at NY NY with a 15-person group for a bachelor/bachelorette party and the hostesses, waiters, and servers were all VERY nice and accommodating and actually seemed genuinely excited to have our group there. Even when we got a little bit rowdy and loud, nobody blinked an eye or said a thing and they were overly helpful in getting our orders, separate checks, and drinks taken care of easily and quickly. 

I wouldn't go here if I was in the mood for the best, most authentic Mexican food, but given the convenience of it, their great service, and the fact that the food was tasty enough and decently priced, I'd definitely go back.
