Love the drinks, the apps and the atmosphere and the whole vibe of the place, and the friendly staff. 

The 3-stars is for the food. I think they're trying to fuse flavors together that aren't really working because I couldn't figure out what was in my dinner, but it was just okay, not terrible, but I thought it was strange, and definitely not great. 

Also a big negative with me is an enchilada with a flour tortilla. There's something so very wrong with this, it reminds me of something you'd find in a 5-minute microwavable dinner cookbook.

Would I go back? Yes, but only for drinks and apps..... for sure!! Probably not for food.
