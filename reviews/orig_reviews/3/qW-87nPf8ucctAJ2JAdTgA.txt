Nice d√©cor and we were seated inside quickly.  The service was ok as he was busy with too many tables.  My wife had shrimp and I had the hamburger and we only drank soda.  The food was ok.  I expected a lot better quality for the price.  I understand that because it is on the strip, the prices would be higher, however, the quality of the food should be better.  The bill came to $57.  The only thing that really bothered me was when the waiter circled the suggested tip of 20% on the check.  Don't tell me what to tip please.  And no, he did not get the 20% he wanted just because of that.
