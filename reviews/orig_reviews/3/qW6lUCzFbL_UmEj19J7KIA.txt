Fun mexican sports bar dining. The drinks are strong.. but sadly their signature cocktail the Loco Patron margarita is not very good. We ordered the guacamole and chips... Erika is wild about her gaucamole. I had the steak fajitas which were very yummy and generous in size. The table salsa is not as good as Chevy's; something of  a watery tomato soup; they need more chunks.
Warm spring nights make this a great place to hang out outside. Next time i am in town this will be one of my stops.
