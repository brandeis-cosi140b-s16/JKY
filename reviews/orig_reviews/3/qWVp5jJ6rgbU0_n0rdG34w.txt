Fun... Fast... Fairly Healthy (depending on what you order)

Went to the location in Boca Park in Summerlin.

I'm SoCA transplant so I really like the Wahoo's locations down at or near the beach.  They just seem to have better flair and flavor.

I'll still go to Wahoo's in Vegas... but I long for the Wahoo's of SoCA.

The Summerlin location has a small patio area so when it's nice outside you can get some Vitamin D.  However the patio is like sitting in the parking lot.  They also have a bar area so you can sit and have a beer at the bar while enjoying your fish tacos.

My "go to" dishes at Wahoo's is always the fish tacos or the fish plate. IMO... this last Friday I ordered the Fish Plate... Grilled with White Rice and Black Beans.  The fish was dry... the rice was dry and flavorless... the black beans were ok.  

The salsa and guac were fresh and very good.

NET, NET.... I'll frequent Wahoo's because I keep hoping it'll be as good as the ones in SoCA...
