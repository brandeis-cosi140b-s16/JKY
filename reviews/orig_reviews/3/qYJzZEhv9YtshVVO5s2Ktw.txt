When trying to decide where to catch the  World Cup game and enjoy lunch central to both our locations, my husband and I settled on Dona Maria. We sat at the bar and ordered a diet coke and my pregnancy drink of choice, raspberry ice tea. The staff was courteous enough, although we waited about 10-15 for the menus to be brought over. 
The complimentary chips and salsa tasted very complimentary -stale chips and salsa that tasted like marinara sauce. We opted for 6 tamales (pork, beef, cheese, chicken x2 and "sweet").  I had beef and chicken, and thought they were ok but slightly dry. I had to drench them in cholula sauce for added moisture.  Also the tamales were relatively small. The tab was close to $25 which is pretty standard for a mid range quality restaurant. I'd say this was purely a convenience thing and based on the food I would have no desire to go back.
