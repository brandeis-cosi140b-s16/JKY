saturday night and it was the only place without a 30 min wait time around the centennial area. service was great and i wish i could say the same about the food. avocado fries sounded like a good idea so we tried it. dipping sauce was good but definitely ask to hold off on the seasoning which seemed like paprika. literally had to wipe it off to enjoy the dish. steak was supposed to be medium rare but served on a sizzling plate that by the time it got to me it was well done. no biggie the nice condiments kind of made up for it. the 30 min wait might be worth it next time but if I'm famished, i'll be back!
