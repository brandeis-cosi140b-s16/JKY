Large portion of the pork.  Can't forget the Green Chili side dish, it was very unique and fluffy.  I sat at the bar, so I didn't a fill of the specials for the night.  It wasn't until I dug into the pork that I noticed a slew of seafood specials on the wall.  The pork was very moist and did not suffer the overcooked dry pork dish that you may find at many other restaurants.

A very dark atmosphere, wish there were at least a little bit more light.
