F&F's Cocina is a nice hole in wall Mexican restaurant off the 215 and flamingo.  This restaurant has a nice Cali/Mex decor and super fast service.  Went for lunch and the place was empty.  Compliments on some great fresh salsa that is very comparable to Lindo Much (my personal favorite).  Had a burrito with the sides and enjoyed my meal... Overall the price was right and the place was clean, fast, and flavorful so I give it a thumbs up.
