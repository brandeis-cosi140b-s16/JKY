Went to Sombrero, food was good it was ok, nothing special.  Although the service was good, nice atmosphere.    I definately prefer "Richardsons Cusine of New Mexico".  Unquestionally the finest southwest food in the valley.  The rellenios are exceptional, same with the enchiladas.  The Beans the best.  Margaritas are outstanding.
