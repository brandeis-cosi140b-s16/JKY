I just realized I hadn't updated this review in quite some time... I've been back to TTTP 5-6 times since 2010, and as Ashley H notes, they have been making changes, most of which are for the better.

The salsa bar remains solid, and I absolutely do not mind paying for chips. The guacamole is tasty. The tacos have improved, but have still been a bit light on flavor; on many occasions, the beef/chicken/pastor have been well-made, but rather bland. Don't be afraid to season-up, Tex!

Where I continue to struggle with this place is the service. It's always so slow. It seems to take forever to get a drink refill, be it a water, soda, or beer. I'm not sure why that is... 

So... Tex - how about we kick it up a notch in the spice, flavor, and speedy departments? Then we'd be looking at a solid 4-4.5 or even a 5-star rating!
