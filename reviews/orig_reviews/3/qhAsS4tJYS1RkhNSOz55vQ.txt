This isn't the best Mexican food I've had but it was ok with me. The restaurant is located in Arizona Center making it convinient to downtown and the sporting events. Happy Hour is from 3-6 during the week with decent deals, but the drinks are more akin to the taste of quarter drinks. Portion size is good however and thr service didn't disappoint.
