I finally made it here.  I love the feel of the restaurant (family owned, local).  You know those one of the kind places.  Went on a Friday night, it was packed but my friends got a table already.  We sat next to the area they made all the yummy shakes, so we had to speak a tad bit louder to hear each other.  

I ordered the: 
Arizona Torta -  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef and eggs.  I had HIGH HIGH hopes with all the excellent reviews.  OH, it was ok, all the meats were bland.  The ruffles chips served with it, just did not flow.
