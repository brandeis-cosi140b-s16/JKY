We came here last night for dinner. 

We were greeted and sat immediately. The hostess was very friendly and our waiter was very attentive. 

They don't have a large portion to choose from on their menu for tapas - but all of the tapas are half off on Monday's, which is super nice. 
Also, the wine list isn't very large. But they have a full bar for everything else. 

We had a fairly decent number of dishes -
Angus Sliders
Stuffed peppers
Artichokes
Filet
Scallops
Asparagus
Lava cake

Everything was okay. The garlic aioli...if you don't want insanely strong garlic in your mouth for hours, steer clear. 
Most of the dishes were fairly bland and there wasn't much to them. 
Everything came out VERY quickly - the waiter said they don't let anything sit in the window and it's all made fresh, which was bizarre because a few of the dishes he brought out were barely luke warm. So, I don't believe that was the case.
It seemed in a way that he was doing his best to convince us that the food was good. 
He was a great waiter, but the food...it was mediocre. 

I can't see myself coming back again...I like good food, especially when I'm paying for it. ;)
