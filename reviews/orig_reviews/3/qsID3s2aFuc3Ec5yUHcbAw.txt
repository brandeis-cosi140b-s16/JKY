So the homemade tortilla's are really good, but everything else is just sort of decent. But that's not a bad thing. The menu is pretty basic, so don't expect your standard array of Mexican combo plates, because they don't have them. You basically pick your poison--taco, burrito or a bowl, with a meat choice and if you combo it for $6-8 you get rice, beans and a drink. That's it. 

My mom really wanted a good tortilla with beans, so I went searching for a place with just that. She had the tacos with the chicarrones verde and lengua. She loved them both. I'm not a meat-eater, so I had their breakfast burrito, which is usually made with eggs, chorizo, rice and beans, but they were very accomodating and made the burrito to my exact specifications. I only which I would've gotten my burrito fillings in a bowl and just ordered a side of tortillas. 

The food is simple and basic, but still very fresh (one HUGE exception being the chips, but you didn't come for that anyways, right?), affordable and not in the least bit greasy. Oh and the service was awesome! The lady working the register was very nice, very attentive, and personable. It really was just like eating at a friend's place you've known for years. 

Do yourself a favor. Don't come here with super high expectations, because this place isn't trying to revolutionize the taco. It's not their schtick. But do still try them if you're in the area, because the tortillas were pretty damn good. Word to the wise, the red salsa/sauce that they have in a squeeze bottle wasn't that great. If you must drizzle a condiment on your food, the green sauce was much better.
