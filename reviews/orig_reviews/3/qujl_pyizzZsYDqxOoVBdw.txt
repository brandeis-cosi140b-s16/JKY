I enjoyed a good margarita and the Machaca tacos were fantastic. My brother ate the ahi tacos which I tried that he raved about which I thought were just good nit great. Salsa was too mild for my liking so they brought out something with more bite which was good.  You can quickly come addicted to chips and salsa.  Nice atmosphere and nice urban feel to it. The dining room was spacious and very open.  I especially like the bar.  Ole'
