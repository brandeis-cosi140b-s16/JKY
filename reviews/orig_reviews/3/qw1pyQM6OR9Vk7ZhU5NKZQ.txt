Devilishly cool devil woman standing above the Diablo sign beckons you in.  Surprisingly decent food here, better than I had expected although thats not saying much.  We ate indoors downstairs in the area above the bar.  LOUD, but fun.  My cocktail was extremely watery so I mentioned it to our waitress and she had them make me a stronger one.

Diablo's is a refreshing break from the casinos and the strip.  Once there, it feels like you are somewhere different.  That alone makes it worthwhile for at least a drink.
