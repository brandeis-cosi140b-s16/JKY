Tonight, it was late and the early dinning crowd had already left.  We sat on the bar side of the restaurant which we have never done before.  There were a few other tables and one big group also sitting on this side.  

Our service was quick and friendly, we got a few of the tamales for appetizers and both ordered an entree.  The food was served quickly, hot, spicy, fresh, with good flavors.   We did have some left overs which I gladly ate the next day.  

It has been a while since we enjoyed a meal here, but it's good to know it is still fresh and service is great.
