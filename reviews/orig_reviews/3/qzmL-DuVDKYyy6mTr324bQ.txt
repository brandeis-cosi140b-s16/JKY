So, The Burrito Factory is located on South Blvd. and can be missed if you are not paying attention. Although the outside is somewhat blah, the interior is clean and designed with a somewhat trendy feel & TV for your enjoyment. Upon arrival, we were a little confused at the layout, where to order (being the only ones there), but was questioned by the cook  who stepped out behind the counter. We ordered one chicken burrito & one chicken quesadilla w/ chips & guacamole. Being there is only one cook, things do move a little slow, but everything is fresh & you select you additional items from behind the counter, that included cheese, lettuce, jalape√±os, onions, etc. We paid and hit the salsa bar, which offered a variety of flavors. Although others Yelpers enjoyed, we thought some were a little too hot, too bland, etc. nothing seemed to hit the perfect mark. And, the soda machine offered no ice, so the owner/manger took our cups to the back to fill with ice, strange. 
However, the food & chips arrived fresh, hot and were delicious. The chicken burrito had rice & beans, along with the additions and was great. The chicken quesadilla was just as good. Both fresh chicken, great rice & beans! I did enjoy the guacamole, but do wish I enjoyed the salsa as much.  
I would love to give them a 3.5, but that is not an option. I will be back, knowing how things work, but recommend to those first timers, don't be in a rush & try everything..
