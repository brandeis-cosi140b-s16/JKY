Positives:
The service was attentive 
Margaritas were reasonable for a pretty touristy place
Prices were reasonable for a Vegas strip restaurant
Fresh guacamole is made at the table for you and it was tasty

Negatives:
Still messed up one of the dishes (no cheese requested - dish came covered with melted cheese)
Why do restaurants not put prices for the drinks on the menu - very annoying
Overall food quality is just ok - about the level of Mexican chain restaurants like Chevy's

Summary:
Vegas strip doesn't have many choices for Mexican.  It works if you are craving some, but it's disappointing when you consider the sheer number of quality restaurants in the hotels.
