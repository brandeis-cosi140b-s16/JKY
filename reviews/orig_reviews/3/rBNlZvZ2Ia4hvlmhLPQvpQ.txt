The nachos are large, but they're not much to write home about. If I'm leaving food on a plate, then it wasn't worth eating, and we didn't finish. There was a mix up with our order, and it took a little long to get settled with the check, etc. Service was friendly, and it was a pretty good value for being off a casino.
