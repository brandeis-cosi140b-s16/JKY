Pretty much like Chevys or El Torito but in New York, New York.

I didn't like their sangria it tasted just like pure juice. The chips and salsa was pretty good...but how can you mess that up? Chicken tacos were okay, rice was fine as well. Overall, the service was okay. Weird when everyone's plates were steaming hot except one of ours in our group. Honestly, I didn't choose this restaurant for dinner but I wouldn't go back again. Would rather eat in Earl's of Sandwich or Wicked Spoon.
