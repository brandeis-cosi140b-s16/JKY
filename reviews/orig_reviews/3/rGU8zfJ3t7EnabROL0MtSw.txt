I was really looking forward to trying this place. So, I finally did. We had the jalape√±o  queso appetizer dip. It was really good. I ordered the tilapia, whole fish pan fried with garlic and it comes with rice and beans.  My friend ordered the tamales with beef taco plate. My food was pretty good. I just did not like the rice and refried beans. They seem generic to me. When I say that, I mean they taste like out of the can and not fresh. I am really harsh on refried beans because they taste the same everywhere. The tamales were ok. 

The problem with Mexican food, in my opinion, is that it's so difficult to determine what is good, bad or mediocre. 

The service was very good. Maybe...I 'll give this place another shot in the future.
