I'm seriously torn about how to review - as two stars or three.  This would have been four had it not been for the shortcut to an unplanned weight loss.

Business traveler, dining alone, weekday night.  Fairly busy. Sat in bar area at high top.  Prompt service.  Asked for and promptly received water, chips, salsa.  Salsa tasted great and had a good amount of heat.  Waiter made a few recommendations, including the pork carnitas.  Carnitas are always risky - I've had way too chewy and overcooked, I've had ok but stomach ache for a week and I've had "damn, I should order that every time" - but all from different establishments.  It was really feeling like more of a fish taco night so I compromised and ordered the Tuna Carnitas.  Sounded interesting and tasty!  Waiter came back and apologized saying they are taking it off the menu.  Hmmm.  I decided to not pursue the seafood angle based on that so rather than fish tacos instead went with waiter's original recomendation of Pork Carnitas - he reaffirmed my confidence in my selection by saying "Now that's a great choice!"

So I felt good about it.  And I have to say, they tasted excellent!!  Only, as I was walking to my car after having had a good amount of salsa and the carnitas (didn't really eat the beans which came with it) I felt the first "uh-oh" moment.  My hotel was literally only minutes away so I kept going.  That almost did not work out...within about 20 seconds of walking in my hotel room door I think I had literally lost 5 lbs.  My stomach is not that sensitive but this must have been caused by something I just ate to have had such a quick and unpleasant reaction.

On the positive side, thanks to the "cleanse", my suit pants weren't too snug the next day and I gave an unbelievable presentation to my client!  So 3 stars.
