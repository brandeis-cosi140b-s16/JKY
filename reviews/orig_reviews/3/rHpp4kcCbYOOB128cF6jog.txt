I'm downgrading my original rating of this restaurant from 5 stars to 3 stars.  I know for a fact, that the Mission claims to have some of the best Posole (or pozole, which ever you prefer) around.  Well, not anymore.  Distrito has them beat, hands down.  After tasting the pozole at Distrito, which features an unexpected garnish of littleneck clams), the pozole at The Mission seems bland and ordinary at best.  

Also, after having eaten at several other upscale Mexican restaurants as of late, the food at The Mission only seems to become increasingly more over priced in comparison.  The new restaurant featuring Mayan/Aztec cuisine on Scottsdale and Thomas, Caldero, offers equally delicious food at much better prices.  Sure, the ambience isn't near as upscale or unique there, but personally, I go out to eat for a good meal, not the decoration. 

If you're looking for small portions as exorbitant prices, then yes, The Mission is for you.  If not, then look else where.
