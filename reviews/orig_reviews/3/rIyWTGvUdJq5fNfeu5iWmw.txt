Excellent chips and salsa, great patio, and consistent food. The "limit 2" margaratias are so strong I have never actually wanted a second one. I like the ahi salad a lot, which is a spicy seared ahi with their raspberry vinagrette, and the chimichanga is awesome. Dine on the patio or the bar for the best service, as sometimes inside it can be terrible. The patio is also great in the evening when the place is lit up with christmas lights and you get the view of the beautiful water features and scuptures. Keep in mind the Arizona Center, being the lush green place it is, has somewhat of a cockroach problem in the summer when it is warm, and them suckers are HUGE. Never seen one near the restaurants though. The menu has something for everyone, and everything is decent. If not for the proximity to my home, and the patio, this would be a sub-par bet, however.
