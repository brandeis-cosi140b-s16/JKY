I had the beef tacos and thought they were really good... We got there for the happy hour where they were doing 2/1 margaritas which were made really well and the staff was very nice..

The only drag is that Hard Rock is the hang out for the local turds, tourist Goomba's and the wanna be rockers... That was the only thing that took away from this place.
