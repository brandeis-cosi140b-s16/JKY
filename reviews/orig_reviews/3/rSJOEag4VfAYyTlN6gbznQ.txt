Good appetizers & great happy hour prices! We had the mini chimis and cheese quesadilas. We went there not too hungry, on a Sat afternoon. Was a bit taken aback to see young waitresses that looked like minors, showing way too much cleavage. i am sure they are not minors. Felt like telling them to go home & wear a real shirt :) Anyway, I guess that is the vibe they are going for. Did not seem like a lewd place though and there weren't any misbehaved drunks or anything. But it was noon.
