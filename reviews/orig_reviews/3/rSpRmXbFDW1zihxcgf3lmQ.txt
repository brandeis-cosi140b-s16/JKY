While me and some friends were walking around on a lazy Sunday we stumbled into this place.

The people who worked here were friendly, it wasn't too busy, prices were reasonable (especially for Vegas), and the food was okay.'

As soon as we sat down we were serves chips and three different types of salsa which were all surprisingly good. I ordered the house margarita which was delish and we got an appetizer sampler to split between three girls. The server was also nice enough to inform us that for $2 or $3 more we can get three of each of the appetizers, instead of two of each on our sampler, so that all of us can have one of each appetizer. The appetizer was okay though, nothing too special, but I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a hotel restaurant.

Service was good, our server was very friendly and informative, but I was really peeved that I had to ask for a water refill (TWICE). It was a Sunday afternoon in Vegas. Hellooooo, I'm obviously hungover and in desperate need of water.
