Not too bad for happy hour, if you can get a seat at the bar.  If not, it's regular prices for you.  Also, the portions have gotten smaller on their oh so tasty apps (in particular, the beef skewers).  

Note to the owner, please don't park behind your patrons, making it impossible for them to exit the space without a spotter and a 20 point turn.  That sucks.
