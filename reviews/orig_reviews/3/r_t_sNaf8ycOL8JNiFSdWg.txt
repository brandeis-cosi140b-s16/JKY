Heard a lot of hype about this place, so I gave it a try. The ambiance was nice and upscale, the waiters and waitress were all very nice, they always had a smile on there face. But now to the food, like the other reviews said its like a Mexican tapas, which can get expensive real quick. I ordered all 3 guacamole's that they offer and all of them were good but nothing that blew my mind.  Ordered the asada tacos and I thought they were just alright.. The asada chunks were to big for my taste..I also ordered the pastor tacos... Now those were pretty good. I really wanted some carnitas, but they did not offer that, so hopefully in the future they do.  All in all I was expecting more from all the hype I have been hearing... I will come back for sure, but I wish I found my go to Mexican restaurant, but I did not. The search continues...
