I visit Vegas once a year and I come here each time. The food is good enough for a return trip each year. The chips and salsa is good. We ordered regular nachos and they were ok, I was hopping for more than two levels of chips and a lot more cheese. I usually get the beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was excellent but the enchilada could be better. Rice is good and beans is ok. The service is very good, friendly and the wait time is reasonable. This may not sound like a great review but I know I will be back because when you are in the mood for Mexican food it gets the job done!
