I've been to this place twice now and haven't found the delicious meal everyone speaks of yet.  Had pizza the first time and it was so-so .. Had huevos rancheros today and the sauce was so overpowering.  The potatoes and beans were good though... The extra $2 on sausage I could have done without but I wanted to try it :) 
I'm going to check this place out again and try something different.... If at first you don't succeed try try again. I like the ambiance and yes prices are a lil high but the place is little what do you expect... it's the exclusivity factor
