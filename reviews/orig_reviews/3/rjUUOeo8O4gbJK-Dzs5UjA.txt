We tried out Taco Guild because we had a hankering for  tacos and America's was closed on Sunday. I love how they re-purposed the church building and the bar looks awesome. The drink menu was attractive but that isn't what we were there for. I might come back to hang out at the bar sometime but we came for the tacos. On par with every new, hip restaurant in town, the music was too loud , the place is designed to be loud and it's not conducive to having a conversation. I'm being a little more generous in my rating than I might be because it's only been open a week. If I were only rating the food I would only be at two stars because you can get good street-style tacos elsewhere that are just as good at almost half the price. I was surprised that ala carte tacos were $4.00. I expected them to be bigger and better at that price. We ordered the ceviche of the day which was nothing more than tiny shrimp and a few pieces of white fish with some mango and onions. When I saw how small the portion was I immediately thought it to be was overpriced at $10. It was nothing special. I won't be ordering that again and I don't recommend it unless you want to spend an extra $10. We didn't enjoy the chips they served with the ceviche either. They looked interesting and there was twice as many as needed for the small amount of ceviche, just didn't like them. We liked the chips that were served with the guacamole better. The guac was which was fresh and very good. Maybe I'll give the food a try another time but I think I'm more likely to come back for drinks and eating will be my secondary focus.
