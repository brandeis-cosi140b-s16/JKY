Is it good? Couldn't really tell over the heat. I knew this going in, I like spicy and often think places under estimate how spicy they think their food is. Not here. I had enchiladas, they were spicy. Service was great, atmosphere in the restaurant is colorful. It is a great experience but probably won't make it onto the regular rotation.
