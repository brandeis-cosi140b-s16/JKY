This is more of a 3.5.  I was going to put 4 stars for the chicken fusion flautas I got but I have to take 0.5 off because I found a toothpick in it.  Apparently it was there to keep the flautas rolled and it was not taken out properly.  The manager did take off the $8 from the total of the check though.

Other than that, it seemed to be a popular place at lunch.  There was even a reserved sign on one of the back tables.
