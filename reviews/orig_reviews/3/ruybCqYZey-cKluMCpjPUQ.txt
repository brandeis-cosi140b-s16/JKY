I do not understand the very low reviews that have been posted. Pleasantly spiced food, very good service and a nice atmosphere. It did have a definite resort feel to it, and there is a resort next door. This is probably the reason some of the prices are up where they are.

Okay, the bathrooms were small for this size of a restaurant. Tiny, in fact. The men's room had a tight stall and a small urinal. The ladies' room was of a similar size, I'm told.

Tables - no booths.

So far, some of the better Mexican food we've found in Phoenix.

No lunch menu or specials offered, or we'd give it another star.
