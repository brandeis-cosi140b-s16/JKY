I cheated and read reviews before going, so I knew to order the Nachos Supreme which were really pretty good.  Well, at least, I gobbled them totally down as quick as I could.
Big serving with lots of toppings, too.
If you want jalapenos--and the mild kind in brine like I like--just ask for it.
Good food, good service...it's ok...not fabulous but ok.
Been here since 1945, so they must have some fans out there.
