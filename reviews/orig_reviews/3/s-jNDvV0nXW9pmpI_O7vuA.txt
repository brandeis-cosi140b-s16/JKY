Came here recently and it had been a while, so we were pretty excited. We sat down and noticed it was a new menu...A new menu devoid of some of our favorite dishes, with higher prices and less selection. Fail.

They took off their beer battered fish tostadas, which were my wife's favorite. She ordered the nachos and didn't love them, and I ordered some very underwhelming chicken tacos. The chicken was bland, the tacos were small, but the dish was $15.

Service was still good, and it remains a nice atmosphere, but I am very disappointed in the changes. We may try it again (especially if they get the fish tostadas back on the menu), but it's dropped a couple of levels.
