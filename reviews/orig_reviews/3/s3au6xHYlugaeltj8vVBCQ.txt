Ate here just aftr getting into town for a 1 night stay.  Stayed at the Monte Carlo and figured it was right outside our hotel so why not.  We were tired and really didn't want to eat much so we stuck with apps as our dinner.  The place wasn't busy and the atomsphere was nice.  Every 30 minutes or so they spin a wheel that  has drink specials, I got the Crown and Coke.  We ordered the Spicy Chicken Quesadilla, Angry Calamari and a side of rice.  The Quesadilla was big and enough for one person to eat, stuffed full of chicken.  The calamari came with 3 dipping sauces and the chipotle was the best.  It took 10 minutes for them to bring the rice out after reminding them of it.  it was nice a nd relaxing after a 3.5 hour drive.  Good for large groups and plenty to choose from in the menu.
