People always tell me they are better than chipotle and in some ways they are. Other ways I feel like they are trying to make a buck off you for stupid things that are already free at chipotle. They charge extra for cheese, sour cream, mild sauce etc.  Seriously for what I get at chipotle I end up spending at least $5.00 more between my husband and I. 

   Though if this is the only "Mexican" restaurant nearby I suggest getting the Sweet Pork Barbacoa. Drink wise they offer a better selection since the have horchata, and limeades.
