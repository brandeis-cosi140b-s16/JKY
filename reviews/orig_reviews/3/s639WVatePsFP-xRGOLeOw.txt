Went in with a couple of friends for a post-softball tournament drink.  Didn't get served for quite a while; all we had on our table were the menus and the chips/salsa.  No water?!

When we ordered our drinks, we got the typical "you're not ordering anything else tonight?/Well, I guess I'd better go work some other tables for a bigger tip" vibe from our waitress.  So what? Serve ALL of your customers the same and you'll be compensated.  Silly.

Yummy margaritas, though.  Chips and salsa don't QUITE compare to Aunt Chilada's, but they were better than most (ahem...chain restaurants...).
