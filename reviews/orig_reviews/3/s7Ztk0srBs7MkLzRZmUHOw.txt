I fondly remember the original Matta's down on Main St.... Anyway, it was very slow around 1pm and no one seated me after 5 minutes of standing/waiting in the main dining area (several other frustrated patrons just left). I had a better experience once I moved to the "cantina side". The chips and salsa where well made but needed more kick. I did enjoy my taco and tostada combo with rice and beans.
