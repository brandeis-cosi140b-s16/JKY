This place was just okay. I think I was hoping to find a hole in the wall gem, but I didn't. 

I had three tacos and some chips and salsa. overall total was around 10 bucks. All the salsa was fresh and had I had many choices. The taco's were just okay. I have had better and I have had worst. Being that I think there are better options in the same price range I will prob go to them the next time I am looking for this type of food.
