I do like this place the food is pretty good the wait staff is wonderful and the music is great! When we were there the live music was amazing!, then the either owner or manager was talking to a table and literally said "shhhhh" to the gentleman playing and then said something like "not so loud" I thought it was a little rude. Don't have live music if you can't enjoy it. Other than that this is a great place to eat just a little expensive in my opinion.
