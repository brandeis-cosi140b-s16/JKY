Two friends invited me to go out for lunch and it was decided to go to Gallo Blanco. We arrived during the lunch hour so we had about a 10 minute wait. Not bad for lunch hour. There was a lot of activity and while you waited you had to continually move to get out of the way of others. 

The decor is pleasant and fits the restaurant theme. I would call this place trendy. This is not a bad word. I use this word to describe the make up of some restaurants. Mostly young, this is the place to eat, fresh local food, no preservatives added. 

One friend got the Ensalada Cortada salad, other got the Ceviche and the Ahi Tacos. I got a Ahi taco and Quesadilla. Two of us had Ice tea, the other a diet coke. 

I know everyone enjoyed the meal and company of each other. I was told the salad was very good. I did not do a taste test. I did try the Ceviche. I have never eaten it before so I do not have anything to judge it from. The presentation was good. (looked good to the eye) I was expecting it to have a more spicy taste. It did not taste bad in any way. It just did not taste as I expected. The Ahi tacos were excellent. The Ahi was cooked just right. Seared lightly. The Ice tea was a peach flavored and was very good. The waiter could of done a better job of keeping them filled. 

I thought the food was priced right maybe a little high for the portion size. Everything I had was taste. I would definitely return again to try something different. Except I would have to have another Ahi taco. The portions are small so order a little more than you would at most restaurants. Oh and enjoy. 

The best part was dining with friends. We had a great time eating and talking.

Would of given 4 stars if the waiter and been more attentive. I will definitely give them another try.
