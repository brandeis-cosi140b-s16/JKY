Like Annie had written, service was not great.  I was the one who asked the waiter how is the bread made for the bread pudding, his answer was "I don't know."  WTH????  Don't know how to ask? Guess not since he didn't want to find out.  

Anyways, the decor was very pretty, fine dining-like.  The bar area was very nice too, with cabinets on the back wall with installed mirror.

These are the food we tried:
-queso flameado *(Very nice combination...cheese, mushroom, cilantro.   Very good)
-seabass (I didn't try it, but Annie had typed "...was perfectly steamed and seasoned.")
-Carnitas (Some chunks were tender and nice, a few were dry)
-Flan (We all liked it very much...As Annie said, "REAL FLAN."  
-Sweet corn tamale (this was quite tasty)

Conclusion:  My two friends loved it, I'm iffy about it.
