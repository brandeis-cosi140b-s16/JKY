Can't beat the $2 tacos, and the rest of the food is well portioned for the cost. We went there 3 times and 2 times they were terribly understaffed. My husband and I made the mistake of sitting at a table the first time and then sat at the bar the two times thereafter. A lot of customers at the tables came up to the bar to order and the bartender refused to serve them and said they had to wait for the waiter/waitress. Even after the customers said no one has come by in 20 minutes, the bartender wouldn't serve them (this was our problem during the first visit too). They also have the best selection of tequila out of many of the tequila bars we went too. They had my husband's favorite, corralejo, which we couldn't find anywhere else. I found it curious that the bartender kept pushing $2 Jose Silver shots even when customers came up requesting better quality and more expensive tequilas.
