Definitely go for the Border Brunch (unlimited small plates AND bottomless mimosas)!

I was pretty stoked to try this place out, since my friends raved about their first visit. The food was great, but the service extremely lacking considering that the place wasn't even packed. Mimosas came out slowly to the point that we had to ask; not only that, the food too was slowly paced. Ok, onward to what was ordered. This was last month so I sort of forgot my feelings toward some dishes.

Fried Green Tomatillos

Bacon and Egg Quesadilla

Chicken and Waffle

Churro Tots - strangely, I think I prefer Costco's churro for a crisper execution.

Huevos Rancheros

Machaca Chilaquiles

Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - there was so much grits leftover; I think at this point we too much heavy food.

Egg White Oysters Rockefeller

Green Corn Tamales - these were great. Warm and smooth corn right out of the wrap.

Breakfast Fries

Capirotada French Toast
