I went to Los Taqutios last weekend. There was a play at the Ahtawukee Children's Theater that day and after the play, we grabbed lunch. We went at 3:00 P.M. and I was expecting more people to be there. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I wanted to go. I got a carneasada burrito with no beans. It's not that beans make me gassy, I just don't like them. At the first few bites, it was flavorless. I could barely taste the cheese, the meat was dry, plus the burrito wrap (bread) was the most flavorful thing in the burrito believe it or not. The burrito got better on each bite, but it wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had. I enjoyed my burrito. You know that cliche saying "The first bite's always the best." It was the other way around with the burrito. The other people that were with me were happy, except for one. She had a  shrimp taco, a fish taco, carnitas burrito and she said it was a little bland. The other person with me is the only one out of us 3 who really enjoyed his meal beginning to end but, he also gave it 3 stars. The place is a little dirty. There was a piece of tomato    on the seat at the booth we sat at. The service was friendly. What confused me was that on the menu, it said that they have Mr. Pibb but, on the soda machine it said Dr. Pepper so that confused me. We drove home with a full belly and an o.k. meal.
