If you're in the Red Rock casino area and want upscale Mexican, this is the place to go. The only other option that I know of, Cabo inside the casino, closed. The first time I came here I hated it. The next time it was better, and now I think it's a-ok. 

The past two visits I've had the short rib taquitos ($8.95). So far, it's the best thing on the menu. The house salad ($7.95) was decent, but forgettable. With the taco sampler ($8.95) you get to choose which three tacos you'd like to try. Among the choices are carnitas, potato and mushroom, rock shrimp, fish, chicken, and carne asada. My wife and I split the platter, with her ordering a potato and portabella taco (yukon gold potatoes, stewed with chipotle peppers, caramelized onions, spicy tomato sauce and queso fresco) and me getting two al pastor tacos (achote marinated pork shoulder with grilled pineapple serrano salsa and lime). The tortillas were dry and ready to crack, but the pork was well seasoned and topped with peppers. They were decent but they won't make me forget some of the street tacos found around town anytime soon.

The restaurant is kid friendly -- mine had the cheese quesadilla ($6) and thought it was ok -- and their booths make it convenient to corral the little ones so they don't wander around.
