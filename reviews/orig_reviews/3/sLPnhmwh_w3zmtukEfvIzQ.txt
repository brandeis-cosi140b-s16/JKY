Off night, perhaps?  We went to Dick's for dinner last night.  I ordered the "New Mexican" platter.  I lived next to a chile field in Las Cruces,NM for four years, walking distance to the Mesilla plaza, so I know quality New Mexican cuisine.  I was not impressed in the least.  My burro was COLD in the middle.  Like out of the fridge cold.  When I told the waiter he didn't bat an eye, like it happens all the time, and had the kitchen make me another.  They did comp me a beer for the experience, but my meal was already ruined; by the time the replacement burro made it to the table I was already full.  I am a big chile relleno fan; I try the relleno everywhere I go.  I did not like Dick's relleno; the chile was stringy and not spicy, and there was so much (yellow) cheese and sauce on top that the batter was mushy, not crispy.  I seriously prefer the rellenos at Filibertos to this one.  I did like their red sauce; it is difficult to find red sauce that is appropriately spicy in Phoenix.  I've had better green sauce though.  Overall, this meal made me miss New Mexico more that ever.  On the plus side, the service was impeccable, the atmosphere in the "wine room" we were seated in is lovely (minus the unnecessary TV), and the drinks were decent.  My husband liked his bloody mary.  I would give this place another chance, but this particular experience was disappointing.
