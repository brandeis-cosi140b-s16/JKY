It's OK.  Three stars are hard to write because it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either.  It was just all right.  Definitely a college spot where many a drunk coed has eaten late at night...speaking of, what is up with these restaurants that let you write all over their walls, tables and ceilings? That is such a pet peeve of mine.  I don't want to eat while staring at "Steve is a gay-fer" on the wall.

The tofu fuma taco has a nice spicy sauce on it, the carnitas are tasty, the carne asada quesadilla was my favorite.  We went at 11:30 and they were already out of two tacos.  I feel like I could just go to a closer taco shop and be just as satified if not more (like Los Tacos).

I live by Red Rock and I probably wouldn't make a drive all the way down to Yayo just for their tacos.  But if I was on that side of town, then I would venture in here again.
