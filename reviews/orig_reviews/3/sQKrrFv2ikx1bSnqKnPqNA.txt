Two out of the four of us got the special.  A $26 filet wrapped in jalape√±o bacon.  We ordered them med/well and medium doneness.  When they arrived, we were surprised to see one was med/rare and the other was extremely rare.  The waitress offered to take the food back and have it cooked longer.  We respectfully declined.  We didn't feel comfortable sending food back into the kitchen.  Otherwise, the vegetables and potatoes were tasty.  The other meals were fair as well.
