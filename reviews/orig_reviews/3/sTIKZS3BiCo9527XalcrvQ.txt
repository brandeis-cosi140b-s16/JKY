Another place opens for lunch at Hard Rock.

Service: good! Very friendly

Food: I don't eat taco, so the only thing I can order from the manuel is grilled salmon and veggies. Salmon was fresh and nicely made, but the veggies were all too oily and burnt.

They do have a full bar inside, so if you like taco, like to drink, this is a place to be.
