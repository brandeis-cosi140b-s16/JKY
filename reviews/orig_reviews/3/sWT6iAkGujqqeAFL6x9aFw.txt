Warning: their giant margaritas are giant.  And it's $28 a pop.  And no, they don't put the price on the menu.  So watch out.

Also, we thought there was a typo on the menu when we looked at it.  A four-item combo cost more than the five.  So obviously we ordered the five-item, and paid less.  That's a nice bonus.

The shredded beef quesadilla is yummy.  And the portion is huge.  So go wild.
