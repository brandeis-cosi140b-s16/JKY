This is a higher rating than I believe I may really feel about this place, but the 3 stars is just due to the idea (original for Vegas but of course nothing new in other cities), the supppppper nice owner who talks to you and was so kind to me and my hubby at his other restaurant. 

Sushi burrito, pick the burritos you want or create your own. Both times here I picked the ones they have on the menu, Rockport my first time in and Long Beach my second time. The Rockport had all the ingredients I love, but the taste was lacking, it had barely any flavor. I got the combo (who does not love taro chips???). Hmmm tell me why is there huge chunks of salt and furikake on the bottom of the tray but it does not stick to the chips, making it completely pointless to have that on there. Now the turn off for me was the canned nacho cheese side for the dip. Taro chips were totally covered in nacho cheese sauce overpowering it and took away all of the are chip flavor. Nacho cheese and regular chips, but not with taro chips it does not work. In addition I saw a girl get taro chips to go and her portion looked 3x my size in a paper bag. Mine had about 8 chips filling up only 1/3 of the tray it was served in. Maybe pick another tray or fill up the chips into the entire tray so it does not look like much of it is missing. I tried putting salsa on top as the owner suggested and I am sorry, but none of the salsas tasted good with the burrito. I really don't get it at all. I tried every salsa there (which they all seem canned salsa. One I swear is Pace Picante salsa for sure.) Not a good match with sushi. I felt the portion was pretty small when my total with the combo was close to $15. 

Second time there, opted for just the Long Beach and no combo since I was not impressed with the taro chips experience. Again, no taste on the burrito. 

I loveeee sushi and I wanted to like this restaurant, but it just did not live up to my expectations.
