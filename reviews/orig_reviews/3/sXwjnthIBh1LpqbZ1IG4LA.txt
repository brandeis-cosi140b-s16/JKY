This place was on Groupon awhile back ,so I went expecting mediocracy and they did not disappoint!

I went in today for lunch with my coworkers 15 'til noon. Surprisingly we were seated right away, which was a plus in my book. After scanning the menu, I decided to go for the Nachos Florentine. They were... okay, I guess. The clips were cool - spinach tortilla. The tablespoon of grilled chicken was also pretty tasty. The nachos also had spinach, some sort of sauce (maybe Alfredo) and a ton of sun-dried tomatoes. They were okay. With less chips and tomatoes and more chicken, they would've have been pretty decent.

The atmosphere is nice - bar-like. The service was fast and good. I wouldn't jump at the opportunity to revisit this place, but I would go if I were in the neighborhood craving bar food.
