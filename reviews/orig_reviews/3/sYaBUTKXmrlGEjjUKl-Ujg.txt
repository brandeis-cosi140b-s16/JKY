I just had lunch here today for the first time. The decor and setup of the restaurant is awesome. The chips and salsa (two kinds, both delicious) came out quickly. Both my friend and I had enchiladas, and they were covered in a thick sour cream sauce. The enchiladas themselves were very bland. Our server, who was excellant and polite, asked if all was ok. When we explained that the sauce was too heavy, he apologized. Soon, the manager came out and asked if all was ok. We told him that the sauce was too heavy. He asked if we would like something else, but we had already finished the meal. He ended up giving us half off the meal, even though we told him he did not need to do that. I will definitely come back to this restaurant based on the level of customer service provided. The food did not wow me, but the management did.
