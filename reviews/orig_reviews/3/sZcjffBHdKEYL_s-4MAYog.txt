I am a fan of hanging out in NoDa and I have loads of friends who LOVE this place. I however just didn't find it to be anything extraordinary.  There's nothing really to say oh this was awful, or this was unacceptable. It just came across so bland. The decor has got a NoDa feel which is good but again nothing to make it stand out. The wait for this place is outrageous which really leads me to a conclusion that it's very overrated. I will have to go back and give it another shot but for now I will stick with 3 stars. I hate that I can't really give a better review but the whole experience just left me underwhelmed and was not very memorable.
