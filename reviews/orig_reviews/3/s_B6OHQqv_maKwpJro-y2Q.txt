Fun Environment. Outstanding Guac. Meh Sushi.

I would have loved this joint if I were visiting for appetizers, drinks and fake tits.. but I was here for sushi. Unfortunately, SumoMaya fell short in this department. The whole fusion thing is a cool concept, but I feel some of the flavors clashed a bit. Giant chunks of cucumber in all the rolls pissed me off.

Service was great despite the place being packed.
