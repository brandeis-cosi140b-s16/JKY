I've had this groupon for Padre's that had been burning a hole in my pocket for a long time! Finally as it neared expiration date I ventured into Phoenix to try it out. It's a cute little restaurant with a really cool red door!

FYI - there's a check-in deal here! $.01 margarita! Mmhmm you saw that right! Certainly not the best I have had by any means but you can't really go wrong for that price right?

After ordering our drinks we decided to splurge on an appetizer so we started out with the Queso Fundido. I was so excited about it because hey it should be all about the cheese and as a Wisconsin boy, I'm all about it! Unfortunately it was more about the spinach and not so much about the queso - it tasted really good, just missing a lot of the main ingredient in my opinion...

He ordered the Mexico City Fajitas! Really well cooked chicken, with the right amount of everything! Super good! I ordered the Pollo Rellano. The chicken (as in the previous dish) was really well cooked but was lacking on the stuffed part. So it was good - just nothing wow worthy. My dish came with side of guajillo mashed potatoes - which look like a pile of mashed sweet potatoes - I personally wasn't a huge fan of the taste but as usual I'll finish my plate anyway :)

The service was pretty good, it was just a very laid back environment, which I wasn't really expecting for some reason.

I'm not dying to go back by any means but if someone wanted to try it out I would go again!
