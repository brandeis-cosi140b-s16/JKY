Does "authentic" mean "good"?

Not necessarily. 

I suppose the Comedor is more authentic than a place like Macayo's or Garcia's because they offer such typically Mexican delicacies as tripa and cabeza. They also have a menu full of the fish and mariscos that anglos tend not to order in typical Gringo-Mex outlets. They also don't drown their entrees under an avalanche of yellow cheddar cheese.

But as an experience I would say even if it does offer a greater selection of authentic menu items, it's not really that much more satisfying than the other places. 

I had the carne asada tacos, which were serviceable if not thrilling. The dish came out warm and didn't have the tell-tale signs of having sat under the salamander for longer than it should. At one time these tacos would have been a revelation to anyone weaned on the Lawry's hard-shell ones. Now, with their soft, grilled dual corn tortilla goodness wrapping them, they resemble any number of other "street tacos" that have become more and more popular recently.

The atmosphere is . . . well. . . "comedor" means "dining room" in Spanish. That's what it is: A big room full of tables. Mariachis were a nice touch.

We waited 30 minutes at lunchtime on a Saturday to get a table. Maybe that's why I am less than thrilled.  The place doesn't want for popularity. Aside from the wait, I had no complaints with the service.

So to the uninitiated, I would go with an open mind, not expecting a life-changing experience. I would also advise people to try the things like the lengua molcajete (a sort of tongue stew served in a lava bowl). The availability of stuff like that is what really sets Comedor apart.

And keep in mind that "authentic" doesn't always mean "good".
