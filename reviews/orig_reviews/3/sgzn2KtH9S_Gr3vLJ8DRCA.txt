Came here for happy hour. 5$ patron shots that are bigger than 1oz it seems. I am on an empty stomach. $3 draft beers need I say more. 
I mean  We get "to go cups with our beers that we couldn't finish".
How awesome is that.
The food was good as well. The Rib platter was cooked to just right, the meat almost slid off the bones. Meals are a little pricey, and if the bar is full you must sit in the dinning section where you are required to order one Entree per person. I felt that was a little ridiculous, but went with it since I was hungry.
