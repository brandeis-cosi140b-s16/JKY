Food was good (both the Asian and Mexican dishes we had), but the small portions in conjunction with the high prices mean that I won't be going back.

I also agree with those saying this is not considered Fusion really.  I was expecting something more like Chino Bandido (an asian/mexican fusion place in Arizona) or something like that.
