First impression, they serve gold here for the price of silver. The parking lot practically required a lottery ticket to get a spot.  Thankfully,  I'm lucky.  Our party of 9 was seated right about our reservation time. There was a 2 hour wait for walk ins.  Refreshments, adult and child, were served quickly.   Guacamole, check,  chips, salsa, beans galore. Now, for the meal.   I purchased the beef tamale and beef enchilada. They were both red sauced. I think it was the only tamale on the menu,  no green sauce. Booooo.  It wasn't  amazing, but I did enjoy the beans and rice.   I took leftovers and consumed the next day. I felt like the hulabaloo missed me. I'll go and try something else with green sauce, if they have any. Oh,  I did get some carne asada chunks in my enchilada. That was tastier than the shredded beef that occupied the majority of my meal.
