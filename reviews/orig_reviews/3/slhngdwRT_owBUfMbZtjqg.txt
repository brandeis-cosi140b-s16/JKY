Casa Don Juan gets 3 stars because the description is spot on, "A-OK." I like going here, it's like my mom's most favorite Mexican restaurant ever. However, if I had a choice I would go to Lindo Michoacan.

The last time we went was for my boyfriends birthday. My mom ordered a whole fried fish covered in garlic. The thing could have easily fed 4 people. It smelled wonderful. However, I have a problem eating anything that stares back at me. I opted for two shredded beef enchiladas.  They were very flavorful and came with very large portions of rice and beans covered in cheese. My bf had a combo plate and he also seemed to enjoy it as well.

The portions are huge and very filling. That is usually the problem for me at Casa Don Juan. Now I am not complaining about being served a goodly amount of food for some pretty reasonable prices, but for some reason, every time I go, and no matter the amount of food I eat, it sinks like a stone later. And its not like I over eat each time. I seriously go into a food coma afterwards, and it feels like my stomach is filled with lead.

As for the margaritas and pina coladas, hmm, they were not sweet. I've had better ones at Outback . . .

I do have to add that they have excellent service. The server asked if it was a special occasion. We told him yes. They were going to bring us some free ice cream but we told them we were Very full. Instead he brought a plate of whipped cream which he dabbed on my bf's nose and the servers sang a birthday song to him. They also have one of those photo ops, where they take a picture of your group and give you a free postcard then later try and sell you a photo (totally optional and there was no pressure).
