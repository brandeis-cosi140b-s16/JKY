This is an alright Mexican restaurant inside Planet Hollywood. It tries to be more of a bar/lounge atmosphere late a night. They do karaoke some nights. On my most recent visit, we opted to sit at the bar and have some drinks and appetizers. The bartender was friendly and attentive. The margaritas were the best part of our experience. They were large and really well-made. You choose which type of tequila you want, how you want (rocks, blended, etc.) and if you want any added flavors. It's a pretty cool way to have a margarita menu. The queso I had was pretty tasty and it was served with fresh tortillas. The salsas were pretty good too. Though, chips and salsa is not complimentary, you have to pay for it. All in all, it's an a-ok spot. I wouldn't make a special trip to PH just to eat here. But I would eat here again if I was at PH and hungry.
