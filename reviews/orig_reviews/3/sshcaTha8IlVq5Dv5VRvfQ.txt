All that was missing were The Griswolds and cousin Eddie. 

I immediately saw that this place was a hit with the locals because it wasn't very pretty. However, it smelled delicious and I bet the fajitas were amazing. 

Some friends and I went for margaritas and appetizers; specifically, Chili Con Queso. Damn, it was good! I had three bowls! And so were our margaritas. Delicious! 

But the appearance needed a make over asap! Sorry, but this restaurant belonged in Laughlin, NV. If you've been there, you'll know what I mean. It was like nothing had changed since 1979. 

I don't see myself going back. Sorry friends!
