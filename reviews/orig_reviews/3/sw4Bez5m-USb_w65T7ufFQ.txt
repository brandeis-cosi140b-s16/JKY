We had a reservation for 10 and were seated promptly. Our waiter was attentive and got us out our drinks quickly. They have a small computer screen at the table from which you could order drinks which was kind of cool. The food was pretty average however with no one too impressed with their dish. The chips they brought out with 3 different salsas were excellent! Best part of the experience. They did goof up one order that didn't get done. Just so happened to be the birthday boys. Manager was good about it and brought out a complimentary shot of tequila. My biggest gripe was very limited beer selection. I know it's a Mexican restaurant, but their beer on the whole is boring. Get a few local taps installed and correct this please. I did no drink one, but apparently the margaritas were pretty good and not a bad deal by the pitcher.
