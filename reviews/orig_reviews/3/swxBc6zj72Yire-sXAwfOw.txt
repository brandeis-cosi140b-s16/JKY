I think think this place is overrated because of it uniqueness.  I mean, if you've never heard of this restaurant, you've probably never heard of chinese-mexican food.  That said, I think that uniqueness does make it a cool place.  I like the food.  When we went in the girl had us try samples of the different things, and she was super knowledgeable and very kind, not to mention super hot.  I don't know where she was from but she had a super cool accent that I couldn't pin, which definitely added to her hotness.  I almost asked her where she was from but I didn't.  Anyway, when I tried one of the samples she said "at first it's sweet, and then you'll get a little kick right about.....now!"  She was dead on I was very impressed.   After the many years this place has been around, I am very surprised they haven't changed the way the ordering works.  It is the most complex system I've ever seen in my life, and I imagine they get complaints all the time.  The flip side to that is that the employees are very eager to make sure you understand how it works, and they help you right along.  The snicker doodles they give with the meal are good.  The atmosphere is a little interesting at this location because it's like a cafeteria.  I would definitely tell everyone to try this place at least once for the experience, and you may decide you love it and come back for more.
