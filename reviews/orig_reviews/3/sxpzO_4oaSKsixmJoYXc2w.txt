Extremely HOT in this place.  Swamp cooler inside restaurant.  Needs improvement before they reach Gallo Blanco status.   

Service was lacking.  Chips brought out 10 min before our guacamole appetizer.  Food took an abnormally long time.  

The rice dish (can't remember its name.  it came in an iron skillet) was burnt and stuck to the pan.  

Salads were great!
