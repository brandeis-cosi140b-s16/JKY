First impression - Amazing building and d√©cor!!!! However, the food is just okay, good but not excellent in my opinion. The service is alright but again nothing to impressive. 
I ordered the shrimp taco and due to an allergy to avocado I asked the server if the slaw could come without it. I was told that the avocado was already mixed in and that the slaw could be omitted. When the taco came it was literally a tortilla with 4 shrimp in it. It looked very sad. I had to track down another server and ask for some plain cabbage to add to my sad looking taco. After 10 Minutes that was finally delivered and I ate my okay tasting cold taco. Overall a little disappointed in the lack of care for a customers request.
