Tried El Palacio for the first time tonight. I have passed it by many times and my fiancé and I decided that tonight we would give it a try. We were seated right away in a corner booth. Our waiter was quick to bring drinks and chips and salsa and bean dip were also brought out. The bean dip was tasty and the hot salsa was good, the mild salsa was a little watery.

I ordered two mini machaca beef taquitos and a cheese enchilada with red sauce. The taquitos were really good. The cheese enchilada was okay but the red sauce tasted very generic. My fiancé got a bean burrito enchilada style and it was just okay. The rice and beans that came with my meal were very bland. Service was okay throughout our visit, slow at times but our drinks were always refilled. At the end  of meal we also received two complementary mini churro's with whipped cream which were delicious, I could have easily eaten many more of these but I am glad they cut you off at two because I'm sure they are unbelievably bad for you.

Overall it was an okay visit. I would not go out of my way to come back here but I might be back on occasion if I am in the area.
