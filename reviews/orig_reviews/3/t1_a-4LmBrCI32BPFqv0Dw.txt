The carne asada was some of the best I have had, but a bit pricey for what you get. I opted for the carne asada quesidilla ( $4.95 ) it was basically a taco sized tortilla filled with meat, cheese, and avocado and folded in half. Great flavor and was very filling. I could see going back maybe their happy hour when they have some cheap tacos.

Employees that were there when I went, were not engaging at all and did not seem happy to be there at all. There was only one table occupied outside and all the other tables were dirty..there was a female that came out to clean finally but was moving sooooooo slow that we wiped off our own table and sat down, and she never uttered a word.
