Ended up here after a game over the weekend and I liked it bc it wasn't packed like every other place on the way back to the hotel.

We got there just in time for happy hour.  Everything was $5, including the margaritas - such a great deal AND when I checked in, we got free guac.  Love it.

The food was good - not great, but, then again, we only got snacks, so whatevvs.
