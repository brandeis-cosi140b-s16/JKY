I would have to say "SUPRISE" is the first words that come to mind with this hole in the wall or you could say it is the crowds of people waiting to hit this joint all night.   I have had better, but the food was good. I had the chorizo and eggs. It could have had more spice. The tortillas were hot and fresh. I had a good experience.
