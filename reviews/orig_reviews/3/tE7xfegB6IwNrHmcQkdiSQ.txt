KoMex' fusion dishes are a little bit of a head scratcher. From what we ordered, they seemed largely like Mexican dishes with very little Korean going on outside Kimchi. The food was all solid, with the pork belly and fish tacos being the two standouts, but I was expecting more fusion and creativity going on. KoMex is very good quick (Don't call it fast!) food at cheap prices, in a bare bones setting, and a friendly staff.
