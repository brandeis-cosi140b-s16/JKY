The food here is off the chain! My wife and i shared the 3 course fajitas and the Baja fish tacos. Omg!  The fajitas were awesome. I highly recommend the vegetables here. The roasted squash is amazing. 
The fish tacos were even better. Both dishes come with pico, guac, and sour cream. 
Now the down side. Apparently they regularly have karaoke, and it's very loud. We sat on the deck overlooking the pond, yet still we had to shout to have any kind of communication. I guess it is our fault for not researching this establishment before hand. This is more a place for a party - style meal. Not very good for relaxing. We will be back. The food alone is worth the visit. $28 for the fijitas and 18 for the tacos.
