We were excited to try a new place close to home as Summerlin is in desperate need of a good Mexican restaurant but we left feeling underwhelmed. The wait for a table on a Saturday evening was about an hour so we decided to eat in the bar area. Well, we were informed you can only be served drinks and appetizers in the bar. Really? Big mistake, Pancho's! I know of no other restaurant with such a ridiculous policy. The margaritas were okay and we liked the chips and salsa. Bar waitress was fabulous and fun. I did notice that the Tiffany style chandeliers (I don't know how these fit the Mexican theme) over the bar were an afterthought as they were run on exposed electrical conduit which perplexed me as the building was just constructed.
 
We were called to the dining area after approximately 45 minutes but of the 5-6 hostesses ready to seat us, not one had a clue of what to do and we waited more than 5 minutes at the hostess stand while they figured it out.  Upon entering the dining room, I literally felt as if I had walked into a jungle. The place is filled with an extreme, almost obnoxious,  amount of artificial plants and trees. Clearly the concept of "less is more" was lost on the designers. The lighting is very bright (might want to heavily consider dimming in the evenings) and there was no background music playing so we weren't impressive with the atmosphere. Our waiter was very good and attentive which made for a pleasant dining experience. I had the lobster enchiladas (really delicious!) and my husband had chicken chimichanga (he liked it but it didn't knock his socks off). We didn't stick around to have another drink or desert because the atmosphere was not inviting. My husband commented on the walk to the car that he probably wouldn't go back and unfortunately, I'd have to agree with him.
