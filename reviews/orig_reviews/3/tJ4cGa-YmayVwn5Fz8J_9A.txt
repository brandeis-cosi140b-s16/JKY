Uneventful veggie burritos and if you're salsa fanatic like me you have to ask for tons of salsa when you get it to go because they only want to give you two to go containers.  I do like the fact that when dining in you have salsa in squirty dispensers and both the red and green are quite good.

Staff is very friendly and more than happy to give you those extra sauces to go.  I have to say the layout of the restaurant is quite uncomfortable.
