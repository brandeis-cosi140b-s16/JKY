Tried the steak chimichanga. It tasted ok, but it was little skimpy on the steak, mostly rice and beans. Also tried the Original Recipe Margarita. The menu says their motto is "less ice, more tequila". When I finished the drink, the glass was still 3/4th's full of ice, so it didn't live up to the motto. Again It tasted ok, but I've had better.  Maybe there is better food on the menu, but the two items I had were just average, not bad, but nothing special.
