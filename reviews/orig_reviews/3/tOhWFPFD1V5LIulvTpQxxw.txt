I found Urban Taco to be a bit lacking in terms of flavor. 

I stopped in recently for dinner with a friend and we settled in a corner for a drink and some chips and salsa before placing our orders. 

The girl working there was on her own, playing bartender and server. She did a good job, all things considered. As far as the tacos are concerned? I had the street tacos and wasn't blown away by them the way I was hoping to be. 

Because we did show up a bit later, we did soon realize that we only had so much time before they closed. However, the bartender/server let us stay an extra 30 minutes instead of kicking us out while she cleaned and closed up shop. I thought that was a nice gesture. 

Would I come back? 

I'm not sure I would. The restaurant competition in this area is stiff and there are a lot of "no-brainer" options in the area. I'm not sure this is one of them to be honest.
