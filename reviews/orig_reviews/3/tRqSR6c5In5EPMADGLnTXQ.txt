I usually eat at this place every single time I go to San Diego, so naturally in comparison it's not as good. But amongst other taco places in Vegas, it's still super good. Only problem is the workers are super slow most of the times that I've gone, inefficient and all over the place. One guy was super rude as he was making the taco. Almost made you want to walk away. But if you catch them on the good day, it's really worth it, and good prices too!
