I know three stars doesn't sound so great but I really have no complaints about America's Taco Shop. I thought the prices were okay for mini soft tacos at $2.35 a piece, and certainly my order of 2 carne asado tacos and 2 tacos al pastor were filling. I ordered both "America's Way" which meant adding grilled diced jalapenos, and appreciated being able to order online and pick up my takeaway order just 20 minutes later. I guess I wish I'd been able to have other selections from the shop, perhaps dining in the really charming dining room, to really get the full experience. All in all the experience was A-OK.
