I've driven past this place a hundred times, my husband and I finally made it in today for lunch. Our meal started with a generous helping of chips and salsa. My husband ordered the Mexican pizza and I the chicken tostada platter. We both liked his dish a little better but none the less they were both good. I'm only giving it 3 stars because I didn't feel like the food was super out of the ordinary and this will be a good back up if we don't make it to our usual go to Mexican restaurants.
