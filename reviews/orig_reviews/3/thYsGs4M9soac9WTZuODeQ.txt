Overrated coming from someone who spent a lot of time in TJ and was almost born there. Lol. The best tacos were Carne Asada , adobada was close but not as good as tj. I asked for tripe and the tripe was close but not as good. The lengua I ordered I never got that's why I'm knocking down a star. I still recommend it compared to a lot of places in Cali, where I'm from. Solid 3.5 Starz
