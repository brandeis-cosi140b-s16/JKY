The place wasn't crowded, and the hostess told us there was a 20-minute wait. F that - sat at the empty bar. Apparently, there's a reason the bar was empty. Slowest ass service ever! I clocked six minutes before one of the two bartenders asked if we'd like a drink menu. Had to beg for chips and salsa. Not enough spice in either, and the green was strangely sour. Got my top-shelf margarita upgraded to Patron for an extra three bucks, and was shocked to see it was delivered in a water glass. Not enough area for salt, people. There's a reason supposed Mexican restaurants use margarita glasses. And - my wife's drink had a black floater. I swapped with her and didn't complain. I sipped around it because I'm a man, dammit. Ordered a beef burrito. Presentation was excellent. Flavor was very good. Rice was dry, but that's typical. Beans were okay. If our slow-ass bartender did a little less dancing by the register and spent a little more time doing her job, TT would have earned 4 stars. Service is important, people. Great service can override a bad meal. I might have to offer some consulting services to my new Luxor friends.
