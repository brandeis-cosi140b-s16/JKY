So I came here 5 years ago and I must say my review hasn't changed: the decor is still great (love the outdoor horno) and the servers are still friendly.  The food is good but nothing spectacular.  I am disappointed that they don't serve anything with mole sauce, but I guess this is nouveau Mexican or Mexican Fusion or something so I can't expect traditional stuff.  Still like the place and would still recommend it to friends.
