Ate in the bar. Had the steak smothered in peppers and cheese. Typical Vegas hotel mex food. Nothing to go crazy about. I had 10$ dining credit so it ended up cheap. Service was way better than some of the other dining at Silverton.  Not sure I'd go back.  I just happen to be picky about good mexican fare.
