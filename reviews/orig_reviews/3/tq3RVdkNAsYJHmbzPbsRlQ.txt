I am glad I tried this place.  I had heard rumors and stopped in here with a coworker who LOVEs it here.  I enjoyed the samples they provide and ordering is a little tricky for the first timer  but they are ready and willing to help you out there at the counter.  The food combinations are unique and flavorful.  I would recommend trying the place but as most of the DDD places I have gone to, meeeh.  Don't feel the need to go back.
