This place is on the verge of five stars.  Here is what went right with the place: great tacos, taco stations were quick, salsa bar was good and plentiful, they had different creations (vampiros), and their nachos were spot on.
Here is what is wrong with the place: no fish tacos, the cashiers were horrible-they couldn't figure out the card machine and it took five of them crowding around the machine to figure out how to work it, and did I mention no fish tacos?  I feel like that is a must!

I will go back... But I hope they at least figure out the credit card machine before I do.
