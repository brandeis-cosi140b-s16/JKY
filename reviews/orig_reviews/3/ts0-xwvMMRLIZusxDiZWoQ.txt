This place is A-Ok in my book.  Very clean interior and friendly restaurant staff meet you upon entering Emilianos.  Pretty extensive options on the menu food wise.  As soon as you sit down, you're given some pretty amazing chips and salsa, which are FREE!

Next,  I ordered the tacos de carne asada.  Pretty good steak, but I've had better in the Pittsburgh area.  The salsa that came with the carne asada tacos was very good, but I spiced it up even more with some habanero hot sauce.  

Overall, I would come back, because I like the ambiance here and the servers are extra friendly.  Not a bad place to grab a drink either.
