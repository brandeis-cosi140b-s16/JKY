We were in the area and wanted some good Mexican (having settled for just 'ok' Mexican food the day before and decided to give this place a try given the strong number of good reviews.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my wife got a taco salad with shredded beef.  You order the food at the counter and have a seat and they some how figure out who to bring it to when it is done.

we were here at noon on a Saturday and the place was pretty busy so It took a bit of time to get our food but the staff was hustling. There is not a ton of seating but things seemed to turn over quickly so no one had to stand and eat. Lots of locals eating here from kids on their way home from sports to families and seniors.

The food was pretty good, but not as flavorful as their name implied but decent value. They seem to be doing a good business in this spot.
