Dos Gringos is a great place to go for a chill happy hour. Although the food and service is just average, they do have good drink specials. Corona's are $2.50 every day and they have other daily specials that are pretty sweet. 

Dos has a great outdoor patio which is great if you have a large group of people that want to sit next to eachother.
