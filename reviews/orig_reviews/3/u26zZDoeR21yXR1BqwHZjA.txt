The chips came out and they smelled awful because the oil they were fried in was rancid. We told the waitress and she brought us new chips fried in the same oil, still rancid. 

However the tacos were great, plenty of meat, very tasty!

Rice and beans were not so good. 
Good to know: tacos Ã  la carte are $4

Overall, we came for tacos and the tacos were good, so not bad.
