Dawn C. and I stop in here sometimes after doing a little shopping at Galleria Mall. I love the $3 tableside guacamole on Sundays. 

Monday-Friday they have happy hour 3 to 7 with $3 drinks and some appetizers are half off. You have to sit in the bar for that but no biggie. 

Entrees are not the most authentic Mexican grub you will find in Las Vegas but it is inexpensive and tasty.
