This was my second time here and I will say that the first time I went, it was such a great experience. The second time wasn't as good. My friend wanted a good mexican joint to eat with his family after his graduation. We had a large party of about 7 and so we called in advance. The lady on the phone said that they do not take reservations and that you just have to come in and wait. We were ok with until we showed up and then there was a large enough table that was empty that we could sit at; however the lady said that it was reserved and taken. I let her know that we just were told you can't make reservations and that you had to wait. This obviously upset us even more because the table that could have easliy sat our group was empty for at least another 10 minutes. Then 1 person showed up for the table and remained mainly empty for another 15 miutes at least. We were still waiting to be seated 30 minutes later. 

The food server forgot one of our peoples food and brought it out later. I should also mention that the food took at least 45-60 minutes to get too. They did apologize on that but didn't seem to offer anything in return. 

Although this place upset myself on my second visit and also upset the other people in the party, I still like the food here. It's a romantic setting (Back patio) and quality and filling food. If I had to rate just the service aspect I would give it 1 star, but since I am taking into consideration the food to go along with my first visit here, I give it 3 STARS. 

Let's hope that my next visit goes better.
