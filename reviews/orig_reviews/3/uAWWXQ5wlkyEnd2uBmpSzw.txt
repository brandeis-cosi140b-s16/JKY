A good friend of mine brought me here yesterday after raving about the amazing street tacos and salsa. I'm always down for good Mexican food so we hopped in the Mom-mobile and were on our way! 

I ordered the Friday special which was 2 hand tacos with choice of rice or beans. You could choose chicken or beef and I asked for one of each and asked for a side of beans as well as I wanted to get the full flavor. My friend had the street tacos pastor, asado, and carnitas style.We also shared chips and salsa with guacamole.

I ended up getting 2 beef tacos and no beans. I didn't want to make a stink about it because I didn't pick the restaurant but when I asked at the counter about the beans, they said they would bring them out and never did. Luckily my baby had beans with his cheese quesadilla so I did get to try them but meh..they were just ok. The spanish rice was under-seasoned and all I could taste was salty chicken broth. The guacamole was pretty tasty though the avocado was overpowered by the salsa that was mixed in to it. The salsa was very tasty. And I was kind of surprised that the chips and the hard shells on the tacos weren't house made or if they were...they've got it down to such a science that they seem store bought. 

My friend enjoyed his street tacos but he agreed about the rice being under-seasoned and over-brothed. 

The staff at the counter were nice, but they were firmly planted there. No one came by the tables to check on people and even though we chose to sit outside, they didn't move from their spot to let us know our food was ready. 

I'll go back to try again if we are in the area because my friend really likes it there and I want to try to get what he's seeing but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back without him.
