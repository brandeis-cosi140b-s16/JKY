I figured this would be just like any other Garcia's restaurant, but it's not, it's much better.  The food isn't what I would consider great, but pretty good.  I don't live anywhere near this location, but if I am in the area again, I will stop in for some lunch.

Oh, and I love that they actually have an American Flag flying in their dining room!!!
