If my boyfriend actually wrote the review, he'd give this place a 4/5 stars. I enjoyed it, but do I personally think its awesome? Meh...just didn't suit my tastes. It's good, but not stupendous. Will I go again? Sure, if my boyfriend wants to go the next time we're in vegas,, but I won't be going by myself.

 Pros: cheap good food, big portions, lotsa food
