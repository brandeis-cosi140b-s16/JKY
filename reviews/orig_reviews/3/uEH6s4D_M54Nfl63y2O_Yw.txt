I was pretty impressed with Cilantro Tacos, especially being in the area that it's in and the kind of foot traffic it gets. 

It is good food, however, I felt that the food tasted very clean..like it could have been seasoned more or been more flavorful. Definitely could have been less oily. HOWEVER, this place got my third star for its excellent ceviche. I mean damnnn. It was good guys. If you haven't tried it, you're really missing out!!!! I also really enjoyed the carnitas, but again, it was barely seasoned...but very, very tender and juicy. 

I'm definitely coming back to try the desserts! Nothing can stop me from getting my sweet fix. Nothing.

The service was very good. Very good. The waiter was really friendly and funny. He told us they're waiting on getting their liquor license--that's the SPIRIT, right?! And of course, I was way too excited about that! :D

I will definitely come in again and again for that ceviche. No kidding. Look out for me, Cilantro Tacos, I'm about to eat all your shrimppppp!!!!
