im a true foodie so sometimes its hard for me to give anything over 3 stars, i have to visit it more than once. i was on a trip to Phoenix and i went here for happy hour. First the cornbread is simply to die for i searched for the recipe when i got home. the guacamole was okay, mine is usually better. the drinks was just okay i know they are known for their frozen margaritas but mine was  soso. did they get me where i need to be, yes but was it memeorable no. will i go back yes if im in the area and dying of hunger.
