They are good but pricey and sometimes when you bite into what you're thinking is a delicious taco you'll find some kind of strange fatty meat or connective tissue.  This has happened twice on two separate occasions.  They need to do a better job of cleaning up the excess bits off the meat either before or after cooking to get a 4th star from me.
