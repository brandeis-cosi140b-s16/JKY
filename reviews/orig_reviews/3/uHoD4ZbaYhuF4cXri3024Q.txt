They had the Groupon, so I decided to give this place a go. The pictures made it seem like real Mexican, so I was excited to try.

I had a pina colada (virgin), guacamole with chips and a chicken quesadilla. 

I really liked the guacamole. They serve it in some sort of edible tortilla bowl. Pretty good. You also get beans and salsa with chips. Beans are worst than canned beans. Absolutely no flavor. The salsa is too spicy for my palate, so I can't really judge.

The chicken quesadilla was just ok. Nothing to really write home about.

Overall, this place wasn't good enough to return to. Roberto's is way better and cheaper.
