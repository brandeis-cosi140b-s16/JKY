Was visiting Madison for the Great Midwest Beer Fest and prior to getting in line for the opening we headed west a bit and via Yelp landed in this little Taqueria.  From the front it almost looks too small to dine-in as there are no tables and just a small counter.  But the server will lead you back, literally through the kitchen, to the dinning area in the back of the restaurant.

As we were in a bit of a hurry I didn't spend too much time searching the menu, quickly selecting a torta.

Our server brought some colored chips and two types of salsas; the chips were good but the salsa was nothing great.  The torta on the other hand was excellent, the steak was juicy and had a hint of grilled, smoky flavor.  The sandwich was huge and was more food then needed (had to save room for 5 hours worth of beer sampling).
