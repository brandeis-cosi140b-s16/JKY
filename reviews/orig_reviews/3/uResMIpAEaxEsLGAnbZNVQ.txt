Decent deals during all day happy Hour on Sunday. The $3 quesadilla was normal size and stuffed with mostly decent carne asada, but not perfect. The $1 ear of corn on a stick was slathered in mayo, which might have been better to eat in-house, than to-go when it was wrapped in tin-foil. It was average and then I had the chips and small guacamole for $2. Both of those items were successful. The guacamole was fresh and a good version.
