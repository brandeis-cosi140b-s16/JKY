Staff is very friendly, they have a great selection, with numerous lunch-portion options.  Our meals were great, portion sizes were good.  

My biggest disappointment was dessert - the fried ice cream, which ended up being ice cream covered with corn flakes (something I have seen before, and am always disappointed with, as that's not fried ice cream), and the flan, which was more cake than custard.  Easy enough to skip dessert all together.  Everything else was good tho!
