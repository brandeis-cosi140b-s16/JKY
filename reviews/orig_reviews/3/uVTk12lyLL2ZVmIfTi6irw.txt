"New Mexico" food, so there's a heavy influance of red and green chili dishes. Burritos and Burrito Bowls are about $6. They have a double-meat, sans beans and everything else, burrito that is ok for carb watchers. If you get it in a bowl, it will be meat soaked in your choice of green or red chili. 

My friend got a Frito's Pie dish, which about $5 and was packed with food (fritos, ground beef, lettuce, and alot of cheese, plus sauce.

I would eat there again for lunch since it's near my office, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
