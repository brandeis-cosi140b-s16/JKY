We have tried Spotted Donkey twice in the last 4 months.  Each time there has been an incremental decrease in the quality of the food and SERVICE.  We will try again but our most recent Happy Hour visit left us scratching our heads.

We love our local establishments and I encourage everyone to give them a try...come to your own conclusion.  A very very cool venue and i hope that the precipitous decline in service is short lived.
