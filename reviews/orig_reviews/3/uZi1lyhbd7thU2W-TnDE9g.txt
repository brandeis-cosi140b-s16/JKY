My boss invited my for lunch and we decided to come to Barrio Cafe.

I had never been here but we heard that it was very delicious based on the yelp reviews.

This place is definitely different...it's not your average Authentic Mexican food. The food was definitely fancy and each dish had like 239448759234 ingredients listed [complete exaggeration i know]. I mean, I just wanted a simple Mexican dish but this place is nothing but simple. 

Instead of brining your average chips and salsa, it was pieces of bread and a chunky salsa. This was different but delicious.

It forced me to order outside of my comfort zone and so I decided to order a shrimp salad [forgot the name]. It was slices of tomato, red onion, avacado,cucumbers, and a few pieces of shrimp. The dressing was really delicious and worked well. However, for the price I expected maybe a little more shrimp or at least a bed of lettuce. 

I do recommend it for people who love to experiment and go outside your average dishes.
