The food was eh. The service was ok. The house special margarita in a pitcher. The best margarita I've had. WOW! It was superb. I had the veggie quesilla and my cousin got the 3 tacos. Eh. Over-priced, lackluster. Both dishes. My suggestion, go get full somewhere else and then enjoy a margarita there!
