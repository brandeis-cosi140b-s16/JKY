Found a new Mexican place I wanted to try last night, pulled up to the door an hour before close, chairs were already on the tables, employees sweeping the floor by the front door. So, away we went.

After a disappointing experience at one of the other Michoacan restaurants in town, we figured, why not give the original a try?

We were greeted and seated immediately, had our drink order taken right away, and chips were delivered promptly. So far, so good!

Checking out the menu, it wasn't sticker shock, per se - however, it was disappointing seeing how pricy the food was. If it is good though, it's worth it.

Deciding on our food, we ordered and watched the playoff game while we waited. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, the true test was about to begin.

Cutting into the enchilada, it was melted cheese all over. +
Tasting the enchilada, not super disappointed, but not wowed.
The taco was good, a little lacking on meat, a little more lettuce and a pile of cheese.

Unfortunately, when I ordered my meal with no beans, they still put beans on my tostada, so, I paid nearly $14 for an enchilada, taco and rice. Sadly, this is not much more than had I ordered a la carte.

 $4.25 for a cheese enchilada or $4.50 for a chicken enchilada?!

If friends want to go here, we'll go again, on our own though... not sure it's worth the money.
