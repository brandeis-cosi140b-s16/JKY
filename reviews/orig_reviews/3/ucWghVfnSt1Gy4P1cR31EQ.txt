I love Tortas! Tortas are to me, the ultimate sandwich. I was excited when I read all the reviews and was happy to visit for lunch and order to go.
The cashier was friendly, the food was ready in a reasonable amount of time.
I have notice an inconsistency in the amount of meat that will be inside a torta and I am not sure if that depends on who is cooking your food. The last time my torta had a minimal amount of carne asada, which really didn't taste like carne asada, more like carne guisada. I think they can do better in this department, there was too much lettuce in it and I am not a fan of what people like to call "pico de gallo" but to me is salsa bandera or salsa fresco in tort as, who cares, bottom line is it doesn't help.

I loved that when I asked for a combination of horchata and agua de pi√±a, they just made it, no questions asked. That was delicious!

I think next time I will eat in, see if that makes a difference, I will also request for no salsa and maybe, if available, pay extra for more avocado.  I will also give their other choices a try, because maybe that's what I am doing wrong.
So next time you want a good sandwich, give Tortas El Guero a try.
