When your flight has been delayed because too many planes are trying to get into Phoenix for the big game - it's nice to have places to kill some time at and grab a little something to eat too!

This place - at least when I was there - had great staff, the pricing wasn't bad - food tasted great and they were not slow - even though I had time to kill. Seemed clean, but it was just really the same ole same ole. However, I wouldn't hesitate to return!

Perhaps more for a drink than a dinner!
