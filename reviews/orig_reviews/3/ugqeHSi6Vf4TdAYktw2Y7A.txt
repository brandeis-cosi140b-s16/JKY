I'll have to eat here again, I wasn't really impressed but I didn't get my usual "Taco Shop" fare. The restaurant was really clean and the staff was very polite. The prices were pretty reasonable in comparison to Roberto's. I personally like Roberto's better but I'll try Pepe's again before I make a for sure judgement.
