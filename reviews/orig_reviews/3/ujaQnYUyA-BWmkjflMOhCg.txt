Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it at...JAVIER'S! - Ariana Grande (problem)

The decor here is very nice, the bar is amazing, and I met some very friendly people here. 

Unfortunately, the food isn't on par with everything else. The chips and salsa is great with the drinks, but the seafood quesadilla that I ordered was quite salty. Some of the standard mexican dishes that other people ordered didn't seem to pop out either.

For an upscale mexican restaurant, I was more than happy with everything but the main entree. The food is much better at smaller family owned restaurants so unless you have a craving for mexican food in Vegas, I'd recommend going somewhere else for food.
