I love the atmosphere of this place. We got a seat right next to the outside patio which was nice because we had a combination of shade and fresh air. When we came, it was really busy but we still got our food in a timely manner and the service was good. But... DONT ORDER DRINKS HERE. I got a $20 fat Tuesday, and there was no alcohol in it what so ever, and I'm no liquor connoisseur but I for sure didn't even feel a buzz. LAME.
