I really wanted to like Taco Haus. I think Payton Curry is a great chef and I live across the street from his newest restaurant. I went with a few people around the time they first opened and came away unimpressed. I tried the tacos and had some drinks, but thought the best thing I had was the chips and salsa. It's definitely not easy to open a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix so I expected better food. All of the things I had were forgettable, and even though I'd like to give it another try there are so many other restaurants to go to that were never that bad.
