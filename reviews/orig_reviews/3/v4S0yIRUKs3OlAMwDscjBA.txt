I guess this place is OK when you're in a pinch (get it).  We were looking for a quick bite to eat on the way to the Smith Center, who knew Le Thai was closed on Sundays, anywho, we ended up at the Container Park. 

We both settled on the Pinches Combo which is 3 street tacos with your choice of meat, I went with Carne Asada, Shrimp and Fish. I couldn't tell the difference between the shrimp and the fish there was so much breading on them. They also charge you .50 cents each taco for "upgrading" to seafood. Elote was pretty good, not the best I've had,  little heavy on the mayo. Horchata was good.

For $35 for two people to have street tacos and a fountain drinks, it was a tad overpriced, in my opinion. Nothing was that good for me to come back again.
