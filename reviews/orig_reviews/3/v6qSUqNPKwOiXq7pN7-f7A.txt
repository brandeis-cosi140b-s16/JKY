Descriptive phrase: hotel Mexican food.

Carlos' n Charlie's is what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant in a Vegas hotel, but whatever. It's full of drunk people, including yourself. Food is overpriced and everything is an add-on. My Chimichanga was $16, but I really enjoyed it. I couldn't tell you if it was actually good or if I was just starving getting off the 4-hour plane ride (the latter, most likely). Go if you must, don't if you dont.
