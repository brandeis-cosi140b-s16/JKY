This is definitely one of my favorite fast food Mexican restaurants. However, it's almost always crowded and the line moves SUPER SLOW. 

The food is amazing. I love their salads -- try it with hot enchilada sauce instead of ranch. It'll cut back the calories. 

All of the tortillas are home made. I think they're some of the best, personally. 

During the colder months I prefer the soup with shredded chicken. It's very good. 

We've done takeout quite a few times. They almost always mess up our order so that's not worth it. We get home and everyone's meals are messed up or condiments are forgotten. Just go through the line instead to save yourself. 

I give it 3 stars. If the line movement and takeout service improves, I'm at 5 stars really quick.
