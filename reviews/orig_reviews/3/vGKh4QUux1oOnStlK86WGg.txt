So I finally made it back to Vegas after about a year and a half, and my first place to stop was here because I've been craving their veggie tacos like mad! But I must say that I ended up being let down because they changed chefs :(

The chips seemed greasier than last time, and the salsa wasn't all that great either. But my immense disappointment was with the veggie tacos; instead of red and yellow bell peppers like last time, they now use green, which leaves a bitter after taste. The tacos also didn't have cheese on them, just sauteed mushrooms and some sort of sauce - I could have done better at home. My heart was broken.

If it wasn't for the great music they were playing, and the fact that my friend really liked his chicken enchiladas, I would have rated this place 2 stars. Let's just say that I have removed this restaurant from my "Wanna Go Back!" list.
