Was in the mood for Mexican, and came by here with a friend. It's definitely not a cheap taco place at all. The place is huge. They have 2 two areas and a large bar. I believe they also have outdoor seating as well. They serve complimentary chips and salsa, along with refried beans. Chips were delicious. Thick and cruncy. I hate the flimsy ones some places give you. The salsa was OK, it was smoky maybe or something, but I like mine with more of a tomato kick. The beans were good but they got cold quickly. I ordered the veggie fajitas. It's my favorite mexican dish. It was pretty good. Not the best I've had but good. My friend got the chicken enchiladas and she enjoyed. They had a chipotle cesar salad and I was torn between that and the fajitas. I wish I would have gotten that. It has grilled corn and queso fresco with chipotle cesar dressing....sounds delicious. Maybe I'll try that next time!
Price was definitely pricey. Not cheap at all. Portion sizes were nice though. Service was good and food was good.
