We have been here quite a few times and its pretty good! It has that authentic Mexican flavors. I would say its...similar to Someburros but slightly cheaper. I usually get their chicken tacos and my BF always gets a carne asada burrito. More recently I got a chorizo and potato breakfast burrito which was really good. We don't come here often but mainly because we don't go in that direction often. The only thing I thought was...odd, is their "nachos" They don't melt the cheese. They give you chips with raw cheese. The guy at the counter, on our very first visit, gave us some for free to try and swore how everyone loves it. We didn't, it was bland. I'd rather have my cheese melted, and would like some tomatoes, onions, and sour cream on top. Oh well!! We still like this place and will continue to stop by when we're near.
