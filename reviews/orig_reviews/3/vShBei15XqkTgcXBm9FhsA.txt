Don't be mistaken TQLA doesn't have Mexican food exactly. It is called "New Mexican" food. While it was pretty delicious I wasn't expecting this. The main difference is that there are a lot healthier choices than a Mexican food restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. The service was excellent. If you are coming here for traditional Mexican food you will be disappointed.
