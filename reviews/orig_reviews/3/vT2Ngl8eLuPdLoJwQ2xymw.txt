Salsa was good, it was just like Chevy's. 
A good selection of tequila too. 
Fajitas were ok, chicken was better than the steak. 

Monday at 8pm, the place was packed, but we were seated quickly only to experience slow service & sub par food. It was so loud we couldn't really talk much.  Over all, dissapointed that Sammy Hagar would be using a mediocre place, just to make a buck & sell his tequila.
