After a lot of the great reviews I expected a little better of an experience.  Went for the first time last night.  My initial impression was great!  "Complimentary" valet parking, fantastic mood/atmosphere.  We came here for a friend's birthday.  We got the sirloin toast and artichoke dip appetizers and they were amazing!  I would come back just for those as my meal.  

However, our entrees were another story.  Our server was pretty pathetic making us feel like any time she had to visit our table was an inconvenience to her.  Then, after getting our food the birthday girl wasn't happy with her steak.  We all tried a bite and it was pretty dang charred and dry... even for medium well which is what she ordered.  No big deal, we will just say something and make it right.  So she tells the server she wasn't happy about her steak and the server responded, "well, you did order it medium-well."  True, but she sucked as a server.  If a customer is unhappy you say sorry we will make it right.  Our friend was not rude at all.  The manager came to check it out and was VERY pleasant and took care of the situation. 

I only gave the place 3-stars because my wife's meal was also very bland and my other friend was unhappy with their entree.  The atmosphere and appetizers were great, but considering the prices they charge and the entrees served just not impressed... :/
