My server Bianca was super sweet. Pretty girl hard to look at her eyes when talking to her because of her little diamond lip piercing. I kept staring at it lol. 

I sat on the patio by the pool.  Nice murals on the walls and pillars. It was nice under the covering with the rain coming down. 

After looking at their menu. I ordered water with lemon to drink. Two pink tacos and one crunchy shrimp taco with an order of the zonked fries. I told Bianca that I don't like onions or tomatoes. She made sure that I didn't have any pico. She was awesome! She forgot my lemon though. :(

Ok so I wish I could say the same about the food. On my pink tacos the only part that had a faint touch of dirty pink was the edges. Both of my pink tacos fell apart so I was had to eat the guts with a fork. Even with the salsa the tacos lacked flavor. The crispy shrimp tacos weren't crispy and were a huge disappointment. The fries aren't fries it's huge wedges of slightly undercooked potatoes covered with some cheese, sauce and some carne asada. I wasn't impressed especially when I got to the under done wedge.  The potatoes are too big to enjoy the other flavors of everything. 

If you want the fun ambiance this is a good spot. The food needs some work.
