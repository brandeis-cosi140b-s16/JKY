3.5 stars.

We came here on a Thursday night around 11 for a late dinner. We loved the atmosphere- great music playing, beautifully set up bar, and a bull in the middle that's free to ride- just tip the guy.

We ordered a few appetizers to start which were the ceviche and the queso. The ceviche was ehhh ok- 3 stars. It was really thick and needed a little more spice to it. The queso was great! We really enjoyed that. It came with only 4 small tortillas- it needed to have more because of the amount of queso you receive. For dinner my friend and I shared the carnitas tacos. They were decent/ the rice and beans that came with it were very bland- definitely not home made. Two of our other friends got the lobster tacos and the steak quesadilla. 

We got a few drinks and mine was the peach margarita/ it was yummy! The service was lacking we didn't have any utensils or extra plates when the appetizers arrived. 

Decent place overall.
