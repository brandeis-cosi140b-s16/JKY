We were very disappointed!  We had planned on having lunch but when the wait for our pitcher of margaritas took forever.  We had ordered quacamole (because the reviews were so good) when we ordered the margaritas and we're almost finished with our drinks when it was served.  Terrible service, margaritas were not worth $36, but the quac was good.
