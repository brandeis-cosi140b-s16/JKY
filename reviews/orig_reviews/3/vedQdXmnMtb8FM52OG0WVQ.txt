*3.5 stars*

While Arriba isn't terrible, it certainly isn't the best either. 

I will say that one thing they do quite well is spice! Anything on the menu that is coded with 2-3 hatch chiles should rock your world. 

I think Wednesday or Thursday is 2 for 1 fajita day. They're never stingy with the chicken, steak and vegetables. We still like to order extra hatch chile on the side. 

Arriba's Fajita Quesadilla is also good, and large enough to share. A nice blend of cheeses, marinated chicken, fajitas vegetables, and a generous amount of those hatch chiles. That thing has had me close to tears a few times with a particularly strong batch o' hatch! 

I mostly like coming here for DRINKS when I find myself on this side of town! Especially those ginormous margaritas. Guaranteed to be a good night!  

The Blue Moon one is my favorite (nothing to do with the beer of the same name)!  You won't find it on a drink menu, but if you ask for it, your server should know what it is. Get it on the rocks. 

The beers micro brewed on site are a bust. Skip them and get something bottled or their other tap options. I ordered the Amber one once; way too much artificial lime flavor. And a waste of $5. 

Service is pretty spotty; however, never have experienced anything so awful that would send me running away and screaming.
