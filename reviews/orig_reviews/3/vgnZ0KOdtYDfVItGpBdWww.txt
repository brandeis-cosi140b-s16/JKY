It was 108 in Vegas, they had limited AC, the place was hot.  So I assume the food quality suffered a little bit.  We ordered 2 burritos, steak and pork.  Not cheap, 8-9 each.   The portion size is large. The steak was very tough and dry and the pork mushy, the beans and toppings where ok.  Really, this places seems fit for late night drunk food.   It really reminds me of a knock off qdoba or chipotle,  where the food is good just not great.  guacamole  is 1.49, boy that sounds like qdoba.   

If its late, your drunk and on the strip you could do worse.
