My husband and I have been regulars at Cantina Rea Rd for the past few years. Our last couple of visits have been disapointing. Our last visit was this week and I think it will  be our last. We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the Enchilada Verde. We were disapointed with both. The shrimps on he fajitas were smaller than ususal and the vegetables were thinner than any other time. The plate was full of caramalized onions. 
The Enchilada Verde was not even close to the description on the menu. According to the menu, the plate is prepared with spinash and mushrooms. Yet , the plate we got was nothing but a combination of melted cheeses.  
The service was ok but nothing special.
