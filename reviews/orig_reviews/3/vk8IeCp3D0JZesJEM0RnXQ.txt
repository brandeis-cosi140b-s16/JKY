I can't say I've ever had Mexican food I didn't enjoy eating, but this was nothing stand-out special. They have an a la carte- type ordering system.. & it's also backwards.. so it's kinda confusing, but they do have decent prices & occasional specials. You can also find live music here on select nights.
