This place suffers from one of the worst themes ever! Luchadores? Really? The only thing worse that I can think of would be a video game themed restaurant. On to the food. The meat selection was good(the owner gave us samples of all of them). All stewed meats. No grilled choices.  I believe the beans were canned. Mass produced tortillas. In a town with some great tortilla factories I would have preferred to see a more traditional flour tortilla for my burrito. Salsas were good but nothing special. I got a wet/enchilada style burrito(don't know why but I was just in the mood I guess). I'm 90% certain that sauce came from a can as well. All in all. Average. I would assume most of their 5 star ratings are from their friends. Their meats deserve better!
