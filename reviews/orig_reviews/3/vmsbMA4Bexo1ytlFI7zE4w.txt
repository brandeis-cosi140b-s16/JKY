This place is a lifesaver.  Whenever we go to shop at Fashion Square, I plop myself down in at one of the tables on the patio at Z-Tejas, and I'm good.  I have tried following the shoppers around, and I actually got blisters on my feet.  So I am now kind of the designated package drop off station.  I sit there and drink, and the shoppers go buy, and when they get tired, they bring the packages to me to watch, have a quick drink, and they are off again.

So I sit at a table on the patio, drink my Dos Equis Amber, if they have it, or Newcastle,  if they don't,  and watch people coming and going.  I always drink the same thing, so I can't vouch for their drinks, but they seem to have a wide variety.  The food is average, but interesting. They have a variety from burgers to steaks along with their southwestern specialties. Their appetizers are great, and I have had them all at one time or another. And I love the cornbread - I eat the whole pan within five minutes.  

I drive the servers crazy with the bottomless basket of chips for $4.49 - I am there for hours, so they don't make any money on that. And I know they wonder where the bags and packages keep coming from as they mysteriously appear at my table.

They also have an happy hour from 3:30 to 6:30 on weekdays and 3:00 to 5:00 on weekends. If you go to Z'Tejas sit on the patio - I will be the one with the packages around me.
