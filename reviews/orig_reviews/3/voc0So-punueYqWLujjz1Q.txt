I think rating Cabo depends on what you really want out of it. If it's sitting at the patio - drinking tequila, margaritas and beers - it is a cool setup and great view. The Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar owns the joint and they blast classic rock all night on the patio of the new Planet Hollywood.

The food was meh. Pretty average, but not terrible. We stayed next door at the Paris, and the Cabo patio served as a great spot to meet up to catch a buzz.

I ordered tacos, nachos and enchiladas in my two different visits. Think of a spicier "Chevy's." The Grilled Poblano Nachos were exceptional - the rest was just aight.

The service was spotty both times too. 5 stars for drinking spot, 3 stars for food, 2.5 stars for service. Let's call it a shade above a three-star experience.
