How can you beat $2 tacos & $2 draft beers?  This was the first place we ate at after arriving in Vegas.  The service was SLOOOOOOOOOW.  The cheap tacos were good.  They did the job.  I can't decide if I liked the chicken or beef better.  Their Miller Lite and Modelo Especial are the $2 draft beers, or you can get a pitcher for $7.
