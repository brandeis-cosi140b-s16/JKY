I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I didn't. Went with the husband, child and friend on a Friday night. From the looks of it they do a banging take out business for there was a steady stream of people coming and going. I ordered the ceviche, the husband and his friend both ordered carne asada burritos and a bean an cheese burrito for the son. 

The ceviche wasn't really what I would call ceviche. It was more like chopped shrimp with pico de gallo, cucumbers and chips for dipping. Tasty but not really the ceviche that I am used to and not worth the price. 

The bean and cheese burrito had a really good taste but as soon as my son took his first bite most of the beans ran out and he was left with a soggy tortilla. The beans would most definitely be a hit as a side with dinner or in a cup, but not in a tortilla. 

The carne asada was also good but the burritos were small in size, again not really worth the price. 

The service was friendly and the patio on a nice night is great. Maybe I was expecting some of the best Mexican Food I had ever eaten from reading previous reviews. The food was good but I think for the quantity of food you get it's a little overpriced, I know some are going to disagree and say it's about quality not quantity, and I agree with that to an extent. 

I would go here again if I had a hankering for some Mexican and was in the Melrose area.
