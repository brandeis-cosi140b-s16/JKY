Came here for Cinqo De Mayo- did the conga line for a free shot- horrible free shot and danced a Coca song on the dance floor- a little to sober for this experience and felt pretty old. However this pace reminded me of my under 21 days spend on Revolution Street in Tijuana. I didn't like the margarita mix they used either. It was the perfect place to come for Cinqo De Mayo.
