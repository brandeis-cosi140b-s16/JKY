Came here because Oregano's was packed on a Saturday night.  I wonder how many of their customers are in the same boat.  I was initially craving Mexican food anyway, so I didn't care.  

The service is awesome, the beer was so cold it was almost icy (read: awesome) and the salsa is yummy yummy.  I ordered the specialty chimichanga and my mom got rolled tacos.  The plates were hu-hu-hu-huge.  And can I just say that cream cheese makes everything better, especially chimichangas.  YUM.  

Not the best Mexican joint I have ever been to, but definitely decent enough to visit again (for the locals).
