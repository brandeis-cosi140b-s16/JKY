We have been here twice now and both times have been disappointed in the service. They have great food (guacamole is not good though - lack of flavor for the hype and price!), but the service is poor. For example, bartender was too busy and she showed it...rude/snappy and was also arguing with other bartenders and yelling orders in front of us, she was clearly frustrated and it was unprofessional. There were many items that were forgotten or too busy to notice, had to remind about silverware (both visits), second rounds of drinks had to be requested after sitting empty for too long, chips/salsa, etc. First time we were there we waited way too long to even get a server. We will probably be back to give them another shot, because we love the food and the location/atmosphere is too good to give up on but so far we are sadly disappointed! I sincerely hope it improves.
