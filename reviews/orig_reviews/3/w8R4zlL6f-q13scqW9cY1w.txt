Just driving by and saw 'Tamales'.. sounded good, so what the heck, why not?

Of course we opted to try the Tamales:

Red - pork in a mild sauce
Green - chicken in a spicy sauce

Both weren't dry/mushy and had the right crumble when the knife sliced into it. I liked the Red Tamale better maybe because of the pork, not necessarily the sauces. The Green had a mild kick but wasn't bad. 

4/5 stars for the Tamales

I also had to try their Carne Asada as I usually order this at every Mexican place I go to, especially the first time. It was quite disappointing, just didn't do it for me. But their Tamales, definitely worth a try.
