Waited about 10 minutes on a late, weekend night. Parking lot isn't huge so finding a spot can be a little difficult.

Environment was part of the experience - It was relaxed with a very mixed crowd of college kids, older men in slacks and dressy couples from the Arcadia area. Booths look worn but were clean along with the tables.

Had originally ordered two Margs from the bar, they were not made in time so the bartender brought them to our table (literally in the bar area). Wonderful Chips and salsa were brought to our table almost immediately upon sitting and the refill was prompt once our server noticed the empty bowl. Our server greeted us within 5 mintues, not talkative at all but in a good way. After ordering, our food came out in about the average wait time, enough to enjoy our drinks and converse. GF had the Chile Relleno and it was...unusual. Basically a plate of grease, cheddar, chile and a mound of "foam." They warn you before ordering that's it's not typical Chile Relleno so I cannot complain. I had a wonderful combo plate, served very hot and looking freshly made (no signs of sitting). Prices on drinks and food were reasonable and I would probably compare the food style to Serrano's or possibly closer to Garcia's in the East Valley.

Overall, I'm pleased with my visit and may return.
