After reading many reviews of this place, I decided to stop by here for lunch and try it for myself.  I was please to see how nice the decor of the restaurant was.  There are two dining room areas and bar seating.  The owner, Leticia, greeted me and asked me if I wanted a table or sit at the bar.  Since i was eating alone, I saddled up to the bar and ordered from the Bartender.  

I decided on the Nachos and a Raspberry Iced Tea to wash it down.  While I was waiting for my order a server brought out complimentary Chips, Beans, and Salsa.  In Vegas, it's rare to get Beans with the comp Chips/Salsa....also, there were two Salsas.....a Chipotle based Salsa and an Avocado/Cilantro based Salsa.....it was excellent!

A few minutes later my Nachos came out.  They were covered in Cheese and had two small portions of Sour Cream & Guacamole on top...certainly not enough for the entire dish.  The Nachos has a lot of potential....the Chips were fresh, all of the ingredients tasted very good....but the proportions were all messed up.  Too much Cheese, not enough Sour Cream/Guacamole/Pico de Gallo.....just the right amount of Beans & Jalapenos.  The Cheese was melted just right, but with some bites it overwhelmed the dish.  A lot of potential here...

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and loved the friendly service and active owner who cares about her restaurant.

Will I return?  I want to come back with my family and try a few more dishes.
