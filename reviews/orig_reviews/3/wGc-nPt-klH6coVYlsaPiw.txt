We were in last week on a Thursday night.  The server was fantastic. However, the food was lacking. We have been too this location several times before but today it was very subpar. The rice was salty and dry. Three people had the fish tacos and all sent them back. They offered to replace one meal out of the three and paid for two out of the three fish taco entrees. The fish was super fishy and undercooked. You could smell that extra fishy smell across the table and on them after they had touched it. Thankfully no one got ill. The other two meals were short rib tacos which were good but rice was sill bad. It would've been nice if manager paid for all three fish entrees and replaced their meals.
