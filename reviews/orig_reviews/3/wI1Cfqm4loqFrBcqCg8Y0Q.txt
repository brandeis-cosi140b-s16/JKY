After participating in classic Las Vegas nightly events, our party found Yolos to 1. have an appropriate name and 2. be conveniently located in our hotel. As mornings/afternoons can be a rough time, what's better than good ol' American Mexican food. 

We got the queso fundido, which was alright. Cheese after a Vegas night is not such a great idea. Quesadilla was decent. Fish tacos were bland. Taquitos were apparently great. The carnitas taco was pretty tasty as well. 

Overall, an accessible and medium-priced place for that time that you just want food. 

Later in the night, we noticed that if you sing karaoke, you get some sort of deal at the bar. We were intrigued, but did not follow up with the offer.
