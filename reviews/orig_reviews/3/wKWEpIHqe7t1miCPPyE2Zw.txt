Nothing special. Well, I lied. The tequila is special, the swing is special, and the bathrooms are special. However the food, it's just eh. 
My other half and I rolled in here shortly after 6:00 PM, the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. We were told, our only option is the right side of the bar, so we took it. It was clear they were setting up for an event, while still trying to accept walk ins. 
First, let's talk about the positives. I love the decor. The hidden front walkway entrance. The swing. (yes a real swing at the bar) And of course the huge wall of tequila is pretty breathtaking. Maybe the authentic look set my expectations too high. 
Between the two of us, we ordered fajitas, potato tacos, ceviche, a salsa trio, and a guava margarita. The fajitas were bland. Not bad, just boring. What fajitas don't come out sizzling? These ones. 
Potato taco, I would give these a C+ or even B-. Not bad, but not amazing. The best part was the jalapeno crema. (Not what I expect the best part to be on a taco)
Ceviche, PASS! I was so excited because it came with mango and jalapeno. Nope. Way too sweet, not nearly enough lime, cilantro, or cucumber to even out the flavors. 
Salsa trio, 2 outta 3 were great. The "attempt at being spicy" one, try again folks. 
However, my margarita was great. Fresh juice, tons of options. Not too sweet or strong. I would return for drinks. And maybe chips and salsa. But if I want good Mexican food, I am looking elsewhere.
