We had 8 girls for a bachelorette party and so I was able to try at least 3-4 plates. 

One of the best plates here is the Chile Relleno. I've had it many times before from Salvadorans that made it from scratch at home so I get pretty picky. Here, the sauce is amazing and so is the stuffing. I didn't pick this dish but I think it was the best one in the group. If I come back here, this is what I'd get, hands down.

I got the Seared Ahi dish but it was not that great. It was ok, but the sauce was more thick and curry like rather than light and delicate. 

The chips and salsa were amazing. Fresh hot chips and the salsa was just spicy enough. 

The margaritas are ok, nothing great, but it wasn't bad. We got the pitcher, which is cheaper than buying individual drinks. We got the strawberry blended margarita and the pineapple margarita on the rocks. The strawberry is better. 

The dishes are quite pricey but the appetizers and tacos were decently priced.
