I had been extremely excited about trying this place an I finally had a chance to go this last sat for brunch. The food was "ok" , as a Chef I had an idea of what the vision was but the execution was very sloppy. I also felt terrible for the one pregnant server who got slammed as soon as we arrived . I want to give this place another chance , maybe I'll go for dinner soon when they will have more staff in both the FOH as well as the kitchen. I know that no excuse for any restaurant but unlike most people that are not in this industry , I understand .
