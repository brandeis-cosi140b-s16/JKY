I have to say I did go back to use the $15.00 gift certificate but I was not pleased to say the very least. I was sent  a message from one of the managers to come back and try some of the food again on them. But when I write these reviews and it's not good I don't do that for a freebie. I write a bad review becasue my experience was just that - BAD!!! So, I did not take the manager up on her offer- I know some of you are saying - Yeah, but it's a free meal - I love free just like everyone else but sometimes I just want to remain as anonymous as possible. 

BOY AREN'T WE ALL JUST A BUNCH OF YELP CELEBRITIES!!!

On a whim I went back and this is what we ordered:
1. Steak Fajita Salad- Large and flavorful - my steak was cold though- would've enjoyed it more if the steak was hot.
2.Southwestern Chicken Salad- this was good...
3.Beef Nachos- Full size was huge- but man thank goodness this was the BF's dish cause this looked like a heartattack waiting to happen...
4. Chicken Tenders Kid's Meal- Your child gets 2 huge pieces of chicken tenders- these 2 pieces of pounded chicken breast are big-
FYI: Kids eat for $1.00 on Mondays if you dine inside- It's a great deal, sadly though you can't order takeout and still get this deal....

I hate having to ask for the Corn Jalapeno Muffins - they should just be brought to each table. Isn't that the meaning of complimentary? I have to say though that the Corn Muffins have greatly improved - they are yummy. If they were brought out with some butter that would be YUMMERS!!! It's sad though, that if a table doesn't know to ask for them that they wouldn't get the opportunity to try these yummy muffins.

This vist was rather enjoyable and I wouldn't mind coming back....
