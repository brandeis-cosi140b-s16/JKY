The food was good, although the servings were a little small for the price. It is an interesting fusion of Mexican food and Chinese food. Oddly, the items we ordered did actually go well together! We had the Fried Wontons (sooo yummy!), the Queso Fundido (basically just a make your own quesadilla... but the cheese was good!), and the Mongolian Beef & Lettuce (good, but the slices of meat were really small!). 

Give it a try, but be prepared to pay a little more if you are trying to get full, because you will need to order a few plates.
