I have been here twice now.  I'll keep this review short because I need to go back a third time for some serious, honest-to-god research, but here's the jist of it:

The food here is great.
The service is pretty average.
The margaritas are completely, totally, unexplainably bad.  Like, 'this must be a joke' bad.  And I'm not talking about one margarita during one visit.  I'm talking about 5 different types of margaritas over 2 visits.  And usually after 2 margaritas, I'm not that picky!

So stop in if you want some mexican food, and maybe a beer.  Do not order a margarita until I figure out what is wrong with this place, and if they have a palatable option.  I will report back.
