Good for brunch.  They have more traditional Mexican food selections such as chorizo and eggs, and huevos rancheros, in addition to more fusion type brunch items such as seafood crepes.  I had the chorizo and eggs, which was very well prepared.  The eggs were perfectly done (over easy), the chorizo was flavorful and spicy, and the potatoes were perfectly grilled.  Prices are on the more expensive side for what you get (10 dollars and up), and some items such as aguas frescas will run you a whopping $5 for a glass, but all in all it was a nice meal.  Therefore, 4 stars for the meal, but minus a star for the prices.
