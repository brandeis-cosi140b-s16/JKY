Ordered 4 asada and 2 adobada tacos and an adobada quesadilla. The tacos were whatever, but the quesadilla was wonderful. It is a not a traditional 2 tortilla quesadilla, but more of an open-faced quesadilla. Even though there were slightly more onions than I would have put on the quesadilla myself, it worked well together. After eating my quesadilla, the tacos were just ok. If you have a choice, I would recommend you choose flour tortillas.
