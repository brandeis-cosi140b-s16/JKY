Great location in the middle of the strip near Planet Hollywood. We were a huge group and had two large tables near each other. Staff is good but a bit slow. Regular chips and salsa and we added guacamole as well. We enjoyed the Ahi tuna ceviche with spicy tortillas and the baja shrimp ceviche. The Shortrib burrito was good and the fajitas were very ordinary. All and all we had a great time and food was good.
