Keep in mind there are 2, ok 3 different kinds of Mexican food restaurants.
1)Fast food, ie Taco Bell etc.
2)Americanized Mexican food with gobs of cheese and beef, serving dishes like fajitas and chimichangas that they've never heard of in Mexico.
3)Authentic Mexican food.

Lindo falls somewhere between 2 & 3.  The food tasted good and they did have a few select authentic Mex dishes on the menu (I had the goat) but mostly it's just Americanized Mex food that is available in any town across the USA.
