Honestly I had this awhile ago so take this review with a grain of salt as things could have changed here....

Food from what I remember was ehhhh...not the best but definitely not the worst...the prices did not help out either...

They did have a wheel that you would spin during happy hour and whatever it landed that was the special for that moment...

Cool atmosphere and a decent location on the strip however either the food or the pricing needs to be a little bit better for me to give it a better rating...
