Overall, I enjoy this restaurant and have been there twice already. It's great to have new options in the Scottsdale/Shea area.

There is, however, lots of room for improvement, which i guess is to be expected from "new" restaurants, although the owners allege to have plenty of restaurant experience. Dropped the fish tacos from menu less than a week in, guacamole seriously lacks lime, and the margaritas are both tiny and very watered down.

on the other hand, the shrimp tacos and pork belly tacos are great. the empanadas definitely stand out, a fancy twist on a well know latin american street food (try the mole chicken). tres leche cake dessert is the best ive had in the united states. 

this restaurant has some potential but i expected more out of the brathaus bros. hope it survives long enough to iron out its wrinkles.
