I had one goal when I first arrived in Vegas: to have one of those tall margarita glasses in my hand as soon as possible.  We headed down to the Strip to chill out for a bit.  This was the first 1/2 yd margarita stand we stumbled upon.  I ordered the mango flavor with an extra shot.  I later found out the drinks and the glasses here are a bit over priced.  But the drink did the trick and started our night off on the right foot.  I will say that going back to the room and trying to do hair and make-up after drinking that thing proved to be a little bit challenging.  But I'm always up for a challenge.
