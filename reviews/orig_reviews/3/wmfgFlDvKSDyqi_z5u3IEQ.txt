Ooh I love this place. Being from Hawaii, I love the island vibe here. It's nice to see a staff with the " Aloha Spirit". The Hawaiian music playing and the Ono food help too.

My favorite dish is the grilled fish bowl, but everything is amazing. The award winning is to die for, and don't forget to order the coconut bark for dessert. 

If you haven't been to Braddah's you should definitely check it out. Enjoy:)
