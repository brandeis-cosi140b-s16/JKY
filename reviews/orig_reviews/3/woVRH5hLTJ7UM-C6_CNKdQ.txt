I ate here the other day for lunch after playing a round the golf, so I was starving.  I ordered the cheese enchilada and shreded beef taco combo w/rice and beans.  A great value for 8.50, plus a margarita for 2.50 which was great as well.  The shreded beef taco was very good, though I didn't get any gucamole or sour cream with it, I suppose I should have asked for it.  The cheese enchilada was good, but I do agree with the other posters that they pile up the cheese on their food, atleast the enchilada.  The plates are sloppy to look at and when eating the food, the plate turns into a mess.  For the value, you can't go wrong, but I do think they can make some simple changes to better the food look wise and not mase their food with so much cheese. 

I did have the mini chimi's years back and I remember how doughy and the lack of taste they had, not sure if they improved those at all.
