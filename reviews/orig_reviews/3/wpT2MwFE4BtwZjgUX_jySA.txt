Im sorry I would love to give this place 4 stars but I can't, the food is great, however the service suffers greatly. The bartender didn't even ask us if we wanted water or how our meal was, and we had to ask for everything. It was really a chore to eat there. Although the food was excellent, it's just the whole atmosphere with no music and unfriendly staff. I guess they have a goldmine and are not concerned with nurturing local patrons.
