Well what could you possibly expect from a mexican restaurant brought to you by the folks who brought you Jose Cuervo tequila (One drink... and you'll never drink tequila again!)?  In the Las Vegas airport?  I mean- low expectations, right?  I thought the service was courteous and efficient.  They had chalula hot sauce on the table.  My chicken quesadilla was a good value for the money- which I believe is something I have never said about any meal I've ever eaten at an airport ever.  They have those cool Oaxacan animal sculptures as decoration.  It is what is, but it has got to be the best restaurant the "C" wing of McCarran airport has to offer.
