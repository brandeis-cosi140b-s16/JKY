Just ordered a takeout and things have deteriorated somewhat. Prices have changed. The Paella used to be $9 now its $13...the web site still says $9....but it has not improved 50%! I asked for extra tortillas....they gave extra chips. I gave them $20 and had to wait 10 minutes for change. Who doesn't have $6 in the cash register at the end of lunch? The last 3 takeout orders have all been wrong...check the bag before you leave! Looks like management is getting a little slack. Its lovely inside and convenient for Nth Central Phnx so I hope they get back on track quickly. When we eat in there everything is fine....they just drop the ball for takeout.
