Stopping at this place for quick and cheap frozen margaritas was exactly what we needed after walking around for a few hours in the desert heat. 

We only stopped in because we got a card for 2 for 1 frozen drinks during happy hour. I can't complain - the outdoor bar had mist spraying each of the chairs at the bar and 2 margaritas were $10 - you can't beat that in Vegas!
