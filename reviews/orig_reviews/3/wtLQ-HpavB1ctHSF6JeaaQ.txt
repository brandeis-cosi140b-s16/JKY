I have been to Paco's Tacos several times so I must say I was a bit disappointed with my meal on Saturday.  Overall the taste was just OK and there was a hair in my food.  The salsa was smokier than normal and overall I thought that flavor was just blah.  My server was excellent though, and I enjoyed a Mango Margarita on the rocks which was delish.  We got there at 5:30 and by 6 it was packed and VERY loud.  

I will go back again and hope this was just an off night for the cook.
