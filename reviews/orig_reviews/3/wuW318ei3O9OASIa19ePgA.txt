If you want a genuine Mexizona experience, Los Olivos is your place.  Especially on weekend nights.  Go there on a Friday night and get your cumbias on. Seriously, amigos. This place has a huge room with a bandstand, live music and dance floor. It's pretty cool.

Unfortunately, the food isn't as cool.  It's pretty run-of-the-mill Mexican food. Definitely nothing to write home about. Or rave on Yelp about. 

So save yer money and head over to Frank and Lupe's.  But get a pitcher of strawberry margaritas to go at Los Olivos first--the margaritas at F&L suck.

P.S. I really wanted to give Los Olivos 2 1/2 stars, but g-damn Yelp doesn't have a button for that. . .

Update: screw Frank & Lupe's --they suck too. Save up some money and go to Los Sombreros--great food & great strawberry margs.
