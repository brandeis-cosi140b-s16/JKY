Service was fine.  No complaints there.

I had the "Sloppy Daddy Nacho" which had bbq beef brisket, onions, and peppers.  The meat was pretty good meat.  The cheese was the sort of nacho cheese you'd find at a high school football game, only mixed with water.  I'm not against generic canned nacho cheese, but this stuff was very thin and was also pretty flavorless.  Anyways, the meal wasn't worth $10.  I can get a much better plate of nachos for around $7-$8 at Timber's.
