I ordered the fish taco, it comes with the mango salsa. Which was ok for me. What I realized is I like the battered fish tacos not grilled. So I will go back and try something else. I also had the steaks soft tacos which I like a lot. Overall, staffs were friendly. A good clean place. Will do a 2nd visit and update my review.
