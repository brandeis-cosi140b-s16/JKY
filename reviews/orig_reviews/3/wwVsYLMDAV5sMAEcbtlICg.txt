This place isn't bad, it's "OK"

I came here as my first stop with friends when we got to Las Vegas. We wanted Mexican food and we were staying at the Luxor so we thought this would be our best choice. We all came to the conclusion that it wasn't bad but we expected more. 

The best way to describe this place is: It's Mexican food made by people who haven't really ate Mexican food before. 

I feel like somone who had experience in other culinary foods made this.
