My yelp-foodie group decided to make the Mission our second spot to visit and review. This review is only based on my last visit with this group. 
I understand sometimes its a bit overwhelming trying to cater to a big group (8 of us) but it literally took over 10 minutes to get our first round of drinks.
We immediately ordered the guacamole and chips for appetizers.  I really enjoy their table side guac all the time as a starter. I would have wanted it much spicier, but I am not sure how much the rest of my guests would of appreciated that.
I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they are very small, but they definitely filled me up. Cooked to perfection always. The wine we ordered also complemented the meal.
My friend ordered the street corn. WOW, I never knew corn could taste so good. I've been to Mission many times and I cannot believe I never ordered it.

This place is definitely a date night spot with beautiful dim lighting. I would highly recommend to make reservations.
