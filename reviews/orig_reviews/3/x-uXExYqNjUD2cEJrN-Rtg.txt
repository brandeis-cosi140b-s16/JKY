My love and I went here on our date night this week. We were served by Gabriel. He was awesome! He was very attentive and pleasant. We only ordered drinks and an appetizer- Queso Flameado Supremo. It was gross, and I'm saying that politely. It looked like it came straight out of the can. Yuck. Gabriel offered us  four different styles of salsa with our complimentary chips before ordering. All of them scrumptious. Joe and I have both been here before. Although we don't frequent this restaurant I wanted to enjoy the courtyard and good conversation If you request to sit in the "courtyard" with its beautiful blue skies. It reminds me of the shopping district in Vegas.
