I came here couple of times. The first time we had dinner and the food was ok. I liked the huge martini glass filled desert. The outside seating is more quiet but if you like the party atmosphere, sit inside. The second time I came here with a party tour, it was very entertaining. I liked the decorations on the ceilings and the thong bar stools. I also liked the Senor frog located in Cancun and Bahamas.
