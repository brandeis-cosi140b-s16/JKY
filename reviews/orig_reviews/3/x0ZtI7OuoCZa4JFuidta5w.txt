Nice little restaurant Tucktaway in the corner of the strip mall next to the flower store in the vitamin shop. The food is well done and inexpensively priced. The downside is the service. The waitstaff is inattentive. With an east west exposure having dinner in the restaurant will blind you. The restaurant does not have a shade or anything to pull down to avoid this and when asked to be moved was met with a blank stare. The chef came around frequently to ask how everything was. I would come here again... And see if I can get better service. The food is worth it.
