First impressions mean a lot and finding this place lacking in interior design or a welcoming outdoor, speaks in volumes. 
What you get is a great gourmet burger at a high price. For the prices they charge they also need to do a better job of cleaning. Homemade chips were NOT all that good and BBQ which I hate in a chip. Didn't know that and since the fryer was down and we couldn't get fries, we were "offered" chips which I thought would be free for the inconvenience. They weren't free and 2 burgers, fries and shakes with tip was a whopping $30.00. For that price I want ambience!
