Taco Tuesday is the reason to go here, otherwise the rest of the Mexican dishes perhaps might be good, but are "Scottsdale priced" Even on TT with the prices at $2.50 per taco, it seems like a good deal, but you might need four to fill you up. They utilize the single corn tortilla system too which usually indicates cheapness. Some tacos are filled more than others as my companion had her fish and asada/relleno tacos loaded, while chicken and brisket on my end lacked meat coverage, but did not lack flavor. The free chips and salsa are quite top notch, so that might cover you if you order just two tacos. We splurged though cause my date was craving guacamole, but it was not worth the 11 bucks and after I walked out I noticed the cart with all the cold ingredients just hanging out in the dining room. The waitress made the guac, but she had no flare because in this case you are paying for the show like that flaming banana desert thingy. Try asking for a side of guac and save your cash for more tacos.
