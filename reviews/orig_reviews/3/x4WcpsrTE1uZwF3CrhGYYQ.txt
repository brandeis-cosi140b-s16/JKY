I was looking for something on the line of healthy and decided to give it a try.  I was greeted with smiles on the other side of the counter (simple but important). I ordered my meal to go and ordered 2 Cajun tacos with brown rice and black beans-with the green sauce on the side.  After I paid (it was around $8) the lady gave me my reciept and walked away. Doootadooo.... I stood there wondering if I should wait or should I find a seat???  Hm I made my way to a table to wait for my food.  While I waited I was checking out the great beachy decor.  The patio looks so amazing.  I will definitely be back for that.  Sent me right back to the laid back outdoor beach bars in California. Sigh. 

My food was brought to me and I was on my way.  The cashier yelled "have a great day" and that made up for leaving me in limbo afew mins ago. When I got back to the office it was on!  The tacos were great.  I couldnt tell if the tacos were spicy of the green sauce I was pouring on it was.  Love spicay!  I did notice that one taco had cheese and one didnt.  Not quite sure why or how that happened but either way they were pretty good.  BTW green sauce is fat free a huge plus. ;)  The rice and beans I had a little of but the tacos pretty much filled me up.

So yes the atmosphere is cute, laid back and fun.  I definitely will be back to get my drink on - ON the patio this time and for sure will be doing the quicky lunch on my lunch break.  Nice guilt free lunch...just what I was looking for.  Success! =)
