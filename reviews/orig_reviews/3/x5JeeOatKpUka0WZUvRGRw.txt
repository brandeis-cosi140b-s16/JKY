The reason to go to Diablo's is not the food or the drinks. It's the atmosphere. It's just plain fun. The food is okay. Not great. Not bad, but okay. Same with the drinks. But the service is friendly and attentive, the vibe is lively and the music is entertaining. Each time I go to Diablo's, it's for a group event. The staff is very accommodating, so I highly recommend it as a place to coordinate a group gathering. Let's put it this way, I've never had a bad time at Diablo's.
