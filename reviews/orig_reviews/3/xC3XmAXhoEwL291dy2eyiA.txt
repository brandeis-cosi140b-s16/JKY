I've been wanting to write this review for a long time. Every experience at Frank and Lupe's is pretty much the same so I think I can sum this up quickly.

Service: friendly but VERY SLOW, I wouldn't recommend coming here if you have somewhere to be after dinner. Slow to seat you, slow to serve you, slow to pick up your check.

Food: I love the chips and salsa. The mole here is incredible!! The shrimp fajitas are good too, but inconsistent. And, I had a bite of my friends poblano cream chicken enchiladas -- the sauce was delicious but the chicken was bland. If you are looking for a good taco plate or enchilada with rice and beans...move along because the rest of the menu is bland-to-mediocre at very best. The last time I was there the beans were undercooked and the rice was flavorless. MOLE OR BUST! It might be the only thing worth coming for. 

Summary: The mole alone would get 5 stars but I realize it's not for everyone. Thumbs down for the service and the remainder of the menu (for the most part).
