Dropped by for lunch recently.  The restaurant is one of those 'Tweener' places that's not quite fast food, not quite sit down.  You order at a counter and they bring the food out to you.

After browsing the menu, decided to go with the Carne Asada Burro (Steak, Beans, Rice and Pico de Avocado, $4.95).  It comes with complimentary Chips & Salsa and you can refill your Chips.

They have a bottle of Hot Salsa on the table for you to use.  It's not too Spicy, but better than Mild Salsa.

The Burro was just OK, nothing special.  The food was fresh but just lacked that extra special flavor to make it great.

Overall, it was a A-OK experience.
