China Poblano is an interesting mix of Chinese and Mexican. My coworker and I swung by for a late night snack after not being able to snag a dinner reservation. I had high hopes because this is a Jose Andres restaurant and I have been dying to try The Bazaar. 

These hopes somewhat fell flat. Our selections:
Shrimp Mojo: shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano pepper
Silencio Taco: duck tongue/fresh lychee
Viva China:  soft beef tendon/Kumamoto oyster/scallions/Sichuan peppercorn sauce
Barbacoa: Oaxacan-style barbeque beef/guajillo chile/pickled cactus paddle

I appreciated the interesting mix of ingredients but the Silencio & Viva China really fell flat on the texture side. They were all just kind of mushy. The most flavorful was the Barbacoa. The pickled cactus added a nice balance to the otherwise strong barbacoa meat. The shrimp mojo had a lot of good flavor but perhaps it would have gone better with steak. The delicate texture of the shrimp was completely lost amongst the sauce. 

What really saved our meal was dessert: Tres Lychees: a new take on the Mexican classic. It comprised of the soaked cake, whipped cream, ice cream, fresh lychee & fresh flowers. It was an amazing mix of lychee textures and flavors. Everything tasted like lychee but played off of each other harmoniously. Each flower had a different flavor that also complimented the dish. 

Tres Lychees just made my night
