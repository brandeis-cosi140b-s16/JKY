Visited Secreto for the 1st time during the lunch hour.  They clearly redecorated from the last owner, I like the tall semi-private booths and the copper bar.

We had 4 different dishes at our table and the favorites were the chipotle pulled pork sandwich, sesame ahi tuna salad with a citrus dressing and the carne adovado.  Not so much a fan of the enchiladas.  My carne adovado had great smokey flavor with just the right amount of heat.

Their presentation on the salad and sandwich was awesome.  I would suggest adding something green for the other 2 plates, they looked and were very heavy. Maybe the pork could be on a bed of lettuce , sprinkled with some diced tomatoes and scallions?

I found it interesting that the pulled pork and ahi tuna were on the menu that is touted as being from New Mexico, but DON'T let that deter you from ordering them.

Our service is what brings my rating down a star.  It was slow and our waiter barely uttered 2 words to us, he neglect to tell us there were daily specials-we saw this on our way out.  If the service is going to be slow, maybe they could offer chips and salsa!

I might also note that the Phoenix Magazine voted Secreto as having the best burrito, so now I have to go back.
Happy Eating!
