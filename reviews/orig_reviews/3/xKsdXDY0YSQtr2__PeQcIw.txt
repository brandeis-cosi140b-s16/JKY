I haven't been here since college, and now I remember why.  the food is only so-so and the atmosphere is puzzling.  I don't want to listen to loudly-played Britney Spears when I'm trying to eat Tex-Mex type food.

as far as the food, some was good and some was not so good.  I liked the chopped salad, which came with avocado, sunflower seeds, black beans, chopped tomato, cabbage.  I ordered the seafood enchilada for my entree, and I did not enjoy that.  the salmon and other fish inside the enchilada tasted off, like fish that was getting old and almost to the point of being bad, but they still cooked it anyway.  I also wanted some "spice" to my food.  everything was sort of bland, which is really not what you want when eating Tex-Mex (or whatever Mexican fusion type of food this is supposed to be...)

my boyfriend enjoyed his steak burrito, but he also felt like the food was overpriced for what we got.
