Suave, Yo quiero Restaurant Mexico
Sauve, Okay-O I don't know Spanish
Sauve, but I really like this song

Besame indeed, man I was totally hungry walking into Restaurant Mexico!  This little shop down on Mill Ave.  After a few drinks or two.  This place hit the spot.  

I can't say it was the best I ever had.  However, the service was really good.  I ordered the basic taco meal with beans and rice.  Like most Mexican restaurants they offer free chips and salsa.  Salsa was good and the chips seem pretty solid in a good way.  My taco entree came quick right after I order leading me to think of it like cafeteria food.  I guess it was so quick I had in mind some lady slopping it onto my plate while smoking a cigarette.  I'm sure that's not the case.

Moreover, my tacos were good.  Nice shredded beef in a deep fried taco shell.  My favorites were the rice because they were a tad bit different from what I was used to.  Mexican rice is generally pretty bland, but here it was nice soft and sweet.  One of the best I've had I must add!  

Overall, experience at the Restaurant Mexico is good.  It's right in the heart of college town so my surprise was the pricing.  I guess when I went to college long long long time ago food was much cheaper!  Wow kids are rich these days! - Enjoy!
