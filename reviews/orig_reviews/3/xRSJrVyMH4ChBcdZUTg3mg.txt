I really wanted to like this restaurant--great concept, great location. The food was pretty good. It's dumb that you have to pay for the chips and salsa. The trio app is entirely overpriced. However, the biggest issue was the service. It took 15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table, another 25 to receive our first round of drinks, and then another 10 to come back to take our order. The waitress rolled her eyes at us for asking about a part of our order that never arrived and asking for more chips. Honestly, she needs to just be fired--it was the worst service I've had in a while. I am hopeful that this restaurant gets it together from a service standpoint because a lot of the reviews seem to echo the same concern. Overall, average food, poor service, but awesome venue and location. Management at Rurus--please help your servers!!
