Place was good, but not worth the rave reviews. 

Service was poor, and our server was aloof. We never received our appetizer. He came by infrequently, spent minimal time at the table, and could be easily replaced by an iPad. The menu clearly states absolutely no split checks or split plates. This place needs to get a new attitude, or a calculator. Service is obviously not high management priority. 

The Carne Adovada was a salt bomb, but still good. For $17 I could think of a million other things I would rather eat. 

The atmosphere is cool.
