We popped in here for one reason and one reason only: the Tejas Trio.

Don't be fooled by the simple name.  It includes fresh chips, hand-hacked guacamole, chile con queso with chorizo and salsa picante to create a winning combination of goodness.  We also received the complimentary cornbread and ordered the Catfish Beignets, both of which I really enjoyed.

This is a great joint if you're looking to have a light lunch or quick bite to eat.
