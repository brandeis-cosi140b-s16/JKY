People go nuts for this place, me? Eeehhh....
The tacos are pretty good but not amazing. The wait to order is usually insane. Last time I was there, there were 4 separate lines and the lines stretched outside (should be an indication of amazingness but no), needles to say we waited for like 40 min to order. I don't think they're 40 min wait good... The lines are usually crazy and chaotic so be prepared. 
They do have a nice variety of meats for a fast food type of joint. They have options like chicken, steak, beef shoulder, tongue, brain and spicy pork. The spicy pork is the best! Those are 4*.
