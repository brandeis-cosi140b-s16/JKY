Been here a couple of times and the food & service has always been great! Today the service was horrible. We sat at our table and no one even took our drink order until 10 mins later. Then another 10 mins go by and they take our food order. Food was delicious as always but then we order desert and another 10 mins go by and the waiter said he didn't understand why we still had no desert after so long of a wait. So to top things off we had to take our check to the bar to pay. They said they had some Xmas parties going & that's why they were slow but after the place emptied out I saw them do the same thing to the table next to us. I hope this was just an off nite.
