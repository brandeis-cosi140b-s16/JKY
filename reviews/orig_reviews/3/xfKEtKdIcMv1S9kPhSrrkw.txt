This was our second time here in a month - this time without the kiddo and for happy hour in the bar area.  This is the first place I'm reviewing where I need to offer a breakdown to explain my rating.  And this is a place I really WANT TO LIKE, since it's close to home and we love finding a great mexican food place to be loyal to.  Just not feeling it, mostly due to service issues.  The food has been consistently good.

FOOD:  4 stars.  Both times the food has been 4 stars and pretty good overall. The Spicy Shrimp nachos are our favorite - but they are skimpy on the shrimp.  Today we had the Chicken Enchilada nachos - they are very good too.  

MENU:  We returned within one month because we enjoyed the happy hour food and drink specials (some of the nachos are offered for $6 and they have 2-for-$4 street tacos, among some other items).  But today when we arrived, the menu had changed and the food item we wanted was no longer on happy hour.  Bummer.  And, not cool.  I don't like changing menus - it's bait and switch.  The waitress said, "We wanted to remove our popular items and replace them with other things so you would try different nachos."  Hmmmm.  

Additionally, while ordering drinks from the HH menu, we asked about chips and salsa.  We aren't trying to get anything for free - but you would think with a $25 bar tab - they could provide FREE chips and salsa.  NOPE.  It's $3.  

My husband asked for a side of jalepenos for his nacho platter.  They brought a little sauce cup with about 10 little jalepenos.  Then we got the bill and they charged us $2 for them.  Not cool.  At least tell us they will be extra - but really they SHOULD BE FREE!  

I enjoy the BOGO free Margaritas at happy hour ($8)- which might be the ONLY reason I return.
