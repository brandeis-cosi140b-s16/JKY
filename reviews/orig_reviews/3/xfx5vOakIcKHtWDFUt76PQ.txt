How have I not reviewed this place? I have been here a couple times, with the most recent being a month or two ago. The husband and I went for happy hour, which was alright. I had been excited to try happy hour here, but I was a little less than impressed. The happy hour specials are only available at the bar, which was somewhat crowded and put you in close quarters with other people. The happy hour drinks are somewhat limited to beer/wine/ margarita. I had the margarita and it was not fantastic... very standard margarita fare. The happy hour pricing on the food is a dollar or two off normal price, but the portions are large. I had the adovado sliders and the husband had the sloppy joe.... I thought they both were lacking something, maybe a fresh element? They were very filling and tasted alright, but I wouldn't go back for either dish. Other items may be better (and I've had some really good items at Richardson's and Dick's in the past...) so I would go again, but it isn't at the top of my list.
