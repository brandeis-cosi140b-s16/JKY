For the money I was expecting more service and a more unique taste.  I am from Salt Lake City but have also lived in California and Texas and I have eaten more Mexican food from more Mexican restaurants than any other type of quinine. Fred's Mexican in California and Sonora Grill in Ogden Utah are every bit as good if not better than Border Grill and the cost is around a third of what it is at Border Grill. It was obvious to me that when you eat at a restaurant inside of a casino in Vegas you are really paying for convenience and atmosphere, not necessarily a culinary experience.  My advice to you if you are reading this review is to save the cash for the shows and gambling, eat at Chilis or any other decent place and then you won't be disappointed.
