Wow, I wasn't sure what to think after reading the reviews for this place-it seems like you either love it or hate it.....and I think I am stuck in the middle. 

We went here for the other night and there was a wait on a Tuesday night which completely threw me off. Maybe some people on Yelp were wrong and the food is just that good that people will wait awhile? Well, possibly but turns out 2/3 of their dining room was being renovated so they were just seating people in the one that didn't need to have any work done on it. Usually this wouldn't bother me but I had a flight to catch so I wanted the process to be a little quicker. 

Once seated we were greeted and got our fresh chips with four different kinds of salsa and sauces. If you're a free chip hound like me, be prepared to pay for a second or third basket since they charge $2.95 after the first one. One was definitely enough to split between two people. Everything on their menu looked appetizing and I ended up going with the flautas since I didn't want to be that girl on the plane carrying on leftover Mexican food. They were fresh and brought out with a heaping service of refried beans, cheese and rice. I love their presentation of the food-it's laid out on a school lunch like tray and rolled out to you on a random little cart (kind of like a bussers.....hopefully they dont use this for both). There were a lot of bigger groups there, including a birthday party next to us in which one of the kids came up to our table, said "Muuuuuurdeeeer" then walked away. Can I get a wtf? 

By the time the sopapillas came out, I could only stomach a bite or two but it was delish!
