Took at walk here for lunch with a few of my co-workers.  I would have never found this place on my own.  Its off the beaten path.  I ordered 2 tacos, one beef and one chicken.  I liked the beef one, very flavorful.  Although I did get some gristle in it.  The chicken one was just meh.  I would not order that one again.  These tacos are more authentic that what you think of from most of the Tex-mex joints around here.  Served with 2 tortillas and a large portion of meat.  There is no cheese in traditional tacos so you won't find any shredded jack cheese here.  The things you can add are mainly just chunky salsas and sauces that you can cram your taco full.  This is a 'hunch' kind of meal.  No seats since its street food.  Just gotta find a spot to hunch over your food and try not to let the mess from your overly filled taco hit your shirt.  I will re-review again later and only get the beef next time.  I must have just had an unlucky taco since none of my co-workers seemed to get gristle in theirs.  I'll give it another go.
