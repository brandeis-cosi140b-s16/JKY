Sahara location is huge, but definitely not a happening place. They have a ton of TVs and play these super annoying 80s videos! Margaritas r really good, nachos r ok, and they don't have a huge selection of combo dinners or even main courses... This is my second time coming here and I'm not impressed at all!
