Stopped by this place for a late lunch and let yelp reviews decide what I ordered. Had shrimp, chicken, and pork tacos. I also tried the croquettes as well. Shrimp taco had the most flavor of anything I had. The salsas I tried lacked kick but hit the spot in the fresh department. I wan not impressed with the chicken or pork tacos, to me the meat was a bit dry and with the tortilla it just added to it. 

Shrimp taco yum
Spicy mayo bomb 
Pork and pineapple combo good
Pork and chicken was dry 

I'll give it another shot one day. The design of the place is pretty cool with the storage container look and feel.
