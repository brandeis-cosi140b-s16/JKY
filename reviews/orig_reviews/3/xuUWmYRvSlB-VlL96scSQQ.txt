Stopped in here to munch before having cocktails at The Chandalier. Lotus chips and habanero salsa are a match made in heaven. Fish tacos and bean tacos were good... Glass noodle salad is refreshing but overpriced and not filling.

This is tapas style, so be prepared to order a lot to feel satisfied... Which gets pricey ( but it's Vegas, so you knew that, right?) Great snacks or appetizer option before hitting the town!
