We chose this place after an extraordinary experience at the Blue Adobe Sante Fe Grille on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd in Scottsdale.  I believe the two were once one and split off to two different owners and somewhat similar menus.

This was okay - but not nearly as good as our experience at the Scottsdale restaurant.  We even ordered that sounded like the same plate we loved in Scottsdale, but neither  the tenderloin stuffed chili relleno nor the smoked pork tamale compared taste wise to the same items on the "Cruz Kitchen"  plate at the Blue Adobe Sante Fe Grille.

We'd probably go back if in Mesa, but I'd find something else to order.  I saw another review of their pozole - which I love - but didn't see on the menu this time.  With any luck.......
