Hmmm ... well it was good, just not great. 

I had the shrimp taco and it came super hot but relativity tasteless. My girl Jacquid had the same thing (two shrimp tacos) and the total came to $25... not exactly a bargain in my book.

That said the interior is small but beautiful (lot of art on the walls).
