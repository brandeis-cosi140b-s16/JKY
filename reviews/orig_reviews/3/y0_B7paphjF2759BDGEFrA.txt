We had lunch at SOL and were pleasantly surprised. Our server recommended the special tacos ordered individually. In particular the vampiro. He was right. It was tasty and unique. The meat was tender and the toppings were abundant without being over powering. Our children ordered off the kids menu and were happy with their chicken and cheese tacos and red rice. As a starter you get complimentary tortilla chips and a couple of dips. One dip in particular was quite tasty but garlicky. Overall  a tasty meal and decent service.
