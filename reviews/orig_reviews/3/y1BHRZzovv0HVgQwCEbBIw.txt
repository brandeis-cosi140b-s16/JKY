Went for lunch so I was thinking lunch prices. First, margaritas are $9.  Sorry, but that is ridiculous.  I opted not to get one but my husband did.  Good thing because it was pure alcohol.  If you actually enjoy margaritas for the taste and not the alcohol content you will not like this.  They do not have a very large menu.  Most items are $14+ unless you want a basic burrito for $8.95 but then rice and beans are $4 extra. I figured maybe I would just get two tacos but those were almost $5 each.  For ONE taco. Oh and add a dollar if you want soft tortilla instead of hard shell. What?!  I ended up ordering the chorizo appetizer and my husband had the burrito.  The food was very good I will admit.  I love spicy and mine was spicy.  We ended up taking some home as the portions were large.  I don't however see us going back soon. Yes the food was good but I feel like they nickel and dime you here.   Too expensive for my taste.
