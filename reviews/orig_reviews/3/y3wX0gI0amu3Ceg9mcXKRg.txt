We popped in here one day, just for drinks. It'd been a long day and we just needed something, stat!

The place was super crowded, but we managed to find seating in the bar area right off the bat. The server was great, but didn't seem to know very much about alcohol. You'd be forgiven except that you're working in the bar, so I don't understand that. He was friendly and accommodating, at least, so I suppose that makes up for it.

We had a negro modelo and a bourbon. The total bill was something like $29. What is this, Los Angeles? Yeah, that's the last time I'll be having drinks here. I get that you have valet parking and that makes you fancy, but wow.. 

The menu did look amazing. I'll be back at some point for the food, but I hear water tastes pretty great, too. My bank account loves tap water.
