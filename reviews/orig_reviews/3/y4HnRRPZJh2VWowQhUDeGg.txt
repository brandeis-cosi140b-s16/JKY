New joint on the Strip. Definitely gets brownie points for lots of TV's, a great bar area, lots of Tequila choices, plenty of chips and salsa, and some pretty tasty food. Minus points for very slow service (not the servers fault but kitchen was too slow for a sunday night) & the weak and pricy drinks. But overall, I like this place. Very big (multi level) so plenty of sitting and standing area. And the food was really tasty again...i had the carnitas burrito and it was damn good. I will definitely go back again for more.
