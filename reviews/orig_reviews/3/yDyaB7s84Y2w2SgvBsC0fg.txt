My horchata was tasty.  The carne asada tacos were not.  I ordered just the 2 taco combo. Came with beans and rice.  Rice was kinda dry, I had to mix some salsa and beans in with it to eat it.  The carne asada was super greasy and the tortillas were not warmed up enough I think as they were kinda stiff.  The gordita's my dude ordered looked far superior to my food.  

I like how they had a little market and bakery in there.  The self serve salsa bar was nice.  This ambiance was very authentically Mexican.  Colors, smells, sounds, everything.

I'll be back to try something different.
