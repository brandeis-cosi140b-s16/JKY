We went there for Sunday brunch. You can't order from the menu Sunday morning so it's either the Sunday brunch buffet or ... go somewhere else to eat. It's $15 per person for the buffet and there's a nice selection. The huevos rancheros was pretty good but a little bland as was the chorizo & eggs scramble. I suspect it's for the typical tourist's palate. The salsas and pico de gallo also had little or no bite. The food is filling and there's fruit, breads, flan and even salad to choose from so there was variety. It's a little expensive for what you get I think. And it would all be pretty ordinary if not for the big pond with green water with ducks and turtles that contributed to the ambiance. (Don't look too closely into the water because there are gross things in there that will make you lose your appetite.) 

We sat out on the patio, the weather was nice and mild and the pond was "interesting" and despite the color, not smelly. I enjoyed the live music too. I've never been here for happy hour but I suspect having drinks here is fun. I'd probably come here again for the brunch since the food is predictable and plentiful and the location is convenient for us. If you go, just don't expect it to be anything but average.
