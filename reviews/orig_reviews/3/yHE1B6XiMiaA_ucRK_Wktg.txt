Both of the times I ate this food, I asked for it to-go so I could take it back to my room and devour it in private.
The corn tamales were not very good. The quesadillas were good.
This place just gives me a huge headache being inside of, but that's how I feel about most of Las Vegas, so I can't give it too much guff.
