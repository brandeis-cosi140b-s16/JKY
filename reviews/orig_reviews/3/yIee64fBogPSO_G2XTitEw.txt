We were going to the theater and via Yelp discovered Fuego.. We ate inside, its a little small it seemed inside and patio. I am still not sure if they have a different menu often as what we came for based on a photo on Yelp was not listed on our Menus.. but after a quick review we found some good meals.. the Corn Bread with Chile Verde was fantastic same as the meat loaf.. the Carne Asada Nachos and the the fish taco not so much.. Service was great and the place had a cool vibe.. Walk to all sports and theaters from here..
