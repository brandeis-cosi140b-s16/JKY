I ordered online for pick-up, and the taco shop messed up my order a bit--I didn't get a taco I ordered. Their carne is quite flavorful, although there isn't anything special about their chicken, and I can't write about their pastor because that was the item I didn't receive. The vampiros are quite tasty, and although their name might suggest so, they do not cause you to grow fangs.

The cochata, a mix of iced coffee and horchata, is quite unique, and I'd have to recommend that--their jamaica tastes far more like cranberry juice than it did hibiscus.

If my order wasn't messed up and if the service was faster (the cashier continually asked the other employees for help), the food could've merited four stars for the restaurant.
