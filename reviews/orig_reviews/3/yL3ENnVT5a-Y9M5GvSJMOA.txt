Hideaway? More like a complete secret. There were no signs or anything out front and we barely found the place. Thank goodness for iphone maps. 

Anyway, once inside we were greeted quickly. The main area consisted of a long bar and a few tables, but it was full. So, we got the next best thing...our own large table in the private party room. Ok? I thought. But, I was hungry and really craving New Mexican cuisine. After a short wait, our food came. I got the New Mexican Sampler. It consisted of rice, beans, a burro, a enchilada, and quesadilla. The burro and quesadilla were yummy, but the enchilada was a little too dry for my taste. The beans and rice were good too. The only negative was that the entire platter was topped with a ton of cheese. That probably explains why they have pizza on the menu. Also, my dining partner ordered the quesadilla sampler and the cheese was prevalent again. I guess going forward you can always ask for less cheese. Otherwise, the food here is good and hearty. Don't come with a light apetite.
