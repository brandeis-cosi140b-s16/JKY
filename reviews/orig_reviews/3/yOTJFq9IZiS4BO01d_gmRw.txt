We came here on our first night since it was in the hotel where we stayed. It was fun! They offered two for one drinks, so of couse we were sold! They give you the yard long masterpieces full of tequila and juices (many other options, but I wanted strength), which was pretty good. I ordered mini burgers which were pretty good as well, nothing super memorable. It was fun how they bring around different signs that point you out in a funny way... we all got a kick out of that. Music was good, I definitely got up and danced when I shouldn't have. Oh well, it's Vegas... you have to! If I stayed at TI again I would visit, but otherwise might try to find something else just to change it up.
