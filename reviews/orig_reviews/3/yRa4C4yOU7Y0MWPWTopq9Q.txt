We ate there for lunch over President's weekend.  We sat at the counter, as the restaurant was full.  The place has a 50s diner feel.  They had live music, which was fun.  Our burgers were good and service was OK  And the meal was affordable.  The only complaint is that we had an ENTERTAINMENT coupon and rather than removing one of the burgers (buy one get one free) from our bill, they deducted the price by hand and left the tax on it.
