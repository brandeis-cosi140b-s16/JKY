After reading the reviews, I guess I was expecting more.  We started with the setas, which were very good.  But the Caldo Tlalpe√±o was much more soupy than what I expected.  Unfortunately, it was followed by the Don't be Jealous (hot and sour) soup.  Although that is what we ordered, the dishes come out from the kitchen as they are ready.  It would have been better if the setas had been served between the caldo and the soup.

But the big disappointment came at desert.  We ordered the Chocolate Terra Cotta Warriors which are described as "caramelized bananas / sesame."  But what came out was three thin cross sections of a banana and a chocolate "terra cotta warrior" on a bed of dry oreo cookie crumgs.  The chocolate was filled with a chocolate creme and there were two dollops of vanilla ice cream on the plate, but despite all of that, the desert was exceptionally dry.  great presentation, but short on the edibility scale.

I had the Santa Quiteria with the meal.  It was so-so and the portion was among the smallest pour of any wine I had while in Las Vegas.

I don't think this place really compares to Rick Bayless's restaurants or other top restaurants in Las Vegas.  But if you are near the City Centre and want a quick, small bite, this is a good place to go.
