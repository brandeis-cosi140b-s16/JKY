We walked in told it was going to be a 25 minute wait, so I went to the bar and asked for a cup of ice water which the bartender so nicely gave me, then filled it up 3 more times before we got seated. NICE...

We got a table by the window so people watching was pretty cool wait we waited for our food. Its loud though at times we barely could hear each other. But its Vegas I expect that.

Chips and Salsa to start, $4. Really?!? Kinda funny. Drinks we decent, I got one with fresh raspberrys I won't lie it was nice and fresh. I ordered the Steak Tacos, $17 bucks, but at least they give you all the fixing on the side. 

All in all it was a decent lunch, a little over priced but the service and food is good.
