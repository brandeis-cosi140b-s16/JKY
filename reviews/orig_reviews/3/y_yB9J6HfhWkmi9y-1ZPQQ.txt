I used to come here a good bit and chill with friends- grab some good drinks and tacos.
Place has changed though overtime. Drinks are still great. Food is good too, as always.
Ever since they put in that "dance" floor though, I feel like the place's vibe has changed. It's still a cool spot to check out if you've never been here... but if you're looking for a place that's a bit more low-key, relaxing, chill, and doesn't blast music - I probably wouldn't come here.
That being said - everyone should at least come here once and check it out - you might like it! It used to be my go to stop when I was back visiting Pittsburgh.
