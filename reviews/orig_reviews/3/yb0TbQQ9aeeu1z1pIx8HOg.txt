The first time I went there was on a Tuesday right before closing, the food was great and the tamales were fresh and delicious.

I was back in vegas, went in there for lunch and fell sick and the smell and taste of the tamales and enchilada. It wasn't the same. and they had gone up in price?
I probably won't go here again unless it's for a churo :)
