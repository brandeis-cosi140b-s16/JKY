Katrina L and I dined at the very same table and her dead-on coverage of Cien Agaves' strengths (recessionista-friendly) and weaknesses (atmosphere, "margs") has tempted me to chime in. The vibe here is pretty blah. If they invested a little in some art/curtains/less bright lights, I think this place could be considered a fun date place, as opposed to a destination for a grande groups.

Maybe my time back on the East Coast has made me desperate for any kind of edible Mexican, but I did enjoy the food. The queso was a huge hit (turns out chorizo in melted cheese can change lives) and the dos tacos especial (2 tacos- you can mix and match any from the menu + rice + beans = $8.95) made the menu muy caliente to me.
