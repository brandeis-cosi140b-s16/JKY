This place opened right around the time that the House of Brews shut down. So the UNLV Allstars came here and started things off with some beer called 1776 (I think). Anyhow, I found it odd the owners let us write on the walls in marker and whatever we had available (blood?) But whatever. 

They have some pretty good tacos though. I thinkt he place is usually a little pricey. But, if you're looking for beer, somewhere to sit, and relax a little, this is the place.
