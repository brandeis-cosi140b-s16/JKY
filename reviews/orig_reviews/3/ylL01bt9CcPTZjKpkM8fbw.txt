Our family loves this restaurant and eat there often.  This new building is beautiful, but the booths are terribly uncomfortable. 
The service is hit or miss...been more misses than hits lately.  I only gave three stars because of the service. The food is consistently good and well prepared.  Their salsa is good (not great) and the hot sauce is HORRIBLE.
