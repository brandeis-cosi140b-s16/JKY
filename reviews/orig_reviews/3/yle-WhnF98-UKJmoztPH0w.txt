Saw this facility on the foot networks "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" and had to say it didn't meet up to the shows hype, hype kills... Food was somewhat generic and oily... Granted it was tasty to a certain degree on my pallet but nothing worth mentioning afterwards nor was it worth the "drive" to get there... I guess I hyped myself up for failure... Place is worth another visit if I was ever in the neighborhood.
