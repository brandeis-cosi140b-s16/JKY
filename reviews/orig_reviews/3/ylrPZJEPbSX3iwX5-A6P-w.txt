Think of this as a mediocre version of Tacos El Gordo, but in Henderson and less authentic. I had the al pastor fries, which were decent. The meat came from a metal tin like they would do at Chipotle. Al pastor meat only comes straight off the spit when ordering a taco. I didn't try any of the tacos, so I'll have those next time and maybe this place can earn a higher rating.
