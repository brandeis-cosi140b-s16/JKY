was about a year ago, went here for breakfast

friends stuck with basic bacon and eggs choice, so really can't judge place on that

I don't recall exactly what I had, I know it was a pork dish with a corn cake and egg, maybe a modern take on huervos rancheros?

in any case, we haven't been back, not that it wasn't good, it's just kind of out of the way of our normal travels. I am not sure if they still do breakfast either, but if I am in area, will give them a shot for lunch
