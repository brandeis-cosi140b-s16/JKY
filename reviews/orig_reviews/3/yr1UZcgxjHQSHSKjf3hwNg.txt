So I went here for lunch today with my dad and my grandma and I thought it was just ok... definitely not as good as everyone made it seem. We had a little trouble finding it, as there is no sign, but it is right next to Luci's market. The set up is a bit weird with a bar and then a couple huge tables in the back. We sat at the really big table with just three of us. I ended up ordering the New Mexican platter that had a chili relleno, tamale, and chicken burro with green sauce and red sauce on the side. I asked or no beans, but I got em anyway, which actually turned out fine because I liked their beans (i usually am not a fan). My dad got the blue, white, and yellow (?) corn enchiladas. His was actually better than mine in my opinion. However, I thought the best item was the tamale... i think it had pork in it, not sure, but it was quite tasty. The relleno wasn't anything special and I actually really did not like the chicken burro... so much so that I only had a few bites of it. The chicken tasted weird... like maybe it was boiled in dirty water or something... not good. at all. So overall it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't want to pay 15$ when 2/3s of the food was meh or less. If I did go back, I think I would stick with the pork, that seemed to be the winning meat at this restaurant... and really, when isn't it?
