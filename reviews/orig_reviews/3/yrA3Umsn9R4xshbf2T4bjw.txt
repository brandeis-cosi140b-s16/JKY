I stopped in on a recommendation from a friend.  It wasn't bad...but I wasn't all that impressed myself.  The place is cool looking...loks like it could have a cool atmosphere.  Personally though...wasn't all that thrilled. 

The Good:  Cool looking place. 

The Meh:  Maybe it's just because I discovered I'm not a Green Chili fan...or maybe a fan of the way they do it.  I got the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Just seemed like it was more spicy than flavorful.  The rice was good.  Black beans were tasty (and I'm not a bean fan).  The enchiladas though...didn't seem like they had anything done to them.  Meet wrapped in the tortilla (didn't even notice if the shrimp one had anything in it).  At least it was all slathered in chili and cheese...  I'd give it another shot though but I would try something else off a different section of the menu.  Plus...pricey.  Yeah..it was a decent amount of food...but $11 for a couple enchiladas seems excessive.  

The Bad: I don't know...maybe I should've stood up and waved my hands around...but just seemed like I didn't really get much in the way of service.  Yes...I sat at the bar...but it seemed like others were getting attention (regulars perhaps?).  Took awhile before interest was shown to take my order...then awhile again after I was finished to get the bill.

Overall:  Cool looking place, kinda pricey.  Service, meh.  Food items, not bad.  I'll rate again if/when go again and try something different.
