Pretty pedestrian Mexican food. The tacos and taquitas are fried and greasy, but I like them anyway. Also, the restaurant is bright and busy at lunchtimes, and the staff seem friendly. However, the other reviewers are right ~ the salsa is boring. There are better Mexican food restaurants, but Someburros! is a good place to get a quick lunch bite.
