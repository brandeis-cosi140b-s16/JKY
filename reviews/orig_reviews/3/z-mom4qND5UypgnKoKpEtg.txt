Let me start by saying the food was awesome.  It was hot, it was flavorful, and after I ordered it was in front of me in under 5 minutes.  The chips and salsa that come with it are also pretty tasty.

The establishment itself is tiny.  we are talking maximum occupancy of 15 kind of tiny for seating, there is the low bar at the counter and the high bar lining the exterior windows and that is all.  Very cramped, makes this place more of a to go only restaurant unless you like feeling like a sardine.

The parking lot was even worse, there are maybe 6 spots to park and 2 are handicap spots.  I got lucky and pulled into one with my tiny Kia Soul that barely squeezed into the spot on the end simultaneously pissing off the other 12 cars trying to figure out how to park at this establishment and not having much luck.

Overall, The food is great, get it to go and walk there if you can because you are not going to find a place to park.
