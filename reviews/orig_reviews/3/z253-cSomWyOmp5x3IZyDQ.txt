Went to this place hoping for fantastico burgers.  The burger was reasonably ok.  Chocolate shake was made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup.  I know that is a technically correct method for making a chocolate shake, but I am a purist.  A chocolate shake should be chocolate ice cream and milk.
