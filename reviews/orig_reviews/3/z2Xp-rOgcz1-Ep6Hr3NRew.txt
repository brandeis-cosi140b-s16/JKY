Every time I get the opportunity to eat at place that can remind me of my madreland I'm always a sucker to try it.  Most times I'm not impressed because... See review for all the other Mexican places I have ventured but other times it's a great experience and treat. 

Meantime I decided to go out with my team and we looked forward to this awesome atmosphere and restaurant located in old town Snobsdale. We made reservations and ended up with Lauren our server for the night.  We ordered appetizers like the Guacamole and the cheese plate.  The guacamole was good but nothing beyond what other local joints can do and I was not impressed with the portion which was very small. The cheese plate was not my favorite.

We kept getting pushed to hurry and order and we were still having cocktails and waiting for another member. The server said if there was any chance we can call our friend to order her food because they needed to serve more guest?? What the French! Did we just get checked at a high end restaurant and were told to hurry up?! 

By the time we got our food I was really annoyed.  Here I am bringing out my team and although I understand you have a busy place, get over yourself and make sure your hostess doesn't seat us if we don't have a party versus making such a classless move.  Foul!

The food was okay but my experience just bummed me out.  I talked to the manager, Brian and he said it was a tough balance and hoped we can understand.  We will see whether I would ever do this again.  It's not like I do this every once in a while, I'm out and about all the time.  Boo
