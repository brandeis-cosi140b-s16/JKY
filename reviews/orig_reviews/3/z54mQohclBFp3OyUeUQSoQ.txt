For such a highly-rated restaurant on yelp, I was disappointed.

We made a reservation for graduation Sunday at 8:30 pm. I called back a week before we went to make sure they didn't screw up our reservation. They assured me that the reservation was still there.

Well, it wasn't. They screwed up our reservation, and we had to wait till 9:10 pm to be seated. The group ahead of us, who DIDN'T make a reservation, got a table before us. I asked if there's a point at all to make a reservation, and the owner stuttered. The owner then attempted to seat 5 of us at a small table meant for 4 at most which I thought was a little ridiculous. Being a server myself, I could've found a better spot ESPECIALLY when there's an empty 2-person table that could easily be joined to my table. FYI, the place was busy, but it was NOT packed since it's 8:30 pm on a Sunday night. The also had a special graduation menu which is almost identical to the regular menu but pricier. 

Food was good, but not great. We got 2 appetizers and 5 dishes, and we all sampled each other's. I liked the duck and the tilapia entree the most. I don't think anyone liked the chicken with mole sauce at all, but at least it was tenderly cooked. 

I got the red sangria which I didn't really like, but my dad did.

This place didn't blow me away like I hoped it would. I've had better food in Champaign.
