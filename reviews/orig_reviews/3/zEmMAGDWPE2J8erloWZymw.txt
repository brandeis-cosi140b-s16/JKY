Good chips & salsa and the chicken taquitos were great. They come in a lettuce wrap style, but you don't have to eat them that way if you want.

They would get more stars, but you can't order the street tacos in the restaurant, the little street taco stand is separate. Why? Only some dumb manager knows the answer to this.
