Really nothing to write home about. I had a burrito with shredded beef, beans, and cheese and it came out to $8.30. No drink. Pretty pricey for something so basic. Like I said taste wasn't anything special. 

The place was nice for taking place in the middle of the hood.  I thought mi abuela was going take my order. Hence 3 stars instead of 2.
