I kind of went in with the preconceived notion that this place would be just so-so. I found it hard to believe that a Nacho joint could do anything super special. The food was decent, service was so-so, and the coke machine was broke. Their first impression was fair to partly cloudy at best.

The food was aight. Not great, not terrible. Definitely get a lot of Nacho for your buck. They're piled high and visually were pretty neat. Not very practical as they were piled high on a tiny plate. I couldn't figure out if it was more like a game of Jenga or an avalanche when I was trying to decide which chip to take. The chicken nachos were good, chicken was a touch dry, the beans were a little cold, but the chips were fresh and the other toppings very good. I was a little disappointed that the soda machine was broke, since Mexican food without soda is like peanut butter without jelly. Well maybe not that bad, but you get the point. The server was okay, not terrible not great, just middle of the road.

I would probably give them another shot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. A coupon would probably give me more incentive to go back.
