When I stumbled on this little gem my first thought was "is the chef mad, a genius, or a mad genius to have a Chinese Mexican restaurant?"  Turns out he is a rather clever fellow that has created a nice little place. 

The food is very good. A little over priced. But good. I had the Duck Tongue Taco. Yes you read that right. Duck Tongue. It was well interesting.  Also had some sticky buns which were freaking fantastic. 

I don't know if I'd go out of my way to eat here again but I  glad I tried it once. Plus the service was excellent.
