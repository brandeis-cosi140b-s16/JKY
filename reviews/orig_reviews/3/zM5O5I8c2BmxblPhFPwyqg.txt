Short story:  horrible service that took entirely too long..decent food

Long story: coworkers and I went here for a 'quick' meal before shooting the pac12 tournament.  The complimentary chips and dip were among the best I've ever had.  And out of all the Meximerican we've all had, that's saying something.  The service is hard to overlook in a dinning experience. And the experience here was among the worst.  Despite not being too busy our food took an hour to arrive.  Not cool man.  When it did get there it was on the colder side of lukewarm. If you're in the hard rock check out either places like culinary dropout.  Much better choice
