I was here for a work dinner and overall, the place is solid.  The chips and table side guacamole were great.  The drinks were a little weak. I ordered the coke carnitas and was a little disappointed.  It didn't have a lot of favor.  Other people enjoyed their dinners.  Next time, I'll have to make a better selection.  We didn't have room for dessert because we all ate too many chips -- they're that good.

The service was very good. My water and my drink were never empty.  And everyone was super nice.  Definitely deserves a repeat visit when I'm in LV again.
