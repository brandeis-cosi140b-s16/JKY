Checking out the $20 brunch

Go for the ambiance and bring a camera.  It's a fun field trip to try to find or even get into the Saguaro Hotel.  They've done a great job renovating the entire property and has the feel of a big resort.  That being said...it feels like a big resort...not a lot of people around.  It would actually be a great place to film a zombie movie!

We were one of three tables in the place as they had just opened and took probably 20 minutes to get our food.  Unless we're at a Luau and you have to pull the pig out of the ground...I'm just saying there' not enough chips and salsa to keep me happy.

Our server was great and chatty through the whole process.  We originally tried to go to the Scottsdale Street Eats food truck festival, which turned out to be a gong show.  So Distrito was our final destination.  Brunch is served with a small app and your main dish for $20. It ends up being a mountain for food after the chips and salsa for a starter.

I'd recommend just splitting an appetizer and I think they do an entree/beer deal.

Food was good/fresh, but they'll have to work hard to start drawing a crowd in
