The carne asada tacos were mediocre at best. The meat was not very good and kind of dry, the tortillas were just ok. The fish tacos were really really good! The fish was perfectly fried to a golden crisp, the cabbage was crunchy and they sauce the poured over the tacos was perfect. Both red and green salsas were really good. I also had a quesadilla which was great, good cheese and a good tortilla! This is a great taco to satisfy some late night craving for Mexican food, much better than a filibertos or their many clones.
