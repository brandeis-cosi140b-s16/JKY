Stopped by for breakfast on Sunday and despite the unassuming exterior found the restaurant and food to be good. I ordered ham and eggs which was good, but not great. My brother got the torta and it was certainly filling and tasty. I can't say it was the best breakfast I've had but was a food home cooked Mexican breakfast which was a welcomed taste of home for a Texas girl living in Georgia.
