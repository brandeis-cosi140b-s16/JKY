It wasn't anything special or out of this world delicious. I ordered a carne asada burrito. The portion was pretty, big definitely couldn't finish on my own. I could buy the same burrito at Roberto's and in fact I'd rather go to Tacos Mexico because their burritos are so much better, more flavor more quality! Wouldn't really recommend this place unless you're looking for average food.
