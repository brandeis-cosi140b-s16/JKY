Located inside the Miracle Mile Shops.  Place was hopping, nice atmoshere with TV's blaring.  Glenda was our server, very pleasant.  Service was good.  I ordered the California Burrito.  Included black beans inside.  It tasted fresh and good, but not great.  Salsa was excellent, though.
Not a bad place for lunch, I may return when I go into the shops again.
