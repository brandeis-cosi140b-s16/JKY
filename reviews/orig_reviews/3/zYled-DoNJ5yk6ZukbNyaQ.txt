Stopped by to have a drink and some snacks with my husband such a beautiful place we love the music and the atmosphere waitress very nice we tried the quesadillas which we really enjoyed the chips were good too then it came down to the drinks I tried the long island iced tea hmm no bueno tasted like cheap liquor then I went for an apple martini omg no Bueno it felt like I was drinking syrup so I returned both drinks the part that I like the most is that the manager came to see if there was anything that he could do and that is a plus in my book overall we will definitely come back .
