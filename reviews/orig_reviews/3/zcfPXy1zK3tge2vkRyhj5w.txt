El segundos is a classic tex mex joint located in the fashion show mall right on Las Vegas Blvd. Location: check. 

On a Sunday evening our party had seating in the air open patio area under the trees. It was 40 degrees but they had a huge array of water misters to keep us cool. Add to that a nice flavour of energetic beats really led to a casual and fun ambiance. 

I would recommend the strawberry margaritas which do contain a few fresh strawberries. I also had a quesadilla but instead of meat they let me sub it with ahi tuna. Not super amazing but a solid appy.

Others in my group had fajitas' plate, where you get a bunch of tortillas and you make your own fajitas.  I commend them on having a full assorted of sauces and toppings, which included guac, sour cream, two types of salsa (one regular, one spicy), beans and hot chilli peppers.

Another thing, it's huge. So that means rarely do you have to wait for seating. 

Overall a well rounded mexican place that is low maintenance, fun and good for all ages.
