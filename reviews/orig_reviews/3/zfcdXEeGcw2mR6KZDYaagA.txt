I wanted to love this place, I really did. I live right around the corner, so I have tried out America's a few times, but sadly...I don't think I'll be back. I mean, the food is ok. I do appreciate that the beans are lard free, and the margaritas are surprisingly good (they are in one of those margarita machines, so I had my doubts), but the food has been just - "ok". Truth be told, I haven't tried the famous carne asada (I'm a vegetarian), so that may be the best thing out there, but for burritos, rice, chips, and salsa - it's just not all that impressive.
