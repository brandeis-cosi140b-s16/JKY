Just your typical hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant... but I guess a little more popular in the Scottsdale area.  The guac was good, wish it had a kick to it. The decor was a bunch of painted wall murals, I think very typical of what I've seen at other Mexican joints.  I did have an interesting take on a chile relleno... 'Spicy Chicken Poblano' poblano chili pepper stuffed with spicy chicken, dipped in egg batter, then deep fried and topped with a delicious vegetable tomato sauce served with rice and beans.  Although, once I again i was decieved by the word "spicy" as this had no kick to it... it's what I typically call "white man spicy."   Anyways, it's decent enough, but nothing that makes me think "man I need to go back"
