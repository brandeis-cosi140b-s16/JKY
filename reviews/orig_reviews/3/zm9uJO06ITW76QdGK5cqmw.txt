This place is very good. I've gone many times and have never had a serious problem with any of the dishes I've tried. They offer authentic Mexican "street" food that's delicious and one of the best salsa bars in Vegas. I highly recommend the al pastor tacos, the vampiros, and the horchata!

Unfortunately they're making the common mistake of raising their prices too quickly while also seemingly reducing their portion sizes. That may boost profits temporarily but it will backfire in the end, especially among regular customers. There are way too many other good Mexican places in the valley, and if I'm going to spend $45+ on lunch for two it probably won't be at Taco y Taco.

Also, their ordering system is overly complicated and some of their employees are easily confused. Be sure to double-check your bill as I've had "mystery charges" show up on my bill twice.
