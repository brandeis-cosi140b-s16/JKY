Maybe only two stars.  Service as VERY slow.  Fried avocado not really much flavor.  Jerk chicken burrito very dry and tasteless. BUT, the ox tail was excellent.  And desserts, truffles and plantains, were very good.  BUT, how can a restaurant not have a coffee maker that works fast enough to have coffee with dessert,that itself took a long time to come out.  At least she recognized how slow things were and compted us the appetizers.  So a mix of good and bad, plus as another reviewer wrote, they are very often out of items.  And, it is very loud.
