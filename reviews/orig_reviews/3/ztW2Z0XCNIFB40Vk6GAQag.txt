A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  

Grilled chicken or beef - that's it!  Plates come with beans, salsa and tasty tortillas!  Rice is available for an extra charge.

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!
