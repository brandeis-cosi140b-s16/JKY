We wanted to love this place based on the reviews but left with a feeling of meh..  we stopped by for lunch after the lunch time rush. The chips were cold and stale and left much to be desired. We ordered the enchiladas Rojas and verdes  based on all the recommendations in yelp. Wish I would have chose differently.  The sauce was ok, but the meal itself was lacking. Both in quality and quantity.   I was expecting something different in the meal to make it standout among all the other mexican restaurants in Charlotte but instead was left with a feeling of this restaurant lacking identity among all the others.
