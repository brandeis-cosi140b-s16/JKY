Most of the time I go the food is great. Not over cooked. Just the right amount of sauce. I usually get the emerald chicken, and the jerked pork.  Friendly staff. Clean environment. But the last two times I went the chicken was dry like its been sitting to long. The pork had very little sause, and the rice was old and crunchy. The portions were smaller. The guy behind the counter was a bit rude, and the lobby was a mess. Hope this is not a new trend. I have been a loyal customer for years. Hope you guys shape back up. Hate to loose one of my favorite places to eat.
