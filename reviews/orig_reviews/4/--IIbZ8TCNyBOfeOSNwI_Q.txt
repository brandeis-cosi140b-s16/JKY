Salsa Blanca is an easy restaurant environment. It's an easy restaurant because the staff is friendly and most helpful. Your order is taken at the counter and you typically receive your food within ten minutes of taking a seat. The food is good and plentiful and reasonably priced. It really fits the profile of a good neighborhood restaurant . I would recommend it for sure.
