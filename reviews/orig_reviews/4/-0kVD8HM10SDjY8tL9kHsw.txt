We stopped in on Easter with some friends.  There were eight total of our party.  It took them a few minutes to get a table ready for us, our drink order was taken promptly once we were seated.  The chips and salsa and bean dip were great.

I ordered the spinach enchilada and my wife had the chicken fajitas.  The girls had a kids quesadilla and some rice and beans.  The spinach enchilada was very good.  It was served with a green sauce that had a nice spice to it and I like the rice and beans.  My wife really enjoyed her fajitas.  The friends we were with also enjoyed their food, they are regular customers and recommend the place.

I have wanted to try this place for a while but it is a little out of the way and I never think of it when we want to go eat.  I was glad our friend suggested it and I plan to be here again.
