Great lunch shortly after we landed at Charlotte airport! Fresh tortilla chips and salsa almost immediately appeared at our table when we were seated. The pork carnitas were spectacular and came with a nice variety of fillings to assemble soft tacos with. We also had the shredded beef chimichanga, which was tender and flavorful. The meal was hearty and topped with complimentary dessert of fried tortillas sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, a dollop of whipped cream, and strawberry sauce. Would certainly go back again!
