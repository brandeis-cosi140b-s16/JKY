What a great place to eat.  Friendly service, Freshly  made and oh so tasty.  I suggest you give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Nothing is so spicy hot you can't taste the flavor of the food.  No chicken dishes available.  I hope that the owners will add chicken dishes soon. However you will find the beef to be tender and flavorful.
