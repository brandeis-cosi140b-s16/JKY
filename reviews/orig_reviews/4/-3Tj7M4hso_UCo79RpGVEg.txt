I've eaten at Yolos plenty of times and everyone I end up getting the chicken tortilla soup. For being a casual eatery open to the casino floor, they make a killer tortilla soup. 

This isn't your average soup, you get an experience:
The shredded chicken, tortilla strips, and toppings come out in the center of the bowl. Then the waiter pours in the soup itself. Why is this glorious???  Compare your cereal that's been sitting in milk for a bit vs cereal right when milk is poured on it. One is soggy and one is crunchy. 

Tortilla strips are meant to be crunchy. Ask for a few slices of avocado and a squeeze of lime. It's the Mexican way to eat it. It adds greatness. 

The guac isn't very good. It needs more salt, like, onion, jalape√±os, there are no tomatoes, and it's over blended. Leave some chunks in there for texture. I wouldn't recommend getting it if you have guac opinions. 

I've also ordered tacos from Yolos. They were surprisingly pretty good. I'd order them again if I wasn't so into the tortilla soup. 

The drinks are good. The staff is welcoming and attentive. I've only sat at the bar area, but there is a restaurant area a bit more concealed from being right smack in the casino.
