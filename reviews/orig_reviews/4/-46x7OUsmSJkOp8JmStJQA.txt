So excited that there is a Mexican restaurant in Summerlin that is not Macayo's! My friend and I ate there yesterday for the first time and both loved it! I got the chicken burrito combo plate and it was very yummy. She got the vegetarian taco and said the guac was sooo good. The service was excellent but the real draw for me is the bean dip! The old Guadalajara that used to be at Palace Station was my fave but this is even better! The only reason it does not get five stars is that the chips are just okay. But I can live with that!
