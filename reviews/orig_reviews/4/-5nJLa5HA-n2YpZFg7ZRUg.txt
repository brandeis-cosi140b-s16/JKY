I LOOOOOVE this place, always come here when I'm in Vegas, LOVE that its open 24 hours so we can come here after a night of partying, or just to have more drinks.... after a night of partying. They have good Margaritas (Small, Medium, and Large) good prices, and the dip trio and fresh chips are tasty. Service is always friendly, and that's a plus. I haven't tried the food yet, however my friend had their Huevos Rancheros and it looked amazing! The only reason I give them a 4 out of 5 instead of a 5 is because I had my mouth set on trying their Lobster Flautas and they ran out of lobster when I was there, and I live in California, so I'm not there often. I'm going back for my birthday next week, so hopefully they have an abundant and fresh supply of lobster... Salud!!!
