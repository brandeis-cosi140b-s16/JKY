Came here before a concert at the Mandalay Bay Beach one Saturday night. We had reservations for 8 at 6:30pm, so it was fairly early for dinner Vegas style. We had a vegetarian and vegan in the group and everyone loved their meals. It was great carb loading before a heavy night of dancing and drinking. 

Their vegan menu is done well, not just chips and dip and a veggie taco. Veggies have a full separate menu to choose from with a great variety of apps and entrees. We also had some food allergies in the group as well and our server, Ronnie (I think was his name?) was a star. He literally ran back and forth to the kitchen and back to our table to make sure he was giving us the right information on what was included in the meals ingredient-wise.

Drinks were delicious and ever flowing. The skinny pom margarita was fantastic although a bit too sweet for me, as was their OG margarita. I had the steak chile relleno which was flavorful and not too heavy. I saw someone at the far end of the table with a burrito the size of a nerf football though...noms for days. 

The live mariachi band serenaded us with Sweet Child o Mine and "going to the chapel" since it was my friend's bachelor party. What a fun group of guys. 

Decently priced for Vegas, generous portions, fun, casual atmosphere and nice staff. It was a great mid way meeting point for both budget and taste and I would definitely come here again. I'm addicted to their chips and salsa. Guac wasn't bad either!
