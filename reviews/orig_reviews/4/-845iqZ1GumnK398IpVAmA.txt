We were looking for a good place to eat lunch this past week in Scottsdale, and The Blind Pig kept popping up on our Yelp searches, so we decided to give it a try - and we are glad we did!  It was a slow time of the day (mid-afternoon), and the atmosphere was friendly with nice people and staff.  We ordered guacamole and salsa for an appetizer, and it was excellent.  We really enjoyed the flavor of the two salsas and the guacamole was a perfect blend of ingredients.  We ordered three fish tacos (mahi mahi) and three short rib tacos.  The fish tacos were average, but we all really loved the short rib tacos.  I wish we had ordered all short rib tacos.  The waiter recommended the short rib tacos, and we were a bit hesitant to order them.  They were excellent and I would highly recommend them.  We will be back the next time we are in town!
