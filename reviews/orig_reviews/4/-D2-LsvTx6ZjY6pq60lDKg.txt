I'll admit.... after reading so many "stellar" Yelp reviews, we were swayed to dine here.

We dined on a weekday evening  -- so we didn't get to experience the "best brunch in town" per Krashawnda N. Dang it! Now we're gonna have to go here again, after re-reading her review. :)

Hubby and I ordered: 
Mahi Mahi tacos  $14
Chicken tacos   $12
Mission fries  $6
Mission Margarita  $7


Food was good... I wouldn't say "AMAZING"... but maybe I had the wrong expectations. First of all the tacos were shockingly smaller than expected. Three tacos per plate, and per another reviewer they truly were about 2" across. However, they did taste divine.... (at least mine did, the chicken tacos). And honestly, now that I'm finished... any more and I would have been uncomfortably full. 

But the Mahi Mahi tacos were actually battered... we were not expecting that. And the batter was a medium coat - not thin or thick. Still edible. 

My margarita was definitely tasty!

I really enjoyed the ambiance.... it was definitely an upscale "Latin American" restaurant. Beautiful dark chandeliers, gorgeous illuminated salt block wall, dark hardwood floors... 

No complaints about the service. We were greeted right away and also immediately had water served to us, when we were sat. And likewise the server was appropriately attentive. 

All in all, we spent about $50 for some smaller-portioned plates -- which was more than we typically spend for dinner lately. But we had a good time.... I think it you're looking for more of a "value", this place might be better on the weekends for the brunch.
