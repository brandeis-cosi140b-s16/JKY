This is one of my favorite Mom and Pop hole in the wall places in Tempe. Some friends told me about this joint and so I decided to come by and see what was smoking. Nice!

Very simple inside with some booths to sit at and a counter to order your food. Their menu offers Mesquite Grilled Chicken and some delicious Carne Asada Beef. They also have several yummy sides that you can order as well.

There are no fancy this or that items here like some other restaurants. Just very tasty food that is cooked with tender love and care. You can see it in the customer's faces as they arrive for a repeat visit.

Usually order the Combo Plate with a side of Beans and several Jalapenos to get my juices flowing. They make the Salsa in house and it combines nicely with the warm tortillas and the beef and chicken. Saw several people buying whole and half chickens and getting them to go.

Place can get pretty busy during peak lunch time hours and it is very close to the ASU campus. You may even see some short shorts during your visit. Or what they called hot pants now? GO SUN DEVILS!
