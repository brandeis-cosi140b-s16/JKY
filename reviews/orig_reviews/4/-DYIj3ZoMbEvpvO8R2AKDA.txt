Had a departing dinner here with some friends, and we had a blast. The margaritas helped that happen as did the cool atmosphere. Even though it wasn't crowded at all (Sunday night) it was still great. The food was delicious and I highly recommend the black bean/plantain mash. I may want to learn how to make that one day. The guacamole was great as well. (and yes, some places do manage to screw this up!!) I'd go back.
