Our team from work came here for lunch.  It is my first time!  After all these years, I finally made it inside for some food.  I selected off the lunch menu (quite a selection for lunch).  I ordered the Poco Pollo Con Queso.  It is a golden brown chicken chimichanga topped with two kinds of cheese.  It comes with rice and I got black beans.  YUM!  It was really good.  The refills are drinks were fast and you did not have to ask.  The only weird thing was they took our bowl for the chips away.  I thought they were refilling it, it never made it back to our table.  

I agree with Jacob L. the deco was WAY over the top.  Almost touristy.
