Chips are tasty, salsa is just ok. I ordered the fajitas bomba & it was delicious! Also love their chicken platter. It's just enough food to take home some left overs. Honey orders fajitas or chimichangas almost every time we go. Their fried ice cream is good, but not great. I do love the atmosphere and our waiters have always been excellent. Definitely in our date night rotation.
