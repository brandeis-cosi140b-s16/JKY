El Dorado Cantina is a month shy of its grand opening, yet it's already a gem. I was eager to try it after such promising reviews. I had read it is next to Sapphire, but I didn't take it literally. I should have, because it is indeed in the same building but with its own entrance. The restaurant is upscale and our group of four were cozy in a booth. 

We started with house margaritas and cold cervezas. We were quickly brought chips and three types of salsa: mild, tomatillo and habanero. All were fresh and delicious. We couldn't resist the tableside guacamole ($12). It did not disappoint! 

Moving on to entrees, we tried the carne asada burrito ($12.50), carnitas tacos ($7.50, seafood enchilada ($13.50) and Milaneza ($17.50). Everything was fresh and tasty. We were all very pleased.

They are currently offering specials and happy hours; hopefully, they will continue. It's been a long time, since I've had an enjoyable sit down meal in a Mexican Restaurant. You wouldn't expect a restaurant of this caliber given the location, but it delivers. I'm already planning my next visit.
