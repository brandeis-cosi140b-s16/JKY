After going to Old Town Whiskey for my Birthday this year, my Husband and I set out to try Distrito, which is also at the Saguaro.  On a recent date night, we set out to Old Town to do just that.  With a localdines.com coupon in hand we arrived around 7pm and were sat outside.  There weren't very many people inside or outside, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was fun and inviting.  We were greeted promptly by our waitress who was very friendly and helpful.

We ended up ordering a variety of things so we could give the menu a good try.  We started with drinks... I had the red sangria, which was refreshing and very good.  The Hubs ordered some spicy beer thing, which he did not like (but I'm pretty sure it's just because he ordered something he shouldn't have).  Anyway, for food we started with the guacamole.  It was fabulous, as were the fresh made chips it was served with.  We also shared the QUESO FUNDIDO - it was phenomenal.  Very cheesy and an excellent duck flavor!  For our entree we had the CARNE EN ADOBO.  The meat was so tender and flavorful, we really enjoyed it.  For dessert (boy it sounds like we ate so much) we shared the sundae.  It really didn't do it for us... something about it just didn't click.

Overall, I'd say we had a fantastic meal.  With our coupon it was very affordable and definitely worth the month.  We're loving everything at the Saguaro and recommend locals hit up this place so it can stay in business!
