I've seen this place at the Santan mall a few times on my way out and noticed it had a happy hour so I took my bf for a whirl. The HH is actually really nice! The house margaritas are reasonably priced and very delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about it) They also have XX which pleased the bf. We had a chicken quesadillas appetizer and shared the tacos al carbon. Both were super delicious, the meat was juicy and the meal was huge! I was very happy with the service we received here which was our bartender. I will definetely be back!
