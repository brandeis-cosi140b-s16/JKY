Pretty decent happy hour with really good white sangria for $4 a glass and it's a pretty decent size. I would go here again just for that delicious little drink.

We also had the pizza-sized quesadilla for $5 and endless chips for $3!!! Good stuff. Chips were fresh and salsa had aghood kick. Guac was pretty good, I have definitely had better, and it lacked salt. 

Yummilicious Factor = A-
