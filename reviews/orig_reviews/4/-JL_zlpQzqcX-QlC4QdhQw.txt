I love this place. My wife and I frequent it weekly. Great service, ice cold beer, tasty food. My one complaint is the Salsa. Now its always good and free...who complains about free, right. Its never consistent. For a few weeks its perfect a little spice and salty. Then all of a sudden its deathly hot with no flavor, then no spice at all and bland. We will always come but please fix the salsa issue.
