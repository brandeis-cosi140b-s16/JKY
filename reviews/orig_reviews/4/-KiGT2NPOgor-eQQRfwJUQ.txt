Boy am I glad that I checked this out. First off , the restaurant is immaculate and very well organized. You can find everything from soups made fresh daily, Mexican sweet breads, paletas (Ice Cream ) , Aqua Frescas, elote, tacos, burritos, tortas. I ordered the  Asada tacos and my one year-old foodie in training ordered the kids bean and cheese burrito. The Asada tacos had some fat that i had to pick through , but the tacos (maybe because its rib eye) are made with fresh tortillas and are flavorful. The bean and cheese burrito was a little spicy for a baby, but it was good to me. The kids meal came with aqua fresca and I ordered the cucumber flavor which was refreshing and not overly sweet.  I will give it another go when in the area and try something new and hopefully better.
