I am not a local but I do know my way around a restaurant.  At first looks, Lindo Michoacan surpassed my expectations.  I read some of the reviews and was skeptical about my dinner experience here.  Needless to say I was taken aback by the view of the city, it was spectacular!  The view itself brings two stars to the table.  On to the food.  The portions were large and filled with flavor, unlike many Mexican food establishments that have very bland and flavorless offerings.  I had the Kikirriki (pronounced kee-keerree-kee), A grilled chicken breast with a semi spicy sauce, full of flavor.  My daughter had the fajitas and while there were no surprises here with the entree, the real surprise was with the tortillas, they did not have the texture and flavor of store bought, these actually had the texture and flavor of freshly made.  Taking a step backward, the servers brought out the obligatory chips and salsa, the salsa was flavorful and spicy, overall it was good.  The surprise here was a small bowl of refried beans came out as well to dip chips in, a nice touch.  The service was very prompt, courteous and we never waited or had to ask for anything.  Now, to be fair, the restaurant was semi busy for a Tuesday night but not overwhelming.  Overall, I am planning on going back on my next trip to the city in April.
