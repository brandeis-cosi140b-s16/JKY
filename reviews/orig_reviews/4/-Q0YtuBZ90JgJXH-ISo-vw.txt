We love Chevy's and eat it a lot back home in CA. Now we live in Las Vegas and the only Chevy's is ALLLL the way in Henderson, at the Galleria. A good 35 minutes from our neighborhood in Centennial Hills. Servers are always very nice, chips and salsa is always on point. Only reason to not give 5 stars: It's hit or miss if the kitchen gets modifications correct. We have had to send entrees back for quick fixes a few times, but the servers are always very quick to take care of it.
