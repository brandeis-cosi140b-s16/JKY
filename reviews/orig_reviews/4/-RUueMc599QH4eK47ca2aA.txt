I am always down to have a taco, burrito or anything Mexican like.  Our last night in Phoenix and we wanted Mexican food.  We stayed way too long at the bar in our hotel and it was getting pretty late since we had to wake up at 5 to board our plane back to Seattle.  
My husband found this restaurant on yelp and we made the 5 minute drive to a very sketchy and dark building.  One reviewer indicated that you would miss the building since it doesn't have an actual sign.  They didn't lie.  I had my gps so I was looking for it but you can easily pass this place up in the dark or light.  Let's be honest, this area is not the best but who cares as long as the food is good and your car isn't stolen when you leave out the restaurant.  There is not a waitress so you look at the board and present your order like Burger King.  Please note that board on the wall has different items than the paper on the counter.  I had my order all ready (lengua burrito and a cabeza taco) but when I got to the counter, the paper had some other items to choose from.  I ended up with the lengua burrito, cabeza taco and a chicharron taco.
My husband ordered chorizo taco and the carne asada burrito.  The food came out quick and looked good.  My burrito was pretty small but filling.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients wasn't bad.  I wish I had said no beans (which I usually do) but it was too late.  The beans overpower the delicate lengua.  The chicharron taco was ok.  Sometimes, chicharron gets cold pretty quick so that was the issue.  The cabeza was pretty good too.  Overall, a good taco shop.  It is the best, hecky no.  Is it better than anything in Seattle?  That would be a yes.  
The only downside would be the Sangria.  It came from a bottle and it was pretty horrible.  Why I did that to myself, I still don't know.
