Excellent food, the chips and salsa were delicious. I ordered a green chili chimichanga it contained large chunks of meat, they definately are not stingy on the portion size.  The restaurant was very clean and the decor was nicely done. I would definitely return and recommend this restaurant  the food was very authentic.
