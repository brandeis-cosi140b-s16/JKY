This was our first time to container park. Heard so much about this place so had to try it. We don't eat meat, but that wasn't a problem here. We got the fish burrito, which came with chips and salsa. The burrito was pretty good.  My favorite part was the corn!! It was soooo goood!!!! Best corn I've ever had! 

The only downside was the long line. My husband stood in line forever and the food took a while to get there. The menu was also a bit hard to read. Overall,  awesome place.
