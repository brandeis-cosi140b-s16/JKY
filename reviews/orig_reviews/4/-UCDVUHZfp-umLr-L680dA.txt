After reading about tacos al pastor, I have been on a quest to try them.  So saying that, I have no experience to base them on.  But I ordered them here to try it out - my bf and I split them (if you order a entree and split something else, they don't charge you the $2 splitting fee) and each got a entree.

The starting salsa and chips were ok, but I swear the salsa tasted like spicy marinara sauce. 

The tacos al pastor were delicious, but didn't have pineapple on top like I had hoped!  The plate comes with two, and they were huge.  I wish I had ordered the plate for myself and just eaten that. 
I ordered a carne asada burrito, because since discovering the best one ever in San Diego I have been on the quest for one in Vegas.  It was alright, but they charged .50 for cheese, Guacamole and Sour Cream....each.  They also put way too much sour cream in my burrito (and I love sour cream!) and I found the carne asada to be too salty.  
My boyfriend got  the beef fajitas and they were great, the marinade on the beef was just right.  We joked because he even ate the guacamole (which he hates), the tomatoes (also hates) and the refried beans (also not a fan of) - he cleaned his plate!

Their menu mentioned their homemade desserts, which is irresistible to me and I  didn't finish my burrito due to the sour cream overload - and when the waitress mentioned coconut flan I couldn't resist.  My bf and I split it, and it wasn't the normal creamy texture, the flan had almost separated and was kinda chunky - but with the toasted coconut it was very tasty.

I'd go back tomorrow for tacos al pastor  :D
