We love Lindo Michoacan! We, usually, go to the one right next to our house (on W. Flamingo), but we travel to this one whenever we have company in town because of the beautiful view of the strip. We've been lucky enough that each visit we've been seated next to the windows to enjoy the view.

The complimentary salsa, refried beans, and tortilla chips are quite filling... so, take it easy to ensure you have room for your actual meal. The beans are sometimes bland, but nothing a little salt can't fix. Besides, this isn't the main reason we come here.

With every meal, we've gotten a cup of their fideo soup (which kind of reminds us of those Lipton Cup a Soup packets). No matter, it's still yummy!

My go to dish is their Pollo con Rajas y Crema (pounded chicken breasts with onions and pasilla chilies in a cream sauce) served with rice and refried beans. So delicious! Every Lindo location I've visited, the dish has tasted the same... so, that makes me happy! My bf likes to have something different each time, so he's tasted everything from their Filet Relleno to the Chile Verde to their selection of Lengua.

We've not been disappointed by any of our selections and will continue to visit this and other Lindo Michoacan locations.
