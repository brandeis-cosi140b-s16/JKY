I really enjoy this hidden gem. I wish someone had told me about it sooner. Food has always been enjoyable regardless of what I have tried and service is quite decent. Definitely a fun, cozy little spot to visit. Dick's Hideaway is on the short list of spots I like to visit while in this area but note that due to the size I suggest planning your visit well as it can fill up quickly.
