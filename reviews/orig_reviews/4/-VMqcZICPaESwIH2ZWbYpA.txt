Chinese Mexican fusion.  Who ever heard of such a thing?  Two foods that most Americans love.  I'm not convinced that it works, but I really enjoyed trying it out.  I went there only once.  It was a food tasting, so I do not know the cost but I assume it is pricey.  It was really tasty and unique.  The atmosphere was typical of the Vegas strip, which is to say that it was super cool.  This place is definitely worth checking out, but I can't see it mass produced on a national scale.
