Went with the Groupon, but with low expectations. I've learned that most Mexican restaurants in Phoenix are underwhelming, and that if I want good Mexican, I must head further south.  

We arrived and got chips and salsa. It came with 3 homemade sauces, all better than the next one.  We couldn't pick our favorite. For dinner, I had the carne adobada. It's the pork, with rice and beans, and some lettuce and tomato, all served over a giant tortilla.  It was out of this world. Some of the best adobada I've ever had. The GF had duck tacos. They were really good as well. She loved them, as well as the rice and beans with them.  

Margaritas were also very good. Padres' made themselves 2 fans, and we'll be definitely going back.  Finally a great Mexican restaurant is found in Phoenix!

FYI: they have a much simpler happy hour and lunch menus.  Also, we went on Saturday, and they had a decent salsa band playing, so if you want some salsa music with your meal, go on Saturday night!
