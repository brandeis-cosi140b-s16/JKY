I am writing about the drinks because that's all we had. I have taken small groups of 5-7 here for drinks before going out. One reason... BACANORA. They are the only ones who have it. 
Margaritas are good and some are great. If you can get the Barrio punch if your not into standard Margaritas. Extensive list of tequilas. 

My two choices for tequila are Casa Noble a√±ejo and Revolucion 100 proof.
Bartender was cool both times.

Update after we finally eat there.

Once again, BACANORA!!!!
