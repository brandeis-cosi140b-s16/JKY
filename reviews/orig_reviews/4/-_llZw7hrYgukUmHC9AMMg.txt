I've eaten here quite a few times and have never had a bad meal. They always bring out fresh tortillas and 3 dipping sauces. Today I'm having their bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and bacon wrapped, jalape√±o stuffed shrimp. This shrimp is dynamite.

I do recommend getting a table instead of a booth. The booth tables are high and not much room.
