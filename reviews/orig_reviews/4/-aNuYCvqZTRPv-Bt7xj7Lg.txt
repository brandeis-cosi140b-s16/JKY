lately, the fundido here is my guilty pleasure. i can't get enough of it. i know it is just mexican junk food, but damn that fundido is good. get the steak one, not the chicken. the steak is better. i also think the rice is better than the beans. the busboy will give you as much free chips and salsa as you want. don't forget to ask for the hot sauce - it has good flavor and isn't too spicy.

the servers are really good at this location - attentive, quick and not at all annoyed by coupons. for some reason, there's a buy one get one free entree coupon in my valpak every single week - that makes my mexican junk food fix a pretty darn good value. that's awesome for me, because it means g and i go to valle luna a lot, and i get my fundido fix a lot.
