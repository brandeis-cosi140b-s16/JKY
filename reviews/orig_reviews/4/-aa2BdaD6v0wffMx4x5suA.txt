We stopped in on a whim and we were glad we did. This is no ordinary taco shop! We ordered two smashed jack potato/marinated spinach & mushroom enchiladas, covered in spicy green sauce with just a touch of homemade guacamole and two orders of tortilla soup. I went with the corn tortillas, which are thick and did not get soggy and disintegrate as soon as the sauce touched them. The flavor of everything was outstanding and the portions were just right. I have no need for a burrito that weighs as much as a bowling ball although I realize that for some people, more food = more value. I will take more flavor anytime. For the meat eaters, I noticed that they have short rib, bison, chicken, and I am sure some type of beef but I wasn't pay that close of attention to that. The menu is simple but there is a wide variety of toppings and fillings to customize your order. The prices are reasonable, too. The enchiladas, soups, and three drinks came to a grand total of $20.13 and we were more than satisfied. We will be back!
