I absolutely love the food at this restaurant and my husband and I make it a point to eat here whenever we are in town. Delicious Mexican food with an awesome view of the strip. Fantastic! 

My only complaint is that the portion sizes are really too large for one person. I don't like eating leftovers and so it just seems wasteful. They give you free chips served with bean dip and salsa as soon as you sit down and those are just to good to not eat. Plus, most meals come with a starter of fideo soup.  In addition, most of the entrees come with a heaping helping of rice and beans. The best remedy to the superfluous amount of food is to split an entree with someone or just order a la cart (though those items are limited).

My favorite meal here is the Shrimp Diablo. Tell them to make it extra spicy and you will be in for a real treat. I also love their Micheladas (that is my favorite drink to eat with Mexican food), though they call them something else here.  I love the upbeat atmosphere though sometimes when they have music it can get too loud.  We have always had excellent service from the waitstaff though I have noticed that the hostesses all seem to have some kind of chip on their shoulders.  As others have mentioned, try to avoid peak times or you will have trouble with parking and likely have to wait for a table.
