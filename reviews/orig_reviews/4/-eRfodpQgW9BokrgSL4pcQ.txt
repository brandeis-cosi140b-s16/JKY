Great Food, Great Drinks, Vegas, What else can you ask for!
I can't believe this place has bad review.
Come on ppl, you're on the strip, drinks will be expensive and if you bought bad groupons, it's your fault for not reading the find print lol
Anyways...this was our last stop before heading home.
Had a drink to sober up ;) Cadillac margarita, strong enough to even us out!
We got sat right away, party of 8.
Our server was super cool and friendly. Even after a table walked out in her and left her with a $90 check. SO messed up. But who wouldn't be bummed after that? So it didn't matter to us. She knew everything about the menu and sold me the house special like it was gold on a plate haha did I regret it? NO. It was fish on top of dirty rice and this green sauce, which I call chimichurri back home. AMAZING combination of flavors.
Everyone was super satisfied with their food.
I'm not gonna lie, the kitchen did mess up on 2 orders but they also fixed a special plate for one of us.
Everyone mentioned the chips and salsa on their reviews and they are right! the salsa is just perfect and super addicting...
We got a super cute group pic taken by the photographer that works there, perfect to end our trip.
I had a great experience here and I will come back next time I'm in town!
