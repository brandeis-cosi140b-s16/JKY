The Mexican Beers are $3 during happy Hour and I had a Dos Equis Amber bottle. They do offer free chips and salsa, but the chips are not very good at this chain. Not much else to say except the outdoor patio is nice, but the outdoor giant Jenga can be annoying if the people playing are smashed and yelling. The TV situation is excellent, except at the bar. Disturbing scene was a bartender sharing an ice cream cookie at the bar with some other guy who worked there....awwwww.
