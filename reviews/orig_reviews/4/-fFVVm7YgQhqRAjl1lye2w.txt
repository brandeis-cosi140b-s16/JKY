I would have given this place a three but they redeemed themselves in their ability to correct a problem with their food.  A friend mine ordered the menudo and it was very salty. The waiter quickly corrected the problem to my friend's satisfaction. In the past the menudo here has been great. I think this was just a bad day for the menudo.  Every other dish ordered that day was good.  Be warned this place is not in the best area of Las Vegas so if you go late at night just be aware of your surroundings. I will definitely keep Dona Maria Tamales on my list of places to eat when I go to Vegas. Its not gourmet but it definitely satisfies my taste for good mexican food.
