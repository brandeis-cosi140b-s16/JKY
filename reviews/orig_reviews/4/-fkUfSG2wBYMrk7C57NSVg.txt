We go here about 1X/mo.  Their salsa bar is extreme; get ready to try all of the 13 amazing freshly made salsas.  Watermelon and radish are my faves.  I usually get the fish taco or chicken tinga.  The staff is nice and service is quick.  Last time they got my order wrong.  It was still good but I had my mouth ready for something else.  When I mentioned it to the staff.  Without a blink of an eye, she was back in the kitchen getting me a replacement taco to take home.  The place is small and usually packed so arrive a little earlier than the usual dining time.
