I grew up in AZ on Sonoran style mexican food.  Much as I enjoy it, it just ain't health food.  The Barrio has improved on the old standbys. No longer does your food swim in melted cheese.  We had the guacamole made tableside - a little cilantro and dried cranberries make it really special.  They make their own corn tortillas which make great chips.  We shared a plate of cheese enchiladas.  The side veggies were done perfectly - cooked but crisp.  the black beans had just enough sauce.  But the best was that enchilada sauce, which they also make themselves.  A smoky flavor - probably chipotle chilis? At any rate, loved the food.  Service was not fussy (Sunday noon in the summer) but good.  had  a nice glass of chilled white to go with our food.  We will definitely be back.
