I love going to El Encanto - probably far more because of the ambiance and the fact that it is a sort of landmark in my hometown of Cave Creek. The food is solid, but not fantastic. I love the avocado salsa they bring out with chips. The pollo fundido is always good, if not a little dry at times. My kids love feeding the ducks, though, and are happy to go to El Encanto. The service is usually good. I would be sad if there was ever no more El Encanto.
