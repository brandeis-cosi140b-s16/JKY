Went back to the scene of the crime with a better date to try the food tonight after my ill fated attempt last visit. The Happy hour tacos are two for $3.50 and we tried all versions. I liked the shredded chicken version best and she was a fan of the steak ones. They all were very filling for the price. The chips were fresher this visit and the red salsa came out steaming hot and had a nice charred kick. I still like the green, but the gap is closing. Also, grab a $4 frozen margarita because it's very hot out and the booze in this version will sneak up and hit you on the way out. We had a very nice server too who was quite attentive.
