They have multiple locations across the state of Pennsylvania and one in Columbus, OH.  I have only been in the original location, which is in the Oakland neighborhood in Pittsburgh.  It is a tiny building, and it is often *loud*.  The later you go, the louder it gets.

Personally, I think a lot of their burritos taste the same, though it is a very good taste.  I like their pickadippa and potato taquitos.  They also offer lots of options, like meatless or vegan versions, or the choice to turn a burrito into an enchilada, and vice versa.  Everything is priced decently, with half-price food at a variety of times (depending on the location) and lots of great specials for holidays and such.

The Big Azz margaritas are enormous.  I enjoy the frozen strawberry.  I often get the small, and I usually can't finish it.
