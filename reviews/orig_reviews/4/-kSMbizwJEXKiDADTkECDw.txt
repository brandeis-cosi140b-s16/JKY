we've been here one other time about 3 plus years ago and decided to come again for lunch.  we were the first and only ones in at 11 am.  i really wish more restaurants would open earlier than 11 am because i like to eat early lunches.  chips and salsa were good.  its a roasted darker salsa which i enjoy.  i like this place because i like americanized mexican food in big portions and not pretentious or fancy and ridiculously expensive.  my enchiladas were filling and tasty, and my wifes tacos were good.  so to me it really hits the spot.  its reasonably priced, good service, and its in new york which is always enjoyable to go visit.
