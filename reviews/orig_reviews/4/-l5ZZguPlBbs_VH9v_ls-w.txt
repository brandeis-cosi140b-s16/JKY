You don't really go to Macayos for great Mexican food; there are far too many superior hole-in-the-wall places for that in Phoenix/Tempe. But this place has a great happy hour on Fridays. I spent many a Friday afternoon getting here early and drinking late. They put on a decent spread as far as the grub goes, but let's face it: this place is about drinking. And the atmosphere lends itself to that, so drink up and enjoy!
