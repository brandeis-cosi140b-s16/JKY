Went there the other night and it was very good.  I had the burro with green sauce and it was great. The others had enchladas and said they were also very good.  The resturant is very clean.  It is tucked into the corner of the Fry's plaza so you have to look for it.  When you find it you will be back.  It is not one of the trendy places just good food at reasonable prices.The drinks were good size and tasty.   Service was excellent. The locals know about this place and recomend it.  I will be back.
