Probably one of the most authentic economic Mexican restaurants in Phoenix for red and green chile.  The neighborhood will scare you if you are not comfortable eating amongst the Hispanic community in their own backyard but if you can get past that you will not be sorry. Building is dilapidated practically and the flooring just old concrete. But dont be scared....

Dont make the same mistake some other reviewers made and order stuff thats not on the menu.  And please people dont take your kids there and order chicken nuggets for little Timmy because he doesnt like spicy food.  If its not on the menu its not their specialty.  Order the red or green chile "anything" and chips and salsa and it will be fine. 

Homemade tortillas the size of a flying saucer and hoemade chorizo too. Did i mention this place is super inexpensive??

It can get super busy at lunch time so get there early.  You can find Phoenix's finest here for lunch (from law enforcement to other government/city employees).  

If you are Hispanic and venture out to eat the kind of food your mom makes you....this is the spot you go too.
