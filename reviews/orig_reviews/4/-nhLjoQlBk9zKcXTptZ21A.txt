Very good food. Not your typical Mexican joint, chips and salsa aren't included but are delicious and both appear to be made fresh. Service was pleasant, but slow both times I've been there. Had Carne Asada Tacos for the first visit -  really yummy. My Mom had fish tacos and loved them. Second visit today I tried the Ceviche and it was a bit of a disappointment, For $10.95 - there was probably only about 3-4 shrimp chopped in the roughly 1-1.5 cup portion, and the the jalapenos were chopped way to large so it was too hot. Comes with a huge order of chips, but Salsa was an up charge. Feels a little nickle & dimey. 
Regardless, it's still one of the better "Mexican" places I've tried and will definitely come back again.
