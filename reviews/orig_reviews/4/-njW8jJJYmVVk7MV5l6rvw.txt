Viva Mercardos indeed! 

I love this joint. My family and I have been coming here for years (back when they were tucked away in a strip mall in Spring Valley). 

The location is large and I have never experiened a wait. As soon as you are sat, a man rushes over with fresh salsa, hot bean dip, and warm tortilla chips. (Heaven!) Luckily, their menus are coated in plastic, otherwise I would have killed 236 menus in my life time.

The prices have gone up over the years, but your chips and dips are unlimited and you get free soupa de fideo when you order an entre (dinner only). I like to add a spoonful of salsa to mine for a little kick. 

Where to begin on their vast options. Their ceviche is delcious and comes with fresh avacdo. They blend together to create a magical flavor. To die for. Their enchiladas are superb. Yum to the yum, yum, yum. The fajitas sizzle and smell and taste delightful. My sister is a fan of their queosdillas, she would recommend the chicken; it's her "usual." (Two reviewers under one review!) My Mom really loves their carne anything. And she will tell you, anything. (It just became a three way).

There are several different dessert options; the usual suspects: flan, fried ice cream, sopapias. The fried ice cream is delish.

Viva Mercados hits the spot. Decent prices. Friendly and efficient staff. No long waits. Clean place. Good, consist food. They had me at Bean Dip!
