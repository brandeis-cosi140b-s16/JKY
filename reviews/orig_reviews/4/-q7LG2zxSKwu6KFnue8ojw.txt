Celebrated my friend's birthday with a fancy dinner in Vegas. We made reservations for 8pm and were seated within a minute. Friendly staff upon arrival. Our waiter Javier was very nice and hot! 

We started with guacamole and i would rate it an 8/10. I usually like my guacamole with more like and some spice. The portion was small for the $12 price. Chips and yummy salsa made up for it though. 

Our food took a little longer than expected and we didn't order anything complicated. But the food was worth the wait! I ordered the Chile Verde (tender pork in green tomatillo sauce) and it was delicious. A little salty but the rice and beans balanced it out. A few things were wrong with our order but we didn't mention it. My friends ordered the carne tampique√±a, soft tacos and shrimp enchiladas. We were so full and pleased with our choices. 

They served premium tequila and the margaritas were on point! We ordered a mango, pineapple and rosa margarita. Martinis were good too. Drinks start at $15, which is about average for nice restaurants in Vegas. 

The restaurant decor is rich in dark wood, dim lighting, and huge floral arrangements. Everything flows well together. They have this cool tequila tree displaying their selection. Beautiful! Would definitely come back for another special occasion. Thank you, Javier's!
