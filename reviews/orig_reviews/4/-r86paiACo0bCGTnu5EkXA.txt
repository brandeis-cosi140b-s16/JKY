Just had to try this place when I heard it was Asian-Mexican fusion and was featured on Triple-D with Guy Fieri. I will admit that I studied up beforehand, since some very resourceful Yelpers mentioned the complexity of the ordering system. It was worth walking through their "How to Order" demo on their website to know what to do.

The staff was extremely helpful when I approached the counter and volunteered that I was a Chino-Bandido virgin. They even provided tasting samples and suggestions that helped me understand what the different flavor profiles were. I settled on the combo (2 meat entrees, choice of beans, choice of rice) and chose Pollo Diablo (meat alone), Jen Red Pork (in a quesadilla), jerk fried rice and black beans. All were delicious and the servings generous. I dared not finish my quesadilla for fear the Oompah Loompahs would have to roll my fat ass out the door afterward.

I think there's a bit of a learning curve to eating here, but I enjoyed the unique dining experience. One of the staff even spotted my Chico State shirt and we instantly started chatting, since he was also from my neck of the woods (northern northern California, I like to call it). I learned that next time I'm going with the meat entrees as meat alone (as opposed to in a burrito or quesadilla), since there is more than enough of the sides to fill you up and the extra packaging only serves to mask the unique flavors of their savory meat choices.

I'll make a trip back, but I'm gonna save up some room first. The last meal resulted in a serious mid-afternoon lunch coma nap.
