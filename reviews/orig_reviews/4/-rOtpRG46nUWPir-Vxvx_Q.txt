When I came here I was told this was like a version of Chipotle but Hawaiian style type of food. Now I got bowl and if you don't know what to get they will walk you through it and sample the food before you decide what you get and mostly under $10. The service is great and it friendly all around. Employees greet us with "Aloha!" which makes me feel like i'm not in a normal food restaurant. 

Now with the variety they have I could say this would get repetitive if you ate here a lot but that all depends on everyone.

Would I recommend this to anyone who's craving Hawaiian style food and want to get full for under $10-$12 this is a place to check out. I'll be coming here once in awhile when I get the cravings for it!
