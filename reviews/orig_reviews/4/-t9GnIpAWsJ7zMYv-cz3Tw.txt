The best authentic Mexican/ Carribean food in Pottsburgh! We had the avocado fries, the salsa that came along was the bomb! My husband ordered the goat curry which came along with rice and beans and fried plantains- Absolutely Delicious. There truffle was the most amazing shit I have eaten in a long long time. It's kinda out of the city but very well worth the drive if you like Authentic food.
