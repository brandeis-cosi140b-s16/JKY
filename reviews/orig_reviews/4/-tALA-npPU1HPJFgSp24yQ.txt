After lots of hype, i've finally made the journey here since i was in Phx for work. 
The employees are genuinely helpful- many samples. I apologized for taking steve nash from them. 
The food- i had jade red chicken, chile relleno & jerk fried rice. Super great. The highlight was the flavor explosions, cheese & happiness in my mouth. 
The venue could be improved and would definitely raise the experience to a 5-star. Maybe i brought my high LA hole-in-the-wall standards but, i was disappointed in the lack of ambiance. 
Imagine a hole-in-the-wall cafe w 4-star food for cheap.
