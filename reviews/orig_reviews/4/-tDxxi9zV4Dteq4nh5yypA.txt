This place is a little tucked away hidden treasure! The venue is awesome with so many areas to sit and enjoy. The Yelp event I went to had the exclusive use of the large outdoor patio - totally cool, right? It is so open and had great space for the stage, the buffet set up and other little fun attractions set up around the place....hello beer burro! It immediately had me thinking about what kind of party or celebration I could have on this patio...guess that means I'm sold on the venue, huh?
The food was great and offered a lot of variety. My favorites were the tamale and the desserts. The service was excellent and the staff was super friendly. Definitely a fun place to stop by for a good meal, a good drink or if you want to have a full on fiesta with you and 50 of your closest friends! Ole!
