We arrived a bit late for our 9pm reservation because the Mentalist show ran over. We decided to sit outside, which I regretted initially since it was so loud out there, but a big party left after too long and it quieted down.

I ordered a pomegranate margarita and my bitch sister-in-law ordered the sangria and we both really liked them. Chips came with three kinds of sauces and I thought the green tomatillo was really good.

I'd studied the online menu and knew I was going to order the chicken poblano enchiladas, which I were able to get without the mushrooms - yay! They were SUPER delicious.  They came with a corn and poblano relish on top, which added a bit of crunch. Wow, they totally lived up to the food I'd seen Mary Sue and Susan cook on TCM.  My husband got the Kobe tacos and didn't particularly care for them. He said they were bland and they also caused him some stomach problems later in the night. Fortunately, he ate the rest of my enchiladas and was really happy with them.  My sister-in-law got some taquito dish that she really enjoyed. My bro-in-law got the chicken enchiladas and loved them too. 

Since both couples had just gotten married and it was my husband's birthday, they brought us over 2 free desserts. One was flan and the other was a rich chocolate mousse cake. Both were yummy.
