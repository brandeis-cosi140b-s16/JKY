*A great place to hang w/ friends for late night delicious food and drinks ($7 margaritas) for low prices, good servings. Food is 1/2 off from 11:00PM-1:00AM. 

I recommend the Hand Mex Tofu Wrapture ($5) and Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu appetizer ($4) for vegetarians. The Fried Tofu appetizer comes in decent servings and the tofu wrapture..I've never had anything like this before. The wrap tastes great - a really creative spin of a vegetarian Chipotle-burrito. It's completely filling, with mexican rice and tofu with pico de gallo. But what really ties the whole thing together is their wing sauce. I chose Honey Chipotle BBQ and the wrap went from crisp to complex - a mix of fresh ingredients with that subdued but detectable taste of sweet and spicy.

(Street parking, may be a bit annoying to find a space nearby. Luckily we found a spot two blocks away.)
