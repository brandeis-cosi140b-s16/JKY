Speaking "frankly" (I seriously couldn't resist,) this place is good but not great. Pros: Owner is cool, totally locally/family owned, food is fresh and tasty and prepared to order. I didn't love the portions for the price (I'm fine to pay more for good food, but usually expect to get filled up at a Mexican place for $6-7 (Cafe Rio, Qdoba, Chipotle...) and this place didn't quite deliver. Food is tasty and healthy, though, so in a pinch I might be back (they're just down the street from my office.)
