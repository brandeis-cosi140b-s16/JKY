The flavors are rich and robust. The ingredients taste fresh. The ambiance is open and modern.  A great take on Mexican cuisine and a reasonable price. 

I've had the Lomo (beef) and Al Pastor (pork) taco preparations as well as the chorizo enchilada. All were flavorful and just the right amount of spice, though a little hot sauce never hurts.

The service is prompt, casual and friendly. Verde is definitely one of my go to spots for Mexican in the city.
