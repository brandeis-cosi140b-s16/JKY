Wow, I disagree with a lot of what has been said about Cantina, I had a fabulous experience! I will admit, the great experience may have been due to the company that I was in, but I think the food and ambiance had something to do with it too :) First of all, the server let us know that their guacamole is a "community favorite," and I am sort of obsessed with this comment. I can contest that it was some damn good guac. I know that this isn't helpful at all, but past that, I really don't remember what I ate....but I do remember that it was really good....sorry! Anyhow, the server was incredibly attentive and he let us sit outside even though no one else was. Food was good, atmosphere was nice and I'd say Cantina deserves a solid four stars. I will definitely be going back the next time I'm in CLT.
