We decided to go here for a girls night since I had never been before.  I was a little hesitant since I like more traditional Mexican food but was excited to try.  They do have traditional type Mexican food with a spin on the ingredients.  Cute concept and décor.  The outside was very neat and would be a great place to enjoy Happy Hour when temperatures are a little warmer. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was extremely busy but we were seated promptly and greeted by our server immediately which I thought was great! We ordered chips, salsa, guacamole and drinks.  The salsa's were decent and the guacamole was very good.  I was a little surprised that they charge for the chips and salsa since most Mexican food restaurants do not.  We both ordered off the Green Chile Trail section of the menu.  I had the Green Chile Burrito and my friend had the Blue Corn Enchiladas.  Both were outstanding and portions were large!! We couldn't finish the rice and beans which were good but not the highlight of the entrée.  The flavors were incredible and had just the right amount of heat.  Service continued to be consistent and friendly.  We really did enjoy our experience and look forward to returning soon.  I would defiantly recommend this restaurant for a different experience with Mexican food.
