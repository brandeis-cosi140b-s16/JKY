I love Tivoli Village and was looking forward to trying a new happy hour spot.  This restaurant is very attractive and has a nice layout.  My girlfriend and I sat in the bar and started with chips, salsa and what we thought was a complimentary guacamole prepared table side to your liking.  What made us think it was complementary and a feature of the restaurant was that there was a tip jar on the cart and no mention of the $9.95 charge.  We also ordered the $3 ritas, crab cakes, nachos al carbon (beef), and the flautas de pollo.  Nothing extremely amazing about the food but it was good.  We had no problems with service and I think this would be a great spot to catch the game as a they have a couple large screen TVs.  They also took the guac charge off the bill.  I honestly have no problem with charging for it, my problem is not letting us know beforehand.  I mean we go to happy hours for a deal and that $9.95 gauc charge equals three more house ritas!   I'm pretty sure I will be back and look forward to when the weather is nice enough to sit outside.
