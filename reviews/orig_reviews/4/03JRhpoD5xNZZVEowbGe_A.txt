We had some family in town and we decided to bring everyone here. We had to wait a little while but it was a weekend night so it was expected. We grabbed some drinks in the bar and chips and salsa, we were happy campers.

Chips and salsa were both good. Nothing EXTRAORDINARY but the salsa was very good.

We sat outside by the big pond and it was nice out, even in the summer. I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was very good as well. I'm not going to say if it was the best or not since everyone has different preferences, but it was very very good and worth ordering. I would say it is more on the sweeter side (must've been the cream cheese) than most fundidos.

Service was very good and attentive, kitchen speed was fine. Great food at a great place. We will be back!
