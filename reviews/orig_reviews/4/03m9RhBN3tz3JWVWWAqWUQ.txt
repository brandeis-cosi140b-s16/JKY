yes another review of awesome accolades to a great taco shop. With all my repeat visits I thought I had written a review on this awesome taco shop. Apparently not. So, this is why I'm a fan of La Condesa... it's simply their beer battered dogfish shark tacos!!! they are soooooooooooooo good, it's like beachside fish tacos without the freaking beach, the taste, smells, and overall experience eating these totally delicious fish tacos can give you a mindf*** yes it's that good! and dipping them these beauties into my favorite salsa of all time.... confetti machine razzle dazzle... the salsa cilantro! it's soooooooo good so creamy, so perfect with their fish taco, and afterwards enjoying their horchata with fruit and cinnamon on top.... HEAVEN! love their quesas, the fish taco, La Condesa you have a fan!
