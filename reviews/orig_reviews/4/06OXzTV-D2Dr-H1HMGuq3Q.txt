We came here to Senior Frogs on a Sunday night after spotting a roaring crowd and music blazing throughout the place the previous night.  

My review is based on atmosphere and music, I cannot speak for the food which I see a lot of poor reviews on.  For a Sunday Night, the DJ kept an upbeat crowd, despite the fact that it was a tad bit dead at first.  Within a few minutes, people were up and dancing around.  When he made us do the Wobble dance, it was almost shoulder to shoulder, but everyone was having a blast. 

The drinks were strong, and the 2 for 1 margarita call topped it off.  We wish we came here instead of Pure of Friday.

Cheers
