Considering this would have to be one of if not the busiest nights of the year with the street festival happening literally right in front of the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to get a table right away this Saturday night. 

Surprise #2! After several attempts at checking in on the Yelp app, I made it in! Not sure if this joint has wifi but honestly, it's not that kind of joint. So stay off your phone after redeeming the Yelp free food offer! (And thanks Tex Tubbs for the grub!)

Our server took the chips and drink order about 5 minutes after we sat. And the taco platters (with tasty black beans and rice sides) arrived 5 minutes later! I appreciate the kitchen was working fast because I can only imagine they were slammed all weekend.

While the basic chicken taco could have used more flavor, and the pineapple and chicken with coconut was seriously devoid of pineapple, these are correctable issues by diner or kitchen. One comes to Tex Tubbs to make choices from an entire page of meat, seafood, and vegetarian tacos, fully customizable platters. Add plenty of gluten sensitive options, salads, and other entr√©es and it's just a place you need to try!

We were thanked for our business by our server and the hostess so keep that up TT!

-Shouting to be heard by my table mate. 
Weird restroom placement. 
Not really any privacy.
Tables right on top of each other.
If those don't bug you then this might be your 5 star next stop!

P.S. Tex Tubbs, please bring back a west side location! Including breakfast!
