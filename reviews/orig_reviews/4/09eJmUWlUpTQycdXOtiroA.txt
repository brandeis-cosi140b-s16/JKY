My review will only be based on the bar with drinks and apps. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough days or stomachs to fit a dinner in at this place. I wish I had...the service and the drinks and apps I had in the bar were top notch. I perused the menu and decided that it was definitely worth a trip back to sample all the goods. The margaritas are excellent. I had the regular one - always good, and I had a jalapeno one, also super tasty. Don't hesitate - go!
