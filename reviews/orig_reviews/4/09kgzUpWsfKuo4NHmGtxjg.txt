Half-price tapas can always make a manic Monday better!  Monday eves, my BFF and I try to drop by and sit at the bar to catch whatever game is on, maybe play a game or two, and savor comp drinks and half-priced tapas.  Our favs include the seared salmon, served atop a bed of spinach and drizzled with a b√©chamel sauce (omg, I refuse to share this plate with anyone); the arroz con pollo savory rice with tender chicken; and whatever else calls to me.  BFF smacks her lips at the sight of this ahi dish she requests and licks her fingers and plate after devouring her salty-peppery garlicky seared shrimp.  It's been fairly busy the Mondays we've been there, and a bonus is that either she or I is usually lucky at the video games, so it's an inexpensive fun dinner.  Background music is great, the staff is always friendly and welcoming, plus service is prompt.  What I really LOVE and appreciate is that it's a non-smoking environment and I don't leave there smelling like an ashtray.  Maybe to attract a clientele all nights and to keep things rolling through the week, the owners should promote a Happy Hour every week day ... not just Mondays!
