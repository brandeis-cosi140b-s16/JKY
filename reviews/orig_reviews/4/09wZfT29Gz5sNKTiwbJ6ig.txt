I have visited a couple of times now, with various friends and everyone loves the place and the food.

Let's start with the place.... As my wife put it: "It feels like we are in San Diego" (somewhere she loves); the combination of the pond, turtles, ducks, geese, trees and birds convinces one that you are no longer in the middle of the desert, but have been transported to some oasis of green, water and cool..... A wonderful setting for a meal.

You can either sit outside around the pond and enjoy being surrounded by the trees and wildlife, or if you are a little less adventuresome, there are plenty of tables inside, some up against floor length glass at the edge of the pond, so it seems as though you are outside.

The food itself is fresh (the salad is always crisp & tasty), VERY well cooked and the service excellent. We have tried a wide selection of dishes between us and everyone has been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes presented.

If you are unsure what to choose, I recommend going with the 'Daily Special', I have opted for this a couple of times and on both occasions it has been excellent.

It is also very reasonably priced - I thoroughly recommend El Encanto!
