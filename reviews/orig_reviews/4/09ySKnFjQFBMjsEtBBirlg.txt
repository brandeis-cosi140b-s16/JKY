Pork chile stew. I'll start here.  

I was nervous at reading the description. I lived in hatch chile country once and I have never heard of potatoes, carrots or corn in my stew.  I understand the potatoes.  But it already had a roux as well. Thicken the stew.  
They dolled it up for presentation.  It still made my ears itch.  Spicy the way it should be.

Osso bucco.  

Thank you.  Lightly sprinkled with cojita cheese.  Cooked down in red chile sauce, it was absolutely delightful.  I still asked for a side of green chile.  Not because the flavor was absolutely perfect, but because I wanted to pour it over the accompanying.  Carrots.  Corn. Zucchini.  And you guessed it, mashed pots.  

I'll be back for the osso bucco.  You should go to the tavern for bucco.  But don't tell me how to eat my pork chile stew!  ;)
