Even if you're not in the area but want some really good Mexican, you gotta come here. The staff (everyone) was very nice. Very clean inside and outside. Plenty of options for seating, even outside. I had the shrimp tacos and side of sweet plantains. Awesome. I also had the ultimate margarita. Supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila, but I didn't even catch a buzz. I complain only because of the price! I mean the drink was really good, especially since I'm not a fan of margarita pre-mix (this was homemade). All in all, this has been the better Mexican I've had so far.
