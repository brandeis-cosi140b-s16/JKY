Good food. Friendly service.
Cant wait to go back! There is a place in PHX that has spicy Mexican food!! WOOHOO!!! 

The waiter was new and you could tell...actually, there was a few new waiters. I read that they do have a revolving door here. Honestly, who cares as long as I get good service and good food at a great price! 

Chips and 2 types of salsa when I sat down. The bean and cheese dip is YUMMY! my chimicanga was YUMMY! My drinks were always filled and the waiter didnt overly bug us!

This may just be my favorite Mexican food!!!
