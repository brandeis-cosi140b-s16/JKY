We love taking out-of-town guests to El Encanto for the "experience".  Charming, funky Mexican patio feel (complete with a pond filled with duck, geese and turtles), in general the staff is great (we have had one or two surly servers in the past, but we never see them again, so evidently management takes care of this) a mariachi band or guitarist strolling amongst the tables (my only issue with that is what's the etiquette?  Should we stop eating and look attentive when they stand at our tableside and play?  Do we tip?)  And the food is GOOD!  I love the three sauces that they bring to the table with chips---just pour those into a soup bowl and give me a spoon.  Chips are typical Mex restaurant fare---a little greasy and tasteless---probably out of a box from Chicago.  We haven't had a unenjoyable meal there yet, although I wish they served a vegetarian version of a chile relleno---why do people insist on ruining cheesy goodness with meat?  But maybe I just need to ask.  DH loves the Pollo Fundido and the Carne Asada.  I am also a fan of the Enchilada de Pollo con Mole.  It's fun casual, and come hungry!
