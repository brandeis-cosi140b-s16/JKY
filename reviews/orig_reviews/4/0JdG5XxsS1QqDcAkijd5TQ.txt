This is a really nice concept restaurant by ZTejas. The taco selection includes old world tacos (i.e., traditional chicken, beef and pork) as well as 'new world' tacos (i.e., duck, snapper, shrimp and lamb). Also, I like the fact that the partner with local growers and use quality organic ingredients in their food. On top of all that, the restaurant is in what was once a church and they utilize a lot of the original decor and pews. How cool is that?
