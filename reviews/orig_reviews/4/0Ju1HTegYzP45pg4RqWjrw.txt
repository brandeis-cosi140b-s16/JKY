I can only write about the cocktails since we never actually ate at Isla.  Instead we enjoyed fresh muddled margaritas.  I tried one with raspberries and my friend tried one with strawberries.  Wait...was it one or two or three.  They were just so good we couldn't stop drinking.  I didn't see the tequilla goddess as previously mentioned, but that didn't matter to me.  My drinks were good sans tequilla goddess.
