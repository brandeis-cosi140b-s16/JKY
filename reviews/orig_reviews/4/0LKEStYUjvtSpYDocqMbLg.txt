One of my "go to" Mexican places. It is very convenient in Park Road Shopping Center. Easy, free parking. Open floor plan. Good energy. 

I like the 1511 margarita and the queso. 

Check out their brunch. Some Mexican included choices and traditional ones. 

Great outside seating. They use Open Table if you want to get a reservation.
