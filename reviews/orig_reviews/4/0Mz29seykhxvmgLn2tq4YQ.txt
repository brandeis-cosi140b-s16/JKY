My friend and I went to lindo michoacan to grab dinner and get tattoos... :)
I have to say I had a really good experience. The service was very fast, as soon as we walked in we were seated, then the chips came like 10s after, every thing rolled smoothly. Everyone seemed very pleasant, one of the managers I think his name was Oscar, checked on us...a lot lol but he was very nice. Our waiter was very honest lol, but everything was cool i was really full; the quesidilla were heaven! and pretty big in portion for an appetizer, i was full before my food came which the waiter kind of hinted at when i was ordering lol
but overall I would go there again....i just hope they stay concistant  with the great service
