Great outdoor patio with attentive staff. We had a few drinks and then tried the seafood enchiladas and grilled salmon. I know what you are thinking: seafood in Arizona? Still the enchiladas, though covered in a few too many layers and sauces, were tasty and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  Without knowing much about the restaurant scene here, i lucked out and would definitely go back. And when you are done just go across the street and have a cigar!!!
