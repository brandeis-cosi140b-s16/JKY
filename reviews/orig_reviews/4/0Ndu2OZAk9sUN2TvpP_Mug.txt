Have been coming here since I moved here 10 years ago! Jalapenos is a good go-to Mexican restaurant for me. Probably mostly because I live so close to it, but also because the food is pretty dang good as well.

In my years coming here I have never had any bad service experiences, it has always been good. The chips and salsa are the best thing Jalapenos has to offer, for sure. Those flour chips?! Incredible. The corn ones are good too. The flour ones win by far though, the texture of them is great.

I typically order either the Sonoran Grilled Quesadilla or the Vegetable Fajitas. They are both pretty good. This place has a big menu too, lots of options. Also I have been of legal drinking age for over two years now, and I have yet to go to a happy hour here? that has got to change!

The whole ambiance of the place is nice. I will keep on coming back!
