This place is is a long standing staple for Hendo folk.  I think a lot of the key here is knowing what is great on the menu to order.  Other reviews mention the Aboldegas soup - it is amazing.  But the rare treat at this place is the shredded beef burrito enchilada style with "hot" enchilada sauce on top.  To me that is the specialty and I have never had anything like it - I order it every time.  Service has always been good.
