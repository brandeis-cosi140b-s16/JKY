Good consistent food & they keep service running pretty smoothly even when it gets busy. 

Because it is frequently busy I usually put my order in for pick up. The other day, they mixed up my order with someone else's & that person left with my food. Accidents happen but I was annoyed to be waiting for all my food to be remade & I wasn't told outright about what was going on- I had to hear the other person calling back saying they had the wrong order. Ultimately when I brought up my annoyance I was met with apologies, prompt service & a refund. I'm so used to apathy at a food counter & I was pleasantly surprised with their willingness to rectify the situation as best they could in a timely manner & I really appreciate that kind of service.
