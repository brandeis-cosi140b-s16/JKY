Absolutely delicious!  Had dinner meeting here and had table of 20. Specific menu with  appetizers, salad and 4 entrees. The queso fundido and empanada appetizers were so good!  Loved my spinach salad and the salmon and sweet corn were to die for. I only wish I didn't eat so many chips with guacamole and appetizers so I could of eaten all my salmon and corn!  The sweet corn was so good!  Definitely worth a stop next time in Vegas!
