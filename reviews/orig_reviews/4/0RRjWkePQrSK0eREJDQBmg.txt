This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food.
