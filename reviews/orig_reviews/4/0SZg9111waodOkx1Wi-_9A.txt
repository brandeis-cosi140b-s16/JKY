This place pulled me in because of the historical building that I absolutely love. 

The ambiance inside is great. Interior design is amazing....I love the gothic but yet modern look. Chandeliers are beautiful...the fact that original windows were kept from the previous church is amazing. DÃ©cor is pretty awesome which helps the great atmosphere. 

The food, I must say it was nothing special. I had better tacos for sure. I also thought they were little over-priced for the amount you get. 

I would for sure go back to this place, but mostly because of atmosphere rather than food.
