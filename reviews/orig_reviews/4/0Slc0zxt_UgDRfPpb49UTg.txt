This is a fun bar to go to! Sandbar is another one of the few places where if I designed a Mexican themed bar, it would look exactly like this. Setup of the dance floor, open air themed, huge outdoor patio and the guy cooking the fresh carne on the side. 

There is tons and tons of bar space around here so it's fairly easy to grab a drink, plus waitresses are always walking around trying to get people to do a crazy shot. 

The last time we went I was able to tweet the DJ and all the recent tweets shows up on all the TVs around the bar so I could see my drunken shout outs to my girl. The DJ ended up following me on Twitter after that night and even tweeted me asking about a place I checked into on Yelp the following week, so bonus points for having an interactive DJ.

There are not a lot of other options on this side of town. The last night we went here we were bouncing around the SE Valley then after Sandbar we drove to Mill. Though Sandbar is perfectly fine for closing the bar down, just get in line a little early for those yummy street tacos because a drunk hungry crowd will ensure you never get one for yourself! 

Protip: Get in line before closing time for those tacos. You'll want one after smelling them all night!
