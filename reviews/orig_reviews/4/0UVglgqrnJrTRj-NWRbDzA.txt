I'd heard from a couple of coworkers about Fat Boy, and after I saw the good reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try them out. It doesn't hurt that they're fairly close to my apartment.

Super, SUPER glad I finally got to finally try them out tonight.

My girlfriend and I went in at about 7:30p - with four people already at tables eating, the place seemed half full; there's not a huge amount of seating in there. It's very much a hole in the wall, but not run down or even remotely divey. It's very well-lit, and the dining area is kept very clean. The menu is posted on the wall, but we were quickly given printed menus at the counter, which contain a few items that aren't on the wall menu. The burger prices may seem a tiny bit steep at first, but when you compare them to fast food they really aren't that much different. The clerk/cook was very friendly, and quick to apologize for our short wait.

I ordered a Monster Boyger, my girl ordered the Double Cheese Boyger combo, and we shared an order of the Chencho Fries; I also had to indulge in a bottle of Mexican Coke to wash it all down. Everything was just stupid delicious. I've already told a few people that the burger is my favorite in town; seasoned well, stacked but not overloaded with toppings, and HUGE. You can definitely taste that they're homemade. The Chencho Fries were just as good, though next time we may add some bacon or something just a little salty to the spiciness.

I can't give it the full five stars, as I haven't gotten the chance to try any of their pizza or other sandwiches; if those are as good as their burgers, that extra star may get added sooner rather than later. Definitely skip your normal fast food burger place and go here instead!
