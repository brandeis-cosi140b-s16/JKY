We came here w/ some out of town friends who actually got a recommendation from their concierge to come here. Im so glad we did.

Its kind of hidden in a tiny strip mall, you will most likely pass it at least once.

Yes, this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. Yes, some people find their mascot "offensive". Yes, the food really is good.

As a 1st timer there, we were treated to a mini tasting for some of their most popular choices: 2 rices, 2 beans, and 4 meats. I decided on the combination plate. I chose the emerald and jerk chicken w/ re-fried beans, and jerk fried rice. Both the chickens were moist and flavorful, and I loved the rice. And who doesnt love an end of meal cookie?

The decor is....minimalist? Seat yourself at one of their many tables, in one of 2 rooms and enjoy your very unique meal!
