Moving from Southern California to Charlotte has been amazing minus the food options.  Casual Mexican is just not good here.   No I don't want your crappy 7 eleven nacho cheese on my food.   At least say queso fresco or creme fraiche so I know its real cheese. 

Vida has been my one saving grace.  Is this an authentic wonderland... no but its got some good food and the basics on its menu with nice twists like pickled onions etc. The trndier taco prep style these days.   The carnitas tacos are great, the drinks and salsa are good.  Everything is fresh and properly made.   Now if someone can find me a [place that sells Steak Picado in Charlotte I will openly weep but until then this place is fine by me.
