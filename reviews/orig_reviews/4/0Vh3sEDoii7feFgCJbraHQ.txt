I agree with a previous review I read on foodnetwork who commented on the expencsive chips and guacomale. Though homemade and very fresh, I fiubd that the guacomale was too soicy for me and was made with an odd combination of crannberries on top. A bit over priced I sat in one day at the bar and ordered an iced horchata at happy hour which comes in a rediculously cool CocaCola glass bottle from the 70s or something. Unfortunately they made mine wrong b I had ask for no Kahlua being one of the rare few who dislikes coffee. But the bartender redid my drink Horchata, ice and only cream liquor. It was EXCELLENT! Usually I grab virgin horchatas around town at the Sinaloan or Mexican smaller restaurants around town. But the recipe is so amazing at Cafe Barrios. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Ice cold drinks at a good price are much needed in this hot summer weather in Phoenix, Az! So milk it up #horchata #highendmexican #cafebarrio #punintended #ricemilk #staygood #summer
