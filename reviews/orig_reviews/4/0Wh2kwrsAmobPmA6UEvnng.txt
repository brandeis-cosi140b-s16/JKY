We came here last night right before going to Zumanity! We decided to sit at the bar. Even though we only ordered chips & salsa & some drinks, the guys were very on top of it. They were constantly making sure everything was fine! We were impressed because most places, they seat you, you order, they give you your stuff and that's the last you'll probably see of them. I would have given them 5 stars if I had a meal there !
