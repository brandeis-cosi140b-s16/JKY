A Hideaway this restaurant certainly is - tucked into a derelict looking shopping center is a haven for delicious Southwest cuisine.  If Richardson's around the corner is packed, or you are looking for a new brunch option, stroll around the corner to Dick's.  Keep in mind that this place is literally a nook, so go with a small party rather than 50 of your closest friends.  The place is kind of sexy as it is, so an initmate gathering would be a better call.  Food is delicious, smoking hot, and inventive.  Not a chips and salsa joint, but more like inspired New Mexican cuisine.  They take some liberties with their green and red chile laden menu, but the dishes impress nonetheless.
