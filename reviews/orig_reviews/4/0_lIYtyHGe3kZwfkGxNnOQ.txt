We visited rokerij Sunday in their downstairs bar. We always love going in for their happy hour! Great small plates for $5 each between 3pm and 6pm. 
We learned that they have half off bottles of wine sun, mon, and tues! 
The food and service is always great.
However, we were sad to hear that they are not doing the reverse happy hour late night that we frequent to often. Where are we going to go now? Anyone have suggestions for a new late night happy hour with great food?
