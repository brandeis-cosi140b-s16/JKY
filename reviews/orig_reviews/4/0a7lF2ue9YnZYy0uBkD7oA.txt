I really liked Mango's. The food was good, and the environment was comfortable. I use chimichangas as a test of a Mexican food restaurant. I oredered a shredded beef Chimi, and it was great. The beef had lots of character and the sauce was unique - fruit and vegetable bits inside - I was pleasantly surprised.
  The chips were very good - not too greasy. The sauce was alright - a little 'wet' for my taste. 
  The price was a little higher than I saw in other reviews. You're going to drop pretty close to $10 on any meal here. 
  All in all, while I may not make a trip just to come here (I live in West Phoenix), I would be happy to eat here if I'm in the area.
