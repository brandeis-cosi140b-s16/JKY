Ever since I moved to AZ all I want to eat is Taco's. It took 5 months for me to wander a little down to the street to find out what Padre's was all about but I'm glad I did. They've been open for 7 years, and in that industry, that says A LOT. 

The happy menu is awesome. Usually happy hour menus have 5 things you don't like and 1 you're ok with. This one, I could choose from many things, but was very happy to see fish and carne asada street tacos on the list, as well as mojitos and margeritas. The bf and I got fish and carne asada tacos and some drinks and they were tasty, the price was right, the service was friendly. I'm definitely going here more often for HH.
