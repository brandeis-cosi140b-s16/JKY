Very tasty food and drinks. The guacamole is very good as it should be. Tacos are creative and delicious. My wife and I split the Mercadito Platter. More than enough food. Only complaint is we made a reservation via Yelp! The only available times were 5:45 and 8:30. We took the 5:45 which was really early but at 6:45 the restaurant was still half empty. Not sure what they are trying to do but they need to stop.
