The fajitas here are great! I ordered a steak - shrimp combo and trust me, they don't skimp out on the meat here. Next time I could easily share this entree. I went with my boyfriend and his 2 and 4 year old kids after a day of swimming at the golden nugget pool. The kids were totally wiped out and wanted something simple. So, luckily for us they had "american" options of chicken nuggets and fries, their favorite! My margarita was delicious, gigantic, and topped with gran marnier! perfect. My boyfriend ordered chicken enchiladas and I loved the sauce on it. The next time I went back I ordered a taco and tamale, but I'll be sticking with fajitas from now on, they were the best.
