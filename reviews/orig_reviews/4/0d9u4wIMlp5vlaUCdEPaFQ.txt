We stopped for the Bloody Mary bar and brunch. Have never seen anything  like it. They give you the vodka, Titos, and a glass of ice. The rest is up to your mixing. On the bar they have a wide variety of additives and several mixes. Unbelievable.  Cost is only $5. It's a real bargain. If you don't like Bloodies they have Mimosas and margaritas. For brunch I had the Eggs Benedict made with real honestly made hollandaise sauce.
