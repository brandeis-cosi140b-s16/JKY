Barrio Cafe is an amazing place to get inspired and creative Mexican food.  The lemon and pomegranate seeds in the un-mashed guacamole is unique and nicely balanced, served table side with awesome homemade tortilla chips.  But be careful not to fill up on bread and appetizers because the entrees are big portions.  I've loved all the entrees I've tried here, usually smothered in intensely flavorful sauces and served with delicious spicy mash and grilled zucchini.  The margaritas are also awesome.  The service is very quick and friendly; our waiter was happy to give us extra chips to take home.  The space is intimate and comfortable with live guitar music being played near the bar.  Be sure to check out the amazing street art that covers the building on your way in or out.
