For those of you who don't like the craziness and the hustle and bustle of Tacos El Gordo on Charleston....this is a great alternative. Excuse me, I wouldn't even call this an alternative....I would compare this as their Siamese twins.

Their Al Pastor (adobada) tacos are made exactly like El Gordo's. Carne Asada with that guac....on point. Yum!!!!!! Definitely come here for your street tacos craving. 

If you come during peak hours...be prepared to wait for a table since this place CAN get a bit dirty and messy....I didn't see any workers here trying to clear/clean tables. We were lucky enough to find the last CLEAN table.
