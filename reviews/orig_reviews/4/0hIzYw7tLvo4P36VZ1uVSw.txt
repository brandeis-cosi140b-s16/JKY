This is a "cool" little spot in Lawrenceville.  I got the salsa and chips and two orders of tacos...the shrimp and the carnitas.  The carnitas were especially delicious.  The tacos are very tasty and I could have eaten 2 more orders with ease.  My only complaint is the tacos are too small.  I can't see how one order (2 tacos) could satisfy anyone's appetite for dinner.
