Stopped in for happy hour today. They always bring two kinds of salsa and bean dip and chips before taking your drink order. They have specials during happy hour and today it was street tacos, margaritas, sangria. The drinks are great for the price. Service was good and the place was nice and clean. Third trip here and the last two times were for drinks and dinner and it's been good everytime.
