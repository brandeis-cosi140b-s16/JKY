And yet another delicious hidden gem found thanks to yelp!

My parents and I were vacationing in Scottsdale, and my mother had a certain suspicion that Arizona would be home to some damn good Mexican food. After a little research, I stumbled upon Sonora Mesquite Grill, and we made the trip out for a quick dinner. (Note: Not really a dinner place, def more like a quickie lunch hour ambiance) We started out with chips and salsa, but don't knock off my credibility here--it isn't your typical chain restaurant fare. There's 3 different salsas (we also got guac which was phenomenal), each with a distinct flavor but all DELICIOUS.

As for entrees, it's a bit like chipotle, formatting wise. You choose whether you want a burrito, tacos, bowl, etc., and I, of course, ended up with the carne asade burrito. It came out very hot, with the tortilla perfectly toasted and the carne asade was seasoned very well, without having an overwhelming taste. My parents got the tacos which were also very good.

I wish I could eat here more often!
