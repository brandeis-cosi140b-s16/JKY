I came here for an easy dinner and margarita during happy hour. I had the most awesome waiter named Chris. He was attentive yet didn't try to push anything onto us, you know like many does. He just rolled with the punches and our constantly changing demands. The food here isn't the awesomest, but the drinks are and the service goes along with that. 

This place gets busy, even though it is huge but they can handle it. I am quite impressed by this. So to recap; Food is OK. Drinks are amazing. Chris is an awesome waiter. I think that summarizes it.
