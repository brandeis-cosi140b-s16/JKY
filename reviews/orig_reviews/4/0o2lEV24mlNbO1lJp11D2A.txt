Our food was just ok, but Miguel the bartender/server made our night awesome with his ol'school music mix.  We were eating and jamming.  I ONLY want to come back when he's working.

I gave only 4 stars because I didn't think the tortillas were homemade and in a place that nice I hoped for that.  I also prefer my carne asada in larger pieces so that the meat is more tender. My tiny meat pieces were too well done.
