Fun idea for dinner. Lots of good healthy choices.. chicken, pork, steak, fish... delicious sauces with great heat. Lots of choices to go with...if you like to design your dinner... this is the place for you!  All the folks are smiley and helpful. Simple yet effective ambiance and soothing music..Next time... I'M trying the coconut bark! A great neighborhood experience!
