It scares me that the guy behind the sushi bar has a foot long beard. There are probably little hairs falling in food.. Disgusting. The owner should have a policy requiring that people (anyone handling food with hearty facial hair) wear a cover / hair net contraption as protection. I love this place but Jesus Christ cover that thing.
