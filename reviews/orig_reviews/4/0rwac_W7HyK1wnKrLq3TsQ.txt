I was visiting Scottsdale for business and my local cousins took me to Poncho's for dinner. This is their favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I tried the sampler with a presidential theme. Good variety of the Mexican dishes available. I enjoyed each piece of the plate and the addition of a large marg made it even better. I have it on his authority that the pollo fondito is awesome. Why only 4 and not 5? Slow to non-existent service at the front and really short handed waitstaff.
