Go here if you want old-school Mexican Food.  This place serves amazing tortillas; breakfast burritos and has pretty good authentic Mexican food.  I would give this place 5 stars, but the location is a little out of the way, which does give it some charm in the New Times sort of way.  

During the winter in the mornings it can be a little cold, but the food warms you up and the wait is always worth it!
