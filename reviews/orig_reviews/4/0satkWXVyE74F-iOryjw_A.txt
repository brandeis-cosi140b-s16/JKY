I absolutely love this place. I first went there last winter at the suggestion of a friend. I first thought it was a tattoo shop due to the girl in the window (when you go there, you'll see what I mean). There is a long bar area inside and very limited table seating (I think about 8 tables). The tacos are pretty expensive if you're just looking at it from a 'taco-standpoint' but due to the portions, I actually think it's a pretty good deal. I love the braised bbq chicken taco! There's a variety of unique tacos. These are not authentic, Mexican tacos so don't go there thinking that. These are completely 'Americanized' with tacos such as the "crispy eggplant" or the "braised bbq chicken" tacos. They have a respectable wine and alcohol list as well as appetizers. I took a date here once and it cost about $15 so it's perfect for a cheap date night. There are no substitutions allowed so what you see is what you get.

The atmosphere is pretty trendy, slightly dive-bar-ish. Very hipster-ish crowds there at times. The staff are quick with your orders, not very personable but I don't care as long as my food and drink orders are correct. They refill the chips and salsa expeditiously, when needed.

I suggest going on a weeknight due to the craziness of southside on Friday and Saturday if you just want to try this place for the first time. Otherwise, if you're already in southside and you are starving for some taco deliciousness, head over to Yo Rita's! I can't wait to go there again!

Oh and did I mention, free chips and salsa!!!
