Good "fast casual" place with a very large menu.  Fair prices, though they seem a little petty with all of the various signs posted regarding how many little plastic ramekins of salsa you can take, refills on soda, not to touch the silverware display, etc.  I concede the authenticity factor with having meat or stock, or lard in most everything (beans, rice, and even in the salsa) but a few additional vegetarian options would be most welcome on the menu.
