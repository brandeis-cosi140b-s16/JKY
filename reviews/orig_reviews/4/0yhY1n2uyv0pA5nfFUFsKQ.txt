I'm not sure this place is worth a trip off the strip if you're visiting.  The idea is novel and sounds great - but the meal was just ok - and with so many great deals and choices around town - it's hard to justify going out of your way to try this place.  I actually have a regular korean-mexican spot that I love - and it blows this place away.  The staff is super friendly here tho - and that alone deserves an extra star.
