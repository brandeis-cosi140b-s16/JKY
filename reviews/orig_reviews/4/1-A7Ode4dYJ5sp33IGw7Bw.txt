Solid restaurant/bar with interesting (and very good) tacos. I have been there twice and was happy both times with the food and drinks. Try the potato tacos. 

Thumbs up: 
+ Ahi Tuna and Potato tacos are excellent. So is the lime ginger margarita.
+ Chips and salsa are fresh and delicious
+ Feels healthy; good veggie and fishie choices

Thumbs down:
- My girlfriend's syrah did not taste like syrah. Yet, it was still interesting. 
- Last time I went, I felt we were rushed out a bit around 10pm on a Saturday although we had not been there for long. 
- Portions are a bit small for my taste
