Good place, good food, but as the others have said the seating area could use some more attention and los banos need a heavy dose of TLC.  

Avoid the 12 lunch rush if you are in a hurry otherwise certainly a place we will be back too when in the area..    I don't think they are open for dinner (but I not 100% sure on that) so the "concern" about getting there before dark should be a non-issue!
