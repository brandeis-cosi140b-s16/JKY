My first ever fish taco, and it blew my mind. 

First walking in, I thought the atmosphere was meh (too loud) and the service was also meh (too slow). The salsa was pretty good but nothing unlike the salsas I've had before. 

But then my BBQ Mahi Tuna Taco came and I almost died and went to heaven. I was expecting fish tasting taco but it was the least fish tasting tuna I've ever had. The fish was cut into chunky cubes but cooked so the meat practically melted into your mouth. The best part was the tortilla.  The tortilla was made out of some sort of God-Bread that was both flaky and bready at the same time. It was almost pastry like and I need to know how to make it! 

But anyways. You get my drift. Awesome, awesome, awesome food.
