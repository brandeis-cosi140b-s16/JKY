Surprisingly I enjoyed the meals here. I wish I would have known that the nachos were HUMONGOUS. I kind of found the Parmesan nachos on the salty side. It definitely helped that I washed it down with an ice cold beer. This place is a chill sports bars. I love the view from that spot because you can overlook Vegas. Eastern and st rose is one of my favorite areas in Vegas. 

Next time that I visit, I definitely wanna try some of the other meals on the menu. I recommend trying this spot out.
