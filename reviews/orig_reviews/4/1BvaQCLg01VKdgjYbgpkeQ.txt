Went to Taco Tijuana on a Saturday afternoon.  The staff couldn't have been more friendly, very helpful in deciding which tacos to try.  I had the carne asada, adobada, and suadero.  Oh, and when I had eaten the adobada, I had to order another.  It was the clear winner.  Taco Tijuana doesn't have the usual salsa bar that most taco joints have, but they make the tacos with specific toppings, rather than just the onion/cilantro topping.  I loved this, I was more than happy to trust them with how to dress the tacos.  The carne was a little lacking in flavor for my tastes, but that doesn't mean I didn't care for it.  But, as noted above, the adobada was fantastic.  Tender with some good spice from the sauces.  The tacos are packed full, each bite has an abundance of toppings.  When I return, it will be a challenge not to order a bunch of adobada and nothing else....
