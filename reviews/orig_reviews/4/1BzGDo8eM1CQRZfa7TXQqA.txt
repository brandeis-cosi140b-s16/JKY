Gallo Blanco is a cool, hip little place. 

It has a very simple design. Very fresh ingredient menu. 
It offers the kind of mexican food I enjoy. Its fresh, healthy and high qualilty. 

I started with chips and guacamoli. By far the best guacamoli I have ever had. I believe they put oranges in it. 
Then I had the fish tacos. Also very good. I ordered 2. My server suggested I get three because they are kinda small. 

I am extremely impressed by their drink menu. I am not a huge drinker. Probably because most places use bad ingredients that contain high fructose corn syrup,  MSG, or tons of added simple syrup (sugar).
Their drinks were all high quality, natural, fresh ingredients. 

They by far, have the Best Bloody Mary I have ever had in Phoenix. 
There was fresh dill in the homemade mix. Unbelievable!
