Awesome food.  Everything we had was wonderful. The servers were nice and attentive although one was a bit clumsy a dropped stuff a few times but everyone has a bad day now and then. My friend had a pork chop with a green chile sauce on it.  It was so tasty that when I go back this is what I'm getting.
