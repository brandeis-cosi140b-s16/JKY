First time in, I went for lunch. Believe or not, I never got to eat my lunch.  The salsa and appetizer  filled me up so much I couldn't eat my tacos.  TO GO BOX PLEASE! 

Here's what I know.  The salsa has a char taste to it. Makes it very different.   The pico has a good amount of garlic.  And the sampler platter is crazy good.   All in all.  I will be back.
