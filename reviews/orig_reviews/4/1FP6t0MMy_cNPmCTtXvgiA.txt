We've eaten there many times. Just had lunch there on Saturday. Sat outside. We decided to have Margaritas and a couple of us tried a Drag N Berry. Margaritas were very good. The Drag N Berry was very syrupy/heavy but had good flavors and was heavy on the alcohol. Would have rather had homemade lemonade with a shot of something but they were out of lemonade. Love their taco selection - great combinations. I had a puerco al pastor, that had pork and pineapple (yum) and another that was brisket cooked in red sauce. They have a couple of good Mexican beers on tap, and had $3 blue moons as the special. We had a very nice relaxed meal with an attentive waiter. Try it you'll like it!!
