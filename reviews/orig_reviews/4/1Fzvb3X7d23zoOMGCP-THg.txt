I'm really surprised to see some of the negative reviews on this place. I had a great experience. 
I was in Phoenix visiting family and friends when we decided to stop here on the way home from the airport. The inside is really neat. It's dim, but very modern looking. I honestly was a little nervous to look at the prices because of it. The waiter when he came over seemed like his job was the best thing to ever happen to the planet. Picture the annoying guy at the Apple Store trying to explain why Apple is the best thing in the world... but toned down. It actually was a good thing. We ordered the queso and moved on to checking out the rest of the menu. Its not a huge menu but has some unique options. When the waiter came back I asked about 2 different options... chicken or pork tacos. Not only was he certain which one he wanted me to have, he decided to describe both in great detail. He knew every ingredient and the order in which it was put on the tacos. And these were not ordinary tacos. All sorts of wonderful stuff on those bad boys.
The food was great. Portions were small, and it was a little overpriced, but overall I quite enjoyed myself.
