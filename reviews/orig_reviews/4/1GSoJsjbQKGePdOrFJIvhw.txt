Have to say that after our treatment at a competitors bar we are happy to be here. After a long week it was nice to have great service. Chris was respectable and on top of it. Drink never empty and he made sure we were comfortable and well served. Food was great and beer was cold. They have earned our business and is our go to spot on our Friday's. Thank you Wahoos for taking care of EMS and first responders.

One thing I wish is that they had breakfast food, but that's how it goes. Treated well and good fish tacos hard to beat.
