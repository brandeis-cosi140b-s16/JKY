Three amigos . For a small place they did a very good job!! The place was clean, the server was great!! The drink specials are insane!!! 
      Food- if your going there for salsa and chips . It was fair. Taste like they use tomato sauce in it. More like tex me  than mexican. But after that it was really good. I had the taco special. I like to order the crazy kind of stuff. So I ordered the tongue taco, pastor ,asada, shredded beef and tripe which they did not have so I got chicken instead. The hot sauces were very tasty.There was only two kinds. Food was hot, tortillas were also hot . I also ordered a tea and then I changed my mind to horrchata( I hope I spelled that right). A rice drink with a hint of cinnamon. It went great with the taco and reminded me of the small taco stands in Cabo in the city not the tourist area. I told the waitress I would pay for my tea. So she left it on the table. As I was about to pay , being stuffed for a great price. She said she would take the tea off the bill because I didn't drink it. Ok folks just this small gesture made a huge impression on me and how these servers take care of there guest. Just for the service alone I would go back. Now I read some other reviews about the service staff that were not that good. This server was new by a couple of months and knew how to cater to the clientele. Great job
