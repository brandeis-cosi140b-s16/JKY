Beware: Very loud. 
Our table had nachos, fajitas, the chimichanga platter, and guava smoothie. Everything was fabulous and that is especially the nachos! The chimichanga was not so great though and it tasted weird. This place is definitely for fun and loves to give out free shots. The band is awesome, the staff is fun, and they also have karaoke. Check it out for great Mexican food, alcohol, and fun. 
Always check Groupon for their daily deals. The restaurant is on there a lot.
