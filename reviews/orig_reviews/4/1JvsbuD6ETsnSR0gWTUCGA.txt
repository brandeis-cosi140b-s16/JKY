It's listed as Mexican, which is a mis-categorization. It shares menu's with sisters Richardson's and the Rokerij. So, it's really a New Mexican fusion with lots of fresh fish and always excellent specials.
The Hideaway is petite, though with an extra room available on brunch- filled weekends. The wait for brunch on the weekends can be lengthy if you're more than two, but it's worth it. The food is great, and I recommend sharing a plate unless you plan on leftovers. 
I frequent this place and have only two gripes, otherwise would have given 5 stars. 
1.) cocktails are outrageous. $10 for a manhattan otr. 
2.) more than once I've seen a cook handle raw food without gloves and have sent it back due to this, so keep an eye out. It's an open kitchen which I prefer.

Otherwise it's bomb!
