While on a trip to Charlotte, we visited this restaurant because we had seen it on Diners, Drive In, and Dives. 

Because of the time of day we went, we got in with no wait at all. The salsa we got before the meal was very fresh and very good. The Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos were excellent. It was with worth searching out this restaurant because it was worth the hype. 

My only complaint is that since I do not live in Charlotte, I cannot have these tacos more often.
