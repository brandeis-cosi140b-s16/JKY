Unique, fun, funky, tasty, divey.  Chino Bandido is a bizarro mix of chinese and mexican.  Order up front (their way or the highway).  Big portions served in tin-foil to-go containers.  Mostly clean seating area with big community tables and some smaller 2/4/6-tops.  Love the Jade Red Chicken -- sweet and spicy.  Whatever you order, make sure to get the black beans (and rice) as a side; they taste like nothing else.  Snickerdoodle cookie (great) comes with every entree, or a mudslide cookie (awesome) on the weekends.  Only downside is sketch service -- try to avoid dinner rush, where you may wait in line for 15-30 minutes to order and 30 minutes or more for your food to arrive.
