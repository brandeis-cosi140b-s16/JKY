I really just come here for the chocolate chile shake.

That will come as no surprise to my yelp friends, as my affinity for oddly flavored frozen dairy based treats is well documented in the talk threads.

This shake comes as any  well made shake should.  With a gigantic straw.  This is the fattest straw I've ever seen.  Even with this colossal drinking implement you will sooner pop a blood vessel than get any of the sweet elixir to travel though it.  
Nope, you gotta pop that lid off and spoon it into your mouth until it melts a little.
It's that thick.  Just the way god intended a milk shake to be.

Then theres the chewy chunks of chile that assault your taste buds with a little kick of spice that accompanies the sweet chocolate goodness so beautifully.  Seriously.  Why is any chocolate shake EVER served without chile.  They belong together, in my mouth.
