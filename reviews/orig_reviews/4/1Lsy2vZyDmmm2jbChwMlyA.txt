I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I had been here a few times when it was Super Mex, but I think they have definitely improved with the name change. 

I really liked their chips, salsa & bean dip. We also ordered a quesadilla for an appetizer and it was really good. Although I don't know how anyone can screw up a quest Dillard's.  :)  Unfortunately, I stuffed myself, and then I could barely eat my yummy Mexican Pizza. But not to worry it was equally delicious later that night at home. Next time I definitely want to see if they can make the Mexican Pizza with a corn tortilla instead. 

The bf ordered the Tequila Sunrise and he was very happy with it. I tried a bite, but I was already so stuffed. We definitely over ordered. 

I also really enjoyed the Margarita. I'm not usually a tequila drinker but it sounded good at the time. Just the right amount of salt on the rim. Delicious!
