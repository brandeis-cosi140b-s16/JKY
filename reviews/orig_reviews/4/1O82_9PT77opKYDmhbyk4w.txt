This was by far one of our favorite places we ate the whole week we were in Vegas. We went during the soccer game, so it was BUSY! It was loud, rowdy and FUN!  It took quite awhile to get our order taken, or our margaritas for that matter. But like I said, they were beyond busy and seemed under staffed. The manager was running and doing as much as she could. The staff was all VERY polite [something we encountered very little of while in Vegas]. The food was worth the wait, hot and delicious! We didn't finish and they boxed it up, along with extra chips & salsa for us... napkins, cutlery, etc. 

Once the game ended, it calmed down a ton. The manager made sure we were taken care of.. and our waiter was funny & didn't stop smiling the whole time. We will absolutely be back on our next trip!
