Came here today with my co worker to have lunch. Ordered it "to go" over the phone so we wouldnt have to waste majority of our lunch break waiting for the food to be cooked. The food was delicious. We ordered the Chicken & Cheese enchiladas with green sauce. I cannot say enough about the green sauce, it is so good! This is our 2nd time here and we love it. Wish they would have lunch specials and coke products instead of pepsi. Other than that, this place rocks!
