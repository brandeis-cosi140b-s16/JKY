Bomb diggity! Vegas secret no more! I'm telling everyone. This place is a great idea and the flavors blend very well. I love the fusion between the Mexican dishes with the Korean flavors. It seems like it was starting to get packed when we were about to leave. On top of being well attended too, and extra food choices, the meal was rather inexpensive! Bonus all around. KoMex, you will be a stop while I'm in Vegas again. Thank you.
