Simply delicioso! Was looking for some authentic flavors with a home-cooked comfort-food feel and we definitely found that here. Chips and salsa to start- the green salsa was so good that we finished off two baskets of chips before our food even came out.
Rib eye crispy tacos- comes with 2 for an entr√©e. A little greasy but can be good hang over food. The rib eye was very tender and juicy. Yum all around
Chipotle fajita tamales- Definitely get the green sauce. Good vegetarian option- filled with onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. 
OMG Churros! Sinfully sweet and coated with cinnamon sugar. Served with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces on the side. Perfect way to end your Mexican fiesta meal.
