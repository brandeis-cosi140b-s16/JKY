This is probably my favorite Valley destination for standard Mexican food. As soon as you walk in, you can tell it's steeped in Valley tradition...

If you come by when it's not busy, you can sit at "The President's Table" which is the table at which President Bush sat when he dined there with Jerry Coangelo, Bob Brenly and Artie Moreno.

If that's taken, ask for "The Mayor's Table", where The Morning Mayor Dave Pratt is known to sit when he visits.

Now I'm no fundamentalist, but I still can't deny that "The Presidential Special" (two enchiladas, rice and beans) is probably the best traditional Mexican dish I've ever had in Arizona. 

Somewhat surprisingly, the shrimp taco is also REALLY good. 

If you stop by, make sure you ask for their very friendly owner, Zippy. Ask him to tell you about some celebrity who's come by in the past. His stories alone will make your evening.
