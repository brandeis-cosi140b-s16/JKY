I am wrestling with what to say. The large selection of salsa maybe masked the flavors of my burrito, it's hard to say.

 Luchador jokes aside there were many things about my experience here that I liked. From when I entered via a large wooden door, the clean inside decorated with interesting Mexican art, padded chairs and of course the salsa bar. There is a menu on the wall; however it is hard to read. Luckily they have printed ones to order from. 

Despite the taco centric name I went with a Mahi burrito sans bacon, filled with grilled mahi, mushrooms, pablano pepper and more. The fish was nicely grilled and tender, the texture of the mushrooms really added to the dish. It was wrapped in a soft tortilla was quite good. Every bite I had was accompanied by one of their many salsas.

 The salsa bar was one of the first things I noticed walking in. There were eight options. Mild to spicy, Mellon to smoky they have it as an option. One of the more unique salsas is made from watermelon; it is refreshingly spicy and sweet.

 A complimentary basket of chips was delivered to our table, some of the chips were good, and however others were undercooked or stale.

 The location was a bit hard to find as its part of a small strip of stores and we parked out front which made for a scary exit backing on to a main road. For lunch today it was a bit odd, we walked in around 11:45 and we seemed to be the second customer of the day, with the first waiting for a to go order. The salsas were just being put out. The entire time there no one else walked in.

From the looks of the massive sign on the door their liquor licence is still pending.
