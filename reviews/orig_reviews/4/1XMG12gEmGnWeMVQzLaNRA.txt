I enjoyed the lunch buffet on this re-visit. There were not too many choices but the food was good and the service was very efficient and friendly. A previous visit was  bit disappointing but this was probably because I came way after the lunch peak at that time. I met Rand H. and Robyn N. here at 11 am this time around, so the food was freshly prepared and plentiful. Three and a half stars, rounded up to 4.
