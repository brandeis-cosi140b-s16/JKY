Yummy charming spot. Im stick on the Chicken salad. Wish I could remember the exact name but it's on the middle left of the back of the menu. Lol

My husband loved the carne asada and a friend said the fried ice cream and tortilla soup were very good too. Prices can be a tad high but it's in s tourist spot. 

Outdoor patio is charming and highly recommended.
