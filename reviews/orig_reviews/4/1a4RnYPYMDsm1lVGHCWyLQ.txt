One of my father's patients had recommended Juan's and said it was the best Mexican food around. My Dad and I decided to test that theory on a recent trip I had to Phoenix.

Juan's is an unassuming box building with a green awning and sign that reads "Juan's Authentic Mexican Food." After entering, the first thing I noticed was that there were a lot of Hispanic people enjoying their lunch, which is always a good sign. The establishment is clean and simple. You have the option to take out or dine in with waitress service. Dine in we did and we were greeted by the peppiest waitress I've come across in a long time.

I ordered a carne asada burrito, enchilada style and with sour cream and guacamole on the side. It was excellent, and ridiculously filling. In fact, sad enough as it is, I couldn't even put it all down. And to wash all that down I had a nice sized horchata. My Dad had a quesadilla and was equally satisfied. Mmm, I'll be back Juan. Mark my words.
