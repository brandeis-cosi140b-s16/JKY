After spending 5 hours in the airport and 5 hours on a bumpy flight, I finally landed in Las Vegas. Since I was traveling for about 10 hours (or more) I was starving for something other than airport food. I didn't know where to go, so I turned to my friend who is stationed out here to bring me somewhere good and low-key. He picked a great place! We started off with guacamole and two different kinds of salsa. The guacamole was really really good! It was the second best I have ever had. We then had the beef quesadilla, which were also very good. Super cheesy, and the beef was extremely tender. 

Oh and if you are going to get a drink (which you are since you are in Vegas) get the pitcher of red sangria.....So Delicious!!!!!
