Had a late lunch here (02/18/11) with a friend and the food was yummy!  Our server was a little inattentive which was a little bothersome because they weren't busy, but the host more than made up for her attitude with his charm!  

They have a good selection of beers (I had the kiltlifter) and we shared some chips, salsa, and guacamole which was all fresh and tasty.

My friend had the green chile open face burger and I had the green chile philly sandwich.  My sandwich was loaded with meat and it was delicious with just the right amount of heat and melted cheese. 

All in all a cute place with good basic food and a good beer selection!
