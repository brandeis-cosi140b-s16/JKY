When a place states "Finest Foods of Mexico" it makes you wonder what makes this place the finest. Coming from LA, this place is very pricey for Mexican food, but you are paying for the ambiance of this place. I really like the ornamentation of this place with large ropes that adorn the ceiling and perimeter surrounding the bar area. We even witnessed a couple getting "friendly" at one of the booths.

We decided to sit at the bar to have some good conversation. The employees here were really friendly. FYI, the chairs at the bar are extremely heavy. Anyhow, we were given some chips and salsa to start. We ordered this seafood ceviche as an appetizer which was decent although the lemon was overpowering. Then, we ordered some drinks and some tacos. At least the tacos were a reasonable size for the amount that you are paying for them. 

Of course after a few drinks, I needed to use the restroom. There is an attendant in the restroom which I suppose in a high end restaurant is expected, although weirded me out initially.

I would say that this place would be great to bring a date as it is a great backdrop for a romantic evening.
