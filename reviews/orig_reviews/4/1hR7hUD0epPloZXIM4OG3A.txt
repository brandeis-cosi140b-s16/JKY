My wife and I went to the Mission to celebrate our first anniversary over brunch. We weren't disappointed. The food was great! 

I had the Chilaquiles (corn tortillas, pork, egg, cojita) and have never quite tasted anything like it. A combination of flavors with a little bit of spice. The plate had a very nice portion as well. Good value for $9.

My wife had the corn pancakes with crab and loved the meal.

I made an executive decision to also order the homemade granola, yougurt and tropical fruit. This dish was superb. I was a bit disappointed that the menu listed the fruit options as pineapple, mango and papaya and when the plate arrived there were blueberries instead of the papaya. Mix in the fruit, yogurt and granola and we had a nice complement to our main meal.

The service was good. We had to wait awhile for our food. A table next to us ordered well after me, and ended up getting their food at least 10 minutes before. That was upsetting, because we were both very hungry! At least the waitress came over and said the food was on its way and thanked us for our patience.

The inside is very nice and has a cool decor. 

There is a small patio outside and a full bar inside.
