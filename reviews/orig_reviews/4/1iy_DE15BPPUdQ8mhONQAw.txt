I'm a huge Nacho fan, I've been wanting to try this place for quite sometime.  So finally I caught a special on living social.  So I ordered one of the Nachos and my husband ordered the rib eye steak.   Well I must say with a name like Nacho Daddy, they really need to step up there game on that.  I was very disappointed in the nachos.  That creamy cheese sauce, and the liquid sour cream!  I make better ones at home.  But....Wait now, the rib eye steak was really good, with the garlic Fry's and the Mexican corn.  I was very impressed.  The service was great.  They asked my husband how his steak was, he was very satisfied.  Finally the bartender asked me.  how i liked my nachos, I told him I didn't like it.  He asked me why I didn't tell him.  Well I'm sure most of you know whats up with that. Who wants to send food back, you never know what they might do to it.  He wanted to get me something else, so I told him I would love to have one of the strawberry margaritas.   WOW...Now that was awesome!  I will be back for another Strawberry Margarita for sure, and a rib eye.  And  I'm sure I can find a good salad on the menu.
