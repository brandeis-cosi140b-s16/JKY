I'm a fan of this place simply because I love the decor, dishes, and plates.. I'm bummed that I've never actually eatin an entre here and ususally stick to the Appetizers. In the past I've had the Chicken Quesadilla, which was delicious and Ceviche which was, sadly, a disappointment absolutely no flavor and too much tomato. Their MARGARITAS on the rocks are no too bad though :) plus they come in a cool glass ;) 

Happy Hour:  Weekdays from 3:30-6:56 (or something weird like that) and then again starting at 10pm- $2 beers/$2 tacos/ $5 Margaritas
