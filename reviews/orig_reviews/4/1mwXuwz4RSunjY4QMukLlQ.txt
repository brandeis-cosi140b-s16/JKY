They welcomed us to sample every single kind of meat when we first started. So yummy and great quality food. Really fresh ingredients. Yummy homemade not powdery horchata. Small to medium sized portions. 

You first order up front (chipotle, subway style) then pay and take a seat. 

Funky decor is kind of neat. Good place for casual dining. 

Would give 5 stars but ran out of guacamole! :(
