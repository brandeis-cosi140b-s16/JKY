Take Chipotle and, cross it with wood-fired pizza minus the pizza, add your own personal twist then throw in some out of the ordinary choices (bison tacos, anyone?) and voila, Gadzooks.

You get to choose from soup, tacos or enchiladas and pick out your choice of meats and cheeses. After they stick it in the oven to get it all melty and toasty you add on veggies and our salas, perhaps grab and beer and your done.

I came not too long after it opened and it took a while to get my order in. A lot of that had to do with that fact that none of us really knew what our choices were. The menus aren't that clear so I found  myself guessing up to the last minute before making a rush decision as to not hold up the line any more.

 It was a little haphazard behind the counter as well because the staff didn't quite seem to know what was going on or what they were supposed to do. It was like a poor assembly line that went horribly slow to suddenly speed up. It was like watching Lucy and Ethel make enchiladas.

Once i got my order though the meat was tender and delicious and I really enjoyed it. I would probably go just a little less melty next time. I think I need to go a few more times and become more acquainted with the menu I'm sure I'll like it even more. I'm sure too that by now that staff are more experienced and running like a well-oiled machine.
