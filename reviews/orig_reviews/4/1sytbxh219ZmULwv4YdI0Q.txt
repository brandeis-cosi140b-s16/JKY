A good amount of variety in tacos can be found in this nice little hole in the way. The salsa bar is included, so pace yourself. Chicken tacos are bland, pork is overcooked, but carne Asada is freaking amazing. I was here with a large party and between all 10 of us I believe we got nearly every taco on the menu and that was the overall opinion. Beef options are the best. The sauces are delicious and the staff is nice. Definitely reminds me of living in Texas, which is to say it is TexMex, not Mexican food.
