I went in with a friend for lunch. As soon as we sat down, the server immediately came to greet us and asked for drink orders. Once we ordered our food, the meals got to our table extremely fast! We both got the chicken zucchini lunch plate, which was pretty good. Our server checked in on us often, and never let our drinks get more than half way empty before refilling them. 

In summary, great service, decent food, I would go back.
