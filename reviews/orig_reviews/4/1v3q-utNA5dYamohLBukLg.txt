Nacho Daddy has an excellent selection of Mexican food be it tacos, burritos and of course nachos! The Florentine nachos was very good and had a unique spin on the usual salsa and beef based nachos. This is the old Firefly location so they didn't do much changes except to move some tables and chairs around. Food = 4, Decor = 4, Service = 4, Drinks = 4, Overall = 4. We'll be back!
