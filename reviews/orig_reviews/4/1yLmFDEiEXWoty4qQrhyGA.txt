This place is like the IHOP of Mexican food. Interesting variety.  Kind of a standardized feel to the food/menu. Get a lot of food for what you pay. Pretty good above average. Got the Egg chiladas and chilaquiles. A plus that I got chips and salsa when ordering breakfast. Love me some chips and salsa! Liked the bean dip
