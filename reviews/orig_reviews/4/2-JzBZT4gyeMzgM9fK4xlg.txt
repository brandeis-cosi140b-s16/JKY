Three middle-aged women dined here on a weeknight and weren't made to feel out of place.  Our drinks were customized to our liking, and management even comped our salsa trio because it took too long (due to a huge party ordering right before us).  I've had plenty of flatbread in my day, and Milagro Grill's ranks right up there - superb firm and perfectly seasoned shrimp, shaved cheese in addition to the melted, perfectly browned onions - yum!

I'd highly recommend if you're in Scottsdale.
