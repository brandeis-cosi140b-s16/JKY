This was the first cafe rio I went to last year. It was because of this location that got me hooked on their food. 

Ordering online is sooo easy, you can choose the most specific requests to make and I have gotten through with little to no issues (over 20 times ordering online, only 1 or 2 small things (left off guacamole on salad, wrong dressing) but given the law of averages they are pretty darn good.

Taste wise the salads are awesome and the reason I order from here at least once a week. Everything tastes so fresh, especially the tortilla under the salad. They make the tortillas at the location which makes a great addition to the salad. *they just added a wheat tortilla option which I tried and was sooo good. 

Portion sizes are pretty large and unless I'm starving ill get 2 meals out of 1 salad.
