A Mexican friend of mine told me Backyard Taco was "the best Mexican food in the valley." So I decided to try it out 

I ordered the steak burrito and checked in on Yelp for free chips and salsa. the first thing I noticed about the steak (or carne asada) was that it was very juicy, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. Also the burrito was extremely onion-y, which really detracted from the overall taste. 3.5/5 on the food

The atmosphere was lively and up-tempo. There was a nice college like vibe to the patio and the interior restaurant. Service was quick and friendly, and prices were about average. ($6 for an ~eight inch burrito. 5/5 on everything else.
