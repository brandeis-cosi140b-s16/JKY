First timer from California at this place and I loved it! Wait time to get a table might take a while since this place is highly solicited, but meanwhile you can enjoy a nice cold beer while listening to the banda play outside. Once you're in, your ears will be greeted by more awesome Mexican music that makes you just want to grab a beer and sing along. We got our order taken pretty quick, but food wait time was a little delayed since it was pretty crowded and thats understable. Once i got my plate I could not believe the amount of shrimp that was on there. They arent stingy at all with the shrimp and well hey im fine with that. I ordered the camarones al mojo de ajo and I loved them. I definitely recommend this place if you want some good food, big portions and some good loud Mexican music.
