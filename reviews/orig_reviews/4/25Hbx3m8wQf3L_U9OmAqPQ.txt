I checked out The Mission when I was visiting my parents in Phoenix because I had read Laura's review, and she generally has awesome taste. Also, I love fancy Mexican food. And The Mission met my high expectations! The atmosphere is really romantic but fun at the same time, I would be just as comfortable there on a date as I would be with some girlfriends. The bartenders were all really nice and the pear basil margarita was amazing. So was the white sangria. I may have been a bit toasted by the time I left. But that's not a bad thing.

And the food was delicious. We had the chips and guac, and the guac was great - nice spice level where it heated me up but didn't set my mouth on fire. Very nice mix of herbs. The chips were maybe a hair greasy for my taste but that is my only complaint. I had the duck confit which was absolutely delicious, and a huge portion. My friend had the black cod which we agreed was the better dish. It was light, flavorful, just perfect. We split the espresso churros for dessert and they were freaking incredible. I could have taken a bath in the milkshake thing they came with.

Overall The Mission is highly recommended. Go there!
