We had a groupon to try the breakfast and overall we were impressed.  They gave good size, flavorful portions and the service was friendly.  The cook even came out to ask if we enjoyed our meal.   The restaurant itself was clean and well taken care of.  Next time I'm going to try the menudo or one of their seafood dishes.  Since they are serving breakfast, they may want to add coffee to the menu :)
