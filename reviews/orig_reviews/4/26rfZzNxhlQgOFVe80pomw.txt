On Spring break vacation, we found this restaurant located in the fine dining section of the entertainment book we purchased for our trip out there. The coupon was great with the punch card used for the fine dining section of the coupon book, and the sample menu sounded delish. Absolutely love Mexican, we have a place at home we go often, and wanted to find another non-chain - great Mexican restaurant. We happened to go during a weekday for an earlier dinner which placed us there during their happy hour. The selections for the appetizers that were included in the happy hour prices were amazing. Our waiter who was very friendly and helpful pointed out the nachos which were loaded with everything tasty, were an amazingly huge portion, especially for the happy hour price... and he wasn't kidding, it was way more that we could eat for 2 people. All the food was great, and well priced, Very clean and neat decor - and too boot, at the bar we were able to catch the end of a basketball game to see our home team - Cleveland Cavs beat the Heat! NICE!
