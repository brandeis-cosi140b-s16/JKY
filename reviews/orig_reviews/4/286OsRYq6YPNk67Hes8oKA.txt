with great trepidation we ventured into nacho daddy's, which we had only mentioned before by way of making fun of the awful name of the place.  we were pleasantly surprised--the bar service was friendly and helpful, the prices good, and the nachos were tasty.  not a fantastic place, but with the highest yelp-rated mexican restaurant in the area being roberto's (umm.  really?), nacho daddy's is not so bad.  a great place to watch a game, also, if that's up your alley.
