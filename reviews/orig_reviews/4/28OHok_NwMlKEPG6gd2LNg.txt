First thing to know about me is I am not a Vegas kind of girl, I hate the incessant lights, the gambling, the tackorama, the crappy cheap free food all over, so for me to love a place in Vegas some things must be in order, the things I love about Border Grille are, clean and beautiful, calm, natural soft light open healthy feel with the high windows and higher ceilings. The food was probably the best mexican food I have had in america. Artfully displayed and delicious and clearly fresh. I loved they have their signature cook book displayed and the staff was courteous and calm. A nice antidote to the hype and manic energy of Vegas overall.
