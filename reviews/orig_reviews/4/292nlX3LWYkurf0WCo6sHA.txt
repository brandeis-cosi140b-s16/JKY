You had me at hello. You had me at hello...

For me (and my dad), I am all about first impressions, and if you have bad salsa than I am not likely going to return. Or if you make me PAY for my chips and salsa--FAIL!

Pancho's salsa rocks the house! 

Their food is great and call me crazy, but I like eating in their seedy bar. 

Their frozen margs arent too bad either.

If you want authenticity--this is the place!
