My absolute favorite restaurant. I have been going to this restaurant about twice a month for the past year because it is my favorite. I love the wide variety of choices for vegetarians and picky eaters (like me!). 

I love the funky and eclectic art and feel too. Every time I am there, the tables are rearranged and there are new art pieces on the wall. I love the cozy feel because I am from the neighborhood and see such great potential for more places like this. I also recommend trying their specialty items. You can't go wrong with frog legs and chips and green salsa. 

Unfortunately, I have noticed that the prices of the food have been increasing, while the portions are decreasing. I understand that it's business, but the quality in food (though still my favorite) hasn't been on point the past couple of times. The chicken jerk has been fatty, the mango unripe, and a few other issues. 

Hopefully business booms and things improve because this is my favorite restaurant.
