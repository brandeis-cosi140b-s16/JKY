My husband and I went twice last week, and intend to return once a week until we move out of Gilbert. Hidden behind the Arby's across the street from Dana Park, we missed it the first time, but it's when we leave this area that we'll truly miss Nando's.

The menu is great, with plenty of classics and unique dishes. We were so pleased by the relatively large number of vegetarian items and learned from our very nice and helpful server Lisa that virtually any dish can be made vegetarian. Like Pollo Fundido (they call it Pollo Rico) but don't want the chicken? They'll fill the burrito with fajita veggies and potatoes instead. My husband had the Enchiladas Ongos (mushrooms with a chipotle cream sauce) and it was to die for. My Pollo Rico was huge, fresh, and outstanding. I've had better beans and rice, but they were fine. The second time we went, Bob had a veggie chimichanga and I had the Barrio Tacos. He really enjoyed his ginormous chimi, and my tacos were pretty good, but I have had more flavorful and tender carne asada elsewhere. 

On our first visit we had the cheese crisp, which came with a deep fried tortilla bottom and tons of good quality cheese on top. Delicious, but a little heavy. We decided that the second time we would save room for the chocolate nachos, and they turned out to be just ok- the concept was far better than the final execution. The chocolate tortilla chips were thick and the flavor was not what I had expected. 

The service was absolutely fantastic both times, and the atmosphere is very open and friendly. I love the wrought iron decor. The prices are reasonable for the portions, and they have the lime mints I love as you go out the door. Our first server told us that she has been with this restaurant since they opened- 6 or 7 years now. That says a lot about the people who run the place- they inspire loyalty in both their customers and their staff.
