We stopped in for an early lunch. The place was empty when we arrived but by the time we left all of the tables were full and that was well before lunch. Shortly after we ordered we were brought chips that had a small amount of  beans on them. They were good. I ordered the carnitas street tacos and my son had the green chile burrito. Everything was really tasty. I especially enjoyed the salsa that was brought out with the chips. There was a salsa bar with several other choices as well that I would like to try on our next visit.
