There is always a wait of at least 15 minutes, but it's a large place, so I guess you can't blame these folks for being popular. We only recently discovered Valle Luna, but it has taken over the top spot on our list of Mexican restaurants.  Even the chips and salsa are a step above what we get in most places. The menu is fairly extensive, and so far everything we have ordered here has been delicious. I would characterize the service as average. They have great party trays that you can order for special events containing mini- chimichangas, tacos and other items. My office has ordered several of these. The menu is not very clear with regards to how these party items can be ordered individually when you eat at the restaurant; I'm not even sure if it's possible, which is too bad because I would like to be able to order these items as appetizers. I highly recommend Valle Luna.
