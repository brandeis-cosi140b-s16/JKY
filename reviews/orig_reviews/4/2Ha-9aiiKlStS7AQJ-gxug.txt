Hubby and I visited here recently and even on a rainy day the place was BUSY! I hadn't been here for years but wanted to see if things had changed. We sat at a table close to the water, service was very good and food was also good. Cave creek and carefree have a few more restaurants but still have that small town feeling. We would definitely return!
