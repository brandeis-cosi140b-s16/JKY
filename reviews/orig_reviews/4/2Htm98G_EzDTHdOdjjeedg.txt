Great outdoor seating in the Arizona Center. They open at 11am and have a nice top shelf margarita selection.  You get a shaker full of drink so it's more like three drinks in one.  We all had soup and salads. It was a good lunch with  nice variety of flavors.  The chicken pablano chowder was really nice.  End of the meal comes with a little treat of white chocolate pecan in a tamale husk.  Yelp check in gets you a free dessert with entree. I didn't think the soup and salad would classify but our waitress was awesome and said she surely could do one dessert for our table of three. 

Great place for lunch. Plenty of seating. Starting filling up at noon.
