Hideaway is right.  You either know where it is - intending to arrive there for food - or you'll completely miss it.  Seating is interesting - bar area was full - big copper top table for 8 is open - and you share your meal time and conversation with others sitting at the same table.  Not really a problem, common in other cities - but new-ish to me here.  That aside - great service - and I loved my New Mexican Platter - Tamale, relleno, green burro, rice and beans, with combo green and red chile.  On the spicy/hot side - but expected that knowing the other Richardsons's menus.  All components were solid - but didn't make me stand and shout that I can't wait to go back.  Other diners were less pleased with their meals - one indicated his chicken was rather dry and flavorless... I'll encourage him to write a review.  I'd go back... but there are still a lot of Mexican/New Mexican places I'd like to try first...
