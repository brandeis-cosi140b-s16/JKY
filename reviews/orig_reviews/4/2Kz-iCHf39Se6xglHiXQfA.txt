Love this place!  Great ambience outside, very cozy, live music on weekends. They have a large garden out back you walk in. Has 2 bars so if 1 is busy you can go to the other one to order a drink. Food is good, they also let you order something that's not on the menu as well. Can get real busy in the evening on the weekends. Sometimes service lacks, but overall is a great place!
