This is my favorite salsa in town, right now.  The old adage holds true: the less impressive the architecture, the more impressive the food.  You're not going to impress your boss with this Phoenix gem, but for an afternoon of $3 margaritas, or a BIG plate of flavorful food Via Delosantos can't be beat!
