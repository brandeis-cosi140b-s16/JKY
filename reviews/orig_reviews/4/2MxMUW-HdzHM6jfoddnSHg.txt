Eat here regularly and have for years now.  It's definitely the BEST Mexican food in Phoenix.  Newly remodeled, they've increased the seating capacity greatly.  They've also increased the counter space as well, so 2 people can order at once now.  Their AZ Burrito, smothered with Green Chili sauce, is to die for.  I honestly have NEVER had anything on the menu over the years that I didn't like!  GREAT CHOICE!
