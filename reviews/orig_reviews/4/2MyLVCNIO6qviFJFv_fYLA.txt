This is a bit over-due and ergo hazy....but I remember the chips and salsa were nothing short of AH-MAZING! 

I was in town for Thanksgiving and the man and I made the trek here to meet up with an old high school friend that I hadn't seen in....well, in awhile. 

The food was great and the chips and salsa...did I mention? Ah-mazing! 
We stayed around after they left and moved to the bar but oddly enough after another round or so of drinks and way before the ASU/CAL game was over the place was closing up and like 10or 11ish. Weird! Other than the chips/salsa I don't really have a reason to drive to BFE  (Mom in Surprise, Dad in Fountain Hills and I live out of state) but I really enjoyed the place!
