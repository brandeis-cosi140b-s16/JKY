This place suprised me.   We were waiting for a table at a nearby Sushi place and my wife and spotted this Restaurant.  AMAZING food.  The Guacamole was made at the table, fresh, and tasted great.  The Fiesta Grill was amazing.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Delicious food, fantastic atmosphere.  My wife and I will go back for sure.
