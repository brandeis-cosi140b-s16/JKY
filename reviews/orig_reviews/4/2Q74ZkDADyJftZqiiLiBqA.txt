This was my 3rd visit and the food is always good. The menu has a nice selection of entrees and desserts. The corn on the cob appetizer is always a hit and the salsa is good. One of my favorites meals is the Mexican Cobb salad with shrimp. It's a huge portion and has eggs, beans, bacon, tomato, etc. I also really like the chile relleno.
The music is a little loud but that's not surprising for a Strip restaurant.
