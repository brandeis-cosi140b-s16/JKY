The best tacos in Las Vegas hands down.

There was two of us, we ordered 3 asada and spicy pork taco. It was so good, we ordered 3 more each again right away. When I was ordering the second round, I realized the corn tortilla was fresh made right there. That's why the taco was so good.

Anybody appreciates authentic Mexican food, you have to go there and give it a try.

I gave 4 stars for the high price and not so good service(bad attitudes). The taco is quite small for $2 each, I had to eat 7 to get full.
