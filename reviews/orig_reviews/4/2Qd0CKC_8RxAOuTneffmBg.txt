Taco Tuesday. Probably the best one around. $1.50 for a shredded beef taco and that includes a crispy shell and lots of beef and even sour cream. The tecates are 2 bucks also. The bartender was very friendly and I had the bar to myself at 8:30pm (don't show up at 7pm). Free chips and salsa and the green salsa is the finest in the land.
