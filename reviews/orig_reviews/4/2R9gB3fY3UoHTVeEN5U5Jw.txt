We were referred here by some friends who ate there 3 times in 4 days.

I could not find on their website how they define their food, but it is not your typical Mexican restaurant.  If you are looking for a heavy plate of food smothered in cheese, look elsewhere.

My wife and I have been two weekends in a row and are thoroughly impressed.  We have had the carne tacos, brochetas (skewered steak, shrimp and chicken), chips and salsa, ceviche and a side of pintos.  The wife loved the blended auntie ox and I had a margarita and sampled some of their tequilas in a sipping  glass.

It is pricey, but it is very unique and I assume the rent in the Red Rock does not come cheap.

We're going back and taking friends.
