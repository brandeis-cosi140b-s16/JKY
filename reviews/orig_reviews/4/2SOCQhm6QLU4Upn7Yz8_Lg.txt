Good Mexican food, and really nice restaurant. Lot's to chose from on the menu, but a tad expensive. Not gonna find much under $10 (except appetizers). Most meals are in the $10-$15 range. So if you order two meals and drinks it can quickly add up.

The fresh guacamole is a MUST! They mix it right at your table and it's SO GOOOD. Margarita's are good, but I wish they had a better happy hour.

On Sunday, they do a buffet, which is good, but not spectacular. I would just order a plate from the menu, but the buffet does give a good variety.
