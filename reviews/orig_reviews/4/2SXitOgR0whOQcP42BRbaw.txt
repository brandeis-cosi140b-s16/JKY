Very good authentic Mexican food. I tend to judge authenticity and goodness of Mexican food by a) how much beans, rice, and cheese do they pile on, and b) if I ate nothing but beans and rice, would it be delicious? The answers here are a) plenty and b) yes! I bought a sampler with an enchilada and a taco. The taco was one of those homestyle kind, where they start with a soft tortilla and fry it into shape until it's crispy. The setting is only so-so, it's a narrow dining room with not a lot of variety of seating options. The price was quite reasonable, but not cheap, somewhere around less than $15 after drink and tip for the least expensive but filling sampler lunch on the menu.
