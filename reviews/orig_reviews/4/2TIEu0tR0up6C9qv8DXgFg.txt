Visited 5/18/13........better late than never with a review?! 
Slower service I'm told was because she was checking on my peanut allergy concern.....since I was unemployed at the time, I was not in a rush. Well-rounded menu with items outside of the regular Mexican food restaurant menus....I had grilled chicken two ways: Baja style and Oaxaca style, black bean corn enchiladas, and plenty of yummy chips with salsa. It was a nice day on the patio, except the paper napkins and even a few sugar packets were blowing everywhere and there didn't really seem to be a location protocol for sudden unexpected winds! No problemo - magnifico tasty food, service with a smile!
