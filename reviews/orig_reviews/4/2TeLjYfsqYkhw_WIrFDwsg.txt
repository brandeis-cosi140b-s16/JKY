Very cool little spot! Here visiting from LA and a friend recommended this place a Mexican/Chinese restaurant.  Guy Fieri has been here so figured why not.  Tried the two item combo sweet and sour chicken combo and it was good!!!! My second item was a chile relleno burrito and it came with white rice and beans, great food, good prices....def going to try this place again!
