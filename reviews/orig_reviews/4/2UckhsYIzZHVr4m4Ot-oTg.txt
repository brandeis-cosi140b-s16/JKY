Yesterday was actually my second time at Verde, but my first trip was over a year ago and honestly I barely remember it (and I swear it has nothing to do with the tequila that I presumably consumed).

My friends and I went for happy hour around 5. We split a pitcher of the regular house margarita. Normally it is $2 off a single margarita or $5 off a pitcher to share during happy hour. We initially thought the pitcher would be a better deal, but I'm actually not sure that's the case.

All things aside, the margaritas were tasty. Very fresh and relatively strong, which was a good thing because it was hot out and I had a looong day at work.

We ended up deciding to get some food; we all ordered tacos. On Tuesdays they are 20% off, so that certainly helped sway our decision. I ordered one chorizo and one barbacoa taco. The barbacoa was tender and very flavorful while mildly spicy. The chorizo, on the other hand, was quite spicy and also tasted great. I usually automatically prefer anything spicy, but I think I liked both of these equally and definitely would suggest trying several kinds if ordering multiple tacos.

All in all ,it was a good experience and I'm going to have to make it a point to stop by more often.
