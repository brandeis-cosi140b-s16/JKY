Wanted Mexican food that wouldn't take a long time. We had a show to get to. To be truthful, I thought it was "On the Border".  It was not. 
 We were seated quickly and the waitress was super nice and very helpful. The layout was nice, but from my seat, I was staring out the door to what I think was a patio, lots of sun to blind me, and I didn't see any sun shades. 
 We got the guacome to start. It was very authentic and tasted fresh and delicious. The chips were fresh and had a great flavor. 
 My wife had a Sangria. She thought it was a little watery.  But, not being a drinker, the alcohol snuck up a little. I had a chelada. The lime was a little overwhelming, but good. 
  I ordered the skirt steak. It was seasoned perfect and cooked awesome. I loved it. The mole sauce on side was great.  It came with one giant handmade tortilla. So wonderful. It rocked. 
 My wife had the short rib enchiladas. She said they were good, but did not rave about them. 
 For dessert we got the banana cream pie. Get it. That's all I am saying. It was a little pricey but really good.
