We went to this restaurant feeling dubious.  My mother wanted to eat here, but my husband and I were hesitant as we are vegetarians.  We chose to go ahead and appease her.  We went to the counter and asked the employee what vegetarian options were available.  Not only did he explain all our options, he let us taste everything first.  My husband and I decided to get a chili relleno quesadilla, which was one of the most amazing things I have ever had to eat.  We also got Cuban black bean tostadas and a veggie quesadilla.  The Cuban black beans were out of this world delicious, and the veggie quesadilla was pleasant enough.  Both were served with this amazing ginger cilantro sauce.  It had a weird smell but the flavor was out of this world.  The salsa was also good.  We also got an egg foo yung burrito which was not that great.  But the chili relleno quesadilla was so amazing it made up for the not so good burrito.  In addition, for dessert we got some out of this world cookies.  I had my husband go up to order more chili relleno quesadillas (let me just add that never in my life have I ever enjoyed chili relleno, so this has to say just how fantastic they are that I would want more) but unfortunately they had just run out of chili's.  To make up for it, the nice employee gave us more cookies to take with us!  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  It was delicious and I can't wait for my next trip to Phoenix to eat there again.
