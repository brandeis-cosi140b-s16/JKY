I don't think I would describe this as authentic as much as what Americans expect for a  Mexican restaurant, but it is very 'Fiesta!!!"  in decor, with lots of tile, colors, booths and tables that can be put together for groups and large families.  Chips and sauces/slaw provided.  We've eaten here many times over the years.  Good value.  Portions are huge.  Table side guacamole is good.  Near the airport and a good place to  have a quick meal with friends who have a 2-3 hour layover.
