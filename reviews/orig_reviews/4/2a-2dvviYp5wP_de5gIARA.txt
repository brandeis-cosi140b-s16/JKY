Went there twice this week for Happy Hour. Once to the Chandler location and once to the Scottsdale Mall location. I've eaten at both locations a few times over the past year as well.

Food: Very good. Always good flavor with being gratuitously spicy. Mushroom enchiladas are my favorite meal. I've tasted EVERY appetizer and they are all very satisfying. Good portion size for an app, which makes the happy hour prices all the more attractive! 

Drinks: Happy Hour Drink prices are quite high compared to other HH's. Otherwise, I guess they're pretty much in line. The Chambourd Frozen Margarita is delish!

Service: Never had a bad experience with the wait staff. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Seem to be perfectly okay with their tables ordering off the HH menu (some servers don't like the small tabs and it's reflected in their performance). Like I said, not a problem here (IME).

So this place always was one of our favorites and will continue to be until something changes.
