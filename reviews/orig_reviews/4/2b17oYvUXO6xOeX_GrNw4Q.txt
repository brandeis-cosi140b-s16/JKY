Great place for Happy Hour! The downstairs bar is very dim and the ambiance with the copper bar and fireplace is so cozy. It gets a little warm if you are sitting at the bar across from the fireplace, but this is also probably the brightest spot in the room so you can actually read the menu.  :p 

I had the house Chardonnay and bf had the house cab for $5. We tried the tenderloin toasts, beef skewers, carne tacos, and bacon wrapped scallops and they were all good. I enjoyed a couple of the dipping sauces that came with the scallops and skewers (the same 4 sauces came with both) and the 5 different toppings on the small tacos. 

We were stuffed when we left. We will definitely be back.
