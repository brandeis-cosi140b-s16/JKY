Blink and you'll miss it.

North side of Indian School, just to the west of 36th St. I've driven by a couple of times and you'd be forgiven for not noticing it. Mainly due to the 'outdoor area' being near to the road and, for privacy and noise reduction, is protected by blue and grey wooden wall.

First visit today, clean interior, friendly staff, and a refreshingly simple menu. Ordered a short rib taco, fries, and a coke - in a bottle! I know, right? I sat in the outdoor area, and the noise wasn't bad at all (it was around 3:30pm on a Saturday). Food arrived in reasonable time, not too long to have me wondering if they'd forgotten me, and not too quick to have me thinking I was in a McD's.

Very tasty taco, fries that reminded me of Smash-burger (in a good way), and thoughtful presentation. A big step up from a hole in the wall. I hope they make it. Probably back tonight to try the chicken taco.

My advice: don't blink.
