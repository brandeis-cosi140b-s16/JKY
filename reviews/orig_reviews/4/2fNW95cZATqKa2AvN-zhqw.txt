The Good:
- Very, very good Mexican food. It is absolutely delicious. Though I haven't tried a majority of the food, the chicken and pastor taco mexicas are delicious. The nachos are also very good!
- Complimentary chips and salsa! They give two types of salsa, one mild and one hot. 
- Most importantly, the food is very fresh! It's always made to order, and comes out hot!
- It is very price conscious also!

The Bad:
- It is very, very small. Maybe fifteen seats available at the most, and unless you time it perfectly, you probably won't get a seat. However, they do have take out available, if that option works for you.

Overall:
Very good Mexican food at a good price. My S.O. and I have been here numerous times, and will certainly be back again.
