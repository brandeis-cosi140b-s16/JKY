Surprised at the 3 star rating. 

Came with my family and we all enjoyed our lunch. 

Everyone opted for the Fajitas Bar Lunch Special for $10.99 11 am - 2 pm (I think). It was pretty much an all-you-can-eat buffet with fajitas made to order, hard ground beef tacos, enchiladas and soups like pasodo (sp?). All tasted good to me. 

I would definately come back.
