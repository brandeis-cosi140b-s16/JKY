First time I tried Taco y Taco,  I had two shrimp tacos W/ guacamole... I was pleasantly surprised. Chips and salsa too!

The food was fresh and the restaurant was clean!  Please keep it that way!......... And I will be back.

 Do you have a menu online?   Or do I have to wing it whenever I wonder in there?
