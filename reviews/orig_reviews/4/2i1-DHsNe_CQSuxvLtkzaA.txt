Stopped in for lunch at Otro today and was very impressed!  We started with the chips and salsa and my friend had the Elote Callejero, which is a corn on the cob dressed in mayo and cheese.  For my entree, I had the Inca Salad with added grilled chicken.  It was delicious and there were so many flavors happening in the salad.  It was very refreshing!  There was actually too much chicken for my taste probably and I would have enjoyed more of the quinoa in the salad.  My friend had the carne asada torta, which she really liked as well.  We both ended up taking half of our huge lunch portions home.  Both of agreed we would be back!
