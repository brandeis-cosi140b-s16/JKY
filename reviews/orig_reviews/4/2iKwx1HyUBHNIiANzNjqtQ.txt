The grand opening week was the first time we visited - tacos with a minuscule amount of meat - but things have much improved.  I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny -jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife.  It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving.  Very cool decor inside and a nice big bar.
