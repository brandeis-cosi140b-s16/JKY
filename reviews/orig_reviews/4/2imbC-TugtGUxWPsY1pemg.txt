Fast friendly service with quick refills on the excellent chips and fire roasted salsa. Had the Caesar as a side salad to entree; very average. The stacked enchiladas with shredded beef with fried egg on top with rice & beans was very good. So was the chile relleno. Overall great service and very good food. It is not gourmet but much better than average.
