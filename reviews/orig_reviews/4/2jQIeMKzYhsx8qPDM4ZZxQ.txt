Lines are ridiculous.  You will have to wait no matter what.  It gets confusing which lines are for what when you're in the mix. 

I don't remember which meat is the one that I always get.  I think it might be pastor.  One of my friends mentioned that it tastes like char siu, and I think it kinda does.  But anyway, tacos here are delicious and flavorful.  Don't forget to ask for pineapple and them green onions. 

And the strawberry bang here is awesome.  My first time ever having any "bang" related beverage was here and I really enjoyed it.
