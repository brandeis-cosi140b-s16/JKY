Had to give PHX Burrito House a shot since there's a lot of good hype about it. Gave it a whirl yesterday and I have to say it's actually really really good. I got the carne asada burrito with guacamole. Yeah, it was bomb. Those flour tortillas were nice and chewy, just how I like em. Loved the "Loteria" decor as well. I'll be coming to this place more often for some burritos. Next I'll have to try the tacos!
