The food was very good and different.  We started with the guacamole which was very good and tasted fresh.  For dinner, I ordered the Pollo Relleno which was absolutely delightful. A chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, corn and goat cheese, surrounded by a poblano cream sauce. The mashed potatoes were unique and had a bit of a kick (in a good way) they were guajilo mashed potatoes and the accompanying vegetables were delicious.

For dessert we had the flan which was a bit rich, but still very good. 

We went on a Saturday evening around 7:30p, the place had a couple private parties going on but we opted to sit in the bar area, as it had quite a bit more atmosphere than the dining areas.  Parking was tight, but it looks like they are now using the available lot in the back which provided a ton more additional parking.
