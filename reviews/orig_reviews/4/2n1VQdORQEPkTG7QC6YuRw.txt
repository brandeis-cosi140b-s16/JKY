I love the space, it has a very clever mix of retro and contemporary. From the case of $2 Chocolate Tacos to the canvas of Frida Kalo, the neon sign on the wall that says "there is no place like Mexico" and the left green old school refrigerator stocked with glass bottles of refriscos and coca cola.

First off, their happy hour from 3-6 is unbelievable.  All appetizers  are half  off, so you can enjoy  their very famous and delectable Brussels sprout nachos and coconut lemongrass ceviche for half the price. Wash that  down with the Diego margarita for only $4 (lime, triple sec, simple syrup, house tequila) and your tab for two is $21 during happy hour.

Roasted garlic beet cream is to die for. The Habanero oil is a must try and adds subtle heat but buttery delicious flavor.

Lemongrass coconut  ceviche is an incredible summer appetizer. Perfect blend of crunchy fresh shrimp, paired with flavors of coconut and lemongrass, and little bit of heat from Fresno chili.

The street corn queso makes the nachos, and there just isn't anything I don't love here.

Finish the night at the 'Treat Bar', which has ice cream, Churro fries, chocolate ice cream and chocolate tacos.

Love love love!
