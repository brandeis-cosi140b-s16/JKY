Our second dinner in Vegas led us to this little gem stashed away in the back corner of "Times Square."

The atmosphere definitely screams "Chevy's Tex-Mex" which isn't a bad thing, I love Chevy's, but may be off-putting to those that are seeking something more authentic.

After reviewing the options I settled on a two-item consisting of a chicken taco and a chile relleno, and after a short wait, they arrived.

The food was excellent. In fact, the chicken taco was probably among the best I've had at a sit-down Mexican restaurant. The chile relleno was also excellent, though the breading was a bit on the heavy side. The cheese inside was fantastic and the rice and beans that accompanied the two were good as well.

I left a very happy, full gringo that night.
