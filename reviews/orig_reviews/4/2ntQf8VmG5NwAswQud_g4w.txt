Just about everything was overpriced except for my favorite dish- Filet de mi Tita! I've been to BC at least five or six times and I seldom wander from this dish. It's a must have! 

The Horchata and agua de Tamarindo is smooth and cold. At least half the time, they've run out so better get there a little early.
