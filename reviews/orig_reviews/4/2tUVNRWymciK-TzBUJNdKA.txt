Just stopped here for dinner based on other recommendations, and they were not wrong. Cute place, friendly staff and great food, plus the next horchata we've had anywhere. The salsas and bean dip were really tasty. The enchiladas trio plate was very good, as were the bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed wax chiles. Definitely would eat here again.
