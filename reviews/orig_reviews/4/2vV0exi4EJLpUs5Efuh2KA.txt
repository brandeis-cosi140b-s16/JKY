This place is great!  I enjoyed the flavor of every meal on the table. Probably the best guacamole I have ever had. The only thing I will complain about is the price for what you get. It's very high for the quantity of food.  If that does not phase you then by all means this is a great place. Try the ghost pepper sauce!
