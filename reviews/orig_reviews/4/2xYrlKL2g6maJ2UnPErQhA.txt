The first seat they gave us was far in the back and by the LOUDEST bunch of 20 year old something's. Just as we sat down, they placed chips and salsa on our table. I couldn't even hear my friend from across the table it was so loud near these people, so I requested a different spot. The waitress came back and transferred us in the front where it was a lot better. They brought us more chips and salsa lol

They have a lot to choice food on the menu, and the prices were reasonable. The food didn't take long, and it was a big size meal. It was very good, but I couldn't even finish half of the plate it was so much. DOGGIE BAG lol.
