We love the downtown location and only recently got to check out the version at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.

Same good food but at the airport (just before you leave town) is a good thing! Better than any airport food I've had outside of microbreweries in the Portland airport, good margaritas, and fantastic guacamole. If you are on a lay over in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor without a chance to check out Phoenix, at least get lunch or dinner here.
