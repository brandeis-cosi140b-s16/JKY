Skipped the Irish Pub to try out this Cantina.. totally glad I did.  Maybe it was the random rowdy group that stumbled in from Dick's... but I think it was the the Mariachi Band that was awesome as they put an ethnic spin on Bar Classic Jams (Neil Diamond to Pink Floyd?!).  They definitely got the whole place singing and literally stopped the passerby's from walking by and sucked 'em into a spot at the bar to join in on the fun.  

Have the sopes to start and a pitcher or two of Margaritas!
