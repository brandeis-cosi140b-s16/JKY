Went there last Sunday for lunch. Staff was super nice.  Had skinny chencho fries and they were really good.  Imagine McDonald's fries covered in warm salsa verde and gooey melted cheese.  They got soggy real fast but I scarfed em' down so quick it didn't matter.  Also got a small cheese pizza which was aight I guess....it was real soft.  And husband got an Avocado cheese burger which I took a bite of and I liked it a lot.  Minus one star cuz' I had Montezuma's revenge later that day.  TMI?
