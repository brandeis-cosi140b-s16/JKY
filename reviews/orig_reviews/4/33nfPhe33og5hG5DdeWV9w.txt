Tried their new store at 3140 S. Gilbert Road...very hard to find (no frontage, no signage, no street visibility) but well worth it!  Excellent carne asada.  My wife loves their signature "FRY BREAD"  which is a meal and a half.  Love their use of green chili in a number of dishes.

We've been back twice since discovering the place last month and plan to be regulars at this new location.
