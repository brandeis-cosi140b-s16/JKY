Finally! I finally made it into Gallo Blanco. First of all, loved the new space. The expansion of the restaurant into the lobby of the hotel provided more room. Let me point out, its been on my list for awhile, but Phoenix Magazine's cover made it down right mouth watering.

Must haves:
Guacamole: Made fresh to order. The addition of orange slices was quite nice, and I would definitely order it again.

Shrimp tacos: By far, my favorite of all taco's sampled. 

I have to admit, I did fill up on Guac, so I could only taste the other taco's. Next time, I have to save room for my meal :) 

The price was fantastic. Great Value.
