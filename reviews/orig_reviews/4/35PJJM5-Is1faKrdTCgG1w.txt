This is my go-to place for quick breakfast burritos. I either get the standard with eggs, ham, cheese and pico or the machaca with shredded beef, eggs, and cheese. Both come with sides of red or green sauce. The tortillas have a nice texture and all of the ingredients are cooked together for an overall great distribution of egg:cheese:meat. They'll even toss potatoes in the mix if you ask. 

Watch out because these burritos are hot and tend to leak just a tad. They're big too, so you only need one. Check these guys out next time you're sobering up from a long night or if you're craving one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. 

They offer drive-thru and sit down. If you eat inside, they have a small salsa bar.
