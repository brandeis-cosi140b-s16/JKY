I used to frequent the Wahoos on Oahu so when I saw they opened one here I had to try. It's pretty much the same...some differences though like healthy options, a full bar and gambling haha. But the customer service is awesome here! In the time it took me to eat my two tacos I was asked multiple times by different staff members if I needed anything and the manager touched all the tables! Nice. Love great service. And they have wi-fi.
