We tried this spot last night for dinner. First impressions were not good. The lighting is horrible. The restaurant layout is over crowded and the lack of ambience is just sad. Now with all of that said, the food was delicious! The salsa bar was a lot of fun. We enjoyed trying several types of salsa while we waited for our food. Unfortunately, the waiter did not put our two courses in properly, so after waiting an hour, everything came at once. This was only after we asked about it. The waitress apologized and did comp our beverages. We are our entrees and wrapped up the first course to eat the next day. We will try it again and hopefully they won't be as busy or their kitchen will have their act together.
