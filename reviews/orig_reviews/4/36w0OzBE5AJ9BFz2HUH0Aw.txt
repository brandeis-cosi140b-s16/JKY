Lengua tacos! Those lengua tacos are what they're known for and I seriously have been daydreaming of them ever since my first visit...

I arrived here around 10 pm and there were TONS of people waiting in line to order. The place was pretty chaotic and it was pretty confusing at first knowing where to line up. I guess there were certain lines for each type of meat, but it really doesn't matter because the cooks all communicate with each other anyway.

So I had their lengua tacos, buche tacos, and their campechana (half carne asada/half lengua) fries and it was just heaven on a platter! Probably the priciest hole in the wall mexican joint I've been to, but the quality is there!

Don't forget to ask for the sauces at the checkout counter. I found that the fries were on the dry side and the sauces made a huge difference in the taste. 

I would highly recommend anyone in Vegas to go here and try it out. I already know that I'm stopping here every time I'm in the city from now on. They just need to open one in LA now.
