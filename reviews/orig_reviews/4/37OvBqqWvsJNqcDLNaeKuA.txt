I have been to Blanco many times for lunch and dinner.  The ambience is super nice... interior decor and openness... the patio super for snacks and drinks with friends during the "good " months in Arizona.

One of my favorites is the tortilla soup.  They have changed it up over the past years.. it is less brothy now.  It is very tasty and yummy. 
They now have a fun little lunch menu with smaller $3 portions so now you can order a few things from the menu and try a lot of them.  We also had a couple of the tacos and they were delish.

Did I mention the waitresses are super friendly and helpful.... and keep the drinks fresh and coming.  And ... as a side note... the hostesses wear the cutest little dark blue  skirts that are easy on the eyes. :)
