A couple of co-workers and I ventured out to the "Barrio" this afternoon for lunch.  If you do plan to go for your lunch hour, carpool with co-workers because parking is very limited and plan for an extended lunch because you very well might spend over an hour here. We showed up at noon, not packed at all, however, our service was very slow. The time it took our server to take our order, deliver our food and drop our check seemed way too long. The seating is uncomfortable and may be a little crowded for those with space issues. 

However, the food is great! If you're one to overlook the aforementioned cons, then you will love the Barrio hands down! In lieu of chips and salsa, you will be served bread and tapenade. Try the Guacamole, made fresh upon order and is served with tostada chips. This Gauc is really good!!!!  I had the Torta de Pollo - grilled chicken breast served on a warm pannini style bread and slathered with great flavors. But wait! Don't stop there.. You have got to leave room for  Postres! OMG!!!!! The Churros Rellenos KICK!!!! These are not to be confused with the Churros you may have had at Disney Land. These Churros are served with warm caramel sauce, vanilla bean ice cream and candied walnuts. It is a crime to not have these fritters.  

I struggled giving 5 stars because of the lack of parking, slow service, and uncomfortable seating. However, This will not stop me from making another trip to the Barrio.    See you there!
