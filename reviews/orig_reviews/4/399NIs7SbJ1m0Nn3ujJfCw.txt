This is a fun place to eat, drink and rest your feet after a full day of trekking around the Vegas shops.  Located in The Venetian, this restaurant has patio seating on the "Grand Canal."    The margaritas were lip-smacking good and my Tres Fish Tacos ($13) was excellent.  They happily take reservations.  The service was excellent and the waiter was quite happy to put up with a bunch of questions and joking from me and The Girls.  Overall, good food at a decent price for Vegas, right in the heart of the Venetian.
