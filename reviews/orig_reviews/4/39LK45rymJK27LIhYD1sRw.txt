This is my brother's favorite place to go when he visits Phoenix.  So on the latest trip, we had to go again (my first time).  The misting was a little weird to me, but hey it's hot in Phoenix...even in September.  Our waitress was really great.  They have good drink prices, especially when they have specials going on.  Their cooling system leaks a bit, so water kept dripping on me.  But we just moved down to the other end of the bench.  Great place for big groups.

Now on to the food.
I ordered the taco salad with carne asada.  It was really good.  How exciting that it even came with guac on it.  Yum.  I couldn't even finish the whole thing...my brother had to polish it off for me.

My brother ordered the Supercheeseygooeychimichanga, the same thing he gets each time.  He let me taste it.  I was not impressed.  Glad I chose the taco salad.
