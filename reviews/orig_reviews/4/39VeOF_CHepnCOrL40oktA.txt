This was the first dinner we had on a recent trip to Charlotte to visit friends. Cantina 1511 was recommended by my friend's coworker so none of us really knew what to expect. The food was much more high end compared to what I was expecting, so if you're looking for a good ol' messy cheese covered burrito, this probably isn't the place to go. They had a really good looking list of tacos, but I ended up trying the crab quesadilla. Per the recommendation of the waiter, I added shrimp. The server told us the chef was a great seafood cook...no disagreements here, I loved it! Very different, but if you like seafood, it's a solid meal. 

Honestly, there were a lot more items on the menu that sounded amazing and I would've loved to try, but the prices were really steep. We chose to split a picture of the blue margarita and honestly, it was nothing special. When the servers (not our waiter) brought the food out, he spilled my boyfriend's drink all over him. The owner and our waiter apologized, comped his meal, and brought two fresh drinks over on the house. We compared the two side by side, and the new drinks definitely had a little/lot of extra love (and by love I mean tequila).  If you're going to drink here, skip the pitcher and go with the individual drinks.  

I can't say enough good things about our waiter we had there. He also mentioned that during the summer he plays music out on the patio, so if you like live music, definitely come by in the summer to check it out. All in all: great place, awesome food and service, not the best drinks in the world.
