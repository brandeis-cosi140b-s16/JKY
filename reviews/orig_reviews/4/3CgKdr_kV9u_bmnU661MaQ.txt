A friend told me about Rito's, referring to it as reminiscent of Seinfeld's "The Soup Nazi" place.  Okay, so there is no surly Eastern European dude barking at you, but it does have the whole waiting in a long line, preparing a head of time what you'll order, and leaving with a delicious meal feeling.  

Yes, this place is busy. Depending on when you go, there may be a line outside the building, and a tedious wait.  But all of that is in comparison to the heartbreaking, taste-bud savoring meal you will have.

I've had their infamous green chile burro and their just as famous (I think everything on the menu is famously good) bean burro.  And, of course, both have been enchilada style.  I can't even imagine not having their complexly flavored sauce smothered all over my burros. My next menu try?  Well, they aren't even on the menu, but their tacos.  I guess you just have to ask for them, and if they made them that day, you can claim it to be your lucky day. 

The portions are huge and the prices are small.  A great business model, in my opinion!  And, I'm sure one of the many reasons why people keep coming back to Rito's. I know I will be!
