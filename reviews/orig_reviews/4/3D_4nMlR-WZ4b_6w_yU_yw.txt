I'm basing this review only on the lime shrimp salad because it's all I ever get! I freaking love this salad.  Plenty of avocado, crunchy jicama, sweet mango chunks, and the most wonderful garlicky shrimp you've ever had. It's one of my favorite salads in Charlotte! I also really like the salsa they serve with the chips. It's got a great flavor and isn't watery like so many Mexican restaurants serve.  

I just had lunch here and our server overheard my friend and I talking about her birthday. She treated us to a piece of Banana Tres Leches cake "roasted banana tres leches with Mexican coffee cr√®me anglaise". I really am a sucker for tres leches but I am also very critical of it. Once you have a good one, it's hard to beat. This is not your everyday tres leches. The banana flavor is not overpowering, but is just enough to get that flavor.  The whipped cream on top had a nutmeg flavor that was so warm and delicious.  I mean, I want to go back and get another piece! It's a MUST try.
