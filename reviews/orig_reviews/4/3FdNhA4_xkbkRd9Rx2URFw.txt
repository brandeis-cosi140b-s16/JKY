What a Great Surprise!: At the suggestion of some friends, we met them at Carlsbad Tavern for dinner and drinks. I had driven by the place hundreds of times, but never thought much of it. I was quite surprised by the nice atmosphere (including a "moat") and wonderful food. I will definitely be back.

P.S. When they warn you the habanero burger is hot, heed their warning!!!
