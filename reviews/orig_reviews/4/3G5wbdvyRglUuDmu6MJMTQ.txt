I have never been to Chuy's but I've driven by this restaurant countless times because I used to work nearby. And Mexican food hasn't always set well with me. I really wanted to break out of my usual comfort zone, and my Girlfriend said I would love this place so, Why not?...

Parking is a little difficult because there are a number of shops and other popular restaurants there, but fortunately there was no wait to be seated. At first we were seated inside, but it was a little Chil√© inside (no pun intended), so we asked to move to the outdoor seating patio. Certainly glad we did, the weather was amazing and the fans surrounding the place kept a nice breeze going for you and kept flies away, plus the table umbrella blocked those rays of sunshine. 

Our waiter cane to the table and introduced himself almost immediately and took our drink orders. Candyce B. mentioned the queso and said it was worth it so we tried it... man was she ever right. The queso had a little kick to it like I expected, since it was a Mexican restaurant, and I loved it. I pretty much stuffed myself with tortilla chips and queso. 

Then because it was my first time visiting, we had a choice to try all for their signature sauces. All of them were great and each one unique in their own way. As for my appetizer I had the custom enchiladas, which came with 2 enchiladas and your choice of sauce to smother them with. It was great but I couldn't finish it because I ate way too much queso and chips. 

Service was excellent and out waiter "Fred" was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. He knew the names and flavors of all of the sauces and kept our experience full of laughter. This restaurant and expeeience completely changed my opinion of Mexican food and I can't wait to try it again. Overall this restaurant gets a 4.0 out of 5.0.
