Great food - i usually go for their carne asada burrito. Its usually on point (love their tortillas) but wish they would mix ingredients a bit more as I end up with bites of only guac or only meat. Staff is super friendly but any hint of it getting busy and the food will take forever to come out. Despite their few flaws it's a great spot.
