This restaurant in TI is absolutely wonderful. The food tastes very fresh and the guacomole was so delicious we couldn't stop eating it! I had the Chicken Enchiladas Divorciadas and it was presented beautifully and tasted even better with 2 kinds of sauces, both equally flavored uniquely, one green, one red. We felt the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and the wonderful service. My husband always gets mole sauce and he said that altho it was good, he looks for a "hotter" mole than what he had here. We both loved the rice and the refried beans, again both sides tasted very fresh, much better than what is normally slapped onto a plate in our local mexican restaurant. A very nice dinner well worth the price!
