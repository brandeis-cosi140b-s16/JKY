Located in the Clarendon Hotel, Gallo Blanco is a urban, upscale, fresh eatery that I am pleased to have the opportunity to try. The menu consists of fresh local ingredients, in simple, but unique dishes that have their own personality. I was impressed with the service, as my water was never empty or any need ignored. I ordered a breakfast sampler and for my wheat toast I asked for some jam. The server brought out a yummy orange marmalade that was no doubt homemade. I could compare this style of food to Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, which also has a really great reputation. Must try Gallo Blanco!
