Had lunch here today and loved it. The whole place is cool with a huge patio. 

We started with chips and salsa with table side hand made guac. My wife had a fish taco and a chicken taco. She LOVED the fish. I had three tacos, carnitas, chili relleno, and carne asada. All three were great. Definitely going back.
