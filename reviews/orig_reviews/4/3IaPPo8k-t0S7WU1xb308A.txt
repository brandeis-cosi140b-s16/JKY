For the true critic's and I first weekend living in Phoenix, this was a great way to start our time in the Southwest.  The happy hour was first rate.  Dark, Cool, Excellent Vibe, and Great Drinks.......what more can you expect in a southwestern bar!

The critic enjoyed the Chile Rellanos, which were spicy and delicious.  Her plate was very generous for the cost.  I sampled the Pork Tomalles with the Green and Red Sauce.  This was great, the green sauce was excellent, but the red was a bit spicy for my taste.  The service was top notch through out.  And treat yourself to the margarita......you will not be disappointed.

The $5 plates for happy hour are a good deal, definately time your trip for this.    Between the terrific atmosphere and the excellent happy hours, this will be a preferred watering hole on many occations.
