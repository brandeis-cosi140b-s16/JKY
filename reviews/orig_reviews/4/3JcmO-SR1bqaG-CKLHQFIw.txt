This is old-school Sonoran food. It's good! Hot sauce, chips, guacamole (though I think it has sour cream in it), enchilada sauce (both green and red), tacos, crispy cheese crisps, tasty medium-heat green chiles -- all good! 

The only item that was lesser to my taste was the chile relleno, though the red tomato sauce on it was delicious.

Give it a shot. There's a reason why this restaurant has been successful for so long.
