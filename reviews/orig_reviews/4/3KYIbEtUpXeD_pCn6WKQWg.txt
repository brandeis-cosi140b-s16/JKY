I was just passing through Phoenix when a local retailer mentioned to try this place out. We came in to be greeted nicely and seated quickly. A somewhat trendy taco bar with lots of different flavors on the menu like the blood orange margarita and some interesting salsas.

We had the queso which was pretty good but since I had just left Austin it wasn't up to the standard of which I had before, still we devoured it since we're from LA and can't even get mediocre queso.. We had a trio of taco plates in which I had chicken and carne asada, my girlfriend tried the fish (which she sent back because it was too fishy) and another suggestion from the waiter which were both amazing.

Ambience was nice for a Tuesday evening and we got served fairly quickly. I would definitely say to come give a try but it's a little too fancy for my liking. I enjoyed the food but I am such a nut for legit street food and taking the gamble on what I get. I would still go here for their great food and polite staff though.
