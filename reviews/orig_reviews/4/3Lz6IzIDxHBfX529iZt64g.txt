These tacos are huge so the price makes sense. I was confused at first because I have never paid so much for a taco but darn these are good. I wish the hot salsa was more spicy but that is my only complaint.

I got togo and they hooked me up on chips and salsa as well. 

Cool trendy little spot.

You must try the grits! They were awesome!
