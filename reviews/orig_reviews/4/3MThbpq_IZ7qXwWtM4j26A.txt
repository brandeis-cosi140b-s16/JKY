After reading reviews, I went to Taco Haus with medium expectations; however, I was quite happy with the results. The service was terrific and the food was very good. 

I enjoyed the raw jicama salad as well as the rice (I requested it with butter), guacamole, veggie taco (I requested it with butter instead of veggie oil), and the pork belly taco was pretty good. My special diet requests which were taken care of with ease and that made me extra pleased. 

Taco Haus sources local ingredients with what seems to be mostly organic. That alone will bring me back again. Their meat is hormone free, but if it were also grass fed, they'd get that much more of my business.
