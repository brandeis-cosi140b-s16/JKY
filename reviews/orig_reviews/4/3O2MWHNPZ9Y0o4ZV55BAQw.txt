We are in Scottsdale for the night and asked the hotel clerk at the reception desk to recommend a good and close Mexican restaurant.  He told us about Los Olivos and we were not disappointed that we followed his advice.  The restaurant is family-owned and operated and, according to the clerk, a local favorite.  The first thing I noticed was the charming structure and unique architecture character and design of the restaurant.  The atmosphere, complete with live mariachi band, lends itself to a delightful dining experience.  The salsa is AMAZING!  It was really so good, I wanted to take some home with me to pour over chicken, eggs, taco salads, etc.   The fish tacos were truly the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the appetizer sampler which turned out to be not great, so I would pass on that.
