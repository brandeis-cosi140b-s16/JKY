I was in this place for lunch today and had the chicken fajitas. They were great. But what really impressed me was my server, Fernando. He was did an excellent job on all levels. Greeted me warmly and promptly, served me promptly, used my name and told me about the lunch card and brought it to the table. (Which I hadn't known about) after 5 lunches the 6th is free. I would definitely return!!
