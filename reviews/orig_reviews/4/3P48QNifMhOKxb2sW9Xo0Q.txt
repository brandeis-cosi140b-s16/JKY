I have been here for lunch a few times, but recently my wife & I went here for dinner.  Have to say the service and food were very good.  Both of us really enjoyed ourselves.  Even though we didn't step up to the #3 pepper" meals, our food was plenty spicy. 

Huge menu and great looking deserts too.  Give it try, you won't be disappointed.
