Popped in for lunch today before heading over to see the A's Spring Training game.  Best mex food I've had for some time, but then its been 30+ years since we lived in LA.  Server was prompt, bi-lingual, attentive, and knew the menu (my wife is allergic to onions).

All in all, it was just what we were looking for... not fancy, not a take out burrito place, just decent eats.  Good for our Sat. early lunch. Didn't have a margarita.
