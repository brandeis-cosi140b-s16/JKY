I have only been here for lunch or dinner for myself, I live locally so I would rather go here than any other burrito place, I'm not a fa of Chipotle or any other fast food burrito place, but I really like there place. Only downfall is they seem to take forever to make food, but there always so busy it makes up for me waiting. I would recommend friends and family here, I haven't tried there breakfast. Love there taco tuesdays for lunch, and there burritos for dinner.
