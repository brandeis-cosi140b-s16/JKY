We came here during a "First Friday" trying to get away from the crowds but this place was also very crowded! We were seated in 5 minutes so it wasn't an issue. It's very festive in decor with Frida Kahlo pictures adorning the walls.

I started off by ordering a lemonade.  I thought it was going to be lemonade from a fountain dispenser but it was freshly squeezed! It was a foamy lemon/lime concoction. It was delicious but no free refills so I settled on one. I also saw people drinking out of a pineapple. It looked refreshing but I didn't know what it was. 

I had the beef flautas which to me is like a rolled taco. It came with rice and beans. I forgot to tell them to hold the beans. It was good but my brother ordered the carne asada torta which tasted better. I told him he can have some of my flautas if he gave me some of his torta. The bread looked home made because the top looked bubbly. It isn't flat like the ones you would get at Robertos. My husband must have loved the Carne asada burrito because he was finished so fast!

It is a busy place so don't expect your food to come out right away. It was also noisy because there were lots of groups just having a fun time! It's a nice place to gather with friends and family.
