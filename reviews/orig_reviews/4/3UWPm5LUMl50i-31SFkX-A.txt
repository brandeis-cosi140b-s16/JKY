I love their chips and salsa.  Both types are pretty good, though I'm always partial to the one that's more like pico de gallo.  They come free when you sit down which is something I always look for and appreciate.  :)

Their tortilla soup is pretty good, though it looks a bit oily and the chips get soggy pretty fast.  Their tacos are ok, although they're right there with julioberto's which are $1 mon-wed.  I usually don't like refried beans but I'll eat theirs.  I love their fish tacos and the cucumber sauce that they come with.

All in all, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  The prices for their entrees are kind of hefty, but I like their bar atmosphere once in a while and their food is pretty good.  I go here when I feel like La Pinatas but don't feel like driving over there.
