My mom insisted on this being her first stop when she arrived in Phoenix. She saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and she loved the concept. So off we went. It does look like a dive, but it was clean and that is what matters the most. The young lady behind the counter was the most patient woman ever and let us try just about everything so that we could make up our minds as to what we wanted. I have no idea what they put in those refried beans, but baby they are some good eats. I could have had a bowl of that with the jerk fried rice and I would have been happy. My mom wanted a little bit of it all, so ordered a carnita burrito, jade chicken, beans, and jerk fried rice. I kept it simple with just the jerk fried rice and the jerk chicken. (Hey I was already full from all the samples, don't judge me) Everything was so good. We had left overs the for lunch the next day. Mom was extremely pleased and needless to say that on her next visit, we will be back again!
