Excellent, just plain excellent.  Showed up with reservations with a large group (8) on a Thursday night.

We were on a mission that night and had been sampling food all over Charlotte, and Cantina was the last stop.  We ordered the tableside Guacamole which was to die for.  Our server whipped it right up and it tasted perfect.  One thing however, we ordered 2 tableside guacamole's and they only prepared 1 tableside.  The other was just brought to us from the kitchen.  Not sure what's up with that.

The Barbacoa was a crowd favorite, I have had this at the other location and it has been on point every time.  Duck Taco's, again a work of art.  3 on a plate and they did not disappoint.  I would highly recommend any of these dishes.

Cantina is Tex Mex at it's finest.  Great location, great service, great food......roll credits.
