usually, just thinking about drinking a margarita gives me heartburn. that canned sweet-n-sour mix or whatever sucks big time. im glad to report, the margaritas here are the shiznit! they come in a really small glass but are super tasty, strong and cheap (during happy hour).

the salsa bar is good but all of their salsas are pretty hot. usually the salsa verde is not hot only tasty, but here it is one of the hottest ones. i figured out the radishes help distill the heat afterwords, though, fyi.

the mahi tacos are rather bland, but the others are good. i also like how they have melted cheese in between the two tortillas. gf said the shrimp tacos are delish - ill have to try those next time.
