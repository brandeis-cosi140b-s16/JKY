As real as Mexican gets in Pittsburgh. Smaller menu but everything was delicious and nicely priced. I had the chili rellanos and it was very authentic and unique at the same time. Big, egg-battered, mildly spicy(either Anaheim or Poblano) pepper with some queso fresco refried beans and tortilla chip. The lady had the chicken tacos and they were very good too IMO.
