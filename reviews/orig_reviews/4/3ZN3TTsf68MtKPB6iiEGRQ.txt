A pleasant surprise/ Pre-show dinner with my girl and my sis. 

The drink highlight - the pineapple chipotle Margarita 

The chips and salsa - that's some damn tasty salsa and gee, they don't charge - i thought i heard they charged for the chips/salsa. 

The guac we ordered was ok. 

The girls had mini -  tostadas - blue crab for my girl, sis had the tuna both ok 

I went with the carnitas platter - very good and the habenero sauce - excellent - glad i ordered the pacifico to go with the carnitas because my mouth was burnin' ! 

total bill including 3 mixed drinks and the beer, $102 - i can live with that !
