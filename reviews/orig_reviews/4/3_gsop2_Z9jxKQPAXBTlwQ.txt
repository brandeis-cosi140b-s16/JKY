Stopped by here after walking through the Cactus Garden holiday lights at Ethel M chocolate factory since it was only a few minutes away.

The food is really good and I LOVE their extensive salsa bar / station. They have that amazing creamy green sauce that I've only seen at Pio Pio in NYC before this. Soo good! I literally drowned my food in it lol I would come back just for this salsa bar. the Pico was fresh & the variety of hot sauces was heavenly for a spicy lover like myself.

We got fish tacos + a shrimp enchilada entree to share and everything was delicious! The seafood was fresh and seasoned well. Great flavor overall. Prices are decent--not expensive but not really cheap either. $2.25 for the fish tacos and I believe $10.99 for the shrimp enchilada entree that was served with rice + beans.
