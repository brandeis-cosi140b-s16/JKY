$2 for tacos (except lengua which is $2.25) pretty standard pricing for better-quality tacos throughout the west, and these are good ones. Considering strip inflation right in this area the pricing is really pretty good espc. considering how good the food is. 

Ordering is a bit grabastic at first until you see how the system works. There's like 5 or 6 different grill stations that each specialize in certain meats, with a sign up over each indicating which are which. You go to the ones you want and order the items you want. You can combine orders at one station too if they're neighbors with the other meat you want. Then once you get the food you take it to one of the registers and they ring you up.
