I was here with twenty something ladies for a bachelorette party. We were planning on going to another establishment but they called us THAT DAY and said that they were no longer in business and we'd have to move our party somewhere else. We called this place in a panic and they were able to take care of us last minute. Ding +1

The staff was competent, efficient and didn't mind how loud and drunk we were being. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. For an appetizer they brought out this delicious queso - which in my question kicks Chili's ass any day.  Ding. +2

I don't live here but I'd say since I only paid $10 for my meal (someone else got my drinks) and I left stuffed and happy, I would recommend this place.  Ding. +1
