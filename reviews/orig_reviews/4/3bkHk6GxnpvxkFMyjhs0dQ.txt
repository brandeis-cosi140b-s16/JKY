We went to Vida with apprehension because of the mixed reviews that it has received both on Yelp and word of mouth. We made a reservation at 8pm on Friday and were seated right away. Our server was very attentive from the beginning and throughout the meal. The chips were good and the salsa, which had a smoky chipotle flavored twist, was great. We had 4 people in our party, so we ordered a classic margarita, a partita, Vida's specialty frozen margarita and the Skinny margarita. We all decided that the Skinny was best. Do not miss the ripe plantain and black bean mash side! Awesome. Also good, the grilled vegetable tacos and the green chili rice. 

We'll be back and will recommend Vida to others. Be sure to make a reservation and be prepared to spend some time there, the food is slow to come out, but I don't think that's a bad thing.
