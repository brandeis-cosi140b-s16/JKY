Good Mexican food, Good Margaritas! Popular though, so you usually have to wait.  Save room for the tres leches cake!

They do table side guacamole prep too... and Ritas by the pitcher, if I remember right...

I really also liked the Marco Pollo tacos, but as Carmen knows, you cannot order only TWO! They come in threes! :)
