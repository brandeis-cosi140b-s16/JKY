I was only here once, but it was for a free lunch (courtesy of the Big Burrito Group, can't really remember why, lol)...so no complaints here.

It's a bit dark, unless you're by the window (limited seating by the window). 

Nice chill place, but probably wouldn't be good first-date material. More like a place to go with friends. 

I didn't have any alcoholic drinks (I had to go back to work), but I someday want to have one of their Big Azz Margaritas.
