So I get why this place gets 4.5 stars, the tacos are fabulous!!!!! Yep, 5 exclamation marks good. The tacos are gourmet. I tried the mahi mahi (grilled, I'm not sure if there is a fried version) and the veggie taco. Hmm, they are both equally good; I can't pick one over the other. I can say that the Pecan salsa helped out the fish taco with a nice spiciness and gave it that pizzazz it needed to set it apart. 

This is my first visit to La Condesa so, I'm not sure how the place works, but from what I gather you just walk-in and grab a seat then a server will eventually get to you. It was a Sunday evening when we stopped by and there was only 1 SERVER!!! Poor thing was running all over the place. I don't blame her for not getting to us with the first few minutes we sat down. After a little bit she regained her composure and was friendly and accommodating. She really shouldn't of been the only person serving the place was hopping as one group left another entered. There was no one standing around waiting for a place to sit, and honestly I don't know where they would wait. 

The paintings on the walls are amazing. Great art work to look at. However, I was seated at the bar and faced empty bar shelves and the light above me was out, so it was very dim. So as far as ambiance, it just wasn't quite working for me. 

Back to the food.. The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.  

I enjoyed the salsa bar. So many salsas, Cilantro (like), Pico (like), Pecan (like), Peanut, Mexican (like), the list goes on!!

I would visit this place again with the hopes that I get a table next time!
