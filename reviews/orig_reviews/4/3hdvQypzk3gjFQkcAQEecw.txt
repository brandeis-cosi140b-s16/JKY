Went here for the first time for a bachelorette party.

Loved the decor.  Loved the service.  

 Street Corn was amazing. I could literally just eat that corn all night long. 

Tableside guac was great. Also had a chipotle ceasar and steak tacos.  The steak was amazingly tender.  I wish the tacos were a little more flavorful, though.

I would love to go here for a date night, as well.
