Going to lunch at 1pm at Escobar's - empty... but why?? Maybe it's the location, but this place should be jampacked with yuppies with elitist tastebuds and students looking for a foodie $$-saving deal. With the quality of the food here, you'd actually expect the service and dress to be a bit more uppity but surprisingly, it's casual and laidback (a good thing). The menu seems to be well-balanced; can't go horribly wrong with any choice.

Foods I thought stood out: the Spanish rice (not too dry and nicely spiced) and the Mango-Rum cheesecake (a fluffy cheesecake! tricks you into thinking it's healthier? i'll succumb...).
