I gave this place a try with a group of friends during our lunchbreak. When you first walk in, the atmosphere of this spot oozes "chill" with high backed plush seating areas, family style tables and plenty of TVs covering all your mindless staring needs. 
When you approach the ordering area, there's a false impression of cafeteria style service. You actually have to take a moment to read the boards indicating the 3 different lines. I went for a lengua/barbacoa/chicharron plate of tacos, each prepared in various styles. There's a great salsa bar offering 6-8 different styles and garnishes. Also, black and pinto beans are available hot at the bar area gratis. No worries about remembering to order a "side".
I topped off my taco trifecta with a side of the house guacamole which had the perfect blend of shallots, avocado, tomato, lime and cumin that my tongue looks for. Next I side - stepped to the bar to finish my meal with a Michelada which are sold for $5 all day with your choice of beer. I had to go with my Dos Equis. In all, a great place to get your taco fix with every style of meat available you can think of.
