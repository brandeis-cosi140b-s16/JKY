My wife and I went to Toros for dinner. It was very inviting - they had the football games on and it was lively and happy but not too crazy or loud. We ordered a couple tacos, chimichanga and churros. That we're all good , churros were the best. Also had dogfish 90 on tap!  The best about the whole dinner was the service. Rene took great care of us. She was nice, personable and made sure we had everything we needed.
