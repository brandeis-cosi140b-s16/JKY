The tacos are unquestionably some of the best I've ever had in my life. That is without a doubt. 

The downsides to Tacos El Gordo:
It is one of the worst lines systems in the world. As far as efficiency, it's the worst. Combine that with cramming people on every side, and it really begins to get on your nerves when you're hungry.
Also, as far as me, everyone speaking in a language I don't understand makes things difficult.

With all of that being said.........those al pastor tacos...ask for pina (pineapple), and man are they to die for.
