Sat at the bar on a Friday night with friends.  We had appetizers and enough drinks to make us all happy and start using language my Mom would complain about.  

The drinks were a plenty - and the bartender was great.  Took orders by the half-dozen and cranked em all out in a hurry without a mistake.  I expected the typical twelve dollar beer but was pleasantly surprised when they were mostly $4-$5.  The mixed drinks were good also - highlighted by the margaritas.

Appetizers were quick and delish.  Props to the salsa dude - that is good stuff.  And it is served with hot sauce to spice it up if you like (I thought it had enough spice without it).

Overall, friendly people, fast service and a nice product.
