WHERE ELSE might you find Tacos of chicken saut√©ed in yellow mint coconut curry and sweet tangy tamarind chutney? If that doesn't do it for you maybe the slow roast chicken basil almond pesto red pepper balsamic cruda taco will do. And if your feeling beefy the number eleven wasabi seared steak in Chinese black bean salsa with crisp cabbage slaw wasabi crema you might dig into? They got all that and bunches more but those were the ones I tried that were all awesome delicious not just sauced up but developed with great flavors and topped with out of the ordinary ingredients. 

Only $2.50  each for these gourmet tacos!

Side dishes cost .75 cents each I tried the quinoa salad. After the mind blowing tacos this salad didn't do it for me but it might for you.

If you are coming from out of town I recommend that you call to make sure they are open. Last year in August they closed with out notice, everything was packed up, and when I called the phone rang and rang without a message. 

They are a little hard to find. No sign on top of the restaurant. Only a picture of a big sombrero on a side wall. The inside is very raw and the chairs were made in a wood shop.

4.5 stars

This one made it for my Las Vegas Rotation!
