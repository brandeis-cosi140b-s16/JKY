We went in on Thursday night this was our 2nd time there and just like the 1st time it was incredible worth the 20 min drive off the strip we had the best Chili Rellenos I've ever had and the EL Mojecte was incredible we will make it a point to go there every time we go to Las Vegas wait staff was also great
