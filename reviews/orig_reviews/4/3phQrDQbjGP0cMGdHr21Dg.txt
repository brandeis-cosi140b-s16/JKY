For a good hang over destination, Rosita's is the place for me. Bean and cheese burrito with green chili is the perfect stomach soother. 

Chips are a little to greasy for me, but the salsa has the perfect temp. I like it a little hotter ie (los dos molinos). The only other item I have had at Rosita's is the chimi. Also good, but if you are a bean and cheese fan, the beans are some of the best in town. That probably also means they are some of the more unhealthy beans in town.
