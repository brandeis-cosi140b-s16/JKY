Great patio to hang out and enjoy the Arizona cool nights. Server was very accommodating to turning up the heaters. 

House margarita and Rustic margarita were very good. Only negative about the drink: glass is small and full of ice. Best to go on Monday night when they are only $5.  

Carna Asada and chicken tacos were good. 

Ladies please take note.....bathroom is for one person. If you go as a group you will have to stand outside the door. There is a "troth" for men and women to use. Very awkward. 

Great place for a date, casual dinner, or meeting co-workers.
