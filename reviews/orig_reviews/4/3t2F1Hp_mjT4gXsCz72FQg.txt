Just went to Modern Margarita's VIP party last night and had a wonderful time. The d√©cor is contemporary and the patio is fantastic! The first thing that you notice when you walk in is the open bar which has seating all around from the inside and outside patio creating a seamless transition from indoor to outdoor. We were able to sample the Modern, Sonoran, Yoga and Spicy Mango margaritas as well as a variety of their menu items. The Modern Margarita is the classic, the Sonoran fruitier, the Yoga (Skinny Girl) a play on the classic with Triple Sec and Seltzer to give it some bubbles and the Spicy Mango is definitely what it says it is! My personal favorite was the Yoga.  

The food consists of some of the best chips, salsa and guacamole I have ever had as well as an assortment of street tacos, small plates and burgers. We had the pork and chicken street tacos which were equally delicious. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu items! Hands down my new favorite ultra-chic margarita mecca.
