Had an amazing lunch today! My friend for the chile relleno and that looked fantastic! I had the short rib enchiladas and oh my goodness...heaven on a plate! So juicy and delicious and I would definitely come back for more. The service was good as well, our waitress was very knowledgable and attentive. All in all...good place!
