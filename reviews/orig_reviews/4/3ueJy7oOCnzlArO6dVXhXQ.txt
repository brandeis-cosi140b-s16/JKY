-Food: HUGE portions, very tasty, delicious, & fresh! Good prices.

-Tortas come with either a side salada or rippled-style potato chips.

-A small accompaniment of red and green salsa...muy caliente!

-Service was friendly, but slow (we had to hunt down the waitress to take our order)...they all wore yellow shirts and had a ponytail, so it made it a challenge when we had to ask for the check.

-We came in at 11am...but it was already very busy. We were still able to get a table, but they are very close to other tables...unless you want to sit in the lap of another person...

-Restroom is very clean.

-Pay your check with the cashier up front.

-Parking is not so convenient. The spots are very tiny, maybe meant for those Eurpean Smart cars. It's like a normal size parking spot that was split in two...is this to give the illusion of MORE parking spots? Someone parked so close to me, I thought I was going to have to climb into my car through the back window.
