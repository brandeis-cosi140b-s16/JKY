Great spot for indie acts, and drinking with your friends.

While I haven't had the food, I've planned a pretend meal here. You know what I'm talking about? You read the menu, fantasizing about what you'll eat there when you go next time. Hey, if a menu can inspire that, I'm bout it.

Anywho - It's mostly the people here that keep me coming back. Fun crowd always.
