As others have stated, its like in and out but more expensive. I also think the meat is better just because of the cuts they ground up together. But I got a mexican coke and a standard with cheese for like 8 bucks? Lil expensive, especially without fries. not saying it isnt worth it, delicious it was. I just wouldnt make a habit out of it...
