The service is outstanding - 5 stars!  The food is really good.  It's not the best Mexican ever, but it is very tasty.  And it's a far better price point than the overpriced, pretentious (but not very good) restaurants in Vegas.

I had the fajitas, and they were very tasty, cooked just right.  My husband had the enchiladas suizas and declared them delicious, as well.  We were too tired of Vegas to have a margarita.  Maybe next time!
