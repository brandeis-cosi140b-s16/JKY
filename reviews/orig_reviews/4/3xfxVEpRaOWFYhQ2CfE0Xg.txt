So glad I finally got to try Border Grill! Next on my list will be to go to the original location. Came here for dinner and got seated right away in the bar area. From the hostess to the bus boy to our server, service was great all around. Also didn't hurt our waiter was hot ;) Our food was good and pretty good portions, maybe just a bit pricey if I had to give a downside. I know it's because the ingredients are so fresh and I appreciate that a lot of items are organic. This is definitely not your usual Mexican food. Lots of creative items on the menu that I'll make sure to try next time.
