YUM YUM YUM!
I would have to say they have the best Mexican food on campus!
They have everything from tacos and burritos to flautas and tortas. I can't even put into words how delicious everything thing is. I really wish I could give them 5 stars but can't because of their limited seating areas, such small store space, and limited parking. Really, other than that. It's wonderful :)
