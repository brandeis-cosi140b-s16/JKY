It is ten after seven on a Sunday night and all I can think about is that big fat Gobblerito sitting there waiting for me at Mad Mex. 

When I tried it I ordered it out of morbid curiosity. Thanksgiving dinner in a burrito?! Really?! WHY AREN'T YOU IN MY FACE?! I didn't have very high expectations for it. I figured lunch meat variety turkey, instant mashed potatoes, and some cheap stuffing and canned veggies. I couldn't have been more wrong. 

This food is the tops. I'm completely serious. The food was fresh and home cooked. It comes with a side of cranberry sauce and once you eat it (that is if you can finish it, THIS THING IS HUGE) it continues to haunt you. 

I can not wait to go back for another one before it disappears until next year.
