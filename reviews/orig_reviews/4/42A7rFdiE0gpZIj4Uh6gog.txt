I like coming here to eat when I am in Vegas. Their Taco Combo is a perfect size portion for me anyways. I don't really eat the rice because I am not a fan. The texture of the rice doesn't seem like it's cooked all the way. Their Fish Burrito is also very good. I didn't think I would like it but it actually had a real good flavor to it. It's a must when you come and eat here to order the Chonga! Very good drink to eat with your meal!
