Visisted this restaurant with my family recently.  I lived many years in Mexico so I know what the cusine should be like.  This restaurant is fairly authentic and has many things you don't find in other Mexican restaurants.

For the most part, their food is very good.  Of all the things we had, the only thing we didn't like was their "Spanish" rice.  It has an odd flavor because it is spiced with cumin.  Cumin is not used in Mexican cuisine (or if it is, it must be very rare).

The better dishes, like Lamb Adobo, are pricier than the usual snack-type meals like tacos but are worth it.  They don't provide complementary chips.  They have them but you have to pay for them (welcome to Scottsdale).  Their salsas have out of the ordinary flavors but are good.  They run mild.  So if you want decent heat, ask for their Habanero sauce.  They have Tecate beer, but not on tap :-(   Margaritas are good.  Their limeade is homemade and good.

Their desserts are delicious.  We had flan and a Mexican chocolate creme pie.

The service is very authentic.  This means that if you expect American service, you will be disappointed.  Mexican service is deliberately slow and waiters must be summoned for service.  It's a cultural thing.  People are expected to take a long time at meals, eating slowly to enjoy their meal and enjoying each other's company.  If you are in a hurry, this is not the place to go.  If you can handle this type of service, the food is worth the bother.
