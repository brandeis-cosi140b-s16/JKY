Was at the az center for a movie and saw mi amigos.  It was nice.  Food was good,  not out standing but decent.  Servers were friendly and price seemed fair.  

It did seem a bit slow but so did the entire AZ Center.  You would think that being in such a good location that there would be more things going on like at city scape.  Az center could learn a lot from city scape
I would visit again if I'm in the area.
