I tackled ALL YOU CAN EAT TACOS!
Now served Sun-Mon for $19.50! 
Drum roll.........10 tacos down! Me vs. Food, round 1 winner- ME!
You get 2 of the same taco per order. And the langostino is not part of the deal. 
Here's the break down- 2 swordfish, 2 shrimp, 2 mushroom, 2 pancita (pork belly), 2 chicken. 
Got my money's worth, as 2 tacos are $6.50 at happy hour. $6.50 x 5 = 32.50.
Not saying I needed 10 tacos, but it's a challenge I had to accept. And a good way to sample all the tacos!
My faves were the pork belly (not spicy but tasty) and the mushroom (kinda creamy, nice break from meat tacos). The swordfish had a nice spicy flavor, the shrimp were too spicy/garlicky, the chicken were good and they now have bacon. 
I sat at the bar, and wasn't informed of the AYCE special, though I wasn't walked into the bar by a host either. No signage for the deal anywhere, guess you have to be in the know or rely on staff to mention it. 
The deal is on their Web site, and Facebook. 
Now good luck beating my 10!
