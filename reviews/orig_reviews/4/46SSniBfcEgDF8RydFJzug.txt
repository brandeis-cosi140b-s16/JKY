Macayo's has been a stand-by favorite of mine since the wee age of 14. I still order the same thing (either a TCT - toasted cheese tortilla or a Quesadilla). The cheese they use, and I know cheese, is SUPERB.

The chips and salsa are crazy delicious. In fact, this is the first place I ever tried salsa (I told you I was picky!) and have been hooked ever since. They serve both smooth and chunky so you can make the decision for yourself.

Margaritas = :) 

I could see how people would say it's not very authentic. Fortunately for Macayo's, I am no expert on authenticity. But I hardly have to twist the arms of my friends who are experts in that field to dine at Macayo's with me.

But that could be because I only insist on getting the Fried Ice Cream after our meal. One of my favorite deserts in Vegas.
