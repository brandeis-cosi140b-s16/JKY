Took an out of town to spend a few days OldTown Scottsdale.  We checked into the Hotel a little later than expected and walking around exploring.  I had a coupon book that had a bogo for them and were happily surprised to see them open.  The burgers were GOOD! The young lady waiting on us was very friendly.  It is a cute little, diner style place, reminisce of the 50's.  I would definitely go back!
