Gallio Blanco is retro, trendy, upbeat,  local, delicious, authentic, and for a while the Tuesday date night spot for hubby and I. 
Their guacamole is one of the best I have had. Different or maybe creative is the right word... with bits of oranges and fresh avocados. You can taste that it was made in the house.

The tacos are authentic street taco style, on small corn tortillas. They don't have the option of flour and I'm unfortunately not a fan of corn tortillas so its more of a personal problem, but that's one star off for me because I usually end up leaving out the bread. Just one of those things.. I keep trying it every time hoping I'd like it but I end up not liking it even more. 
My personal favorite is the beef burrito. The beef is flavorful and cooked to perfection.

If you order chips and salsa, it comes with delicious fresh chips and choice of their regular salsa or 4 different salsas. My favorite is the smokey chipotle. 

I keep telling myself that next time I need to try something new on the menu but so far I haven't been brave enough. Seems like another visit is in order and I promise to update this review if I really make that step.
