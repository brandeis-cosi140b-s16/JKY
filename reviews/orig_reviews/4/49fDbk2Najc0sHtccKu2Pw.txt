Don't judge a book, or Urban Taco, by its cover. It's SO cute inside. I'd steal everything but the Christmas lights in a second. Adorbs. The owners are obviously present and involved & the service was attentive but not overbearing- loved it. Moving on. The food is good but not great. The 4 street tacos all had the same toppings but different proteins. Boring. The rice was horrible... could have easily been six days old and left on the counter. The salsas weren't much better- the chimichurri tasted exactly like creamy pesto, another tasted like pasta or vodka sauce and the garlic one was reminiscent of thick garlic aioli. But wait!! The corn side dish with poblanos and onions was the stuff my dreams are made of, the refried beans & veggie taco my friend had looked super good... so I'll be back!!
