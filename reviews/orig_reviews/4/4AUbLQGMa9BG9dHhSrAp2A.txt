I recently had to plan a conference at LLV.  We chose to do a taco night for a group of the attendees.  We ended up with 40 people and I think everything turned out very well.  We arranged a meal of tacos, rice, beans, salad, and sodas for the group.  We also got the drink specials for everyone.  Chanthy, the owner, had the food out at EXACTLY 7pm as promised.  Everything was hot & fresh.  The restaurant had to make last minute changes to our area due to rain and it still didn't affect them.  I was very happy with everything I am sorry to see the other comments on here.  I would go back for sure.
