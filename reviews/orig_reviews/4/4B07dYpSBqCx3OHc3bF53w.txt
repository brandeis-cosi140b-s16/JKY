I need to upgrade my review based on my constant return to their happy hour.  They have a very good one.  My hubby and I enjoy having an impromptu date sometimes in the middle of the week and we meet here for HH.  I love the Coctel de Camaron, it is exactly the way I love my shrimp ceviche.  Their skinny Margaritas are delicious, too, and since they are supposed to be skinny I guess you can afford two.  haha.  The other great idea they have now is their Tuesdays Tacos and Tequilas.  Last Tuesday it was a lot of fun.  They had live music and specials on tacos and margaritas.  I am glad I had signed up for their e-mail updates, that is how I learned about this new event.
