A great place to eat without burning too big a crater in your pocket and if you want to impress your date or out-of-town relatives (or both!). The food and service is both great. I usually get their salmon dish (it seems to change a little bit each time) and it is always a winner because it is not dry but not too moist. I also tried the carne asado (medium-well) and it was also a wonderful dish with tortillas, assorted veggies, and rice and beans. Their beer selection has some variety in case wine or sangria is not for you and if you are sick of the usual suspects. I have gone here three times and it still never disappoints. This one is a winner indeed.
