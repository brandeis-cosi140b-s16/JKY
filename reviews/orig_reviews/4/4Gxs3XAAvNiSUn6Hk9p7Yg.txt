This is strictly off my one & only visit so far & not of the actual menu. We were Saturday day drinking, DUH! 
Pros: The few happy hour items we ordered, were tasty! The tacos adobada YUM! Chips, salsa & guacamole, nice! The drinks, even better!! Paloma's were finally located, no one in this town knows what they are! The flavored ritas, were ok. 
Not So Pros: We had to hunt down a Server after we were greeted by the Hostess and walked thru the bar area past 3 Servers to go sit outside. And still, we had to hunt someone down.
Nonetheless, will try it again!

Update: Today Cantina reached out to me via Twitter regarding my review. Because of that outreach I have changed my 3 star rating to a 4 star. One thing I can appreciate is when a business reaches out to their patrons because it means that they REALLY care about what they are doing! As I mentioned to via Twitter, I will DEFINITELY be returning to Cantina! Thank you for reaching out!
