We had a great time at lunch yesterday.  We decided to sit inside because it was a little warm outside.  It was a good decision and we noticed others moved inside also.  We started out with the 'made in front of you' guacamole.  Very good and the pomegranate seeds made it.  The chips were very crunchy and made in half moon forms for scooping.  I had a beer and it was ice cold served in an ice cold mug.  We each had a variety of the taco options and all of them were good.  These tortillas were about the size of the cardboard coaster my beer was sitting on and were filled with great ingredients, served hot and full of flavor.  I would recommend lunch or dinner here any time.  Next time I will dive into a margarita or one of the 500+ tequila options available at the bar.
