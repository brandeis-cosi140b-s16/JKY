We were going to panda express and notice the sign for this place and I though huh so went on yelp and found that it looked and the menu sounded Yummy and cheap...love cheap food haha. My boyfriend and I went here to try it out I love street tacos so was set on them but was wanting pozole yum. Decided on the carna asada three tacos and my boyfriend got the pollo tacos and we shared a quesadilla which was awesome loved the salsa too. The women at the counter was nice but kinda was confused when I asked for the three tacos deal...but its all good...loved the decor and the open sliding Windows awesome....dollar taco tuesdays are you kidding me we will be back lol!
