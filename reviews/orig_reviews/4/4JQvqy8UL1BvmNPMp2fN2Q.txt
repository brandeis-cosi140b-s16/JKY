I probably would give it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. I had been wanting to try this place after seeing it featured on Food Network since it is only a few miles from my house.

My boyfriend and I went and as soon as we walked in it smelled amazing. There were quite a few people there but the service was fast and friendly. There seemed to be a lot of people coming in from the bike shop next door which is always a good sign.

I ordered the carne asada torta and a marinated pork taco and my boyfriend ordered 3 carne asada tacos and we shared a soda and it came to about $13. The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. I do not like very spicy food and I thought that the spice was perfect. The hot sauce was great; it had a slight after kick and a great sweetness too. I personally thought that the carne asada torta was the best part. The bread was absolutely delicious. The tacos were great too, although I think the carne asada ones were better than the pork. I was not a HUGE fan of the tortillas, but they were certainly authentic. I just prefer flour tortillas I guess and should have ordered them instead of the corn. 

I would definitely return to Los Taquitos and I am looking forward to trying other menu items!
