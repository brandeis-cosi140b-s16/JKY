If we'd have seen this place just driving down the road, we never would have stopped because from the outside it doesn't look like much. But because I had read so many great reviews we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did! We've now eaten there at least 5 times....each and every time was amazing. The staff is great! The food is absolutely incredible! Beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The entire staff works very hard to make sure you have a great dining experience. I have not stopped recommending this place to people since I first ate there, and I'm looking forward to our next visit!
