I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and recenlty had the opportunity. A few of my coworkers and I were at a training in Phoenix and desiring a spot for lunch.  A quick click of my GPS for local restaurants and Chino Bandino populated my screen. I shared the philosophy with my coworkers, my desire to try this place and they were game.

It was lunch time and busy when we arrived. We were a little confused as the place was crowded with people. One of the employees came over and inquired if he could help us and we explained that we were first timers. He took us to a side bar and gave all four of us samples of the Jade Chicken, the Carnitas, black beans, fried rice and a few others all of which were delicious. We excitedly ordered and sat down for our feast. Suffice to say we were stuffed when we returned to our training. Around 3pm the Snickerdoodle came in handy for our late day snack. Each of us enjoyed this outing and we shall return.
