This part of downtown Las Vegas has seen better times. Do not judge this wonderful Mexican restaurant by the area. The tamales are out of this world. Best ever. The special was two  tamales, I ordered the chicken, with soup or salad, refried beans and Spanish rice. The portions were very large to say the least. Price was a very reasonable $12.95. While this restaurant is about a 30 minute drive for me I would go there anytime I desired a quality experience.
