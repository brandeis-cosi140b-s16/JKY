Went here a couple weeks back and have to say one of the best places I have found for Mexican food. Corn tortillas were homemade and delicious. The chicken tacos were my favorite. I rated a 4 star because they were short staffed and I had to get my own refills a few times and wait a bit for my beers but for how delicious the food was id do it again. I just called them and they said otro caf√© is their other restaurant and they are relocating Gallo Blanco. Looking forward to checking out their new spot!
