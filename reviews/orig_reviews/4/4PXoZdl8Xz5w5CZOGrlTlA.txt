while cruising the strip-- jason and i decided to stop by for a drink. 

lo and behold, we leave with a gigantic fishbowl of alcohol in our hands :] 
it was massive for twenty bucks and the alcohol the bartender poured in was half of the fishbowl. yikes! good thing we were sharing that sucker.

all in all, pretty good experience-- service was great, didnt have to wait long even though it was pretty crowded! i will definitely come back here on a later trip!
