We were shopping in the area, and checked on Yelp for a good taco/burrito place. This place sounded great.

Inside, there was a small area to stand. There were about 5 tables, but two of them were in front of the kitchen, and along the wall where people would stand to place their order. One of the tables off to the side was rather large, and could fit about 8 people. Luckily, there were a lot of tables outside, and one with an umbrella opened up while we were waiting. 

I ordered the taco al pastor, while my husband got one as well and a taco carnitas. With a drink, the total came to just over $11. The fountain drinks are rather expensive at $2.75. 

When the tacos arrived, I think that we were both a bit surprised at their size. They were about 4-inches in diameter. They looked really good though, and came with a lime wedge. We dug in, and the flavor was really good. Nice chunks of seasoned meat, with fresh cilantro, salsa and onions. The tortillas were also very flavorful.

It was fun sitting outside and watching everything that was happening around us.  I don't eat very much, but next time I would need to order 2 tacos, and my husband would get at least 3. Might try a burrito next time.
