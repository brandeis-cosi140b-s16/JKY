While I still haven't found a cheap Mexican place that compares to those in Chicago, or, say... Mexico, Mango's is a nice place to come for a burrito. And their aguas frescas are really amazing (my favorite is the canteloupe).
The enchiladas are pretty typical -- lots and lots of cheese, rice and beans. But the thing that really stands out here are the burritos 'enchilada style.' The basically take the burrito and smother it in sauce and some cheese. It's delicious! I came here yesterday with a coworker and bought the veggie burrito ($4.75) enchilada-style (extra $1.75). It was tasty and fresh-- full of crumbly white cheese, chunks of avocado, onion, rice, beans and fresh jalepenos. 

Antoher thing I like about this place is that, if you come during lunchtime, you'll actually feel like you're in a "real" city - the tables are crowded, both insdie and outside the buildling, it's loud, there's a mix of business people and families - It's unusual for Mesa, and its really nice.
