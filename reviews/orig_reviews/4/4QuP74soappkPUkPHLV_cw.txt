Our group was wondering what was good on the menu and asked our waitress for input.  She said to try the "Limit- 2" Margaritas $11.95  Two of my friends said the drink was strong, one of us opposed.  I also disagreed.  It was definitely salty though.
We grubbed on the chips on salsa and drank our margaritas as we waited for our food to come out.  The chips were really good, especially the chips that had the sweet topping on it; but too much of that can make you sick.  I kind of did and had to stop...

Finally our order came out.  I had ordered the Mango Buffalo Salad as suggested by the waitress, and it was a featured item on the menu; it was alright.  I was too full to even finish the tostada.
