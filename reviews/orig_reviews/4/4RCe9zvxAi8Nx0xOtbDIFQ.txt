Came here recently with some friends who had just moved into the area. We went on a Saturday night around 7 and it took about 45 minutes to get seated, but we enjoyed sitting at the bar for a few drinks. My friend got a spiked honeydew aqua fresca - it was pretty good and potent! When we finally got seated, we decided to all order something different and share. Our choices were the chillaquielles (out of this world delicious), carne asada burrito (good and filling), and several tacos (which were all also delicious). This place would get 5 stars if it weren't for the service. 
We had to wait an extremely long time for our server to acknowledge us, and when we ordered chips and salsa we were brought out half a bowl of chips and no salsa. When the server finally came back around she appologized and brought out fresh chips and DELICIOUS salsa. So, this place has amazing 5 star food, but pretty dismal service. Definitely will go back, because the food was just that good!
