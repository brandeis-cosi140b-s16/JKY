The 4 of us went there one evening for dinner as we were told that it was good Mexican food. The wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is loud with lots of people having fun. But the talking seems to bounce off the walls. Not bothersome too much but just be prepared that it won't be quiet atmosphere.
The server was super nice but I can't seem to remember her name. Felicia maybe? not sure that is right. Oh well, but she was super attentive and friendly. The margaritas are good but not heavy on the alcohol at all so for the price of them I would next time decline. The food was superb. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were really good. The burrito a friend had was super large and looked yummy.
