I was abducted on a hungover Saturday morning and takin this this place. At first I was a little nervous, it's in the hood, no sign saying this is even a business, bars on the ordering windows. But hot damn, this food was good. A must for a hungover, gut soaking meal. 
I'll definitely be returning....just maybe with my gun next time. Haha jk
