Food is great, but service was horrible!  We were ignored for at least 12 minutes and the person I talked to about service was rude.

We ordered chicken tacos, cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos and margaritas.  Almost all of the food was delicious, and it was all fresh.  If the service was better and the prices were lower, I would give them 5 stars.  

Chicken Tacos - AMAZING.  Not only the tacos themselves, but the side of rice too (which I swear is coated in butter, but I don't care).  Chicken was well-seasoned and delicious.  $14 is a little steep though.

Cheese Quesadilla - Good and cheesy, but something about it was almost sweet.

Taquitos- The edible parts in the middle were good, but the outsides were fried too long and couldn't be eaten because the chicken inside turned hard-as-a-rock.

Margaritas were good, but $10 for a soda sized glass of margarita is ridiculous.

If I'm in the Phoenix airport again, I would definitely come back for the chicken tacos!
