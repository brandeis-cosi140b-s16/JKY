This place is seriously great.  It's a little stand next to the grocery store.  I learned about it from my roommate who is from Mexico.  She said it was the real deal, so I had to check it out.  Delicious tacos for two bucks!  The beef are my favorite.  They also have a wide assortment of sauces that are all a little too spicy for me.  I get mine plain, but they are just phenomenal.
