What a lovely meal.  We ate here the first night in town, just plain hungry.  We also lack good Mexican restaurants at home so were hoping for something closer to authentic.  We were so pleased with ours meals (we both got cheese enchiladas)--both in terms of taste and value.  Note that you also get free chips and salsa.  The chips are hot and salty and the salsa is actually a trio of decent (but not outstanding) salsas.
