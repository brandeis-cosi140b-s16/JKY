I'm a huge fan of Dona Maria, they never let me down! The food is great and the atmosphere is casual. Theres never a long wait for food and the wait staff is tops. There are always plenty of people around to help serve you. I don't venture far into mexican cuisine and tend to order the same selections. I would recommend the chile rellenos and the enchiladas. I have yet to try their namesake tamales. I would steer clear of the burritos has they tend to be on the dry/boring side for mexican food.
