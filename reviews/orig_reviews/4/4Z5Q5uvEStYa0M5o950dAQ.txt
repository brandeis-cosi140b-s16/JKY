Service was a bit spotty, but I don't think they expected to be slammed right at 11am on a Sunday.  It took a VERY long time to get the check, we were there for nearly 90 minutes, but, since we weren't in a rush it wasn't a big deal.  The green chili quesadilla is the BEST EVER, just make sure they use green chili (as in meat) instead of green chiles.  It took a while to get it to our table since the chili was still being made, but the flavor was out of this world!  There was a smoky grilled flavor that I've never had on any other dish which just sent it out of the world.  

Gollo Burro, chili verde, enchilada style.  You need NOTHING else.  I ordered that and my table was eating off of my plate instead of enjoying their food--it was that good.  Machaca burro is also extremely tasty.  

Hooray for a local, family run restaurant.  You will NOT find queso dip, pollo fundito, or any of those 'Mexican chain gang' restaurant foods here.  This is simple, hearty food and you can tell they love what they do by the quality and taste in each dish.  Returning soon!
