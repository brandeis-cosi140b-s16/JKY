Just had lunch here and while the wait was a bit longer than I would have liked, the amount of food for the price is the real value.  I ordered one of the combos and I didn't come anywhere near being able to finish it.  In the future I would skip the tostada as it was bland at best, but the taco and cheese enchilada were wonderful.
