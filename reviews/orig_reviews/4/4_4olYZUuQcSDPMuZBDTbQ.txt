Thoroughly enjoyed my lunchtime visit to Nacho Daddy. Went with the Chicken Burrito. Reasonably priced, very tasty. Server was pleasant. No complaints about this spot. 

If you're looking to feel like you walked off of Freemont Street and into Mexico City for the most authentic Mexican experience ever, you won't find that at Nacho Daddy. But it's still great food. You'll enjoy!
