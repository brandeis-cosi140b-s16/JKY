If you're a hipster looking for a Mexican food restaurant in Tempe, Mucho Gusto would be happy to meet you.

The pretty spot is staffed with vintage-wearing, young servers and hosts, and when I went there, I really liked the relaxed, laid-back vibe (and the food.)

The spot has a pretty patio with twinkly lights and a fireplace, and the inside restaurant is dimly lit, warm and cozy.

To start, I had a yummy Mexican pizza appetizer ($7), made with fry bread, black beans and cheese. It was the perfect portion for two people, or for one person's meal. I thought the fry bread was an interesting choice and gave it a nice doughy texture that was a surprise.

For my entree, I had cheese enchiladas ($14). They came with black beans and rice, and though I usually prefer refried beans, I actually really liked the smoky flavor of the black beans and thought they went great with the meal. They were the same ones found on the pizza, and I guess I just couldn't get enough.

The cheese enchiladas were super-stuffed with cheese, and it was too big of a meal for me to finish-something that's rare. While there are tons of fast-food Mexican joints, I'd go back to Mucho Gusto for the cute ambiance and filling portions.
