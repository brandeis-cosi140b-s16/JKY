The building is beautiful.  I loved that they didn't try to 'modernize'.  As others have mentioned, it is very loud inside.  The open rafters lets everything echo and then the music was loud.  As this was the first time there, it would have been nice to get an explanation of the tacos.  Unfortunately because of the acoustics, it was almost impossible to hear the waiter or any explanation.  The food was good, but I did think it a bit strange that when our food came out, it came out piece meal.  We were a group of four.  One plate came out, then two, and the last plate came out five minutes later.  When we place our order, we indicated to the waiter that there would be three individual checks.  When the check came, it was all together.  He offered to split the check, but got the splits incorrect.
