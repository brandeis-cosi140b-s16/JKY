Yum! Had the archerra (I think that's what it's called) burrito here for lunch, it was awesome! The margarita was good and the chips and salsa were great. I would give it 5 stars but our server sucked, took him forever to get my water, I asked for lettuce in the burrito and didn't get any, and he forgot my side of sour cream. The food was great though, and the prices weren't bad either. I'd definitely eat here again. Plus it's right down the street from sprinkles...what an excellent location! =)
