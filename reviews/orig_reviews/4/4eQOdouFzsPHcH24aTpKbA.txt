Get the tacos!

I've been here loads of times and 99% of the time I go for the tacos.
My favorites preparations are carne asada, chicken, and their vegetarian. I always order a mix of the three. I love their corn tortillas, but they have flour tortillas too if you ask for them.

They also have fantastic horchata! Tastes just like Christmas!

The staff are really friendly and they are very fast on take out orders.
