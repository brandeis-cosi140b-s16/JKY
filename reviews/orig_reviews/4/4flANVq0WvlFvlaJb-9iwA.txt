I was introduced to Mi Patio by a friend of mine who knows her mexican food spots - every one she's introduced me to has been phenomenal.  

If you want a cheap meal that will leave you satisfied - go to Mi Patio.  It's easy to get to.  The food is good. The service is friendly.  They refill your water glass without asking.  The food comes out so fast you almost think they read your mind and started making it the second you walk in the door.  And there's a mountain of food for a teeny-tiny bill.  

The decor is fun to look at too.  (Which is another thing I love about Mexican restaurants - the colorful decor.)
