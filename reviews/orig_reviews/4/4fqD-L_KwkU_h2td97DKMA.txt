We really enjoyed this meal. Three different salsas including a pico, chipotle and verde. Tableside guacamole was good with the sun-dried tomatoes. Had a margarita which was large and VERY strong, only needed one. Enchiladas de Res and Suizas were both good, the sides are extra which seems silly but you really don't need them because the entrees are so big. Jose was attentive and even suggested that we not get the grilled cactus if we had never had it before...thanks Jose! Incredibly filling meal and lots of flavors for a decent Las Vegas price.
