UPDATE - Thinking we should give them another try we visited this past week and the cantina move was nice. Decent food, tasty salsa that could have been a bit hotter, excellent margaritas and good, friendly service. I'm not sure what other people are talking about because we enjoyed it far more than under the previous owner who kept us from returning for over a year. Ahwatukee residents will enjoy the newest incarnation of Secreto. We're fans again.
