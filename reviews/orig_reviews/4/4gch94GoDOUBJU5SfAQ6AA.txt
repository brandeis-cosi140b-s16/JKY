Was in uptown Charlotte on a Sunday afternoon for a Home Improvement Showcase at the Convention Center. The showcase didn't last that long and it was a beautiful day outside, so decided to take a walk towards the Epicenter and find a place to have a late lunch. Walked up on Vida Mexican, and decided to give it a try. The restaurant was empty inside, and everyone was sitting outside because of the beautiful weather. We sat at the bar and ordered a drink while our table outside became available. I ordered a Classic Mojito which ended up being really good. I find Mojito's can either be really bad, or really good. There seems to be no in between. 

Once we finally got seated, our waiter brought us out some Chips and Salsa. I'm not sure what kind of salsa it was, but it was rather tasty. It definitely had a different kind of zing to it, but was enjoyable. 

I ended up ordering the easy and simple Chicken Tacos which used grilled red chile chicken with black bean puree with a specialty blend of cheeses, chopped cilantro and pico de gallo with a side of red chile rice. No complaint here, and they definitely hit the spot. 

Vida was quite enjoyable, but was rather pricey for Mexican. Its in a great location with being connected to the Epicenter though. I'm pretty sure it gets quite busy during the evenings. I definitely recommend for a nice lunch during a Saturday or Sunday afternoon if you happen to be uptown.
