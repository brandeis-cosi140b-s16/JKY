The food is great, especially the pork barbacoa salad. Everything is fresh and the tortillas are incredible. 

The restaurant decor is fun. HOWEVER, going there any day around lunch time is loud and if you want to hear the person you are with...good luck. Every time I have been there (at least 10), there are always groups of screaming kids, and the moms just seem to let them run around. What can I say...the food is good...I now get it to go.
