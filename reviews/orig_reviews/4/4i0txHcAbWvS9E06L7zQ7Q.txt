Always go here with my family. And for most of the time the service and food is amazing, also the staff. I went here on a Sunday night with my family and this place kind of let me down a lot. We made reservations earlier so we did not have to wait for a table so that was nice that they take reservations. Once we got seated we had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to come by to ask for our drink ordered which was annoying. About 10 minutes later we finally got chips, salsa and the drinks we ordered. The restaurant was pretty busy and I did not see a lot of employees working which made me think the service was going to be bad. The server we got was so nice, he's been working here for a long time and he's always been very nice. I did see him taking a lot of people's tables which I felt bad because someone else should have helped him with other people's orders. I got the Chicken Chimichanga. It was pretty good. I asked for no green chillies in it and they put them in which was annoying but I still ate it. WIsh the service was better, and besides that I recommend it to anyone that wants to eat pretty good Mexican food!
