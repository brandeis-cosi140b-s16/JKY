Paradise Valley Purger Co. Is a fun and interesting place to visit.  The staff is so nice and helpful, always looking for ways to make the guest feel like they are getting taken care of. As for the food I would say that it is good and worth stoping by but not the best I have ever eaten like some of the other reviews state. Don't get me wrong the food is good and worth going to try but not something that I would go out of my way for a second time.  

We ordered the PV bacon cheese burger, brûlée burger, sweet tots, reg fries, corn, and French toast fries. The PV cheese burger was tasty all put together, the meat was ok might of benefited from some seasoning a bit but the toppings were the best part  they really made the burger. My husband had the brûlée burger he said burnt sugar made it a little bitter however he agrees the toppings really make the burger. It is the toppings that set this place out from the rest. As for the sides the tots were my favorite. The seasoning on the regular fries is a bit sweet and the corn smelled like gas and was really small for 1.95 like a 1/4 of an ear. But the French toast fries made up for it only 2 bucks and you get a bunch. Save room for these. 

In all it was a good meal not expensive and we are satisfied. Would we go back maybe and would I tell others to visit maybe.  not the top of my list but still good. The staff was fun and that maybe the reason we go back.   

PV Burger Co you do a great job for what you are, a dive burger place.
