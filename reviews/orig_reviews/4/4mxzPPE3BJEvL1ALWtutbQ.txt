My friend and I landed in Vegas starved and in the mood for some mexican food. We headed down to ISLA in Treasure Island in search of some good cheesy food, guacamole, and some margaritas!

We started off with the guacamole "Classic Mexico City Style". it was good, but it wasn't really that much and most of it was covered in cilantro. Fortunately, they didn't mix it in so I was able to pick it off. The chips were perfect and the salsas were all pretty yummy.

I got the seafood enchiladas and my friend got the fish tacos. We were both pleasantly surprised at the heat that both of these dishes had. There was plenty of food and if we had a fridge I would have probably taken some of mine to go...instead I just downed it all. :)

The complete our meal we ordered a few glasses of the blackberry sangria. Its really hard to mess up Sangria, but ISLA really got it right with this one. 

I only had 2 weird moments:

Weird Moment 1: The tequila goddess. I wasn't really sure what her deal was. Does she just offer up the tequilas? I would have taken advantage of that if I knew what her gig was!

Weird Moment 2: The picture taker lady. I know this happens in a lot of restaurants, but this was the first time I was posed by one. It took almost five minutes to take the picture and we had to do several poses. I couldn't stop laughing so apparently I am not the best subject. Eh...

This was the right way to start off our visit!
