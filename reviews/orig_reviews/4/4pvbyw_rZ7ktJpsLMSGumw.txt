So hidden that they don't even have a sign.  You either know this place by word or your bestest friend Yelp.  Tehee. :-D

Tex-mex is the name of the game at Dick's.  Don't expect authentic Mexican but come with an open mind that you will indulge in good tasting dishes.  Aside the main entree, what stood out to me were their rice and beans.  They were cooked al dente and full of flavor.  The grains were firm but not hard.

On my last visit with Fia R and Daniel L (first timers), I ordered their red tamales.  It wasn't the best I had but it was on a decent level.  I came here once for a CMYE and I had one of the enchilada dishes and it was melty good.  The cheese was like molting lava all over the dish which screamed: "eat me now."

All their dishes come on these cool, silvery industrial looking iron plates ensuring your dishes will remain hot while you get down and dirty.  The only caveat would be that its a compact place--you have the main bar and the couple of tables by it (seats 4).  To that, there's a more spacious dining room for larger parties, but probably needs a reservation.

You will find the decor appealing due to its dimly, dark setting like you went into hiding.  The lighting and furnishing were all high-end looking, no less.

If you are craving some Tex-Mex in the central PHX area, this is the spot to get some.  They purposely try to be a "hidden gem." :-p
