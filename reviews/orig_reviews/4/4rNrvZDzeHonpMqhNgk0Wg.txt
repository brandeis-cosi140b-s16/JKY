Very tasty and well priced for Mexican food! I had the combination appetizer which came with tamales, beef tacos, taquitos, chimi's with a side of beans. The tamales tasted deliciously with the spicy salsa which is the perfect mix of chunky and spice. I wasn't very fond of the tacos and taquitos but the chimi's and tamales made up for it. This will definitely be my 1st choice when it comes to Mexican food.
