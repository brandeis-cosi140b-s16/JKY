Hola! Yo quero zopes en tacos

Yes, my Spanglish is tops!  Just like this place.  I would like to announce my new favorite hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint - Lulu's Taco Shop!

I ordered their Zope and el Pastor with rice and beans.  The zope base was different from what I'm used to.  It was actually a hard piece of bread instead of a hard shell tortilla, which wasn't bad at all.  The beef in each of the items I ordered was well braised and soft.  The salsa a top was okay but definitely needed some extra kick.  They have a salsa bar with some pickled carrots, onions, and peppers.  You don't see that around here in PHX often or at all!  

The place is well decorated with some Mexican flair.  This is a real dive and what you would expect to have some great food and it did not disappoint!  They only accept cash so don't forget to stop by the bank. - Enjoy!
