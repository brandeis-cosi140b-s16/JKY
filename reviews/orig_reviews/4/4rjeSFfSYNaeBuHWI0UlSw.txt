The good is really good. Hubby and I staying at the Venetian resort. We had a show at 8pm so decided to eat in the hotel after. This place hit home. The guacamole was awesome. Chips were a but yo heavy for me but tasty.  Salsa was good. Chicken burrito was good with the cilantro rice I was happy with u choice. Hubby had some pork which he ate all of.
