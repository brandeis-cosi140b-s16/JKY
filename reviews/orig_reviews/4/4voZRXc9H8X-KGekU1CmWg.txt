Traveling by air to Denver so drove to Charlotte night before. Asked hotel staff recommendations and Miguel's was on their list of close to Hampton Inn. I was always taught don't judge a book by its cover.  This is truly a "hole in wall" local restaurant.  
We lived in Texas for 25 years and were used to excellent Tex-Mex food.  Miguel's is comparable to most in Lone Star State.
Had the Mango margarita and husband had regular on rocks. Mango was very good.  Meal began with chips and salsa. Did not have the heat but was okay. Shrimp fajitas were good with zucchini, mushroom, squash, bell peppers.  The rice was good but wish there had been more guacamole. Husband had enchiladas Verdes. There was a heaping amount of chicken in the three. We took two sopaipilla back to hotel.  Thank goodness we had refrigerator with freezer. Yum two large containers of vanilla ice cream. Half time ball game deserts!
