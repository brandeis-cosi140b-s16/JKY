One of the best burritio I've ever had.  That's high praise, I know.  The short rib meat was fantastic and the burrito construction was just perfect.  It wasn't bursting at the seams but it was well filled and balanced.  Now, your main complaint might be "Mike - it was $13 for that burrito."  I hear you...it is expensive but then again, you probably will eat $8 in chips and salsa before you get that burrito.  Throw in the delicious rice and beans side it comes with and you're getting a fair price.  

I've also had the crips (think mexican pizza) and the enchiladas.  Both were very good but I'll be sticking with burritos in the future.  Additionally they have a good happy hour M-F with 1/2 price apps.  The guac is definitely worth ordering.
