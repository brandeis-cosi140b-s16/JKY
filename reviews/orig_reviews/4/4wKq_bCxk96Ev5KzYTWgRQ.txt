Prices are a little high but overall it's great food. The chips and salsa were awesome. The green was my favorite but the red salsa was a very close second. I had the veggie enchilada and the veggies were wrapped in a blue corn tortilla with a green chili queso on top. Delish! The veggies inside were perfect, nice and crisp. Such a great texture with everything being cubed. I can't wait to try them again.
