How American are your tacos?  This place is pretty good ~ I like my tacos American please!

This place was a Papa Johns back in my prime days at ASU but they did a great job of redecorating to make the place seem less greasy.

For a first timer what are your safe bets?  I would recommend tacos or vampiros (basically a tostada) but would caution against the breakfast burritos, the one I had wasn't very memorable.   I do fancy the Cochata and anything with pastor (pork) in it.  I've also heard their ceviche is excellent but they only have it on Fridays!

THE MEAT:  The reddish pastor is very tender and has some sweetness to its flavor.  The carne asada (beef) in comparison is quite salty and is akin to cubed steak so they bits will get stuck in your teeth.  The garnishings they use are different depending on the meat you pick so be sure to try both before picking your poison.  They also seem to randomly give you guacamole, raddish, and/or cucumber as bonus sides; I'm still scratching my head as to the methodology and purpose here but I'm not complaining.

In the mood for a good taco?  America's Tacos is a great choice.    The benefits outweigh the negatives and I return here quite regularly!

Things I like:

-Outdoor patio very nice
-Food takes a little while to make, that's how you know it's good
-Pastor on everything
-Corn tortillas!
-Vampires (vampiro) ftw!
-Cochata will change your life
-Hit up their website for their story, it's always cool to read up about successful food establishments

Things I don't like:

-Don't let the menu fool you, it gets expensive fast and the portions are small so find some coupons. You're looking at about $10 for a man size lunch
-Their happy hour tacos are smaller than their regular tacos so double up
-Consistency is an issue, sometimes their pastor is excellent, sometimes it's a little tough or too salty for my preferences
-Location is a little weird if you're driving there
