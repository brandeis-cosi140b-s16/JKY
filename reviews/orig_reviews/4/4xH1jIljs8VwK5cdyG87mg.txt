Blanco down by the Biltmore area is better. Service is better, outdoor seating is better. The food and cocktails are great at both places. This is definitely my favorite Fox Concept restaurant, with Zinburger being a close second. I love the tacos and blood orange margarita. We've had issues with this one bringing us shitty chips with some excuse as to why they don't have the good home made ones and then 10 minutes later the next basket we get comes with the good chips :| or great service until we need the check and then it is like pulling teeth. Stupid things to complain about... which is why they still get 4 stars. I'm giving the other Blanco 5 stars, you aren't as polished. Deal with it.
