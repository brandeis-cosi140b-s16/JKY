Great selection of Margaritas, the Sea Bass Tacos are definitely worth writing home about, absolutely delicious with just enough crunch, thin sweet slivers of radish and the most delicious drizzle of dressing, and also slaw. Yummo! We also tried the Sea Bass Veracruz which was tasty but not thrilling, the tomato overwhelmed the fish somewhat. (Pescatarian options somewhat limited but not as bad as vegetarian - what is with Vegas and the limited Veggie options?) The Flan is a little stodgy on top but really yummy near the bottom. I had two passion fruit margaritas, the first of which was light on tequila and filled with this heavenly tart fresh passion fruit, which of course, prompted me to order a second, which arrived lacking in passion fruit and seriously tequila heavy, aah well.
