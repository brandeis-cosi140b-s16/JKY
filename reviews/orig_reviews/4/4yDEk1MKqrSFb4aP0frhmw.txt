Food was great, we ordered Carne Asada tacos and fries. Cooks have a great personality and make the environment fun. The reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the lack of customer service by the cleaning lady. We decided to eat outside and before we even took our first bit she came in front of our table and start sweeping. Who likes this being done when you're eating?! After I polity asked her to please do it after we finish eating because we do not want dust on our food, she states this is her job and will continue to sweep. I couldn't believe this. Some people have no consideration for customers. Ugh!!!
