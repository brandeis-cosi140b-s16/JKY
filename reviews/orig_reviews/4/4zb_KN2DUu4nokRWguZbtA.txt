I am going to let the yelp community in on a secret.  I really shouldn't because I feel as if the secret gets out, it will get harder to get into these, but it's such a good experience I do want to yelp it.  Ok, here goes: once a month on a Monday Mercadito has cooking classes.  I have been twice, and they are fantastic.  The first time I went was in May, and it started a little late, but for $45 we got a plate of pineapple guac, (with a full size cocktail), queso (with a full size cocktail) salmon tacos (with a full size cocktail), chili relleno (with a full size cocktail) and dessert.  Were you counting that?  That is like five courses with four full size coctails, for $45 plus tax and tip.  O-M-G.  Can you believe that?  The second class I went to seemed a little more disorganized, but that was because they decided that we should cook certain courses.  So this time we had mango guac, but we had to make it (that's ok, it's a cooking class) lobster ceviche (which we had to make) then a slider with french fries, a piece of fish, amazing tres leches cake, and four full size cocktails.  Seriously.  One of the best deals in town.  Oh, and this last time they gave us little containers of the rimming salts/sugers used in the drinks.  I have a feeling I am going to regret letting this secret out, they will get more crowded and I won't get a seat.  But, I LOVE this experience.  Oh, and by the way, the bar tender is AMAZINGLY knowledgeable about cocktails.
