Looking for a bite to eat downtown, we searched and found this place on good ol' Yelp.
It lived up to our expectations, as a upscale Mexican restaurant.  You may want to make reservations for the evening as the girl at the front was busily manning the phones as we entered a mostly empty restaurant for lunch.
I had the calamari salad, which I would go back for- it was a bit on the oily side, but very tasty none the less.
My husband had the chicken quesadilla with fresh guacamole, which he said was VERY Very good.
I will definitely come back, it is a nice place to bring my mom, who loves Mexican food but isn't the tacoria type.
( it is also a back door way into the design center...nice place to explore)
