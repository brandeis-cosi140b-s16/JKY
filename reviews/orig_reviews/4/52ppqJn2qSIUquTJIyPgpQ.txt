once fazoli's, now turned into mexican restaurant..  i wanted to try the place... but mexican food is so common around here.. so it is nothing special to me.. besides.. they taste pretty much the same.. right?
well.. no..

i walked in.. long line of people waiting to order..  i stared at the menu.. and so much to choose from..  everything sounded so good..  

i ended up ordering enchilada combo plate..  did i mention they have different selection of fountain drinks with mexican juices? everything about the place felt pretty authentic..

they make their own tortillas, chips, and everything else they serve.. you can taste the difference..  saw lot of hispanic people eating.. which shows their food is traditional and authentic.   

only thing i don't like..  they close at 8:30pm and closed on sundays.. bummer..
