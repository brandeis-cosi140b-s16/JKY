Ok Nacho Daddy Downtown, you have redeemed yourself. I'm back to being a believer! In NACHO DADDY, I BELIEVE! haha...no really Jennifer, Tyrone and Rick took excellent care from before me stepping in to the place. The service was overly on point, and not just with me and my guest, but with everyone. I had the Mango Thai Basil Margarita and the Raspberry Margarita (Tyrone's suggestion) and both were the bomb. We partook in the Supreme Nachos sin jalapenos (I can't do spicy) and they were delicious. The guest I took rarely ate and in fact prior to eating said he'd just have "a lil sum sum"? He ate most of it because it was so good. Rick was very attentive to his bar guests and Tyrone was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Thank you again for the great service, delicious drinks, and scrumptious food. I'll be seeing you again.
