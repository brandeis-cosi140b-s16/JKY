This place is located all the way East of Charleston cross street is Bruce. Tacos El Gordo Only serves one dish and that's TACOS. This place is like the Inn & Out of Tacos. The place is  packed so expect a lot of noise. I would recommend the ADOBADA to anyone new to this place, and then expand from  there. There are exotic cuts that I've tried for the adobada is still the best. Cheap and Delicious is always a good combo in my book.
