Haven't been here in awhile but definitely worth checking out. I used to stop by here at least once every time I came to Vegas to visit my parents. However, since I've moved here, I haven't stopped in yet for some reason.

It is an odd / unique fusion combo that surprisingly works out quite well. 

Fusion fries or nachos are absolutely delicious. So heavy and guilt-inducing but if you're gonna do a cheat meal, might as well do it right!

Fish and shrimp tacos were delicious as well from what I recall, and not as heavy.

Burritos were a large portion. Never tried it myself but got one for my brother to-go once.
