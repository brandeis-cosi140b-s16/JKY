WOW, for a happy hour this place is amazing.  From 3pm to 7pm, you would think, THIS PLACE REALLY????

The staff in the bar area are amazing.  The level of customer service you get from them makes you feel like you are in a 5 STAR restaurant.  The drinks, the appetizers are so good and reasonable for the price they charge, you will not find a better place in the valley then this place.

We have been here a few times to eat without enjoying the happy hour and the food was good.  We only had one bad experience with a manager there when we wanted to order something we were paying for and asking for it to be made the way we desired.  

I would HIGHLY recommend this place for anytime, but if you have the opportunity to come here for Happy Hour, take advantage of the opportunity and enjoy.
