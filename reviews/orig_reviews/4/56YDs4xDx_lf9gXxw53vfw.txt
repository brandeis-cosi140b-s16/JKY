One of the best burritos I've ever had.  A friend had talked me into going to Island Style next door and I went with some hesitation.  The food was not good and I was starving.  When we left I saw Los Tacos, looked it up on Yelp, and decided to go.  Jackpot!  I had just found one of my new favorites in Las Vegas.  

I walked in and was a little confused on the menu.  It doesn't really specify what comes with burritos, tacos, etc.  I added guacamole, sour cream, and cheese to my Al Pastor burrito.  Absolute heaven!  Even better with the sauce on the tables.  Chips and salsa were about average.  Nothing special there, but that's not the focus in this place.   I'm going back for Tacos later this week!  

Thanks for the great meal Los Tacos!
