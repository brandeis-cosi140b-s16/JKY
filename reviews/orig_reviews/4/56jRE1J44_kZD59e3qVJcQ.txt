This place has the best authentic tacos and I think it might be a sister company to Tacos el Gordo and Tacos Tijuana in Las Vegas. If you want AMAZING authentic tacos that are a little on the small size you need to visit one of those taco places. I order at least 3 tacos each time I visit because their tacos are small.
