Barrio is on my short list when I'm visiting Phoenix. Their Cochinita Pibil is better than mine, and I'm okay with that. It's tender and juicy and I eat every last bite. The only aspect in which my C.P. exceeds theirs is the fresh habanero salsa I serve on the side. I'm writing this review from my POV, thus the four stars; however, I made the mistake of recommending the dark mole to a dinner companion, which turned out to be much more earthy, smokey and strong tasting than I recall. Too much char on the chilis, perhaps? I couldn't blame my friend for getting through less than half his plate. (Perhaps this is a matter of personal preference, but I enjoyed the moles in Oaxaca much more.) All in all, I still highly recommend this restaurant for its quality ingredients and authentic flavors.
