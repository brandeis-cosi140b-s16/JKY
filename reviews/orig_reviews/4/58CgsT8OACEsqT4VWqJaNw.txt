I have eaten at this restaurant five times, and the tacos are quite good.  Fresh tortillas, grilled at the time you order.  Delicious meats to choose from.  My friends enjoy the burritos and the beans.  The decor is a lot of fun.  The people behind the counter are friendly.

On the downside, it is a self serve kind of place where you have to get your own soda and salsas.  Usually the music is too loud, so it is somewhat difficult to carry on a conversation with your friends.  And the wait in line to get your food is a bit excessive, primarily due to the odd way the staff has of offering you every item, one at a time:  "would you like cheese?  What about onion?  What about...."  It is just inefficient.

If you are all about the food and like kitschy decor you will love this place.
