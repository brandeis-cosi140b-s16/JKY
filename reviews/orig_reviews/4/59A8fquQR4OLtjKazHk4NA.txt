It's been awhile since I've eaten at a Wahoo's location.  I grew up in San Diego therefore it was one of those places you go to when you where near the beach area.  I love love love their rice... however, this time around I went for the brown rice as I'm trying to "change" the way I eat. The brown rice was typically nutty and typically dry.  I think next time I will stick to the regular at least at this establishment. The food here was good. Atmosphere awesome, especially with the littles and most of all it's close to home!  Healthy Mexican food at it's best is the best way I can describe it.
