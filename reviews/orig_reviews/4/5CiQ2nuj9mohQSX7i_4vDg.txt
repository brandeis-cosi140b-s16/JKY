I can't believe it took me this long to come eat at El Encanto! I've heard about the cool patio and pond but really didn't understand it until we finally stopped off here for Cinco. Glad we did!

When you first walk in from Cave Creek rd side you are met with a large outdoor pond and see tables next to it. It really reminded me of the River Walk in San Antonio. Really cool and probably the best reason to come here. The atmosphere is really great. Plus we had awesome weather which made the experience even better. The wait was about 20 mins so we grabbed a drink from the outside bar. The pond and weather really made the time to by and before we knew it they had a table ready for us. Too bad they didn't have a table near the water but we still could see if from inside. 

I ended up ordering the mole chicken enchilada. I'm a big fan of mole and it is very hard to get right. I'm often hesitant on ordering mole at a restaurant that I've never been too but I was glad I did here. Easily one of the best mole and I wish I would have ordered the large size! Chips and sala were good and had good service too. Ill be visiting El Encanto again!
