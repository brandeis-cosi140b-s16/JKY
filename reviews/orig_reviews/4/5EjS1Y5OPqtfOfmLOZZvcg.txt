Food is awesome, but the service sucks (especially the hostesses).  Their street tacos are my personal favorite there.  We really like most of the varieties we've tasted and they have good meat/vegetarian options.  We also like their guacamole a lot.  It's especially nice that the guac is served with homemade large chips.  I also recommend the calamari appetizer.  If you're a calamari fan - it's really great and unlike other calamari I've tasted.

The service is what keeps them from getting a "5 star" from us.  Their hostesses (on 3 different occasions) are snooty and cold.  They seem 'bothered' that they are there to help anyone walking in the door and they act like their seating us at the most exclusive club in town instead of a nice neighborhood Mexican spot.  They need to hire some host staff who are genuinely warm and friendly - it would make a BIG difference in people's willingness to wait for a table instead of walking away.  The servers are mixed.  I've had a couple that were awesome - and a couple that were forgetful and slow.  But they've all been friendly.

LOVE the food...  hoping they perfect the service.
