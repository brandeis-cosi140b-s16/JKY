First time at Carlito's and was worth the 20 minute drive. I had a chicken and black bean burrito smothered with green chile sauce. I added jalapenos, lettuce, onions and cilantro to it. They were quite generous with the green chile and the sauce was so tasty.  Also ordered the sides of rice, retried beans and the sopapilla.  The rice and beans were okay, but the sopapilla had me at the first bite. It was piping hot and we drizzled it with honey and it was amazingly delicious. Can't wait to go back and eat again.
