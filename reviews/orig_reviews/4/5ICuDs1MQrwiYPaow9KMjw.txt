This restaurant is awesome. Love the atmosphere (although a little too dim) and the menu selection. I usually come here on Tuesdays when it's happy hour all day. Their guacamole, some tacos, and other small bites are on the HH menu. I can eat a full meal (sharing the guac appetizer and 3 tacos) for about $12? it's a great deal! 

oh, but their desserts are nothing to write home about.
