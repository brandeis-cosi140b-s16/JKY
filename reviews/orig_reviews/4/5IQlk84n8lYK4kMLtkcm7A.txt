My last visit here was a wonderful experience.  The queso fundido was again delicious, though the tortilla was as hot and greasy as Al Pacino on his prom night. 

The mixed drinks were decent, and the bartender was willing to alter a few ingredients to my taste.  I am not a fan of agave.  

I decided to try the Oaxacan Strip Steak.  Magnificent.  The steak was soft and tasty, almost like a rib eye.  The mole sauce was as complex and flavorful as any I tried in Mexico.  Wow!

Despite the high price, I will return here everytime I am in Vegas, and never try any new dish.  I'll keep experimenting with their drinks, however.  As for their desserts.... I'll never know because I am always stuffed before the main course is done.
