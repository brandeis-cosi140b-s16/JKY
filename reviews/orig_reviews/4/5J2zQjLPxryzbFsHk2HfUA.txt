This is my favorite Mexican food place on the planet.  If you are ever in Phoenix, you must go to this location.  Apparently this is the old Tom Mix house.  The famous silent western actor from our past.  The food is killer and the margaritas are very strong.  Keep in mind the food here is super hot!  When you sit down, they bring a red and a green small cup of salsa.  You think ok I can do this.....But, they also put down a pitcher of water!  The salsa is BRUTAL.  In a great way of course.  Go here, its super tasty...

Everything on the menu rules...
