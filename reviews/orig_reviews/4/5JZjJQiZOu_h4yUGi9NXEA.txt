Ordered the lengua, asada and suadero tacos. I think I ordered more than that but I couldn't really tell after the huge mess I made eating my tacos at a rapid pace. 

I was really unsatisfied by the food I was eating at the hotels and on the Strip and this place is just down the street from where I was staying.  

I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in SD and wanted to see what the LV branch tasted like. 

I came at around 11am in the morning and there was no line and ample indoor seating. Ordered my tacos and bit into the asada taco to find cold meat. I was really surprised. I know that the meat is cooked in a batch and used to make tacos and then another batch is cooked, but still - no reheating the asada on the grill? To top that off, the meat was a little tough so I was a bit displeased. 

The savior of the bunch was the lengua tacos. I could just gobble down lengua tacos all day because the meat is so soft and juicy. Juice literally sputters out at every bite!  I immediately regret getting the asada taco. 

Ordering is fast and efficient when there isn't a line. This establishment is spotlessly clean (well at least it was in the morning). Stainless steel tables and walls - and even the bathroom was spotless. Whaaaaaat. 

So even if my asada was cold, I was a happy camper. Later on while driving home I could still smell the tacos on my fingers and my mouth would water. A sign of REAL food. 

Skip the over-priced Strip and come here!
