Mucho gusto is probably one of my favorite lunch restaurants.  The patio is very charming and just lovely to sit on when the weather is nice. I love the tacos they serve here, and the margaritas are strong:)  I recommend coming here only for lunch; dinner portions are the exact same size but more expensive (a little bit of a rip off in my opinion).  Overall this place is nice for a good lunch and conversation.
