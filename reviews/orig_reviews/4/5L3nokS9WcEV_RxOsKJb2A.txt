Came here late during the week so there was no line so if you're busy place adverse just go then. I got a few tacos here some chorizo tacos and some fish tacos. The tacos are small street food style so I would say order double what you would normally order at a standard taco place. Both the tacos were excellent  and super fresh and flavorful. The fish taco was likely the best I've ever had in my life but I am not a fish taco expert. I also got some rice and some churros (both pretty tasty). For drink I got a pineapple soda but probably should have tried the horchata. Basically this is a no frills restaurant with good tacqueria food and that is about it so don't expect anything more.
