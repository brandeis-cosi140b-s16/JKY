I'm from Texas, where we know mexican food. Frank and Lupe's has the BEST and closest thing to real mexican food I can find in the valley area. The only downfall I can say about them is the service is hit or miss. When we have the server "rick" take care of us the service is great. However, anyone else I feel doesn't really care that you're there. The enchiladas with green sauce are absolutely incredible. They have the BEST chips and salsa that the valley has to offer. I could go there every day for chips and salsa. So if you're looking for great mexican food than come here. If you're looking for great service, I may skip out unless Rick is there.
