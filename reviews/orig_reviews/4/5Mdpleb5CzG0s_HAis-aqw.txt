Love the carne asada burrito! We visited around 8:00PM on a Sunday night and the place was a little dirty. The tables were clean but there were a lot of broken chips on the floor. Maybe they just had a busy rush? It really didn't bother me but it was noticeable. The staff was friendly and we were greeted upon entering the restaurant.
