I posted a review awhile ago and was contacted by the restaurant about my review. They invited us to come back and try it again. I took my husband this time and was hoping to love it. We placed our reservation online and unfortunately, we were late because of traffic. I was worried about being late but they sat us right away which was so nice. We ordered the guacamole for starters. It was delicious. They really do have some of the best guacamole I've ever had. I like their chips but some chips in our basket were still soft and very chewy. It kind of makes it hard to eat when they are so chewy. When we did get a crispy chip, it was awesome. My husband ordered the chile relleno and since I wasn't feeling super hungry, I just order the tamale off the appetizer menu. Presentation was nice. The food looked good. My tamales were more like a corn bread. They were crumbly and not dense like I am used to tamales being. The taste was good, I just wouldn't call what I had, a tamale. The green sauce they served with it was delicious. My husbands dish had a nice kick to it. The pepper was very good. The sauce on the plate was a little too tomato saucy for us but all in all, it was ok. I think the service here is exceptional. Our server was great. She was nice, quick  and on top of things. My husbands soda never went empty and that's good service to me. I have been more than impressed with the service at this place. I have come to the conclusion that the food just isn't too my taste and that is ok. They get five stars for service for sure. I would give the guacamole five stars too. I am glad we got another chance to try it out thanks to the manager, Ross! So overall, super impressed with their service, love the guacamole but the food just isn't for me.
