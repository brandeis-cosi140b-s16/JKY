Ok, I started out my first experience at Tee Pee's thinking this review was going to be not one of my favorites to write. I don't like to complain and as we waited to be seated, I just opened myself up to this famous local gem. I mean, there's a reason it's packed and everyone talks about it, and well, as you may already know or will know upon entering the building - GW Bush ate here so...whatever that does for you. Anywho - the place feels dive-y but it has it's charm. Reminds of places I loved as a kid. But it appeared clean, so I'm good. 

We waited awhile, but used the time to look at their menu on Yelp and decide so we didn't hold up the table too long. Sat, had the soggy chips too (as we saw other reviews said, and yeah, we were bummed). But chips are free, not gonna complain - we still ate em - whatever. But yeah - the food was bomb. I get it now. I had the Chicken Burrito and he had the Cheese Enchiladas. Great prices too for what you got, even the pitcher of classic margaritas that we split was only like $9 - dang. I definitely want to come back try some other dishes. We went to another local [Mexican] restaurant the following night that is favorited by locals but is [nicer] and more expensive - but hated it and wished we had just gone back to Tee Pee's (if that says anything to ya [ahem-Ticoz-ahem]).
