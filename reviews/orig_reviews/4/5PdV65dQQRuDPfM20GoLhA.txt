Bought a groupon to try out El Hefe..note I am past the club age and honestly I was a little unsure of the place. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm, parked right in front and was told we could sit anywhere.  Not a huge place by any means as all the booths were full, so we sat at a high top table. The place has a bar feel but that was to be expected.  I got a margarita,  the one with the OJ and Grand Marnier, it was really good (I will admit to preferring frozen) but this on the rocks version was tasty. The drink was $10 but it was rather large so worth the price. We then ordered the queso fundido, oh my one of the best I have had. It came with great chips with sea salt and five of their little tortillas.  Both the husband and I ordered the three taco plate, I hate the braised beef, duck carnitas and the mushroom taco. All pretty good, the husband got pork al pastor (his favorite), chicken tinga and the cod. He also loved the corn that came as the side. The cilantro rice I barely ate. All inall we will be back and I am goinf to try their nachos, they looked amazing. We definitely will also order less due to sheer size but had to order at least $40 for the groupon. Great deal. Now this location is in the heart of old town Scottsdale and is across from Whiskey Row so be aware of the scene. But they have a Tempe location. We will definitely be back for lunch and some more of those yummy margaritas. I love trying new places through Groupon.
