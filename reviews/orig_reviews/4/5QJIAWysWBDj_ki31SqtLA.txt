Very tasty Mexican food. The view at the Lindo is amazing! Best place to go for a girls night, date night or special occasion especially if you call ahead for a table near a window for night or even day time views of the Vegas valley!


The menu has many delicious items, the fish tacos, the pollo azado burrito, the spicy pork carnitas(food network) and the table side guacamole.  The Cadillac margarita is delicious!!!! The dessert of the fried ice cream is amazing but when ordering make sure you ask for the flameado! That's the best dessert!
