Although the this place has amazing handmade tortilla tacos and beer the service today was mediocre at best one of the waitresses would only ask my boyfriend for refills on his drink and not me... I feel if you are going to serve a table make sure everyone is taken care of not just one person... My first time I came the service was awesome but it could have been because the owner was here so everyone was on their best behavior...I will come back again but I hope the staff can display the same awesome service I had my first time
