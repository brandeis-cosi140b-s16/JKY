Second time here and it was just as good as the last time. We arrived Saturday night @730pm. It was packed but we were able to get a table right away. The hostess was friendly and was able to get us regular table instead of a booth by a very loud party. Our water and chips were almost immediately served. The salsa was hot......ouch, but not for my partner who devoured the bowl!  Seconds followed and so did our waiter to take our drink order. I had a mojeto.........pardon my spelling. It was tall, cool and refreshing. This was laden mint leaves and plenty of alcohol.
While waited for food, a DJ played some funky 70s tunes with Mexican music, we laughed and thought it was cool.  Our food was good, nothing out of the ordinary...I had the shrimp saut√©ed in a cream sauce with lots garlic which I love. My partner had the burrito....covered in cheese and sauce......uh interesting since burritos are not covered in either.  It looked more like a huge enchilada.  The overall service and atmosphere was great. The food, good....but not exceptional.  We will go back.
