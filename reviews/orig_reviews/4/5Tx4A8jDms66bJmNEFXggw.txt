Dirty Mexican food definitely hits the spot after a whole day/night of drinking... And Tacos El Gordo is the place to be! Not only is it super cheap ($2/taco) but its super delicious. We got the al pastor, carne asada, and the abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. My favorite was the abodaba (spicy pork). The meat is so juicy and flavorful. I can easily polish off 4 tacos. The carne asada fries are also good. They really pack on the meat and cheese, but wished they put on more guacamole. The fries are good, but I think I'd much rather eat more abodaba tacos! I also got the Horchata, it was OK. It was too watered down, I've had better. Parking isnt bad, saying how busy it is. We parked in a lot thats facing the Wynn, and there was plenty of parking... Easy access to good late night Mexican food!
