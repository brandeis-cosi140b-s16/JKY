My my my. YUM. I consider myself a Tortilla Soup aficionado and HANDS DOWN theirs is the BEST EVER. Flavors of salsa, sides, soup, tacos..... fresh and inventive.  And our bill was crazy affordable.  Awesome happy hour offering. Service was friendly and attentive. In short,  our new favorite Mexican restaurant!!
