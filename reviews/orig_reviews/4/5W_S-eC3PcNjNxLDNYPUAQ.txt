Salsa suitable for the fully Sonoran-ized. Canadian Snowbirds beware! Great sinus medicine.

Ric, our family artist kept insisting we eat at Comedor Guadalajara. That means Guadalajara, MX eatery. 

I lunched here many years ago when it was a good eatery with a bunch of tables on a bare slab in a big building. Things have changed. But not the food. It has always been excellent. 

In my opinion, the chips, salsa and some dishes of CG require the diner to work up to the spicy heat levels encountered. They are mid-range spicy, but always come to the table hot. 

Check the hours. I've been here twice with friends and family, and the place was closed. I'm a huevos rancheros fan for breakfast. Other family members enjoy tacos and enchiladas. Ric speaks highly of the menudo.
