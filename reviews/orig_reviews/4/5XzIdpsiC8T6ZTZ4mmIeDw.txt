In the middle of countless furniture stores, bail bonds, and some thrift shops on Main Street sits this restaurant with really good Mexican food. Very pretty inside! I love the atmosphere. The servers are wearing the outfits to match the festive interior. The service is pretty good. There is street parking with meters (quarters) and there is a  parking lot in the back of the restaurant. For First Friday, they set up seating on the sidewalk.

You get chips & salsa (yummy)- guacamole is  extra. I always get the fish tacos here, which are really good, and good sized, too. In fact, I don't think that I've ever veered away from the fish tacos (and I've been coming here for years now). My husband always gets the beef burrito here.  Prices are reasonable. Participates in the Entertainment Book. I would recommend this restaurant.
