Very pleasant surprise.  Found this place on yelp, when we arrived, it was completely empty.  We almost got cold feet and left.  So glad we didn't! The service was excellent. 2 young girls helped us and we're extremely friendly and knowledgable about their menu. They even allowed us to sample each of the meats.  Although each meat was delicious, the pig stood above the rest.  If in doubt, get the pig.  

All in all a great experience.  We will most definitely be back.
