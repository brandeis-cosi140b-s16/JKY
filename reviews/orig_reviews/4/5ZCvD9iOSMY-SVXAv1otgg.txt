Very unique and intriguing!

Definitely try if you are a foodie!

Loved the dishes and would return but a little too noisy for my taste as a favorite restaurant.

Favorite dish was the season mushrooms -- must try :)

We also got:
Chicken tacos -- very small, but fresh and delicious!!

Pork belly roll -- crispy and interesting! A little too intense for my taste.

Strawberry gazpacho -- delicious!!!

Ps happy hour only works at the bar.
