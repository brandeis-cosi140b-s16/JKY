I used to go here all the time for the absolutely, hands-down best ahi tacos in the universe.  But, alas, they have dropped out of sight...are ahi disappearing myseriously?!?!  I'm not sure why they don't have it anymore but I'm really disappointed.  I will be back though for the awesome guac.  And the carne asada tacos are good too.  Oh, and they have Negra Modelo on tap.  Now that's really why I'm really coming back.  ;)

Please save the ahi so Gallo Blanco can put it back on the menu.
