Unique food but the restaurant was a little on the dirty side. Tables hadn't been bussed even though the restaurant was empty. The coke was out in the machine and when I pointed it out, the cashier said I could take a bottle of coke if I wanted. I had the steak which was really good and the coconut bark is the bomb!
