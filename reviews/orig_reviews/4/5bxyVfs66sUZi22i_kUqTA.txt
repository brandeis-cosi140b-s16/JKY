Great food, fast and friendly service, but a little pricey. I love tex-mex and I typically get a ground beef chimi plus chips & queso when I go to a new restaurant.

They were both spot on here. I asked for ground beef, but I go shredded however it was very tasty and super quick so I didn't care much. Chips & queso were $7.50 which seems a bit steep for cheese and more of the free chips. We added the table hot salsa and it was even more terrific and spicy.

The waitress was very nice although she did disappear for about 20 minutes when we needed refills and more chips.

We'll be back.
