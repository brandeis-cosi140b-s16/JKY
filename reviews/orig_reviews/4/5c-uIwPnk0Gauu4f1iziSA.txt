Don't know how I missed this place for so long. I've worked on Mill Ave for over 3 years and never made it to this restuarant and I have to say that now that I have I will probably be there more often. I had chicken enchilladas with a side of rice and really enjoyed it. Perfect balance of spice (in my opinion) and flavor. It wasn't overpriced either which makes it a great lunch spot.
