Loved the food but our table was right off the kitchen with horrible lighting. Just remove the table . I eyed an empty booth the whole time and it looked so cozy and warmly lit. 
I had a Paloma, a delicious drink, with dinner. My chipotle chicken fajitas were delicious. The 3 enchilada plate was huge and tasty. All the food was substantial and good! We had a nice waiter and I would like to go back. I would skip the appetizer because the entrees are huge. Or......just go for appetizer, queso, and  a nice sangria or margarita!
