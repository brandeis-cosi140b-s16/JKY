My husband and I are from out of town; we had an early flight out of Phoenix, were in town for one night only and were looking for a place for dinner. The AAA guide sent us here; it did not disappoint. We had kind of a long wait, but we ordered drinks from the friendly bartender to pass the time. When we were finally seated, we promptly ordered the guac. It was fresh and delicious-the pomegranate seeds added a nice touch. I got the chicken enchiladas suizas, which were also great. Hubby got the grilled tacos; they were also fresh and tasty. I have no idea when I'll be in Phoenix again but if I ever am I'll go back!
