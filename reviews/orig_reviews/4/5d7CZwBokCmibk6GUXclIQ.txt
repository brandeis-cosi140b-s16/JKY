The guacamoles were heavenly.  I dream of visiting Scottsdale again just to order the guacamoles.  They have one of the largest tequila menus in the area - in fact they have a tequila sommelier.  The main course dishes are not laudable; some are a little too rushed and lack value.  But the guacamoles take you for a whimsical taste adventure.  [insert heart emoji]
