While staying  at the cosmopolitan I was lucky enough to have easy access to China poblano. My first meal consisted of " when pigs fly" and " golden pigs". The golden pigs were awesome. They had sweet tender pork filling with a hint of 5 spice ( I think) and came with house made sweetened condensed milk which was delish. There at 4 to a serving..but they are filling. The when pigs fly were the same filling..only these were steamed..not fried golden..and came with no dipping sauce. I was pleased..but would have liked a dip!  Second trip I ordered the 18 monk noodle.. And took it to go since I was solo..I guess it was because I took it up to my room..but the noodles were a bit dry..and the portion was a tad bit small. One stand out that I had both times were the pork carnitas tacos. The filling was super juicy and came with two chicharones inside. I could have eaten 10.
