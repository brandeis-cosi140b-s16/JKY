Well, here I was on my 2nd trip to Vegas and having a pretty good time.  I was staying right behind MGM Grand at the Signature and it was getting pretty close to "Go Crazy" time.  So naturally before the festivities began me and my traveling companion needed to grab a bite before we got the night started.  

We get to the restaurant entrance and are greeted by a very lovely hostess.  She escorts us to our table and the first thing you notice when you walk in is the very modern and stylish decor.  It may not be for everyone but I really liked it and the music as well.  Our server who's name escapes me now was very nice and just great all around.  We decided to try the guacamole for starters.  Now, I will tell you this. I've had Guac at many places including Rosa Mexicana (which I've always thought was very good).  That guacamole at Diego must have had crack in it I'm certain.  I could not stop feeding my face with that stuff.  Before I even knew what happened it was all gone.  And I felt kinda bad as my traveling companion never really stood a chance in battling with me for position over the guacamole.

The entree that I had was the Arrachera (Flank Steak).  It was pretty good. I will say that I was NOT disappointed.  By the time the meal was done I was good and full.  No dessert that night.  The only thing left to the was thank our very nice server with a gracious tip and head back to the room to get ready for night.  Let me tell you that nice meal definitely helped out later on if you know what I mean, LOL.

All in all I think DIego is a pretty nice restaurant.  The next time I'm in Vegas I would definitely like to go back.
