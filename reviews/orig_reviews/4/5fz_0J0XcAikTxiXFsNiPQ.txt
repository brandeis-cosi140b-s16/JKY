Love love love.  I don't know how I haven't gotten around to writing a review of this place yet! 

First, let's discuss the location: it's RIGHT next to the strip club...like, in the same building.  This is amazing.  Amazingly hilarious.  Did you know that the dancers order from El Dorado and they deliver to their dressing room?  Amazing.

The food is on point and very affordable.  Less than strip prices, more than a taco shop - it's *just right.*  They USED to have half off for locals every Monday, but now that's a thing of the past. :( 

Their margaritas are great - no stock sweet and sour, everything is made in house.  The carne asada is yum, the lettuce wrapped tacos are surprisingly delicious and filling, and their trio of salsas is SO legit.  

Whether you're stopping in after a trip to the strip club...or just having a leisurely dinner on a Tuesday night, El Dorado has you covered!
