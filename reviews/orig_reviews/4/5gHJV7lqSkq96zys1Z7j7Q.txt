Leave your expectations for traditional Mexican food at the door. The food is very fresh, not terribly spicy, but unusual in a good way. We went for happy hour (from 3 to 5 Tues through Fri) and started with the tequila and lobster quesadillas for the table. Then we all ordered the $1.50 tacos in various forms. We all thought the halibut taco was the best, closely followed by the roasted pork tacos, but they were all outstanding.

We also had most delicious $6 margaritas I've ever tasted. Oh and the guac...not traditional, but fantastic. I would never have thought of pomegranate seeds in guacamole but I loved it.

Save room for the flan. I usually pass on flan but my brother insisted, and it's the real deal.
