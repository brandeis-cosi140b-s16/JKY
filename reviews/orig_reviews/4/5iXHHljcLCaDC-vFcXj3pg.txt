We got seated quickly. It was really busy but the environment was clean and warm. However, we were seated quite a while before we were served. I think it may have been a bit disorganized since several people were working the tables around us.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and a Riesling. The wine was super sweet so don't get it if you prefer dry. However the food was amazing...best fajitas I've ever had. We shared the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert...impeccable.
