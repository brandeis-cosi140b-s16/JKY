When I saw an ad that Wahoo's opened here, we had to try it immediately, because I fell in love with the salads over the summer during a trip to La Jolla. And I hear they will be opening another location soon in Boca Park.  The atmosphere at this Wahoo's is even better than the one I remember from California, although it was cold the night we dined there (doors were open). Large restaurant -- respectable list of beers, which I loved. And several truly healthy options on the menu, too. I happen to be addicted to the power chopper salad with spicy white beans and fish. We also ordered a Banzai Bowl. Check out the happy hour from 3 to 7. This place also has extensive options for vegetarians. And their beverage options are fantastic. I'm not a soda person so usually do water or beer with my salad at Wahoo's, but here, they have three kinds of iced tea - mango, tropical green, and plain. Sodas and sobe lean beverages. (Definitely buy the large cup so you can get 75 cent refills on your return trip)  They were SUPER accommodating to my special requests (brown rice on the side, dressing on the side)
