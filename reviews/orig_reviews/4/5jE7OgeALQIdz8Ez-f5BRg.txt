Had dinner there this week, very good food, best I have had since socal, cute restaurant, waiter was super friendly.  Chips Salsa and Guacamole were all very good and the Tamale was quite tasty, reminded me of being home in Socal with all the great mexican restaurants.  Good food, good place, go visit!
