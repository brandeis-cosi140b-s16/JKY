This Place was dead when I got there for lunch but I must say that the taco salad with shredded beef and single malt of whiskey that I had, not only was it  delish but the price was right!. Rey, the bartender was friendly. I wish that I would have had the chance to go back on the weekend when it was suppose to be a mad house but maybe next time, if I find myself in Scottsdale!
