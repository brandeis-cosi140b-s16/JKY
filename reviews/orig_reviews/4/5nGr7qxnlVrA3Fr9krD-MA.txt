Love this place! I ordered the chicken enchiladas on a recent trip and then went back and got them again later in the trip..the green sauce is so good! Their chips, salsas, and margaritas are all very good and the bartenders will mix you up something special if you sit at the bar and tell them what you like. A very good spot hidden by the convention center in Mandalay.
