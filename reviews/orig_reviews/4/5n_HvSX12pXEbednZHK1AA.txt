I love this place. The tacos are amazing and I am trying to try them all. My first time there I went with what the server recommended (one shark with pinapple salsa, and the tuna) and was amazed. I didn't think I liked cooked fish until I took a bite of that tuna taco. It was pretty much a life changer. The next time I went with a friend and we halved all the tacos so we could try more. The service has been great, the only thing I don't like is the side dishes, I'd just stick to the fruit salad.
