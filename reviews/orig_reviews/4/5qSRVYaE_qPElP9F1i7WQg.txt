I finally went there with someone who was willing to both eat amazingly hot food and wait as long as possible.  And wouldn't it just figure that for the first time, there was no wait.  I don't know what good Karma I had going, but we walked right into the place.  Sure it was a Thursday, but come on!!  

So, yea. It's hot.  But you knew it would be hot.  What I didn't hear so much about was how it manages to be really really good while not doing anything "special".  Our plain Cheese Quesadilla was amazing - but it was just cheese and tortilla.  But they managed to cover the ENTIRE thing with thick yummy cheese - and no big bubbles either - yet the tortilla was still 100% crisp.  Everything was like that.  Describing it might not sound exceptional, until you realize how rare those things are to find all in one place.  And their mexican rice had the most amazing taste - neither of us could place which spices we were tasting that were so different.  

Outside is a mess of tables and chairs that HAVE to be there when they are packed, but it looked a bit like Coney Island in the off season to go through there when no one else was there.  

Personal tip?  If you are worried about the spice of your dish - get it with the sauce on the side.  That's where all the heat is.  My companion did that with the Chimi and found it to be the perfect way to make sure she got all the flavor of the sauce, without being overwhelmed by it in every single bite.
