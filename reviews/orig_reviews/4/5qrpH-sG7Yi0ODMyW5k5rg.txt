We have had good and bad service here, and my wife is completely put off by the location and the ambience. The parking is atrocious. There are no reservations, and if you're waiting for a table get ready to be pushed hard to order from the bar. All that being said, it still gets 4 stars instead of 2, because the guacamole and the regular menu items are that good. Of course they are 50% overpriced.
