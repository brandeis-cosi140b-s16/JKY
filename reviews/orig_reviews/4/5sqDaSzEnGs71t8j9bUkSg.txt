This place is hands down the best Mexican food establishment in Champaign, and a top level competitor on a national scale. 

My first time trying it was in 2012 when my friends and I went on an eating spree to try every Mexican food place on Green street in Champaign's Campustown area. We were highly impressed with the flavor of the steak tacos, and their freshly made tortilla chips. Since then, I've tried a few of the other dishes here too, and the chicken huaraches are my absolute favorite. Their rice is pretty tasty too. 

I give them 4 stars and not 5 because the place is really small, and sometimes there's no where to sit, and/or there's a long wait to order. When they first opened, the wait time was longer (unless you called in), but now they seem to have gotten that figured out. The service is always good, the girls working there are always nice when we come in. Easily one of my favorite spots for eating in Champaign.
