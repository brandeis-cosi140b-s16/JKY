This place was great. As said in many past reviews, their margaritas are truly the best. I had the Portabello mushroom street tacos which were PHENOMENAL...I wish we had one of these places at home, you would catch me there everyday at lunch time for sure. 

Only one bad thing to say about this place...some of the seating was like those sushi places where the table is real low and you sit on a couch...I am 5'6 and can deal but my friend that was with me is 6'4 I don't know why they seated us there!
