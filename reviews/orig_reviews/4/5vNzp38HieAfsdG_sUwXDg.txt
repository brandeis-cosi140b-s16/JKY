WOW. This place is sooo delicious. I am talking greasy-make-you-feel-guilty-for-eating-it-bloated-for-hours-SCRUMPTIOUS! Totally worth it! 

Its a mexican/chinese food place. Thats right, you mix the two. I went with my husband and he had to save me from being a rookie. YOu have to get adventurous and mix the combos. Get a diablo chicken quesadilla or a jerk chicken burrito. I highly recommend the chili relleno, it was awesome.  They also give you a free ginger snap cookie with your meal, they are perfect!

Dont over-do it (its easier than you think because its so good) this place is loaded in sodium so if you leave really full you are going to be 3 times as full when you get home! I will warn you, the place is divey, but the food is so good you zone out your surroundings and just focus on disgracing yourself by eating like someone denied food for days.
