Obviously I'm one of the few who likes this place, but I just judge it for it is.  I don't come here expecting authentic Mexican food or a fine dining experience.  I do come here for tasty margaritas and the poblano chicken dinner, which is the only food I've ever ordered from here.  It's a chicken and cheese stuffed poblano pepper, breaded and fried and covered with their bajai sauce.  Now I know the bajai sauce is nothing more than cream (sour cream?), cream cheese and jalapeno juice, but it sure is yummy!  Quite addictive and no way it's good for you, but I just can't help myself.  The chips and salsa they serve when you sit down are good, they offer a mild and a hotter sauce and I like them both just fine.

I love the patio they have overlooking a small "lake".  It's a great place to hang out and drink margarita's.  I have always had good service here.

I've been here many times over the years and I'm sure I'll be back again!
