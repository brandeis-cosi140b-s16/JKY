The Tacos here are pretty good. The meat actually taste like authentic Mexican style marinate and grilling. We tried the carne asada, chicken asada, pork al pastor, and shrimp. The taste of the food was mouth watering. The guac was tasty and the chips tasted home made too. Beer selection was excellent and not to pricy (some beers). The environment was modern and chill. We went on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was not busy at all. We used the groupon deal so we saved quite a bit of money. Without groupon deal I do think the tacos are a bit pricy. 

CONS: 
Due to it not being busy what so ever it did take a bit of time to our drinks, but once our drinks came it went by quickly. 

The portion of guac is way to small to share with another person, it should be a tad bit bigger. 

They give you a slice of lime per taco but the limes did not have any juice in them. 

We had ordered a Lambic Framboise beer thinking it was going to be a regular sized or on draft,  it came out to be $24 for the beer which is way to over priced for that type of beer. 

Overall good experience will be coming back.
