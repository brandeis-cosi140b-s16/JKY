Good stuff!!  Loved the burger and will definitely be back when on that side of town.  I wanted to give the Chencho fries a whirl, but it would have been too much to eat and the Burger was at the top of my list.

The dining room area is small, but I found it to be clean and well kept.  The kitchen is quite open to the dining room and, at first glance, appeared very clean and organized too.  I will certainly return again.
