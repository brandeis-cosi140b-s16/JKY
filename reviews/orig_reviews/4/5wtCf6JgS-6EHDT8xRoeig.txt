Another bookmark. Check. Based on my rule of thumb, I usually get the namesake because it should be a safe pick right?

So I get the Carlito's Burrito. Peep this. Double meat (no rice or beans). Your choice of meat. (Beef, Chicken, Chorizo, Carne Adovada, or Pork Verde for 7.35) Steak is 8.35 and Shrimp is 8.95.

You can choose to smother it enchilada style for a dollar more. You can add complimentary toppings upon request. (Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions, Cilantro, Salsa, Pico De Gallo, Pickled Jalepenos, and Serrano Peppers)

Guacamole is 75 cents and Sour Cream is 50 cents.

I chose steak with everything except for the Guacamole and Sour Cream. They ask you if you want the red or green sauce. They told me the green sauce was more spicy so I got the red. (I still ended up sweating profusely so I am assuming the green must be really spicy)

The taste? Pretty good! You have chunks of steak mixed with all the fixins. Every bite was as good as the last. If you refer to my pic, the size of the thing can be intimidating. But if you are really hungry you should be able to finish it.

Service was decent. You order, pay, wait, and receive your food. Enjoy. Keep in mind since they only have one register, on really busy days you just might wait a while.

Location. Ummm, its a decent sized place for where its at. From the outside it looks small, but when you come in, there are enough tables and chairs for about 20 people.

So next time, I will try other some of the other tasty options since the Carlito's Burrito was so good.
