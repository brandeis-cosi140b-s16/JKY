The food was what I expected because my friends recommended that I come here, and the margaritas were good. The atmosphere was lively, so it is a great place to go with family and/or friends. The menu is also priced right, so feel free to try an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I have to admit, I didn't know what to order so I read my fellow Yelper's reviews for suggestions. Thanks guys! You were right, the fish tacos rock! Although the service was on the slow side because it was busy, our waitress, Claudia, made every effort to check on us. Once we were able to place our order, the food came fairly quickly. The portions were smaller than what I'm used to for a Mexican restaurant, but the flavor made up for it. I was very satisfied and full. The fresh chips and salsa placed on the table when we arrived helped. Thanks for making sure we stay fabulous and fit Cantina Laredo! I will definitely be back because I love Mexican Food!
