Tasty, better than average Mexican food.

I hit this place up on lunch with a coworker and we were both pleasantly surprised.  Their food is all made from scratch (except tortillas), tasty, and seemed fresh.  Prices were reasonable and definitely worth it.  

You walk up to the counter and order, then they bring it out to you.  I had their Carnitas "Guadalajara" Style... when I asked the owner "What is Guadalajara style?" he replied "Guadalajara style means they're the best carnitas you will ever have".  Well, how could I say no to that?  Turns out they are slow cooked carnitas, done proper, then deep fried before serving... haha, so good.  I won't say they were the BEST carnitas I've ever had, but they were probably tied for best..... although a bit greasy, obviously.  The beans and rice are nothing special, however the hot sauce and corn tortillas were spot on.

This place is definitely an addition to my lunch rotation.
