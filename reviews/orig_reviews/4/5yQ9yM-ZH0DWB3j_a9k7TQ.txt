We've been here a few times now and it is consistently good food with consistently ok service, especially if you're sitting on the patio. 

You obviously can't go wrong with ordering the tacos and beer... Duh! But if you must venture away from those items, I have to say, the salads are extremely flavorful and delicious!!! I have tried to copy creating it, but I just can't get it right. 

The decor is quite fun and interesting. There's large TV screens, a turtle with a skull head, burning candles, biblical people doing funny things, etc. This is a great place to start your night out with a group of people.
