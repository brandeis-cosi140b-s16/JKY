Secreto is under a new owner, but the food hasn't suffered from what I can see in other reviews. We stopped in the grab a late lunch and order the Tortilla Soup and the Roasted Elephant Garlic starters. Both were out of this world. The Tortilla soup was far richer than any I've had before and extremely flavorful. Don't know how to described the Roasted Elephant Garlic platter, damn good though ... a must have when you eat there.

The menu is very tight without a lot of fluff. The beer selection is strictly premium (although the manager said she does stock the ever present BUD LIGHT in bottles if someone is really hankering for one). 

The service is great - unrushed for sure. The place has high backed booths that offer a bit of privacy. Nice intimate restaurant. Definitely a repeat
