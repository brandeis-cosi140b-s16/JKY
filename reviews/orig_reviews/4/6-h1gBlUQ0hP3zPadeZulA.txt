Started with the Elote Callejero (Grilled corn w/ Cotija and smoked Paprika), which was different than most corn I've had.  Wife got the Chilaquiles Verdes with chicken, while I had the carne asada burrito.  The carne asada beef was made really well.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.

They also serve Lux coffee which is very very good.  Service was ok but left a little to be desired.

If you go to the men's restroom, the urinal is in the shape of a pair of lips.
