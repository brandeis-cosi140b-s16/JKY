This is one of my local favorites and most of the food I've tasted is delicious. With that said, on the weekends, the wait can take up to 1 1/2 hours. The problem is the host staff whereby they will tell you the wait is about 30 minutes. That is not the case. I believe they need to be forthright with their customers so the expectation is not ruined because of the long wait. I think they tell
people the less time so people don't leave. This is definitely not a good management policy.

Other than that, we have enjoyed the food and the wait staff each time we have been here.
