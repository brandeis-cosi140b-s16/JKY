Been here a few times. Very convenient location to my home. Love their torta's, however the fact that they come with ruffle chips is a little strange. On some of the larger tortas you could probably get away with splitting the meal, or bringing it home with you. Salsa is spicier than many other Americanized mexican food restaurants, which is an added plus.  At the end of the meal they give you a dum dum lollipop. Only gripe would be the fact that their margaritas are non alcoholic. They should really splurge on getting that liquor license.
