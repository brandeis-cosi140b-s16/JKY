I have only been here one time but I am a fan and it was enough to get me to write a yelp review.  I had the chicken taco's and they were excellent.  I ordered three of them and had planned to eat two and bring the other home with me.  I didn't bring the other one home with me because I ate it.  The woman at the counter was very informative and friendly and the food was great.  I prices were the same as any other taco shop in the Phoenix area and the product was superb.
