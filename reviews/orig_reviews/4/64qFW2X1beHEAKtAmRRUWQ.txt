I was looking for a reco for a 'significant' [eh hem] birthday dinner and foodie friend Jim suggested Mission because of Matt Carter.  We had a 7 res and parked right in front...fire blazing out front, nice feeling. Inside, the decor is appealling but because of the lack of soft surfaces, its really loud. [Full disclosure: I did not inform them it was my birthday] We were seated along the banquette wall and were a two top next to a four on each side. Noisy, obnoxious. 

Server was very nice although stumbled over the bar order [and it turned out they made a scotch substition that they made no mention of]. Had I not already done my yelp research I would have been at a loss as to what to order. We skipped the apps and had the swordfish and the pork. Swordfish was a fine attempt but I thought over citrified and small bit over cooked. The pork tacos were genius. The combination of the pork, the sauce and the accompanying red onion, queso and cilantro on the home made corn tortilla just sang. The pork arrived as a glistening chunk that falls apart. Well worth the $32 and meant for two. You can also ask for more of the tortillas. 

We shared the churros and milkshake for dessert. DEEEVINE. Warm chocolate churros sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and an amazing milk shake that we really enjoyed. 

I'd go back and sit outside by the fire and eat the apps and have drinks Plates are small to begin with and I think if you expect a crazy WOW dining experience, you'll be disappointed. I think the service is working out some kinks, the bar seemed okay [although the TV is this space seems well, off putting...] and the kitchen seemed to be cranking. 

I do think its very fine food.
