One of our favorite places for fresh-Mex and Southwest.  Good value, easy parking, good service. It can be a noisy dining room at times, so the patio is a good bet, weather permitting. The naco torta is a mess to eat but heavenly.  The menu has enough variety to please everyone in our dining party.  Never disappoints.
