Went here after reading reviews and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Although the male host was not the friendliest, the waitress was. She was so nice to help clean up and did not get angry when my 3 yr old dropped his drink ALL OVER floor. The  florentine nachos were outstanding and the chicken quesadilla was REALLY good as well. It's really easy to ruin what is basically a simple dish. Definitely coming back!
