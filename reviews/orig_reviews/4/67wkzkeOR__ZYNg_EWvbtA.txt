We went here last night after more highly rated Yelp places nearby were completely empty.  It was a slow night for dining out although the weather was fantastic.  We saw this place and loved the outdoor seating.   

Service was terrific.  Our waitress was very honest about the menu and what she liked and didn't like. When I asked her opinion about an appetizer, she said not to get it but to have chips and salsa instead.

As for the meal, I took her feedback and ordered the grilled mahi mahi tacos. They were small but I am not a big portion eater.  Probably better as an appetizer for most people. They were FANTASTIC.  Best fish tacos I've had in a long time. Loved it was a small size and I sometimes hate eating at Mexican restaurants with huge portions.

Chicken Margarita was also great which was a waitress pick.  Red enchiladas had a lot of sauce (almost mole) and were just okay.  That person in the group wished she listened to the waitress.

Margaritas were all tasty, too.  We all will return when we are back in Scottsdale!
