Fresh tortilla! And they are good! Came here and to another location near Summerlin, liked this location better for some reason, don't know why the food tasted a little different at the Summerlin location. 

FOOD
Like a Chipotle but with a fresh tortilla. That's what makes it. The chicken was also really juicy. Didn't try the other meats though. 

Chicken tacos (4 stars): They put a good amount of chicken in there. You can taste the tortilla more since it's not covered with ingredients. 

Chicken salad (4 stars): They put a fresh tortilla on the bottom. Comes with guacamole too. Only thing is the tortilla on the bottom is soggy from everything on top, so ask for it on the side if you want. House dressing is good!

SERVICE
Everyone was nice when I came here. They are pretty fast at orders.

ATMOSPHERE
Came for lunch and it was pretty packed, but people get up fast. There are a good amount of tables.
