Asi es la vida. Verdad. Verdad.

I went here for lunch. There was a man playing acoustic guitar in the main dining area. My experience here was beautiful, authentic, and delicious. Our server was a bit confusing, but nice enough. 

The food was legit Mexican (take that with a grain of salt as I am a definite gringa) and incredibly fresh and well prepared. I was completely impressed. It was a bit pricey for lunch, but definitely not outrageous. 

I would highly recommend this to folks looking for an authentic, somewhat gourmet, upper-end, and delicious mexican spot in Phoenix.
