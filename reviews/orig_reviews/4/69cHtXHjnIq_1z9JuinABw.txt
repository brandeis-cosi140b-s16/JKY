I have eaten at Chevy's in California and the one in Henderson. I must say I have never been disappointed with any item I have ordered. The only complaint I have, is I wish I  could finish an order of steak fajitas! Their chips and salsa are the best. Paired with a Cadillac margarita is nothing short of heaven.
