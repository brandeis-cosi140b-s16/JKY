I am ridiculously ashamed that in all my years in this fair city of Pittsburgh and my three years Yelping, I have yet to review this fine establishment.  I suppose the Shadyside location is among the more recent additions to the Mad Mex crew, so maybe I get a pass?  

ANYWAY - Mad Mex is just fabulous...even moreso in the fall when the all-important Gobblerito takes centerstage and fills my belly with an entire Thanksgiving meal swaddled in a delightful flourly shell.  Aside from the Gobblerito, MM has plenty to offer year-round, include those of us who love a good vegetarian meal when they're not scarfing down turkey by the pound.  MM's menu is a delight to every Tex-Mex palate and their wings aren't too bad either.  Throw in a great beer list and the best margaritas north of Mexico City and you've got a true Pittsburgh favorite. Pass the guacamole, please.
