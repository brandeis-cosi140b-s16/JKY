My friend works at a local coffee shop and almost everyday he walks down to Rito's for a burrito.  One day I saw him have a delicious looking green chile enchilada.  I just had to try it.  Well, that was three weeks ago and I've been there at least once a week since then.   
The owner Richie greets you and instantly shows you a smaller menu so you don't have strain your neck to look up at the board.  Then he will ask ya where you are from and what your name is.  He's very nice!  Even makes conversation with my little one.  I was surprised when I returned he remembered my name.  :)

I order pretty much the same thing every visit.  I love the green chile enchilada with a side of rice and also chips with hot sauce.  Today I skipped out on the rice, my bill was less than $6 and I was full after.  LOVE THAT!  

The dining room is always clean, a bit small but they cater more to "to-go" crowds.  They also ask for patience because they are not a fast food restaurant.  They hand out paper menus and encourage you to order ahead.  

Only drawbacks to this location would be ours and days of operation.  They are closed on Sunday and Monday and they close at 6.   I'd give anything for them to be open until 7.  
I wish their chips had less salt on them but that's only because I am not a big salt fan.  I still eat the heck out of the chips and sauce though.  ha ha ha

Word of warning.  THE BURRITOS ARE HUGE!  Thank goodness everything comes in a togo container. :)
