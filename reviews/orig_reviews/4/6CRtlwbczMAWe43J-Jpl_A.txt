I've been to this bar about once a week for the last couple months or so. It's nothing special, but for some reason I can't stop going back. 

The bar has a great happy hour from 4-7, as well as a few daily specials. Tuesdays until 10 pm offer $2 bottled domestic beer, $1.50 tacos, as well as cheap margaritas and mojitos. I believe there are also specials on Monday nights when they offer karaoke. The one thing I will say, is that they don't offer any draft beers, something I look forward to when going to a bar. 

Although it is a bar, there is no smoking in the actual establishment which is always a con in my opinion. But, for the smokers, Paradise Cantina has a decent sized patio, which is great on the rare occasions ha there is nice weather in Las Vegas. 

I usually go on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, so it's never very busy. Service has always been great. Waitresses are friendly, and drinks come out quickly. I've only had the nachos to eat, but they are delicious. 

Overall, it's a nice bar to go to when you're on that side of town. It has decent prices, but they aren't prices that you wouldn't be able to find at any of the other bars near the UNLV campus.
