We stopped in on Saturday night, right before it turned into a bar/club. I ordered the Charlie's Tacos (mix of chorizo, carne asada and chicken). They were really flavorful. I enjoyed my meal. My friend ordered the Chicken in Mole Sauce. We both tried each other's and both agreed mine was better. Her chicken had a little too much sauce. She still said it was okay. She mentioned that she got the Parmesan and Swiss Chicken before, and it was really good. We got the two-for-one margaritas with a coupon they were passing out in the casino. My friend got the classic margarita and said it was good, and I got the mango margarita, and it was way too sweet.

They were trying to force a party to start, so that was a little annoying at first, because I was hungry and trying to eat, and they were trying to bribe me to dance (offering free tequila shots if I did the Wobble with them or whatever they were doing.) Looking back, I should have accepted. lol. Oh well.

After we ate, it was fun. People started showing up and drinking and dancing more. They were playing good music. They were training a new shot girl, and so we got a bunch of free shots because they were showing her how to count pours and how to be more flirty and fun with the customers. That was cool.

We ended up leaving and heading elsewhere on The Strip. But it seemed like it would be a good time if you stayed all night. Apparently, it's all you can drink for the ladies after you pay $13 for your first drink. I'd come back again and check that out.
