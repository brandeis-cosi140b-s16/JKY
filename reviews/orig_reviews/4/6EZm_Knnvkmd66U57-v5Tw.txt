Sure, there are new players in the Gilbert Market that offer Latin American specialties, but I would crown Cantina Laredo as " queen" of service and experience.  You don't need to travel into the barrio to have your tastebuds satisfied.  Guess what, the wait is about 200% less than that place in downtown Gilbert.  Skip the hype and head to Cantina Laredo for a most enjoyable time.
