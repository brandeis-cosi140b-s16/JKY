Food is awesome! Customer service is not unfortunately. We were told a 15 minute wait and were seated 45 mins later. Our waitress rushed us through the process and was very pushy and loud. Luckily the food saved the night! We will definitely be going back, but will be requesting a different waitress and will try to go earlier when it isn't as busy to get seated. Definitely a gem in Centennial Hills!
