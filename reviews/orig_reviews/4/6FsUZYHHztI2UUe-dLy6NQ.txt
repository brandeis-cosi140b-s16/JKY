I would go to this place JUST for the chips and salsa.  The red and green are both very flavorful and spicy.  This was my first time going to this location and I decided to make the drive for the salsa.  They were at the My Nana's Salsa Challenge, and won, so I decided it was worth the drive.  They did not disappoint..  
We ordered a plain cheese crisp, carne adovada burro, and a shredded beef burro.  Somewhat boring choices on our part, but they were really tasty.  The adovada was fantastic.  I could eat that every day, given the opportunity.  And the green salsa was just soooooooo delish!!!!!
Service was a bit sketchy.  We were there tonight, on a quiet Sunday, and were "forgotten" after we got our food.  But I'd forgive a little bit of sketchy service for a re-do of those chips and salsa!!!
