I had a great time here for lunch ... my waiter was very friendly and the food was delicious!

I really enjoyed the corn salsa and chips that came as soon as we sat down - it was a nice change from the standard tomato salsa.

I went created a taco lunch of two different specialty tacos. I had the lemon grilled shrimp taco which had a nice light flavor while the tuna with the honey wasabi dressing was awesome! The tacos had generous portions of shrimp and tuna respectively. You can choose your side and I went with the refried beans - it was a lot spicier than I was anticipating, but it was a pleasant surprise. The only thing about the beans that I didn't like was that it was served a bit cold. Other than that I really enjoyed this place and will be back!
