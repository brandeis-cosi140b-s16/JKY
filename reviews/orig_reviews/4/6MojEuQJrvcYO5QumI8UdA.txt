Solid spot. The food is delish! Had the bulgogi chimichanga and the bulgogi fries. The meat was so good and flavorful and went along so well with the Mexican flavors. My chimi was HUGE! and loaded with sour cream, gauc, tomato and lettuce. And how can you go wrong with the bulgogi meat on the fries, again loaded with all the toppings. Next time I'm trying the bulgogi cheesesteak...

I gave 4/5 stars due to wait time and also the ambiance leaves a little to be desired. Staff was great and very friendly though! Definitely will be back for more.
