I lived in California for many years and didn't realize how spoiled we were with the Mexican food.  Here in the Phoenix area, we a had a lot of trouble finding a Mexican restaurant that we wanted to return to.  Nando's has great food, a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and reasonable prices!  We will return again and again!
