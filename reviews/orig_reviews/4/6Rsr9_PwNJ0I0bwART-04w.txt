Diamond in the rough!! 
I've tried many of their dishes and they are all authentic and leave me so full I can hardly move! I love that they have a fresh tortilla making station right there in the dining room as well as the live music, However as much as these things are fantastic in my view, my favorite part is their margaritas. They have many flavors and everyone of them are delish!
