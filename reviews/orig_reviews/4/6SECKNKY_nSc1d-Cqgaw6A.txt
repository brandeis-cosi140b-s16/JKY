Finally! I made it to China Poblano,  I had been wanting to go for so long.  Like most of the reviews say,  the food is Excellent,  but it adds up quickly with the small dishes.  If money were no object, I would go here once a week.  But at that price, its more of a special occasion.    the Cocktails were Fabulous,  and very tasty,  as were the pre-cocktails we had at Chandelier Bar.  

My Favorite dish was the Traditional Shu Mai,  the "gold" flecks were a nice touch.  They were moist and yummy and flavorful.   The 10 ingredient soup was a very unique blend of flavors.  good,  but next time I'll try a noodle soup.  
The Guacamole was super yummy,  it had cucumber which I'll have to add to my next batch.  

My other favorites were the Carnitas Taco with green sauce and chicarones, mmmm and the Tuna Ceviche with sesame.  

For the barbacoa taco,  i was expecting a traditional mexican slow roasted beef,  not something with bar-b-que sauce.  Although I love nopalitos (cactus) on anything. 

Next time I'll have to have the queso, and more.....Lunch anyone?
