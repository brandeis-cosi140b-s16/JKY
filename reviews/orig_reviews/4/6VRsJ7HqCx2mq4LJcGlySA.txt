You like spicy? No seriously. Flavor, heat, fantastic!  The service left us flat, it was the bartender working a table routine. He forgot our appetizer, forgot our drink refill request... You would think after twice getting up walking across the bar to request what he already forgot to bring us would have embarrassed him into better service, or not.

The food was very good.  Even the bean dip and salsa they give you with the chips had some zip on it.  Normally the gratuitous salsa is pretty lame to appease the masses.  Here the masses must like it hot.

If I ever get out to Phoenix again I'll be back, but I don't think I'll take a table in the bar area.
