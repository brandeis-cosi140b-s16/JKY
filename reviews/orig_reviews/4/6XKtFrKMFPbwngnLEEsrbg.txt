The mesquite smell as soon as you enter is so enticing! I loved my carne asada quesadilla and the salsa bar had so many options. I love that you can choose between canned US Fanta or bottled real sugar Fanta... Nice touch. :-) It was not very busy, but the weather was pretty bad, so hopefully that was the reason and this little local joint gets enough business to stick around.
