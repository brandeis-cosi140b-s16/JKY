Been here once... and a half, I guess. 

I took an out-of-town visitor here because he wanted Mexican. We went at the oddest hour in the day, which could explain the very friendly service we got. The tacos were tasty, especially the fish tacos. The fried fish stayed crispy, which is the most important part, and the taste was not overpowering. Overall, food was good for its price, and the presentation was not too shabby. 

However, two downers about service: 
We wanted to sit on the bench tables near the umbrellas and mist, and since it was so insanely sunny we asked the host if she could open the umbrellas. She said she couldn't because then the misters would drip water onto the tables... hm... We resorted to the small slabs called tables, which ended up being just enough space.

[Side note: I went back here again for dinnertime and got seated in a booth where the table was up to our knees. And it was kind of far away from the bench. I personally couldn't stand it being in a skirt and all... unfortunately, my guest and I decided to book it before the server came back to take our orders.] 

Also, our waiter was not as attentive as you'd think he'd be with a nearly empty restaurant... with such a small table as the ones outside, one cannot afford to have extra empty dishes laying around...

Overall, tasty food at decent prices, nice ambiance, and really nice fish tacos! I would come back for a light afternoon lunch, but not for dinner.
