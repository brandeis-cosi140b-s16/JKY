Excellent Mexican food!! Great place to grab a bite before heading to Red Rock Casino. Their tacos are the best, especially the rock shrimp tacos! They serve a fabulous sangria margarita! They will kick you in the butt,so be sure to eat plenty before downing a couple of those! They offer outdoor dining and gaming at the bar!
