Modern Margarita has a lovely happy hour....here is my happy hour specific review:

Patio:  great patio for groups! The area is fenced in but doesn't block the outdoor experience that is so nice in the Arizona sunshine.  

Food: The happy hour menu can be found here:  http://www.modernmargarita.com/menus/ModernMargarita-HappyHour.pdf

I recommend starting with the $3 chips and salsa flight or $3 beer-battered onion rings (at those prices you can't go wrong!) The veggie and steak tostadas are only $4!  I seriously make a meal out of the happy hour menu 

Crowd:  The crowd can be a mixed bag-- there are some sketchy cougars prepartying for Blue Martini (that place is a sh@tshow), working professionals, and locals.  

Staff: our server was a total peach and didn't complain about splitting the bill.  The bartenders gave my small group free shots when we told them we were celebrating a new job!  Most importantly, the manager offered to charge my iphone!  It was much appreciated!  

We will be back again very soon for happy hour!
