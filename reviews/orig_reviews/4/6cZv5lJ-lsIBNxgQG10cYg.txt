I was too hard on Matta's in my first review.  

Been back several times since and have to say so I really like this joint now.  Their chips and salsa are good, the service is friendly and fast, and their house margaritas feature good tequila!

Try the bean dip, the fajitas and finish it off with some fresh fried ice cream.  Your belly will thank me later.
