I've come here numerous times and although the food is really good, the employees lack customer service skills.  They have forgotten my order on several occasions and always forget my drink so I have to wait until someone comes over to pour it.
The chicken is wonderful and very tasty, I love the chicken tacos and burritos, although I do occasionally find bones in the meat.  The carne asada is good as well and sometimes it is overcooked but I still like it.  
During the lunch and dinner hours it is extremely busy and with the place being very small, it's tough to fins a place to sit down sometimes.  The best thing about this place is the prices, they are very reasonably priced.
