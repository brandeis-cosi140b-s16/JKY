Fortunately or unfortunately China Poblano is located on the second floor of the new, cool, hip Cosmopolitan hotel right across from the Marquee nightclub entrance.  If you don't like large crowds, this is unfortunate, if you like to see a lot of pretty people dressed in their sexy Saturday night bests, which is what you should expect when you even think about going to the cosmo, you will feel right at home.  I wasn't expecting much from China Poblano after reading all the negative yelps, but I was pleasantly surprised.  You cannot go to a high end Chinese or Mexican restaurant ready to compare it to the tastes and prices of hole in the wall joints in Sgv or East LA.  That is the problem of a lot of yelpers out there.  You have to realize your surroundings, you are in a high end hotel in Vegas and a Jose Andres restaurant.  You should know what to expect in prices, but you should also know you are getting good fresh ingredients and beautiful decor.  And last, you need to try the food with an open palate and not expecting the tastes that you grew up with at neighborhood restaurant.  Here's what I tried:

Carnitas taco - excellent
Barbacoa taco - good
BBQ pork buns: different, but good, no your typical fatty pork
Shu Mai: again different, but good
Ha gao:  ok
Glass noodle salad: excellent and refreshing
Mole fries:  not too good
Queso fundido with chorizo: excellent
Chicken and rice soup :  spicy but good

There are also two food bars you can sit at, one has a view of authentic Chinese people making dim sum and the other has Hispanic people preparing guacamole and other yummy foods,  which I thought was pretty cool.

We had a great meal and good service, definitely worth a try, and I will definitely be back.  Just be prepared to eat with an open mind and an open wallet, lol..........
