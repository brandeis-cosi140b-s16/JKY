You had me at the Hibiscus margarita! I rarely give four stars to a restaurant with only one vegetarian option on the menu... but I guess I'll make an exception, for stellar margaritas!  (It's amazing how we are so close to Mexico, and AZ restaurants continue to produce mediocre margaritas and chips and salsa.) Not the case here folks!  So even though the Canteen barely meets 4 star qualifications, they credit to for great for their excellent margaritas and salsa flight.  We obviously started off the meal strong with Chips and Salsa, and Hottie and I both ordered tacos for dinner.  I had the Portobello tacos with blue cheese, and Hottie the battered fish tacos.  Mine were good, except the blue cheese overpowered the Portobello, so I ditched it after the first bite. A more mellow cheese, such as Monterey jack or Fontina would have paired better.  I ordered a side of "smoked" black beans to go with it... these were awful, dry, not smoked whatsoever and they were refried.  I'd rather eat my own arm then be subjected to that nonsense again.  On a positive note Hottie said his tacos were the best he ever had.  The ice cream flights they had for dessert sounded great, but I didn't have room to try them! I'll definitely be back to the canteen for Happy hour...
