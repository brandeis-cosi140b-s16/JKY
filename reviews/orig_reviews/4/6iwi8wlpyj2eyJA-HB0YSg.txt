Delicious street tacos. At $2.50 each with your choice of meat, plus a cart of toppings, it's a great deal. The line moves quick, and the food is delicious.

I have no idea if it's authentic or not, but I'd like to think it is. Either way, it's a great spot for a quick bite and a welcomed change from a lot of other Mexican foods in the city.
