This is a pretty solid Mexican restaurant. I was very surprised by the lack of decent Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Lindo is consistently excellent and was the best Mexican place I found when I lived in Vegas for two and a half years. The chips and salsa and bean dip are delicious, the soup is good, and every entree I've had has been delicious. A great choice if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas.
