I've been here like 3 times in the same week. I get the long beach every time I go just without the tortilla strips. Its basically like a spicy tuna hand roll and its very good. Their ginger is also some of the best I've had. Only downfalls are their hours (not open on Sunday, last time I went) and the long line... It took us 30 some minutes from entering to check out which is understandable since they're still fairly new and we did go during the lunch rush. People also take a long time to order since its kind of like subway's set up so that kind of is annoying but what can you do?
