Excellent food! First time eating there. We started with the coconut shrimp with orange jalapeño dipping sauce served with salad greens on the side.  Although the dipping sauce sounds hot, it wasn't. It was more of a citrus and jalapeño flavor and it complimented the coconut shrimp quite nicely.  We tried the hanger steak fajitas for our entree.  It's a good thing we were able to split the entree as it would have been way too much for one person.  The steak had a wonderful mole sauce with a little kick. And the vegetables were not typical for fajitas.  Asparagus, carrots, onions, red & green peppers.  Also had a side of black beans and rice with black beans.  The regular margarita was one of the best I have had in a restaurant.  The menu is seasonal and changes quarterly, so you may or may not be able try something that is suggested in the reviews.  Timing is everything! I would definitely go back when I'm visiting Champaign.
