Black bean mash, tortilla pie, poblano cream sauce- oh my!  I came here for a recruiting dinner and I'm thinking (and hoping) that the wonderful food served here got us our recruits!  This is the perfect spot for business and pleasure alike.  

However, I am not too fond of the smell of the restaurant.  It almost smells like a strong cleaning agent and kinda chips away at the appetite.  Since there are plenty of seating available outside, along with a wonderful view of uptown Charlotte, this isn't too big of an issue on a good day.
