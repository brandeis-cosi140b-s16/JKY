What a great place! Even though it is far out in the North East Vegas areas well worth the drive.  I had the pollo con rajas!  Served with rice and beans and fresh home made tortillas! You just can't go wrong or get more authentic. When you are in the mood for some home cooking and you don't feel like taking the pans out this is a great place!
