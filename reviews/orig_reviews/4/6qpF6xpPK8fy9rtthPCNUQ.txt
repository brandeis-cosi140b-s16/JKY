I had been here once before years ago so this was like my first trip. I received some great coupons in the mail and decided to try it out with my babe. Atmosphere was great! We both got the E-3 (not valid with the coupon but still a great price at $11.99) deal which is the appetizer, Entree and dessert. I started the meal with their homemade Tortilla soup which was delish! Second course was their mini chicken fajita dinner with rice and beans which wasn't all that mini in my opinion. Topped it off with a mini fried ice cream which was amazing and again not all that mini. The tortillas that came with the fajitas were made fresh and hot right there so that was a HUGE plus and the never ending chips and salsa didn't hurt either. I will definitely be back. We paid less than $40 for two three course meals, drinks and the tip for the amazing food and excellent service!
