My wife, kids, and mom and I ate here Friday night.  We had the chips and salsa, crab tostadas, quesadillas, tamales, shrimp and steak fajitas, and tortilla soup.  The chips were the only thing that were not good.  They were just okay.   Everything else was fantastic.  My wife enjoyed her big stick margarita, I enjoyed my margarita primero, and my mom enjoyed her classic margarita.  The most tasty items were the steak with the steak fajitas, the crab tostadas, and the tamales.  The salsas were very good too.

This local will go back to Segundo again!

Kid friendly too.
