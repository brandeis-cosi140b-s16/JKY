I was finally able to try Phat Phrank's after much word of mouth. They close at 6 and don't open at all on weekends, so it was never on my radar. But I can see myself picking up dinner from here now that it's on my way home from work. If yelp allowed half stars I'd give 4.5.

I had carne asada and adobada tacos. They were both served in corn tortillas that held up well to the filling of meat, cabbage, onion, cilantro and scallion. The hot salsa might be hot to other people, it has a rich, smoky flavor beyond the heat.

The rice and beans grew on me, especially with a little salsa added. Both of them are fairly simple preparations.

Flavors overall are very clean. Their adobada is fried to a crisp and adds just enough savory goodness. The carne asada feels a little greasy at first bite but is melt in your mouth good by bite three.

Frank is a gracious, smiling host whose passion is apparent in the very first impression. He clearly takes pride in his work and enjoys serving his guests.

I'll be back, and if the rest of the menu is as good as those first two tacos, I may bump them up to 5 stars.
