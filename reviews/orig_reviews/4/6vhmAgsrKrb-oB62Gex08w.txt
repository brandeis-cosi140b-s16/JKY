If you're looking for some cheap tacos on the Strip go check out Tacos El Gordo next to Encore. If you are looking for some real Mexican food in a beautiful setting Javier's is your place.

Make no mistake, Javier's is probably one of the more pricey Mexican restaurants in town. Average plate runs upwards of $30 but don't expect to eat for less at a sit-down restaurant on the strip let alone Aria. The menu is extensive with a large selection of seafood entrees and vegetarian dishes. There really is something for everyone and the combo plates allow you to sample a wide variety of dishes. I recommend the stuffed relleno peppers and guacamole, the lobster enchiladas are also extremely popular. On a side note: no free refills on soft drinks, $6 for a small 11 ounce bottle. SMH!

Rest assured your money is going somewhere: the restaurant. Javier's is gorgeous. Big props to their interior designer. The white stone with dark wood, leather tables,
massive wood carvings and a beautiful bar all come together to make it one of the best looking restaurants on the strip. The restaurant is huge, probably the biggest in City Center and you can see the attention to detail in every square inch.
