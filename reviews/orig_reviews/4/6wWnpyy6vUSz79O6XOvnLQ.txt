I've been to Casa a few times.  It's solid Mexican food with a good ambiance.  On the Friday night I went they had a live singer performing so that was a nice touch.  It was packed but we were seated quickly and served within five minutes of placing our order. Their menu is incredibly extensive with the typical combo plates you find at most Mexican places.  My first time having a Torta.  Mexican sandwich as described by the waiter.  No idea I had been missing out.  It was good and I didn't leave filling stuff like I usually do after a heavy Mexican meal.
