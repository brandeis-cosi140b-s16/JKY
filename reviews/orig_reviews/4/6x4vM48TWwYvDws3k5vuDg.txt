One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas. I liked the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa. I had a pork tamale and chili relleno. Both were good. My boyfriend had a really good pork torta. The ambiance was great and service, prices were reasonable (inexpensive when it came to the torta) and service was at attentive. The restaurant is located in a funky part of town with cute and quirky vintage shops that are worth strolling past afterwards as your food settles.
