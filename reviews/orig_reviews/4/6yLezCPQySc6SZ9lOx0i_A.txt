First time here and enjoyed it very much.  I asked for a recommendation and the Adovado (red chili marinade) was the quick response.  Tasty and spicy, hit the spot and the home made salsas were a big hit with me too.  At first glance the prices seem just a tad high but the quality and time it takes to produce high quality shines through
