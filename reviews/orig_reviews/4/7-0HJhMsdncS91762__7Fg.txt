We went here on a Busy friday night. We had no reservations with a party of 10 people. we waited for about 20 minutes and they sat us which was pretty good considering it was a busy friday night. Our waitress was very friendly and overall the service was good. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was enough to fill me up with a piece or two remaining. My husband ordered three tacos which were the fish of the day "grouper", some pork, and beef. 
He was very happy with his tacos until he bit into the grouper. He said it was too fishy for him. Thinking to myself it can't be THAT bad, I took a bite into his fish taco and man was it BAD. It was so fishy that I had to spit it back out into a napkin. Our other friend had ordered the same fish taco so we watched him take a bite into his before telling him how bad it was (just to see if it was just our taste buds lol). He took a bite into it and his face just said it all. He hated it as well. We told our waitress and they gladly took off the 2 fish tacos off our tab and the manager came to apologize as well. 

Overall experience was good and we will be back :) 

P.S the dragon berry mojito is soooo yummy! I had two :)
