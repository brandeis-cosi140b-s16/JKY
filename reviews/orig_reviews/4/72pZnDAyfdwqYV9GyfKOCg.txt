So it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway), the tortas at LRDLT are enormous.  Like ridiculously large portions for the price.

The bread is soft.  They're piled super high.  The ham is sliced thick.  The breaded beef has a spicy kick to it.  The omelet (and yes... let's just call it an omelet) somehow makes it all come together.  And keep napkins nearby before you start because all the avocado and sauce and beans will get all over the place.  The tortas - I usually go with the Del Rey or the Reyna , just for the kitchen sink level variety of stuff they shove it.  Is it breakfast?  Is it lunch?  Is it dinner?  Yes!  All the tortas come with a more than generous side of Ruffles.  A few times when I've ordered a torta takeout, it's felt like they handed me a lunch sack with half a Costco-sized bag of them.

Service was solid and friendly although it's always been pretty busy every time I've been here.  Wait times go by fast though.

And now, I can't wait for my next visit.
