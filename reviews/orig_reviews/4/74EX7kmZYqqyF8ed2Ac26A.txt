I absolutely love Border Grill. It is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip. I especially love their weekend Border Brunch! With unlimited mimosa and all you can eat small plates, this restaurant is a must visit when in Vegas. Chef Mike's Bacon Jalapeno PBJ, Yucatan Egg Benedict and Churro Tot's are to die for! They have an outdoor patio and bar area that is perfect during the summer. Overlooking the Mandalay Bay pool, it always feels like you are on vacation!
