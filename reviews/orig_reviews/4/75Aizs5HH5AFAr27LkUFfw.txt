We very much enjoyed the street tacos, finding the portion to be satisfactory and the ingredients to be fresh.  The burrito bowl was excellent, but lacks lettuce if you like it.  I hold 1 star back because the rice and beans are a bit too heavily salted.  The staff is friendly and the restrooms are clean.
