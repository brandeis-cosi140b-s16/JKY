We went there for first time, had good food and great service. I liked the variety on the menu, little bit of everything to fit whatever you are in the mood for or can afford,  light to heavy, inexpensive to pricier.  I thought their drink prices were a little high (margaritas were around $8 or more and I thought they should be around $6 for a house marg), but the waiter told us they were still running happy hour, I had a couple of drafts and I was happy with those prices.  We'll go back again for sure, looking forward to it.  And there are lots of places in the valley we would NOT go back to.
