Very inexpensive and the Tacos are SO good I crave them every time I drive down 7th Ave. 

The service is excellent and the keep your chips & salsa full.  Not a big fan of Margaritas myself be everyone seems to like them.  They are pretty cheap too. I think $1.25? 

If you are in the area and are looking for a good Mexican meal, give it a try.
