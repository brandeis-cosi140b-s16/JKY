I've lived in the area for over 4 years and only recently discovered this place (too many great Mexican restaurants to choose from!) I've been twice and have enjoyed the food both times. Only giving 4 stars, though, because it's a little pricey for what it is. The sopapillas at the end are a nice touch.
