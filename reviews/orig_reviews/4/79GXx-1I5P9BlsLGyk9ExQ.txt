Fish tacos are very good

Guacamole is fantastic although the tortilla chips seemed like something only slightly better than you'd buy at the supermarket, which really confused me as the tortillas for the tacos were obviously freshly made in house.

Prices at lunch were reasonable by Vegas standards, dinner seemed high for what is essentially good-very good Mexican.
