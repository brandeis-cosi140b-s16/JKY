This is about on par for east valley chain restaurant Mexican food. Nothing spectacular but not bad. I have had a couple things here that were bad... Stay away from fried items. But the fajitas were decent and the chips and salsa can't be beat. Great prices and decent service. Overall, not a bad place to eat if you're in the area.
