Not too bad of a spot for decent Mexican food at our hotel. I'm currently staying at Mandalay Bay for the Interop 2010 tradeshow. Our first day on the floor for setup, we stopped here to grab some lunch. Main reason why I'm giving this place 4-Stars? The tortilla chips and salsa they serve before we order our entrees. Mmmmm mmmm yum! Chips were delicious! They had the right amount of salt and crunch to em! I ordered the rock shrimp tacos with jicama slaw. Really really yum, it also came out with red and green rice. I might have to stop by here again for lunch today since it's gonna be another long workday at the booth.
