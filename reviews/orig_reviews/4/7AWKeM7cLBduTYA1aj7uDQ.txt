Great tacos. Slightly more expensive than my usual taco place but the extra cost covers the nice, clean facility. Definitely worth the visit for slightly upscale facility and slightly upscale tacos. Will go back to try more soon. Only 4 stars because they seemed to take a while to get 4 tacos prepared and didn't put the same guacamole on all tacos. 2 tacos got actual guacamole and 2 tacos got a light green sauce the call avocado sauce. Also, the menu lists all the foods improperly. It lists tripas (intestine) as beef as well as other non beef choices. Maybe they think gringos don't understand Espanol
