I had a late night dinner at Macayo's. It was a very big place, and I went to sit at the "bar" area in the back with a friend of mine. 

We ordered two margaritas (mmm) and chicken chile burros. The service was good, the burros were good, and the margaritas definitely were good. Chips and salsa came with the order. Our waiter was kind as well.

The reason why I gave this place four stars instead of five was because the atmosphere was fairly loud, and I couldn't have much of a conversation with my friend. To be fair, it was a Friday night, and there were many people there. I would recommend coming here with a large group, because Macayo's can definitely accommodate many customers in their large areas.
