I thought the food was good here, esp. considering it's basically a sports bar restaurant. I was really surprised when I asked the hostess if they could make something vegetarian for me and she pulled out a vegan/vegetarian menu with maybe 8-10 items listed. This makes it easy for everyone. I pick out the item on this menu, the waiters don't need to know a lot about vegan vs. vegetarian, and they simply tell the chef what I picked out. The helpings are a little too generous, but nobody ever complains about having too much food left over to take home.
