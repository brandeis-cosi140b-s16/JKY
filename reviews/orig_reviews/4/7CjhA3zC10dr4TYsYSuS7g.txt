We really wanted to go to the Wicked Spoon buffet but we were too late. So we wandered around the Cosmo, starving. My boyfriend spotted this place and I was reluctant because I wasn't sure how Mexican/Chinese food were going to go together. After a disappointing meal the night before (see my Spago review), this was a pleasant surprise! Our server was super friendly and very helpful. We started off with the Happy Buddha Vegetable Spring Rolls and continued with the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice and Setas Tacos. Lastly, we ordered a noodle dish, which I don't recall the name of. It was DELICIOUS and spicy. Our tummys were certainly happy. The boyfriend also had a few of the Salt-Air Margaritas and I had a couple Mexican Mimosas (YUM). Very glad we ended up here.
