I love this place. 

I usually sit downstairs. It is almost like you are walking downstairs into a dungeon. The atmosphere is very warm and cozy, dim lighting. 

The menu is great for brunch, lunch  or dinner. But their happy hour is by far my favorite. Probably one of the best in the area. 
The appetizers and wine by the glass are only $5.00 each. Five dollars for high quality food, such as tuna wasabi sashimi, scallops wrapped in bacon, and steak tartare. And an amazing wine selection to choose from. 

This is a happy hour where you can eat a couple healthy, high protien items and drink a glass of good wine, all for under $20.00. 

Do not get me wrong, I would still go there any other time, other happy hour and pay double. Its well worth every dollar.
