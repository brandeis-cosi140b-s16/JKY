Order the Margarita!  Just make sure that you don't have anything to do after.  Fresh chips, salsa, and spicy bean dip to start, nice and greasy mexican pizza with shredded beef to finish.  Had to go home and sleep after this one.  While it may not be the cheapest, the huge portions and stiff drinks will keep me coming back.
