Mexigoodness!! 

I love this place. I come here a few times a month and never have a bad meal or a bad experience. The guys behind the counter are always friendly, the food is made to order and whatever you order is always flavorful. Last night I went in and a Mariachi band was playing!! They were awesome! 

The Vampiro is one of their specials and is always a good idea. Carnitas and fresh pineapple squished into cheesy fried tortilla goodness.They have tons of vegetarian options including the soyrizo tacos. I always order them with everything on them. Delicious!! I love the Mexican corn which is sweet corn with crema, cotija cheese and chili powder. So good. The salsas are all at a help yourself area and offer a variety of mild, medium and hot choices along with beans, veggies including marinated onions and fresh radish and lime. 

I always get the horchata with my meal. By far, the best I have ever had. The sweet cinnamon milky drink helps cool down the spicy flavors of your tacos or burrito. I'm not even embarrassed to admit I usually down three cup fulls. 

Try this place out, you'll love it.
