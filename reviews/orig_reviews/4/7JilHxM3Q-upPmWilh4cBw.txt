In the Henderson / Las Vegas area that is serious lacking in good Mexican restaurants, this is a small diamond in the rough.  My Mexican food critiques are biased against So-Cal / Orange County restaurants.  In that area, I'd give it 3 stars.  If you are in the Vegas area and are looking for a good restaurant, you probably wont want to pass this one up.  The service was excellent -  which is a big plus.  The food is above average.  I got the Carne Asada tacos which were very good and very authentic.  My wife got a cheese enchilada which was a little on the saucy side, but still good.  If you don't like Mariachi bands then you might not like this place, but I actually found it more entertaining than annoying (no trumpet player helps).
