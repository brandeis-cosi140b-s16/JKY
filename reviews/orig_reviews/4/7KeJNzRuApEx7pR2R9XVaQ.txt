I went on a Saturday around 3:30PM being drawn in by the allure of shade and outdoor misters. All of the front outdoor seats in the shade were already taken so I sat out back, near the bar. The inside decor is very hip and much more urban than I'd expected.

I ordered a trio of mini tacos which were divine and a house margarita. (Ok, make that two margaritas.) I almost fell of the chair when the bill came for a whopping $16. Happy hour specials apply even to table seating - not just for those seated at the bar.

My server was chipper as was the manager on duty who went out of their way to point out travel suggestions. Highly recommend!
