Holy cow I finally found spicy jerk chicken. Do not...I repeat, do not order the jerk chicken and the red diablo together with jerk fried rice, all were delicious, but together it felt like I had swallowed a live wolverine. I love the combinations here.

the girl got teriaki and red jade chicken which i tried and both were also quite yummy.

The only regret I have is not ordering a dozen snickerdoodles to go. Jesus those things taste like angels! We will be back far too often i am sure.
