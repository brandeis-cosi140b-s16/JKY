Went today for Taco Tuesday and got 2 tacos, rice and beans for $6. My son got a free nino quesadilla which was nice. The chile beef and sweet pork are both very good. The rice and beans were flavorful. My favorite thing was the fresh tortilla it's on, so good! The restaurant was crowded but the line moved quickly and there were clean tables available. I can't speak to customer service as we had no problems but we will definitely be back for the food.
