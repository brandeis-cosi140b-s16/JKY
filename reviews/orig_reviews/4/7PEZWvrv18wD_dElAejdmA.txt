My mom & I treated ourselves on a trip to Las Vegas this past fall, and it was so worth it. The service was top notch. Our server was forthcoming with recommendations and extremely sweet. The drinks were to die for delicious and our food was divine. I had a pork belly dish (the special - can't recall the name) and my mom had the Green Chicken Poblano Enchiladas. Both were delicious, though I slightly preferred the enchiladas. This was my first time at a Susan Feniger/Mary Sue Milliken restaurant and I was completely satisfied. I also loved that the restaurant overlooks the beautiful Mandalay Bay pool area. Really nice atmosphere.
