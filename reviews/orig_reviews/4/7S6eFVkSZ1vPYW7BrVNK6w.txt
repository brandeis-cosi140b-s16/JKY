This is why I love MGM, so many wonderful restaurant choices. We were craving Mexican, so we started out with a Cadillac Margarita ($14.00 each), which was very STRONG!!! So Yummy though. The Guacamole was nothing special, very small portion for $12.00. The Chips and Salsa are plentiful, and I like that they give you 3 different kinds of Salsas to choose from. My BF ordered the Taquitos, cause the chips, salsa and guacamole were very filling. He loved them. They are the perfect serving and size and have a very yummy taco sauce over them. I ordered the Enchiladas. Very good sauce, and large serving size for my size. haha.....I was overly full when I left, which kind of ruined it for me, but overall, they have great food. Just don't overeat, cause it doesn't feel good when in Vegas!
