I love when you walk into a place and they have like 5 tables inside and like 20 outside.  It's a true sign of a successful mom and pop place to me.  

So... had our party of six outside... it was nice, green grass around, and it was cool at the time.

The server was pleasant and she goofed off with us... there was one time she took forever to get my beer and she comped it for me, without me even complaining about anything.

The chile relleno was really good, and I was hugely surprised at how good the beans and rice were.  

Hubby had the carnitas and being a mexican himself, he's pretty critical of any mexican food and he loved the carnitas.
