Mexican food is never my go to cuisine. Working in a couple of Mexican restaurants has lead me to not actively seek it. I know for once it is an Asian working in the Mexican restaurant instead of the other way around. Every once in a while I do crave for it though. Today, one of my friends from work wanted to get lunch before he had to go to the airport. 

I got a barbacoa salad with the vinaigrette. The option for whole wheat tortillas is a welcomed addition. I am not sure why a salad comes with it. Just seems like a huge open face burrito now. I like how they load up with cilantro, lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, and even give a slice of lime. What I listed only comprises half of the ingredients available. They have monterey jack, cheddar and cojita cheese, and tortilla strips. 

This is a perfect meal for two or for one broke college student.
