The food is so good. I had the Al Pastor and chicken tacos and they were packed with with guacamole, sour cream and all the fixings. They were delicious. I also tried the carne asada quesadilla, no fatty pieces and it tasted great. My favorite thing about this place, however, is the salsa bar... I don't know what kind of salsas they were in particular but the light and dark green salsas were AMAZING. All the others were great too, it also has grilled and raw chopped onions, grilled peppers and black AND pinto beans. You have to try this place.
