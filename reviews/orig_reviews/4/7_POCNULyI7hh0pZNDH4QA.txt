I really love this place!  It is just a smidge below a 5-star rating... and I'll be returning often, so I'll update if it makes the leap to super-5-stardom.  

We have eaten at Gallo Blanco for breakfast and at least 4-5 dinners.  Husband mentioned that he thinks their menu is a bit limited, but I tend to disagree.  I think it is innovative with enough of a selection to keep it interesting.  

Our meals have ranged from yummy to to-die-for deliciousness.  We have NEVER gotten anything less than great food.  However, there have been a few inconsistencies... my husband has ordered the chilaquiles on 4 occasions (creature of habit?) and has loved them each time... but they have been slightly different each time.  Maybe the cooking time is a little longer/shorter sometimes, but it can have a big effect on the end product (regardless, they were still fantastic, even if inconsistent).  Our favorite items have been ANY torta, the chilaquiles, and the guac.  I'm a huge fan of fruit in my guac (thanks to the introduction to pomegranate seeds in my guac at Barrio) - and the oranges were a delightful surprise.  The only thing I haven't loved is the honeydew agua fresca, and the horchata can be a bit hit-or-miss with flavor.

We have had nearly every waiter/waitress that works at Gallo Blanco over our many visits, and we have had NEARLY consistently good service.  There was just one visit that went a terrible I-need-to-call-your-manager-the-next-day way... and after said phone call was made (which, I promise, was a first for us!), all was made right.  We were so delighted that the management really heard our issue(s) and made us feel like coming back - which we have and will continue to do. 

I really hope that this place has more staying power then it's predecessors... we will continue to frequent it, bring friends and out-of-towners, and recommend to all.
