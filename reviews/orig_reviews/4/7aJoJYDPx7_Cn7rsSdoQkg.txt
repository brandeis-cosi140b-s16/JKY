We split a jerk chicken wing appetizer, it was tasty enough. I am a fan of the 'avocado cream', which I have not had before now. I had the Al Pastor burrito, I liked that the pineapple was roasted. My friend had the Carnitas burrito, which I was not as much of a fan of because it was a little bland / subtler... not really citrusy at all.
