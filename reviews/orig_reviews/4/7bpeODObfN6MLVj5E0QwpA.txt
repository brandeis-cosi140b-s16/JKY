I've heard about this place for years and finally made my way down the stairs!  We were deciding to go out, somewhere between Arcadia and Union Hills.  Many names came to mind like Richardson's ( so sad to hear of the fire!) , Dick's Hideaway, Bomberos, but we decided on the Rokerij.  

The staff is friendly, attentive and on it!  There are only 3 tables for dining downstairs and there was a wait, which is fine.  We noshed on the stuffed  mushrooms and bacon wrapped shrimp while lounging on the sofa near the fireplace.  They had ESPN on and the Tour recaps were looping, music playing at a nice level and it wasn't crowded at all.  We had a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, perfect with the apps.

Great experience overall - I will return!
