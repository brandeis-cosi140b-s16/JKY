I've been trying to get to this place for almost a year now.  It is in a general area that I go to at least once or twice a week - Costco, K. O'Donnells, Golfsmith, Four Peaks, etc.  but it seems that I just am never around there when I want a light lunch or quick bite to eat. I finally made it!!

It is a delightful little restaurant located in the strip mall behind K. O'Donnells and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. It reminds me of a taco stand in a building.  The first time I was there, I made it for lunch - and I could see why it has so many good reviews. The line was out the front door, but they simply take your order and you find a table to wait until it is done.  Although it was crowded, I did find a table, and was able to watch as they served lunch - very efficient, very friendly. 

The food is delicious, made with fresh ingredients while you wait.  The menu is large.  I have tried the blackened chicken burrito, carne asada tacos, blackened chicken quesadillas, and, of course, the Dos Equis - all were great.  They also have a breakfast menu, and children's menu.

They have several salsas available, but once I found out they had Habanero salsa, I knew I loved this place.  For those that like less fire, they do have both green and red salsa, of varying hotness.   

I have only given 4 stars as I haven't tried everything I want to.  So now I will work through their menu - it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. But with Dos Equis, I will persevere.
