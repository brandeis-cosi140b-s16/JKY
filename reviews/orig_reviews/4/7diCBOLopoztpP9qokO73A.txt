I've been going to Carolinas for almost ten years starting with the location in downtown Phoenix. While I still hold that this location isn't quite the same, it is still very delicious. Green chili burrito, red beef tamale, and a machaca taco are all solid choices for lunch or dinner. The beans are amazing. Whatever you get, get rice and beans, promptly mix together and mouthgasm.
