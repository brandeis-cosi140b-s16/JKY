We stopped in for dinner last week after the Michael Jackson ONE show.  It was fast, tasty and in between the Mandalay Bay and our hotel.  The chips and salsa were addictive, so the entrees couldn't come out soon enough or I wouldn't have any appetite left.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and really enjoyed my meal - super tasty!
