The food & drinks were good. The only issue is I didn't feel any of the food items were really fresh.  The salsa felt like a good quality jar salsa. Or maybe a jar salsa that has been modified.  Food items as well. The beef felt overlooked. As if it's been prepared before and was cooked once more to be served hot. Price was of course not cheap! We ended up paying $120 for 3 drinks and 2 good items. Tax and 20% tip. Which is decent for a fine place like Javier's. But again, I wasn't impressed enough to wanna spend $60 per person and go there again.  
By the way our server was nice-ish..! I mean she was professional but not friendly at all. I mean she probably didn't smile one bit! But she was professional. And I'm a softie so she got the 20% tip!
I have my eye on the SLS Vegas (#SLSVegas) to open next week. I wanna try all my fave restaurants that they have: #katsuya sushi, #cleo Mediterranean, & #bazaar by Jose Andreas.
