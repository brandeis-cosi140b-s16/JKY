Thank you yelpers once again! We were looking for a taco place to eat while we were in Las Vegas this past weekend. After reading all the reviews, we decided to try Tacos El Gordo. 

As we were walking up to the place we noticed it was packed. That is always a good sign. There were also a lot of Mexican people there, usually another good sign. As busy as it was, the line went quickly. The menu is pretty simple and I chose the asada tacos and the adobada tacos. They were filled with meat, onion, cilantro, salsa and an avocado green sauce. It was almost hard to pick them up since they had so much meat in them. I like they don't skimp on the meat :) Both tacos were very good, although I liked the adobada better.

I highly recommend that if you're in Vegas and you feel like tacos you hit this place up.
