The Stand exists in a time/space warp that makes it sound like "Wouldn't It Be Nice" is always playing. You're slightly concerned a seagull might jack your fries. There's just a little bit of sand under your nails. It's several decades ago. 

Time moves slower, service moves correspondingly. Burgers and fries are done simply and well, with no attempts at extra flare - unless you count Stand Sauce. It's not bare bones, it's classic in a way that makes one nostalgic for the idea of a time they may or may not have actually lived in. 

Overall, it's a welcome helping of affordable simplicity in a culinary wonderland neighborhood laden with more expensive, modern burger-things.
