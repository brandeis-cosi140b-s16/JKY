This local Mexican joint is down the road from me a such a gem to the neighborhood!

While putting in my order, the nice lady upfront gave me lots of good suggestions. She took such initiative, I was almost certain she was the owner. Upon asking her if this was her store, she shook her head and said that she was just a staff. If only all businesses had staff like her! Turns out you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. Our group of friends ordered just about everything and let our forks fly without borders.

The portions are splendidly gianormous. Order a platter and split that sucker in half to save for later. I love big portions- it means I don't have to cook lunch for work the next day! All orders also come with 'special' bread. Dip the bread in a tub of honey and you'll feel like you just entered into carb mecca. What a wonderful feeling it is!
