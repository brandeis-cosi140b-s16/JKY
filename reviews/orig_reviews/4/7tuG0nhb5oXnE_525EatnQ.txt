We accidentally found this small unassuming but attractive restaurant when nearby Davio was closed. Standard Mexican fare with some innovative twists. I had fried duck - often a risky choice in any restaurant - the tendency is that the duck is not fresh or over-cooked and dry. I was pleasantly surprised to encounter moist tasty duck meat with delicious side order of mashed potatoes. Salad was fresh - a bit lemony as per Mediterranean taste. Corn soup was tasty but too salty as is typical of Pittsburgh restaurants. Chocolate hazel nut cheesecake was good but a too sweet for my liking. Excellent friendly service. Highly recommended.
