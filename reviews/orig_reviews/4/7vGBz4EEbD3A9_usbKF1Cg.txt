Love this tex-mex restaurant. The tacos, especially Paco's taco, a brisket taco, cannot be beat. Unfortunately, they "had" the best fish taco, but changed the recipe and the new one is not the same caliber. When choosing a restaurant I look for drink specials, quality of food, and atmosphere. This place hits all 3 well! Would prefer TV viewing from all tables in case a game is on and I want to post up. There can be a wait and not always able to get my preference of table to meet this goal.
