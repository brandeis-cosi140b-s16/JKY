Food is good.  Great for happy hour (but often extremely crowded).  You can see the woman making corn tortillas from scratch.  I've only eaten in the bar and during happy hour.  The tacos and appetizer platter are very good.  The happy hour margarita is a good deal, don't miss Cinco de Taco on the 5th of every month.
