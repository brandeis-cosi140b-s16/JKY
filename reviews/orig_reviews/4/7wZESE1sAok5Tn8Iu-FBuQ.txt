There are certain places that are like an old friend.  That is how I feel about going to this location of Macayos.

The food isn't the best Mexican food in the valley but it is consistent.  I can say that, I've been eating there since they opened this location.  I happen to like the type of Mexican food they serve.  I have no problem with ground beef as opposed to the  shredded beef they serve at other places that gets under my bridgework and drives me nuts.

I can't tell you much about the drinks which seem important to many people.  The strongest I do is cranberry juice with actual lime juice which the actually remember to do when I ask for it at Macayos.  Cranberry juice with a few crushed limes doesn't do it for me.  I used the brain God gave me and stopped drinking alcohol years ago but I still like something at least with some flavor...

It is a good place to take friends when you just want to have a pleasant meal and talk.  Consistently, the wait staff is pretty jovial and most have been there for awhile.  The interior is in keeping with this same laid back attitude.  It isn't fancy but who is going to eat the interior?
