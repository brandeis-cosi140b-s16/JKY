If you are a Mexican of heart, then I probably won't recommend you to go to the Chipotle. This is a Mexican restaurant with an "American fusion"  lol... Although, it is not 100% authentic Mex is  great for the buck. You cannot go wrong with any item from the menu; they offer burritos, tacos, salads and bowls (my favorite). You can select the type of meat, the spiciness of the sauce, white or brown rice, pico de gallo, corn, sour cream, cheese, well you get the point!  Fast service so you will be in and out of this place.This restaurant is great but, I wouldn't recommend it as a spot for your first date! lol
