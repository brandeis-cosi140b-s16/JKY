Okay so this was my 2nd time here at Diablo's Cantina. Once we got out of the No Doubt Concert once again it was past midnight and again too late to hit any of the clubs I was on guestlist for. I had been here before and knew it was a good atmosphere. Highlights women are free, it's an open air bar so plenty of cool breeze, great margarita's, free shots from the hot girls dancing on the bar, and the music is a great mix of hip-hop, house, reggeaton, salsa, everything. It's two levels, upstairs is more of a lounge feel, while down stairs is more of a bar atmosphere. However you can dance either upstairs or downstairs. Good eye candy from a buffet of guys.( meaning a variety of races). No complaints about Diablo's Cantina. I love this place!!
