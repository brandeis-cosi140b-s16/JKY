I have gone to Vida twice in the last month.  Both visits were pretty good.  I enjoy the fresh made tortilla chips and salsa.  They provide those endlessly!! The lunch combos are very good.  Only challenge is getting to Vida without having challenges with parking.  Otherwise all good.  Great service.  And delivery time for lunch was very quick.  Have to go back again soon!  But will take the shuttle!!
