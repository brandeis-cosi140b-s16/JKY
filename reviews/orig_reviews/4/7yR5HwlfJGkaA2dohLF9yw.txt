BLACK CHERRY MOJITO. yes! 

We ate here just a week ago on a Saturday night and the place was hoppin'. No doubt being located in the Mandalay Bay during a convention is going to pack this place whether it is good or not. But thankfully, this was time and money well spent.

The black cherry mojito was a refreshing signature drink. I had the chicken enchiladas and ate the whole thing a long with some of my friend's tacos. Everything was delicious!

The service was great and we even joined their locals discounts club which I'll actually come back and use. Be careful of the tortilla chips served at the beginning. They're really addictive and filling.

If you manage to hang out at the Mandalay wave pool and float on the river all day... and then come here for a hearty meal. Your day is golden.
