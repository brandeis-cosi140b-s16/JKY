They would get 5 stars if they had a more effects ordering system. There's 3 different lines depending on what type of meat you prefer. So for example, if you want carne asada, tripa, and adobada then you'll have to stand in 3 different lines. So either don't be in a hurry or bring ppl with you to help you stand in line. That being said, I only come here for the Adobada (al pastor or spicy pork). This is by far my favorite taco that I've ever had. Make sure to get the fresh pi√±a (pineapple) pieces on your taco. The sweet, savory and slightly spicy go well together. 

Avoid the Saturday lunch hours the lines are very long.
