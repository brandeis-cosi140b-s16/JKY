I have past this place a million times and always wanted to stop and I finally did. It was good. The only thing that was fabulous was the cheese crisp. It was actually crispy must places its just a soft tortilla with cheese, I can do that in my own microwave. I didn't have the refried beans but they looked watery and not so good. I enjoyed this place and will come back but besides the cheeses crisp it was average but good.
