Food is very good here, Specials are often superb. I have had the Carne Adovada which is very good. They used to have an excellent rib eye, and I was quite miffed when they stopped selling them. The waiter told me they could not get a consistent product and cost were high. I find that hard to believe but whatever.

I have also tried the Habanero cheese burger. This is not for the faint of heart. I tried it 2 times. The first time it was not as hot as I expected. I did see another older couple who both ordered it and it was quite humorous (to me) the husband took one bite and got this very unhappy face, and never took another bite. his wife ate the whole thing.

The second time it was definitely hotter, almost too hot for me to eat. I was sweating up a storm. but it was very good. If you think you like spicy food watch out this burger is way hotter than you think. If you think taco bell is spicy then don't even think of trying this burger.

I would like to see their menu change more often, and maybe serve more dishes with lamb chops. Bring back the rib eye!

All the margaritas are excellent here.
