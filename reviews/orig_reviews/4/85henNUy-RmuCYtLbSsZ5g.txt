I ended up at this restaurant because of a recent livingsocial.com deal.  It turned out to be a great buy and allowed me to find some "authentic" mexican food in Phoenix.

I was really pleased with this restaurant, and will definitely return.

For starters, the chips and salsa were excellent.  And you can have as much as you want, without being charged for an extra basket of chips.

I ordered a combo plate with tamale, taco, and cheese enchilada.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything was great.  The enchilada was my favorite part of the dish, and I will definitely stick with this next time.  The tamale was very good for a restaurant tamale, and would hold up with any home made tamale out there.  The taco was not the best.  the meat was a little overcooked do to the deep frying of the shell, but it was still good.  Just not my personal favorite.

The enchilada was very good.  You could taste the home made tortillas and the red sauce was very tasty.  Definitely recommend.

The rice was very good and authentic.  The beans were ok, but not the best I have ever had.

All in all, this is the best mexican food I have had so far in Phoenix.  It only gets 4 stars though, because I have had much better in other cities.  But so far, I have not found better in Phoenix. 

 This will definitely be a frequently visited spot to satisfy my craving for authentic mexican food.
