Richardson's is wonderful! It is so cozy and romantic. Generations of love birds have enjoyed dates at Richardson's and hopefully many more to come! I am vegetarian and I always get the Garlic Pizza. It is just sooooooooo good. There are limited items on the menu for vegetarians but so worth it!! Music is good, atmosphere is good, food is good!

Love it.
