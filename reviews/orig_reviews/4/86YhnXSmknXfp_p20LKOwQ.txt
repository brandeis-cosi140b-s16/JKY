I had a Groupon for Baja Joes so four of us went for dinner during our Girls Weekend.  The others are right - this place is a little difficult to find - but well worth it.  A small place with bright ocean murals on the wall and an extensive menu of traditional mexican dishes and many seafood dishes.   I had the shrimp veracruz which comes with a mild red sauce.  The shrimp were some of the best I've ever eaten.  The tableside guacamole was also very good but a little expensive at $8.00.  The others raved about their chicken and shrimp fajitas also.  Other than the guacamole, the prices were very reasonable.

I will definitely go back.
