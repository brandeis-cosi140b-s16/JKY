Chile relleno's ordered today for lunch buried in green sauce.  Served hot and tasted wonderful.  Chips were flavorful as well.  Will return upcoming for lunch.  Just wish the d√©cor was wasn't so "strip mall" and served more adult oriented beverages to make this a dinner place with friends on occasion.
