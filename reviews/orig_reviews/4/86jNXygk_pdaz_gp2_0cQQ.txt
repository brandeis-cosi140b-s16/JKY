Really great tacos!  The fish and carne asada tacos taste fresh and delicious, al beit small, but they are only $2 each so order as many as you like!

The chips and quac are perfect!  I love thick crunchy not too greasy but just enough chips and the guac is FRESH, real and as posted has a tint of oranges in there-- so good.

I also had the frijoles and holy moly frijole- they were gooood.

My friend had the elote-con queso and said was was fabulous.

It is a simply clean menu with high quality taste-- 

I can't wait to plan a get together with friends there and have some drinks and food too!  This trip was food only. 

Not to mention the breakfast menu had me craving eggs really bad.
