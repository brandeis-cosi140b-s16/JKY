We've gone to BQ twice in the past couple of months and both times the food has been very good and the service has been outstanding.  The meals arrive hot, the ingredients are fresh, and the portion sizes are more than adequate; I'm not a drinker so I'm not qualified to give a personal review on that, although a friend of mine was very happy with the wine she ordered with her meal.  The second time we went our helpful waiter (forgot the name, a very nice and efficient Hispanic kid who was always muy rapido with the drink refills) was making the fresh tableside guacamole and apologized for what he felt were poor quality avocados, he actually went back to retrieve some others which - according to him - weren't any better.  He apparently has an eye for avocado detail because the guac was not as good as our first visit, but certainly not terrible (3 out of 5 for the guac; 4-1/2 out of 5 our first visit).

The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, but don't go here with a Del Taco budget in mind.

BQ is located in downtown Gilbert which means it's safe and family friendly practically by default.  I always see plenty of Gilbert PD cruising up and down Gilbert Road which, when you stop by for a late meal, gives you added peace of mind.  I'm not implying that Gilbert is Maryvale, it's actually 180 degrees different; the fact that they're driving around is a good thing as they're not stopping to toss ne'er do wells and derelicts into the paddy wagon like you see every 20' in downtown Tempe.
