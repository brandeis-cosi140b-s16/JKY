There's so much to love about this rustic place. The outdoor patio is so relaxing & it's nice to just watch the swans & ducks in the small pond. The black birds are having a good time too watching the customers below them, just waiting for us to get up so they could swoop down to snatch a chip. Speaking of chips, they are nice & thin but this time they weren't warm, even when we asked for fresh ones, a pity. The 3 salsa's they put on the tables are all delicious, my favorite is the avocado green chili. We always order the Carne Asada Chimi, the steak is perfectly marinated & tender, it's diced with peppers & onions & there is a lot of it in the chimichanga. We get it topped with their excellent fundido sauce & I'm happy to write that they put a lot of sauce. The refried beans are better than most places in Phoenix & the rice IS better than anywhere else. This place is definitely worth the drive. The only bad thing for me is that they have Coke products & we are Pepsi people. Sometimes you can get a good Coke mix on tap & that was true with the regular Coke but that was not so with the diet Coke, it was a little flat. The fried ice cream was an ample portion & made with cinnamon ice cream & had strawberries on top but the shell was too chewy & tough for me, I would like to see Cinnamon Toast Crunch used as the shell instead of Corn Flakes because it's crunchier & tastier too.
