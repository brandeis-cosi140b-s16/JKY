I go here once a week.  Staff have always been awesome.  Ive had mistakes happen (which is going to happen) and the service recovery has been excellent.  I always get a quesadilla with grilled chicken.  (it did suck when they started upcharging $1.50 just for grilling chicken) Otherwise, everyone is terrific and the food is right on.  Def give it a try if you haven't.  Oh! and in and out in under 30 minutes!
