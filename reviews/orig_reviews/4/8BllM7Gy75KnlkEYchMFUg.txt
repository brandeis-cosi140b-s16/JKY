Colleagues from India, UK, NY and locally enjoyed Valle Luna. 

While no table was promised, a table for 7 overlooking the "Lake" was ready when we arrived.

Good authentic margaritas. Abundant chips and salsa with an appetizer of guacamole. Made two ways, one regular and one hot.

We chose Fajitas, Chili Relleno, and chicken enchiladas.

Larges portions, most (but not all) staff were friendly , and good value.

Outdoor seating with view of lake...perfect for the cooler evening.

Moment of humor: one colleague ordered a drink of Baileys Irish Cream on ice. Order was met with disbelief. Two people came out to double-check that's what he really wanted. Guess they don't get too many orders for this stuff.

PS Can't say how Valle Luna compares with other area Tex-Mex...but infinitely better than anything in NYC.

Would return. See pics.
