Rokerij
Made reservaton for 3 PM Mother's Day, but no need, as Rokerij was not on the collective conscious MD list and thus plenty of open tables. The entertainment lawyer from LA turned waiter 4 months previous seemed quite pleasant and pleased to be in his new role and will only become more refined and astute. Just don't bring up Guns N Roses around him...

(Throughout we were attended to by other friendly staff who seemed to get along well with each other, carrying on light banter within ear shot.)

A gentle reminder to all establishments as we enter the "warm" season, please keep a vigilant eye on our water glasses. Sometimes even 30 seconds of ice only at the bottom of a glass can cause mild anxiety.

There were 5 different, occasionally overlapping menus (Rokerji's own lunch, breakfast, dinner; Dick's Hideaway; Richardsons) on the table, as well as colorful chalkboards on the walls full of specials. Choice overload.

We settled into a nice, earthy Firestone cab for me, bellini cocktail for my love, homemade lemonaid for teen daughter, and tea for mother-in-law, followed by calamari and tomato bruschetta for pre meal. All eliciting satisfying, "Mmmm's!" from a family not known for the gift of describing presentations and flavors in poetic, food critic terms.

Main courses were blackened Mahi w/ beets and trout w/ green beans (2 separate specials from the board) Pasta Heidi, chicken,beef,shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. we all shared, compared and enjoyed. 3 of the 4 dishes are on the spicey good side.. The trout was purposely tame for wife's mother.

Passed up dessert because someone in the party was jonesing for Costco's strawberry swirl and I was set on buying one of those propane tanks with a gauge (refer to pre-Mother's day grilling malfunction); my reward for pulling off - for the first time in a few years - a successful Mother's Day outing.

Thanks, Rokerij. Hope to see you again soon.
