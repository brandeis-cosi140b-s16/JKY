If you want cheap margaritas and great chips and salsa, this place has Ritas for 1.75! I think they put celery salt in their very mild but tasty table sauce, which is especially nice along with the margaritas. 
All of the food on the menu is good. Not really down-home mexican, more like down-home chicano, but still delicious in it's own right.
The eggplant enchiladas are pretty good, but they have this light chicken burro plate with cabbage and celery and a really good peppery vinaigrette, that I discovered I preferred without the tortilla, and this is my staple when I visit Mi Patio.
This is a really great place to get tipsy and fed with friends if you happen to live walking distance.... the waiter bought my friend and I a shot after one or two of our meals.... I guess he knew I would tip him for it! :-)

This place is always nice and cool on a hot summer day.

This kind of private business should stay in business. This kind of sweat and kindness should be rewarded by our patronage.
Everyone smiles here with real love.... or maybe it is tequila?
