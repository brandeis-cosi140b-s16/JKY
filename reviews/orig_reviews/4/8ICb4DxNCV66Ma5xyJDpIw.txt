When Yelpers start flooding a place, there's a good chance you will not be disappointed. I thought I was trying a new, hidden establishment on Tropicana and Pecos.  It's new, but it is not a secret--Yelpers will find good food! 

ORGANIZATION: The best thing about Taco Taco is the organization and service. Unlike so many taco spots in town where you may wait around in confusing "lines" shouting out jumbled orders, there are large signs directing hungry customers.You simply look up and find the item you want to order and head to that (well marked) line. Easy.

SERVICE: Better even than the signage is the service. Every employee is helpful and warm. I've been back a few times and each time the employees have greeted me with a smile and a warm disposition. It's funny how a smile goes a long a way. From the folks making the tacos to the cashiers, there is a professionalism about this place that I enjoy and respect. You don't have to break into side conversations or endure any annoyance from put upon employees here. Someone has done some training here; the attention to service gives this place an advantage over many others in town.

FOOD: The food is solid. The taco meat is well seasoned.  I had some minor quibbles with texture and depth of flavor, but the food offerings that I tried (tacos and vampiros) were good. 

ALL IN ALL: This place is clean and well lit. They've got a great corner spot in a quiet neighborhood strip mall and I will definitely be back. The food is good and the service is excellent.
