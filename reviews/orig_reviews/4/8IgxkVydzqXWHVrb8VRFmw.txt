Friend suggested we head to Barrio Cafe for Happy Hour...and we did just that. We ordered a few items off of the Happy Hour menu and enjoyed a few drinks. We pretty much had the dining room area to ourselves. Tasty. No complications just a great time. Barrio Cafe never disappoints. For all those that have had bad experiences here, I hope I never go to BC with you...I'd hate for you to jinx my meal! Cheers***
