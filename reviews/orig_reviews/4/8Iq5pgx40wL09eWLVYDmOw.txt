After watching an episode of "Hairy Bikers" on H2 where they are introduced to Barbacoa (cow head) tacos, I had the opportunity to try them also today for lunch here! 

I was able to order a large burrito with a combination of tongue and head meat and was it delicious!!  While these were two separate meat items on the menu, I was able to combine them into the burrito when I asked the gentleman taking my order who I understood to be the owner of the place.  He seemed impressed than someone who was not Hispanic (I'm Asian) was ordering this type of meats.  He told me this combo was one of his favorites and I soon found out why!  It's my new favorite burrito or taco filling!!   

The meat was juicy and tender, and not bit off tasting or gristly like when I ordered the Carne Asada tacos next door at Tacos El Gordo, whose tacos I also love.  

If you do not think of the source of the meat, you would never know by the taste!  My two tablemates were a little grossed out, but they don't know what they were missing
