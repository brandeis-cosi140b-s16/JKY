Oh my dear!  Like Mexico, Jamacia and China did the tango on my tongue.  Being a first timer,  I was guided through the menu by a Chino Bandido expert.  I was intrigued by the unorthodox flavor combinations.  Honestly,  I'm not sure how fried rice, emerald chicken (ginger, green onion,  salt) and cuban beans could work together on a plate, but they do!  And those cookies....so yummy.  I'll be back soon to try something completely different.
