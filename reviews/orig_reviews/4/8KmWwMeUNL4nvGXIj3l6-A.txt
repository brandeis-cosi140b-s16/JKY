Alcohol + tacos = best decision ever.  

This was an event organized by the conference I was at. half price tacos and two for one margaritas. You can already see where this night went. 

Tried the ribeye, carnitas, and breaded lobster soft tacos. Split everything with my brother. Loved the carnitas the best personally, but I think my brother preferred the ribeye. Couldn't go wrong with the margaritas at all.

It was hopping because of how many people from the conference that were there, so service took a bit. Can't complain too much because we enjoyed the drinks and the scenery. 

They do have a mechanical bull on the main floor that has a weight limit, much to my little brother's dismay. 

Great food on the pricy side without the special. Still worth checking out for the good eats.
