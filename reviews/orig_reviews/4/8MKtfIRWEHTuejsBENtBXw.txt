This is one of the other taco place that hits me right at home. I mostly come here during the night time because its really one of the only taco places open late (please do not compare to Filibertos!!). Menu is pretty simple chicken or carne asada, awesome prices too! Also I love where they cook and cut the meat, it's like a food cart on steroids...HUGE and impressive. Out late and around the area don't miss out on this place.
