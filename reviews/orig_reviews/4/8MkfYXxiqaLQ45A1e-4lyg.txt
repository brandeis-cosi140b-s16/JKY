If ever there was a restaurant I could dream of picking up and taking with me to whatever city I end up living it would be Rockerji.

I have such a special spot for this establishment, from their New Zealand Sauv. Blanc list to their green chili potato side Rockerji know's what's up.

As I've frequented this restaurant more times than I can keep track of, I hadn't sat down to really appreciate them in the form of a Yelp review.  I owe you one, Rockerji.

My last visit to Rockerji, and I'm assuming this will be my last for quite sometime since I'm moving across the country next week, was nothing short of incredible.  It was a celebratory meal honoring a job offer so of course drinks were in order.  We started out with glasses of the crisp and ever so light White Haven Sauvaignon Blanc as well as the Ahi Tuna appetizer.  Now you should be warned, all the plates at Rockerji have a bit of a kick...a spicy, not overboard flavor punch.

The crew I was with opted on a barbeque pizza for the table and 3 plates served "family style".

It's almost sinful to not order the bacon-wrapped scallops and the beef tenderloin brie toasts, no but really - you'll be repenting for days. 

We also had the chicken taco's which are spicier than the average person can handle (eater's beware).

For dessert we enjoyed the flourless cake which could serve a family of 8, I promise.  The chocolate was perfect consistency and is paired ever so nicely with a vanilla bean ice cream.

Great, intimate date spot or laid-back foodie haven.
