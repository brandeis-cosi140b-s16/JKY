Buyers BEWARE!! The tacos really are good. They come with beans and cheese in addition to the meat, but they will CHARGE YOU EXTRA: $1 for no beans, then she'll ask if you want everything on it and they'll add an additional $1.85! All of a sudden your taco ends up costing you $6.35!! Yet the nachos were only $3.50. Weird. Over all the food was really good. I just didn't appreciate the extra charges.
