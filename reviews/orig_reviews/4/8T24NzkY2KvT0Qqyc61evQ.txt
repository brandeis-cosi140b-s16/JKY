Omg this place is delicious! Tacos al pastor all the way! Their salsa bar ! Don't get me started, I love their salsa bar. I hate it when other taco places hog their salsa in the back and make you ask for extra and then give you the tiniest plastic containers! Not here! Open salsa bar for everyone ! Lol their quesadillas are awesome , I wish I lived across the street i'd come here way more!
