As my Californian friend said, she only eats Mexican food when she's back in LA.  Well, here in Vegas, which is close to LA, I've discovered that I can find a good authentic Mexican restaurant east of LA.

My recommendation is the shrimp with their special chili pepper sauce and the carne tampiquena.  Their tortillas are freshly made and best of all, the price is right!
