I've ate here several times and I have never had a bad experience. Service is good, not great, but good. The food is good for their prices, and they serve pretty good sized portions. My favorites are the fajitas, chipotle enchiladas, and the flautas. But my main reason for coming to Chevys is their micheladas, some of the best I've had.
