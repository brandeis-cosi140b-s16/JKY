This location is near my house but there is the original location neary my work.  We order from them all the time at work.  I must eat here at least once a wekk.  I think they have been in business for over 50 yrs. Seriously, I can't get enough of this place.  Sometimes i get withdrawls.
I usually order #9 with all rice no beans and 1 chix 1 beef.  
Their tortillas are super sinful. you know they have lard in them but who cares..when they are good.  I've also tired the corn and beef tamales.  They also sell them by the dozen frozen too.  It's great during the holidays.  i tried to first cook them in the microwave..lets just say not a bright idea.  It turns out perfect in the rice cooker.  
I also like their chocolate chimichangas.  totally sinful..
