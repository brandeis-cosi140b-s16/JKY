I'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor. One of those benefits is the food served at Z'Tejas, and I will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on Tex-Mex. 

This is what you need to order (no exceptions): 

1. Drinks: Chambord Margarita 
2. Appetizer: Cornbread (so moist!) 
3. Entree: Seafood Enchiladas 
4. Dessert: Berry Cobbler. 

You will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food. But, and trust me on this one, you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive. I would have literally licked the cobbler pan if I was not in public. 

Your pants will be bursting to make up for the weight that your wallet loses over the course of this meal.
