We've been waiting for Bobby to reopen his restaurant since they closed. I'm glad they are open again and we can enjoy some of the finest Mexican food in Vegas!  They've only been open a week and you can tell they're working a few links out, but for the most part, they are back up to speed with the old place. I highly recommend you check this place out if you are looking for honest, straightforward Mexican cuisine with fresh ingredients!
