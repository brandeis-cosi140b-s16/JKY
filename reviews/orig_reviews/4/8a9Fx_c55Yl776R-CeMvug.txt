We had a fun time with our party of seven on a Friday evening. I really like the high beam rafters, the blue earth tone colors throughout, the cute hostess dresses and the striped shirts that the wait staff wears.

We had a blood orange margarita, pomegranate margarita and fresh chips w/tasty guacamole & salsa. I would opt for the blood orange margie- refreshing, zesty with a bitter sweet flavor. We had multiple bartenders, all very friendly & engaging.

For dinner we moved from the bar, to an outside table.  Paul our accommodating waiter, did a nice job of taking us through a delicious dinner. We all had various sea food items and loved it.

This is a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene with terrific people watching.

Muy bien Blanco!
