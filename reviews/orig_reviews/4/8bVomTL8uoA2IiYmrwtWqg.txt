I've dined at Border Grill 3 times and I've never been disappointed in the food.  Service has been hit or miss.  I dined for dinner a month or so ago and we had the most outstanding service.  Sunday I dined for Brunch and the service was sub-par.  To start off, our server served my friend water in a cracked glass.  When we noticed and alerted her she was less than empathetic.  Throughout the meal it was almost like the server was going through mood swings.  She was nice then she was rude then she was friendly again.  Very strange.

Onto the food.  Spectacular.  The all you can eat tapas menu is phenomenal and the $10 bottomless mimosas is a must!  They have over 15 different flavors!  The French toast, steak and eggs, and breakfast fries were some of my favorites!  For dinner I had the steak quesadilla, very simple but excellent quality of steak.  One strange thing to mention though.. We ordered he fries a second time and this time they were seasoned completely different.  Kinda strange as I enjoyed them the first way better.

I absolutely will be back to try new menu items and have another great experience.
