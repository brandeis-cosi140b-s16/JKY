Juan's has quickly become our favorite Mexican place! 

I've been about 8 times now and it's always pleasant and yummy. Unfortunately, the word is out...it's busy! It's family friendly which means there's kids everywhere! So many, in fact, that they ran out of highchairs on our last visit. The good news is it's the perfect place for antsy noisy kids because they are at every table and no one would notice. 

The happy hour specials are great! The ceviche is generous and tasty. The quesadilla is huge and packed with meat and cheese. The house margarita is meh but the fresh ones and skinny ones are very good! The sangria was ok; the flavor was too muddled. 

Our last visit with yummy food, leftovers to take home, 3 full bellies and 3 cocktails was only $48. Can't beat that! There is a singing guitar mariachi that serenades your table and is great with the kiddos too. Fun!
