Whether you want to go for lunch with your colleagues, happy hour, a few drinks after work, Vida's a great place. I know because I've done all of that multiple times and was never disappointed.

Vida Chicken, the tacos, sandwiches are all good. Drinks are good too. Personally, wasn't so crazy about their Enchiladas but it could have been that I wasn't so hungry. I'd say the best thing about this place though, is that if you are looking for a place to eat/drink as a group in center city, and there's no consensus, this place is perfect.

Now, I must advise you to make a reservation if you are heading over for lunch on a weekday. It will be packed! If you don't you'll most likely wait. But luckily, the servers are nice so it makes up for the wait. Thanks.
