Friday evening and our foursome stopped in for dinner and drinks. The margaritas here are amazing. Sweet and liberally dosed with a salty bite. Try the house gold - couldn't be more delicious. The chips and salsa are quite good - very crispy thick tortilla chips with salsa that is just spicy enough. Every single one of our entrees were delicious. We tried four different plates - seafood tacos, smothered burritos, mole, and a torta. Yum. You can't go wrong with a visit here and the service is quick and gracious.
