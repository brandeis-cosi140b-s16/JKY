I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, not only because the food and service were both excellent, but because I'm very excited that there is finally a decent Mexican restaurant in Summerlin. I had the fish tacos and my girlfriend had the cheese enchiladas (which inexplicably comes with chile con carne on top - she opted for the delicious but spicy tomatillo sauce instead). My tacos were flavorful and juicy, and they were grilled, not fried, which I loved. The picked onions on top were yum yum.  Complimentary chips were light and crunchy and the salsas were tasty. We each had a margarita which were made with fresh squeezed juices and a VERY healthy pour of tequila. Hopefully they keep this up! I thought the room and bar area were lovely and understated, with plenty of natural light.  Our server (Cesar) was great - we got lots of attention and copious drink refills. Overall, lunch was a big thumbs-up.....we will certainly be back to try other menu items and take advantage of the happy hour margaritas...
