Amazing burgers with new & original twists and recipes every week....swift and friendly service....one of the best shakes I have ever had in their maple bacon pecan shake ...sweet potato tater tots there are the only fried sweet potato item I will eat (everywhere else that does SP fries and such, I really ca't stand)...and Sriracha at every table? What more can you ask for?

I give this place a 4 instead of a 5 because the first thing I tried there, I wasn't a fan of. I wouldn't suggest the country fried burger...it's not like a chicken fried steak on a bun like a thought it'd be; it was lightly dusted in flour then grilled on the skillet, also supposed to have fried onions, where I thought I was getting something like French's, it instead was blackened onion sprouts on the grill, and I wasn't a huge fan of those...it WASN'T TERRIBLE, but also not was I was expecting, and that wasn't a good thing in this instance. If what I described is your thing, then it's another thing to make you fall in love with this place. I've been here 3 or 4 times.

Everything else, however, was top notch, and I would always recommend this place to a fellow burger lover.
