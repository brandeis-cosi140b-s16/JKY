I am going to keep this short and sweet. I would recommend Milagro Grill to anyone. The food is creative and delicious. They do a fantastic job combining very different flavors to make excellent dishes. The service is good. They have always been friendly and accommodating. The drinks are great. The have numerous variations of typical drinks that work. Order the Tostadas de Costilla.
