Great fish tacos, they don't batter the fish they grill it. The Baja burger is an excellent value and delicious as well. Located close to UNLV, it's a small cozy dive. The staff are very friendly and will sit and talk with you. Highly recommend if you're looking for good inexpensive food off the strip.
