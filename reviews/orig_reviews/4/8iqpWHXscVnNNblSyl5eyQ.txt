Being a native of Phoenix, I buy/cook mexican food at least once or twice week. This Saturday after a movie at the Esplanade, I drove into the Garcias drive-thru to get some early dinner. I always order a green burro, enchilada style with rice and beans.The wait was very reasonable compared to other take-out wait times. I felt like $8.89 was a bit more than what I usually pay, but no real complaint there either. 

The food was piping hot and delicious. I wish I would have specified green enchilada sauce but the red sauce was very good. I can tell the reheat is going to HIT later on (excited). 

I don't have anything bad to say about this place as it was recommended to me by one of my coworkers. I am from South Phoenix, so my favorites are Carolinas and Ritos, and sometimes Ponchos (on central). I am not familiar with any Westside mexican food so I'm so happy I get to add the OG Garcias to the list.
