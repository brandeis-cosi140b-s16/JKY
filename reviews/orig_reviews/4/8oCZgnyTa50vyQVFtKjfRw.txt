I almost feel useless writing this review, I think everyone has said it all.  But still, I liked it just that much that I want to have my say anyway!

I had one shrimp taco and one pibil taco.  The pibil was...... just... so, so so so good.  It made me want to exit through the kitchen and shoot the chef a la Johnny Depp (*i will not shoot any chefs, please do not report me).  The tortillas were just right, and I already want another one.

The shrimp taco.... I hate to say it but it WAS bland.  Not bad, just not very flavorful.  I poured on a bunch of the Cilantro Cream salsa, which didn't add much.  I'll stick with the pibil!

On to the salsas:  Believe the hype over this strawberry salsa.  Who the heck thinks these things up??  Regardless, it's brilliant and I hope they start selling it by the jar.  I was super excited about the cilantro cream, but it fell a little flat.  Like the shrimp tacos, it was good, just not filled with flavor.  The only other salsa I had was the plain old salsa, and it was really great as well.

And as for the horchata, I have never had horchata like that.  It really was delicious, but just so sweet and rich that I don't think I even finished 1/4 of it.  And for some reason, you can't get a smaller size.  But for a few sips after your meal, mmmmmmmmmm.

Dave B is right about the price.  BUT, we each got 2 tacos, and neither one of us finished them both.  I really think that splitting a 2 taco meal, combined with the DELICIOUS tortilla chips, is more than enough for 2 people.

As others have mentioned, the artwork is just stunning.  I love Day of the Dead art, and these were beautiful.  

In short, the Yelpers are all right.  Just go, and thank us later.
