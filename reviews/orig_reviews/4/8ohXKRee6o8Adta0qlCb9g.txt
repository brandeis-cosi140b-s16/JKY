Went here with my husband for lunch. We got the fajitas for 2 since fajitas is in the name. We started out with some tableside guacamole, I like garlic and roasted jalape√±o in mine so it was just okay. We probably won't get it again, also, because they give you SO MUCH stinking food for the fajitas. When the server arrived with our chicken and steak fajitas they light it on fire with I'm guessing is tequila? Correct me if I am wrong. We OHHHH'd and AHHH'd!! With your meal comes soup which was DELICIOUS (the hubby paid a bit more to get the pozole soup, just lacked some salt) and each person gets their own sides of beans, rice, sour cream, pico, and guac. You also get a choice of 6 flour or corn tortillas. There was so much food I didn't touch my beans or rice, you could easily share this with 3 or 4 people. The chicken was BANGIN' the steak not so much, I found it dry and tough. Next time we want to try to shrimp!! 

OH before I almost forgot. The chips and salsa are pretty good, not the best I've had but the best I have found in Las Vegas!! The service was mehh which is why I knocked a star off but I am more then willing to give it another shot.
