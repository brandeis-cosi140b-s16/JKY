It was my first time here and I was in the mood for Mexican food! Was sat immediately with no wait, but then sat there at the table for about 15-20 mins with no server or anything.... Finally someone came over and asked if we had been helped. By that time we already picked out what we wanted. Overall good was great, service I'm not so sure about....
