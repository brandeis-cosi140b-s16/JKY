We initially visited the Mandalay Bay for the aquarium but were in severe need for a meal and a drink. So glad we used Yelp and decided to drop by. The steak quesadilla was very delicious and different since they use some not so common cheeses like cojito (I think). The steak nachos weren't bad either. My fiance got the cucumber cocktail and I got the mojito. Both very yummy! Overall a great experience here.
