Ok the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of their outrageous prices, don't get me wrong I'm one to pay high prices for food that is well worth it but buying food at this place makes me feel like I'm getting robbed. I order the carne asada tacos ($3) with guacamole , cheese, and sour cream which cost an additional  ($1.50) and I always ask for no beans which is an additional ($1) wait what?!?!? $1 to not add beans!!! So all in all I'm paying $5.50 for ONE taco.
Their food is DELICIOUS! but the way they charge for every single addition is just a rip off.
