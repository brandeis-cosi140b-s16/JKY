Been going to Macayos for years.  It is a regular stop in the family restaurant rotation.  The service at this location is always decent.

I would give it 5 stars, but they took my burrito off of the available options for the combo platters a few years back, and I'm still a little bitter about that.  Now I have to order it ala carte from my Enchilada platter (because choosing one or the other is just unrealistic).

The thing that separates Macayos from a lot of the other Mexican places in town is that you can actually identify the meat source.  This is a big thing with me.  I like the "authentic" places sometimes, but I always have this nagging question in the back of my head as to what animal the "beef" actually came from.  Macayos seems to be the best of both worlds.  Good menu choices, with actual honest-to-god beef, pork, and chicken (etc).
