THANK GOD THIS IS SO CLOSE TO DOWNTOWN. 

Amazing prices, great food, great hours, and easily accessible. Tacos El Gordo is great for the late night drunchies or any time meal. They do also offer free grilled onions and chiles if you request them. 

Don't forget to pick up some candy or ice cream for dessert! arroz con leche or cafe popsicle is my personal favorite
