Chinese and Mexican on one plate?  WHAT?

Seriously...it's the best thing that's happened in the state of Arizona since 1924 when they put a stop to the ban on interracial marriage (See what I did there??).

Ordering is difficult.  It's a bit more complicated than most places.  But once you get the hang of it, it's totally worth it.  If you've never been before, just let them know and they'll walk you through it (with samples!).

Totally affordable and filling...with a free snickerdoodle!
