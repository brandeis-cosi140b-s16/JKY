Despite the spotty reviews for this place, I still had high hopes when my boyfriend and I headed here last Friday night.  Besides, we had a perfectly good Groupon to use :) the restaurant has great ambiance and is tucked back from the slot machine casino action, which is nice.  Here's what we thought of the food:

Chips and salsa: YUM! The trio of salsas were good and we devoured the chips, and our server brought another basket of them without us having to ask.
Appetizer -- Queso Fundido: NOT what I was expecting.  Agave in Summerlin has this killer queso that's bubbling hot in a baby skillet from the oven, and that's what I was expecting here.  Instead, we got a bowl of warm cheese dip that tasted OK, but was basically a fancier version of the fake nacho cheese you'd get at a baseball stadium.  I was not impressed.
Entree -- Chicken Fajitas for 2: A sizzling platter loaded with seasoned chicken and veggies, and we each had our own plate of toppings, flour tortillas, beans and rice to make our fajitas with.  This was really tasty, and for $18 a pretty good deal.  
Dessert: We got the featured dessert which isn't normally on the menu, a deep-fried banana-filled tortilla covered in sugar, chocolate and raspberry sauce and with vanilla ice cream.  Presentation was beautiful and it tasted great! 

Overall I think the rest of the food made up for the disappointing queso dip, which is why I'm still giving this place 4 stars.  Our bill came up to $32, which seems very reasonable considering we got a ton of food.  If you like Mexican, give this place a shot :)
