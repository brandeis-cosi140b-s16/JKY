I was hekka hungry today and my friend suggested we go here. We rounded up the apartment troops and hopped in his Hummer around 8pm. There was no wait and we were the last ones to come in just before closing. I was a bit worried since it was a party of 8 and it was so late but we basically ended up with the 2 servers to ourselves after the rest of the customers left. 

99 cent margaritas all summer!! WTH and they were not in miniature glasses either!! OMG I saw customers with mi cheladas and other giant margs. Their chips were fresh and hot not greasy or salty. The salsa could have used more bite to it but the kids enjoyed it as well as the bean dip that I couldn't stop eating. 

My friends son had the waitress's wrapped around his finger they were very attentive and kept stopping to get kisses from the little guy. The men had the carne asada plates that were ginormous and left nothing behind. I had the enchiladas suiza's and my partner in crime had the fajitas. Mine was good there wasnt really any heat to it but the chicken was cooked perfect. It was all really good I cant wait till I'm hungry again for leftovers. The little ones had pizza's and fries it kept them entertained and their meals included ice cream for dessert. I was really impressed by how nice the staff was way after closing time and they never made us feel like we needed to hurry. They made sure the margs were constantly flowing. The menu had everything but tamales I think. I will be going back to try this hibiscus infused marg it sounded delish!! Party of 8 the bill came to $107 not bad at all! 

P.S. If you happen to like Coronas they are $1.25 on Tuesdays.
