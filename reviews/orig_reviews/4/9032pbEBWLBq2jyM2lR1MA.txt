I actually love this place, very good food and excellent salsa.  Its a little seedy around the gills but has the biggest selection of tequila in the world.  99c margaritas are good but small, salsa's are very tasty with the gratis chips.  I'm not a vegetarian by any means but DO get the repollo and corn enchilada....its a fantastic mix of grilled cabbage and corn on a tasty tortilla.   mmmm, fabulous!
