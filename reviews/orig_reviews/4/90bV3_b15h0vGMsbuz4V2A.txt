Weird, thought I'd written a review about La Comida, but it appears no. So, here we go. 
Located in the Fremont East area, a block or so from Container Park, the outside is inviting just by the shear whimsical flair of the neon monkey sign and brightly colored flowerpots lining the walls as you enter and finally the traditional Virgin Mary of Guadalupe statue.  
Inside is equally thoughtful in the Mexican design.  The bar area, stocked full of different tequilas  (and other liquors and beers) is adorned with rustic wooden and stained glass cathedral pieces. The walls with weathered wallpaper and tons of rosaries surround wooden tables with a mish-mash of Mexican style chairs and benches. A+ in decor. 
Food, it's good, but not fantastic. The chips and salsa they provide are very good, the guac is also very good. However, the other dishes we've ordered are not so fabulous. The pozole was decent in flavor, and quite a bit of chili was added to bring more flavor. The burrito was commented to be good, but nothing spellbinding. The chicken fajitas were definitely tasty, but I was disappointed that they seemed warmed and served on a regular plate. Traditionally, Tex-Mex fajitas are usually served sizzling and steaming hot. The chicken tacos have some strange green guac-salsa verde that is not very appetizing. If we go again I will ask for no green salsa on top of the tacos. The house margarita was very tasty, though! I like how they serve it in a mason jar, keeping with the artsy-rustic feel. 
Service is awesome, both times we've been to La Comida, Frank with the cool mustache has been our waiter. Nice guy, very friendly.
