Dine in at their patio and it was kinda relaxing for you can feel the breeze and it was really a nice place to have a dinner. I ordered grilled chicken with some mango mole sauce but it tasted different though. It was good but I couldn't really figure it out if it was chicken or lamb lol. It probably be because of the mango mole sauce that made it taste like a lamb. I'm giving it a 4 star only because our server was kinda slow. Fall asleep again waiting for our cheques to come.
