Much easier to get a table here than at Barrio Cafe, and the food was very good. I had the mariscos relleno and it was delicious - only a little spicy with a tasty sauce and plenty of crab and shrimp stuffing. The mashed potatoes were delicious, but I could do without the calabacitas (veggies). The carnitas were lean enough for a very picky eater and the tortillas looked great - he ate them all before I got a chance to snag one.
