Needed a quick bite on the way to PHX and tried this place out. Small menu, clean atmosphere, and nice options at salsa bar. Tried the much talked about machaca fish taco and a shrimp taco. They come out quick on a great corn tortilla and then it is up to you to build whatever you want on top from the salsa bar. 

Overall, quite tasty. I like that they don't try to do too much or be too much. I would appreciate some avocado options...either guac or slices, but other than that, I would definitely come back again.
