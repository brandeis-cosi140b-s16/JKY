My wife and I ate there for the first time.  Glad we stopped!  After only being open for 6 months these guys have it going.  We can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  Brulee Burger and the Beach House Burgers were both a hit.......and the fries!  10 different ingredients to shake on the fries!  Are you kidding?
