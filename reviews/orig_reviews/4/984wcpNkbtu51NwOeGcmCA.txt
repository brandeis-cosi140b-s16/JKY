This place is a hole in the wall that is damn good...the red salsa is spicy and flavorful...when I went the carne quality was over cooked it was 4pm...I'm thinking the food is 5 star if you go at noon...I hope.

Okay I went a couple of days later and it was 1pm..the carne asada was fresher but still a bit cheap in quality.

This is definately one of my favorites for a burrito or tacos
