Every once in a while, I feel incredibly stupid for not coming here more often. 

Reasons why I am stupid:
- This place is literally just a walk down the hill from me, and it should be super close to most Pitt students.
- The tacos are delicious and freshly made.
- The toppings are unlimited (literally, you can pile it on until you're forced to use a spoon/fork). Like, as someone conditioned to paying extra for guac at Chipotle, I'm pretty happy with unlimited amounts of slightly more goopy guac here. 
- Each taco is only $2.50. But let's be real, the base price is more like $5 for two tacos because who comes here and just gets one taco? 

Pay inside first, hand the receipt to the guy doing the grilling, and then enjoy your tacos, you lucky person you.
