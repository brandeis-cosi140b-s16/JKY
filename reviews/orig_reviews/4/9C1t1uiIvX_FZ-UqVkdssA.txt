Just an awesome place
To eat.... At the airport no less! I had a layover that lasted longer than expected on my way to Northern California and dropped into this place for a quick bite. Great selection of Mexican food and drinks. I had the short rib and avocado cheese crisp (Mexican pizza) and it was just decadently good!
