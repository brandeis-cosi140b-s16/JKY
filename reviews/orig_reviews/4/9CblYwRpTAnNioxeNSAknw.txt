Chorizo!

It's one of my favorite words to say in Spanish. I dig the South American version, but have been pretty excited to see it popularized in the States and served in Mexican restaurants. 

Say it with me now...


"Chooooor-eeeeee-sooooo!"


Naturally, when I saw it on the breakfast menu I had to have it. Add that it was on an Eggs Benedict (or eggs benny as the kids are calling it) and that was my order. Try to fight it. You cannot.

I definitely made the right call (although the burrito was a close second) because I enjoyed every last bit of it. Now, when I do eat breakfast, I'm a big breakfast kind of guy. So even the big burrito wouldn't be enough to fill me up. But this is probably more like "appropriate" sized breakfast. It's a not a race to see how much you can eat in one day, right? That question was directed to me, BTW.

If you take into context that Distrito is attached to The Saguaro hotel, I think the pricing is right on the mark. It's a gorgeous setting (love the skulls and wall o' splendor and shine) so it would be a great choice if you're staying there. (You can also order the food to your room.)

Dunno how it compares to other b-fast options in the area, but I guess I don't need to. If it ain't broke, right?
