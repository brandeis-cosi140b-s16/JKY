What an interesting place.  We stopped here for lunch on our way out to red rocks park.  Excuse my surprise, as I'm not from vegas but it was interesting to see gaming here.  

This is a pretty good restaurant with some interesting tapas.  We decided to just be surprised and let the waitstaff bring us whatever.  I think the Arepas were the highlight.  The bacon wrapped dates were interesting, but perhaps a little weird to eat hot dates.
