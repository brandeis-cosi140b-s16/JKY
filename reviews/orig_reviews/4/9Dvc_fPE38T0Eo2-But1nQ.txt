In the past I'd say the other location is better. But overall I think both work just fine. The other location seems to have specials more often. But here you don't have to deal with that back parking lot like on Indian School.

If you are looking for great salsa, fair specials, a decent margarita, and pretty good food Popo's is always a good choice. The food is a bit heavier than some places but definitely better than xyzabertos.
