This place was pricy for Mexican food, but damn was it good.  The tomatillo sauce in the enchiladas suizas is the best I've ever had. And the cheese they put in that dish is beyond.. a little sweet and tangy.  And the churros are warmed and injected with some type of devilsih caramel creme.  Come on!  They're trying to put me in a food coma.  Great horchata.  And very simple and tasty guacamole.  It's better with the pomegranates than the cranberries.
