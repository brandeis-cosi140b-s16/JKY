Definitely should check it out. It's not a chain, typical Mexican food joint. It's unique. Great little week night place for happy hour queso and a margarita. Our steak was tough so I would not try the skirt steak again, but the veggie enchiladas were great. We had good service and they should be proud of their take on Mexican food. We will be back.
