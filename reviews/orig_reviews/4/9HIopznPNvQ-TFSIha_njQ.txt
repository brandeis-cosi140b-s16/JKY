BEST MARGARITAS I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!

And they run really good happy hour and follow on facebook prices ($3 for a top notch margarita!)

I've been here 3 times and it's a solid classic mexican food joint.  If you are in the mood of a HUGE plate of food, with beans/rice - then this is a good choice.

Good salsa/chips! I wasn't impressed with their dessert (the ice cream sundae and churros - pass)...and come to think of it the food wasn't THAT memorable either. I guess the great margaritas have made me think highly of this place.
