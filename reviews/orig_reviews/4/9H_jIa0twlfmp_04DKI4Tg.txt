I really like this place! The shrimp burrito was quite good, it unexpectedly bit me back, but a few swigs of water took care of that. Other people in the party liked theirs. One remark I can recall is that the burritos were filling. The owner (or I think it was) was very accommodating to our special requests, and explained the menu to us newbies. They take great care in preparing their food and I look forward to trying them for breakfast one of these days.
