Place is a madhouse. Crazy packed. Got some carne asada tacos and spicy pork tacos to go with carne asada fries. The fries were a pleasant surprise. Tacos are very good. The salsas need a little work. The meat in the tacos have a nice smokey flavor. Came here late at night to avoid crazy lines during the day.
