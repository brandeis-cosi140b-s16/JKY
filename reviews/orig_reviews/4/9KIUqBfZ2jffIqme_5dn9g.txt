My co-worker and I decided to grab a table on the bright and cheery front patio, filled with sunshine yellow chairs.  We immediately appreciated the fact that they saved the two substantial trees that helped to block the noise from Central Avenue.

Now down to business.  We were greeted by our server, who quickly brought our beverages, crunchy chips and salsa for starters.  

For lunch I ordered the "Lunch Special" which was a choice of 2 tacos (served on made-to-order corn tortillas) and choice of soup or small salad for around $10.  I chose the Shrimp Taco (with grilled shrimp, Mexican slaw and pico gringo), the Carnitas Taco (shredded pork, tomatillo salsa, cilantro & onion) and the Rhythmic Beet Salad (mixed greens, beets, papaya, avocado, goat cheese, toasted pepitas, cilantro & scallions in a honey champagne vinaigrette(recommended by our server).   

Everything was DELICIOUS!  And although I had plenty of food, I found myself wishing that I could order more just to try the great-looking combinations.  Every taco has slightly different ingredients. Not just a change in the protein, like most traditional Mexican restaurants. They also don't come with the heavy grease and mountains of grated cheddar cheese that you'll find on the majority of valley tacos. Each item was light, fresh and yummy!  

The service was prompt, friendly and courteous too!

I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu.  I'll be sure to take my camera for pictures too.
