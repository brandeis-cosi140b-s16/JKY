Hmm... I'm the second to review Mi Casa. Judging by the previous review date I am assuming there is currently a new kitchen staff, or I showed up on a good night. I had read about the Mexican restaurant @ Silverton Casino with the day of the dead dcor. The lady and I are suckers for all things Day of the dead. Plus the aforementioned review (Vegas Nightlife, I think?)  Was a positive one. 
 We started off with a pitcher of Margarita, the 1800 Blues- 30$ and we were fuzzy whence we got to the bottom of the pitcher. The Queso Fundido Appetizer was nice. I'm not an expert but smart money says not exactly authentic but tasty as hell. Main course we both had the Fajitas. I had the mixed grill, Steak & Chicken they were full flavored and the chicken was especially piquant in its marinade. The lady had the Baja Skrimp variety and they had a nice flava as well. 
 Not authentic, Not day of the dead enough... but well worth it. We will be back.
