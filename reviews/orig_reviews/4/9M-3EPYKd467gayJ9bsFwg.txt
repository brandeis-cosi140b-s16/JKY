So, I have heard lots of buzz about Barrio, but for some reason I never stopped in.  My bad!  

We went out for a little Christmas eve date night, and were delighted.  We had a short wait before being seated, so we bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  I ordered something with grapefruit soda and juice and I think vodka? Tequila?  Boo!! Whatever it was, it was delicious.  The lady ordered a margarita, which was equally tasty (and strong!). 

We started off with a spinach and cheese crepe, which lasted about five seconds. It was that good!  My lady ordered a seafood dish for me (fish, shrimp, little scallops) with grilled zucchini.  Topped with a creamy sauce and chorizo! AHHH! I didn't realize what it was until I bit in and immediately spit it out.  Sorry peeps, I just don't get down with the swine!  The rest of the dish, however, was magnificent!  Succulent little scallops, flaky fish morsels and juicy shrimp! I don't eat animal stuffs that often, but this was definitely worth the backslide.

Overall, we had a great time and can't wait to go back!!
