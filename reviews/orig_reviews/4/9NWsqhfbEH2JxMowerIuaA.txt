We stopped here yesterday for late lunch/early dinner.  Since it was Sunday, they had a brunch menu but neither of us were interested in that.  Immediately after being seated, we were asked about drinks and two iced teas were brought quickly.  

After looking at the menu for awhile, my wife opted not to have the fajitas for two but ordered the chicken azado Vallarta style--salsa Española with capers, banana peppers, and olives.  I ordered the flaming fajitas.  After all, it's the name of the place and that's why I stopped.

We were brought chips, salsa, bean dip, and a small dish of grilled onions and one half of a grilled jalapeño.  Standard fare except for the grilled onions and jalapeño.  

In a short time, our dinners arrived.  Mine was flamed near the table but far enough away for safety.  The fajita pan is a high pan with a circular top.  The chicken, peppers, and onions were nicely grilled and the flavors were very good.

My wife's chicken was good, and it was a very large portion.  I have leftovers for dinner this evening.  It was one whole chicken breast.

Not finishing her meal allows my wife to justify dessert.  I need no justification.  We shared an order of fried ice cream that was very good.  The crust on the outside was tasty and the ice cream was nice to have on one of our 100 degree summer days.

Service was excellent.  Multiple people came to check on iced tea refills, was it OK to remove dishes, anything else, etc.  One of the managers (owners?) came by and chatted and made sure all was well.  He asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He explained some of their current promotions.

I normally would have given Juan's a 3 star rating.  However, the service and the appreciation shown for patronizing Juan's figured in my upping the review to 4 stars.  I appreciate when businesses give good service and are glad that you stopped there given all the choices we have in this city.  I am a fan!
