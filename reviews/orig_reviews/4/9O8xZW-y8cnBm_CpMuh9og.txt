I spent $11 and got a carne asado taco, an empenada, an order of croquettas, chips and salsa, and a drink. The taco had good flavor, and I liked the queso fresco on top; the portion size wasn't huge, but the quality was excellent, especially compared to fast food places. The empenada was flaky and delicious, and the croquettas were small, but tasty. The verde salsa that came with my order was excellent. 

Next time If I  eat at Brushfire I will definitely order the "flight" combo again, rather than ordering items separately.
