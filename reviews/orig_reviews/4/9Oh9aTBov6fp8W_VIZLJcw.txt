I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I've only been once, so I'm think 4 is probably more appropriate for a single visit.
First, we were there on a Friday night at 10:30pm and sat right down.  Service for us was GREAT ... from the bus boys to the servers.  And I'm the kind of guy that WILL tip less (or not at all) for bad service.
Second, I felt the price of the tacos was right in line for what you get.  These are definitely not your regular street tacos (which I like too).  For two us .... 4 tacos, one beer, and tip came to $21 (no complaints).
Third, the tacos were really good.  Only got to try two, so looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations.
Fourth, probably my only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I feel for ANY restaurant that serves a lot of finger food, they should have hand sanitizer all over the place ... very accessible.  With that said, I did go to the bathroom to wash my hands.   :)
