Came here out of curiosity after continuously hearing their awful commercials on the radio and was very pleased!

Super tasty tacos.  Friendly staff.  Abundant options. Clean restaurant.

Came here on a Sunday evening around 7pm and the place was fairly packed.  I had 9 tacos because I wanted to try all the different meats having never been there (which turned out bad the next day if you know what I mean), but all of them were very delicious!  They have a salsa bar with many different types of salsas and toppings, also tried almost all of them and they were great.

The staff was very courteous and helpful with the menu.  The place was extremely clean from the taco bar itself to the restroom.

Overall very pleased and will be going back!
