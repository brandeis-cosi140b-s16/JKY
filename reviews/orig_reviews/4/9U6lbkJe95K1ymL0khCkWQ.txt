I have been to Distrito 3 times now. And every time their food is some of the tastiest I've had. Their service however, leaves the customer often a little puzzled. The servers seem disenchanted and as if you're putting them out by dining there.  It's odd because they have a good knowledge of the menu, and will advise you on your order if asked, but with zero enthusiasm. It's just strange. I've had the pleasure of being greeted by a manager once and the head chef came to our table one evening, both were incredibly pleasant and appreciative of the business. Why don't they hire happier servers?? Anywhoo... 

Drink-wise, I'd recommend their house margarita and red sangria, but skip the specialty cocktails as they are pricey and did not impress.  Their guac is really good, but be prepared to spend $10 and share; it's a lot of guac! Food-wise, I recommend their mahi tacos and the queso fundido... Fan-freakin-tastic!  For the mahi tacos, house made tortillas are topped with a lovely piece of fried mahi mahi, slice of avocado, pickled cabbage and a dollop of spicy aioli. It is an explosion of flavor. The queso fundido is truly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Their ribs are also fall-off-the-bone amazing and the nachos are everything nachos were meant to be. On their sides menu, I'd have to push the corn as it was different from any I've ever had before. 

Update: They have a happy hour now!  House margs, guac and a couple other things marked down to around $5 every day from 3-6pm.  Definitely a steal deal!
