We went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by "family style". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes...
