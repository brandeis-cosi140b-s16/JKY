for burritos, this place is great.

america's bean and cheese burrito features peruano beans, which are definitely tastier than your standard pinto.  pretty simple and straightforward, but well executed.  has the unfortunate tendency to fall apart, though, as the delicious beans soak through the delicious tortilla wrapper.

the carne asada here is super tasty.  obviously, anyone claiming the best carne asada in phoenix can expect a throwdown, but for people with gringo sensibilities, this is a pretty great version - not as crispy as some more traditional places, well-seasoned, and juicy, which is rare among carne asada purveyors.

i think the best way to experience it is in a burrito, but i know people who are big fans of the torta and the taco incarnations as well.

beer is cheap.  refresco margaritas are divine, getting better with each sip.  the patio is a really fun place to hang out.

there are a few knocks keeping this from five-star perfection.  quesadillas are a bit disappointing and boring given the quality of everything else.  there is a lack of salsa offered for your food. you get a cup of some fresh and tasty - but crushingly mild - stuff, with no options for spicier or more interesting fare.

all in all, a really solid neighborhood joint.
