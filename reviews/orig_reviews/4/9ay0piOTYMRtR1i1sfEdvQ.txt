I went the other day for lunch and the place is pretty good (really 4.5 stars). I got the cornbread enchiladas, a unique concept in and of itself, with the red sauce. The red sauce had a very mellow heat that didn't overpower the flavor and meshed well with the slightly sweet cornbread. 

I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and support a local business that is churning out excellent food at reasonable prices.
