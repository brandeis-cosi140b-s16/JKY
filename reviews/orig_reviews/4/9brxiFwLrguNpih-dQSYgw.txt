I'm a big fan of this place.  It's not really well marked on Hayden and I almost missed it the last time I was driving there.  The first few times I was here there were always long waits, but I was here last on a Saturday night at about 730 and it was probably half empty...hopefully they aren't losing too much business.

My favorite things here are the lobster enchiladas and the crab stuffed poblano peppers. The lobster enchilada plate comes with two enchiladas, rice pilaf and asparagus.  It's topped with a really nice mild spiced, lobster-y, tomato-y, creamy sauce.  I recommend saving a little rice until the end so you can easily clean up all the extra sauce.  The enchiladas are not too big, but you're definitely full after finishing them.  The poblanos are awesome.  I'm pretty sure they're broiled and there's a great crisp on top of the peppers.  It's a pretty rich dish and somewhat spicy, but the sweetness of the peppers brings everything together well.  

The appetizers are good.  Last time I was there I had the nachos and mexican potstickers.  The nachos were awesome...chips were crunchy, plenty of cheese, and they came with green chiles on top, which gave it a great lil kick.  The potsitckers were not anything special, but kinda an interesting idea with the asian/mexican mix. 

Finally, a trip to Carlsbad Tavern is not complete without the sopapillas.  They serve them warm with honey.  No matter how full you are, there is always room for a sopapilla or two.
