Las Palmas #2 is in front of the Oakland Las Palmas mexican market.  Not sure how long Las Palmas has been making tacos in front of this market (was told on Friday thru Sunday only).  Similar to the Brookline location, tacos made on the street in front of the market.  So YUM!  The Pitt students are loving it.  $2 taco with corn tortillas.  Appears to be the same selection of meats and salsa's and toppings as the original.  Ordered two tacos, a carne asada and  a pollo.  The carne asada was just coming off the grill and was delicious.  The pollo was in a warmer and was a little tough and probably in the warmer to long.  The salsa's are great!

Las Palmas does have a facebook page.
