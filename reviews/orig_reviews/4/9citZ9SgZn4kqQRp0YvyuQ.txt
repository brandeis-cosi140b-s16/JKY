I have had the pleasure of dining at Pinches Tacos on several occasions... always delicious! The fish tacos are by far my favorite. Pair those with a glass bottle of Mexican Coke and I am one happy girl. My only gripe is that I feel the price is a bit steep for street-style tacos, but clearly it hasn't stopped me for enjoying them!
