While staying at the Monte Carlo on a recent work trip my group ate here twice! Definitely touristy but the steak and fish tacos are sooo good. I was even craving them after I returned home. The guacamole and their salsa was very tasty as well. We split a pitcher of regular margaritas on the rocks, which I thought was a perfect mix of tequila & lime mix.
