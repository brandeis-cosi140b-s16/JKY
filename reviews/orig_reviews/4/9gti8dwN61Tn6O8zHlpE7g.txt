Ok. I might be a Russian American, but I love Hispanic food. This is a cool spot in the Plaza Midwood area of Charlotte, NC. Kind of hard to find and parking blows, I mean at least pave the lot to make it easier to drive in and out of there. But on a good note, the food is amazing. The owners also own Kick Stand and Hawthorn's (never been, but its on my list to try), but Loco Lime is amazing. Great drink specials, large enough meals to share and the endless chips & salsa are always a plus. The salsa has a nice spice to it and the food in general is seasoned just right. The service on the other hand- SUX. I keep going back there just for the food, but if the food blew, then Loco Lime would never see me again. I gave 4 stars because of the service, its like every time I go there, its like every server hates their life, never checks on us and always forgets something. Other than that, Loco Lime is on my top Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, NC. Definitely a place everyone should try once, and who knows maybe I just have bad luck with the service!!
