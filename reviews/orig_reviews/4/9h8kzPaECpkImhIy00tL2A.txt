One of my favorite spots in Phoenix, Richardson's always seems to cure me of whatever is ailing me with a Prickly Pear Margarita and a healthy dose of scorching chiles.  Don't let the location (a dingy strip mall) or the laid-back waiters fool you - the food is top notch and a bit upscale.  The dark restaurant and tucked away booths make the place seem like the setting for a clandestine meeting.  Chile Relleno and the Carne Adovada are both toothsome, while the enchiladas are a treat for cheese lovers and chile fiends alike.  Richardson's makes the distinction that they are New Mexican cuisine, and although they are not what you would find in Mom and Pop Albuquerque, they are still a red and green driven menu.  Definitely worth a trip!
