This place was pretty wonderful.  We stopped in, after having received a coupon for a free drink when purchasing a drink...ok ok-twist my arm, I'll come by. 

 The mix of Mexican and Chinese was quite fun.  On one side you have people making tortillas on a flat top, the other has people prepping and primping dim sum.  We sat at the bar on the dim sum side (being from San Antonio I've seen more than enough tortilla prepping).  Our waiter was great!  Explained everything in detail regarding the menu and how everything works.  His knowledge was extensive and much appreciated.  He also informed us they were featured on Food Network, which I didn't know but made it that much cooler.  The tacos we had were amazing.  They are pricey small bites but damn they were good.  Suffice it to say, I will be back, even without the free drink coupon.
