Yum! Came here on a Sunday night with my family for the first time. Workers asked if this was our first time and then have us samples of all the meats to try! The kalua pig, chicken, and fish were great. Steak was too sweet for me. My main complaint is that it was too cold in the building! Had my peacoat, north face jacket, and sweater on (three layers!) and was still freezing. Other than that, the food and service was great. A must visit if in Vegas!
