The first time I was invited to Frank & Lupe's with some friends, it was a last-minute invitation and subsequently I was unable to arrive exactly at the time of their reservation. I was literally on my way! The restaurant didn't care - they have a policy that refuses to seat incomplete parties. On a subsequent visit, I realized why (and I definitely don't hold a grudge about my first experience). This place is popular, and always seems to have a long waiting list. I'd be upset if they sat incomplete parties in front of me too. I can't be a hypocrite! Pitchers of margaritas, average chips/salsa, and impressive dinner combination platters. I've only sat on the patio, and I never intend to sit inside. One of the main reasons I enjoy F&L's is the atmosphere of that patio. It truly is secluded and you can easily forget you are in Scottsdale. If you are a fan of Mexican food/atmosphere, you'll love this spot. Skip the chains like Macayo's - and head straight to Frank & Lupe's... Just make sure you have a complete party!
