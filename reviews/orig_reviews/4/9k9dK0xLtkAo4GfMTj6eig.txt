If you are a fan of any Mexican style mesquite grilled meats, do NOT miss this place. My husband and I had a quick lunch here and were stunned at how flavorful and rich the simple food we ordered was. He had a chicken burro and I had the chicken quesadilla and chicken taco. Can hardly remember any Mexican grilled food tasting so great. My only criticism is that the informal, bright, colorful atmosphere would indicate that the staff would also be welcoming and fun. Not so. No Mexican hospitality at all. They were uniformly dour, unfriendly and mechanical. When I asked for our table to be wiped down, the cashier barely acknowledged me and then we ended up having to wipe it down ourselves. Staff needs to be friendly and welcoming, with a smile for all, and this place would get 5 stars from me.
