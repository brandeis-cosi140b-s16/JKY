Safe. I know that sounds like a mediocre review, but I love knowing of places that are safe to bring anyone to, where you're confident they will leave at least content in the belly. This place is a bit run of the mill in decor. No one is going to write home about how cool it is. However, it is clean and comfortable and after two visits, I feel pretty confident in the quality of what I would call Tex-mex. There may be more "authentic" Mexican food on the menu, but I stuck with the burrito both times. 
The service is good, frozen margaritas are tasty, food is yummy and tummy gets filled for a reasonable price. 
I guess 5 stars would be the best, but I lived in Austin for 2 years, so my scale is skewed.
