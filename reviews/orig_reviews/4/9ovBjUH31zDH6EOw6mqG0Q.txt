After reading some of the less than stellar reviews I feel obligated to review one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Even if it isn't exactly an authentic representation of the traditional variety. 

The staples here are excellent. The chips are fresh and a bit heartier than most. They are, indeed... delicious. The red salsa is of mild-to-medium heat and complements their companions well. The beans are also very tasty, not refried and smothered in cheese like some well-known offenders. The rice is tender and flavorful. Together with some fresh flour tortillas and you experience what is know as harmony. 

The chicken mole enchiladas are easily my favorite dish here, with the mole being slightly sweet and mildly spiced. The hard tacos here can be a bit greasy, which I admittedly enjoy on occasion. The red enchilada sauce is pretty decent as well. I think I have also had the tamales here, but do not remember them standing out.

It's a pretty cool spot too with a patio and bar out back. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Sure, you can get better elsewhere in the valley, but Frank and Lupe's is always a solid choice.
