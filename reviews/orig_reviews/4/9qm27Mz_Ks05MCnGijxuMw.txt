I don't know what all the fuss is about their tacos being too small! They are standard taco size.... And I had more than enough food! I ordered the combo which comes with one taco, chips and salsa, a drink, and one tapas. I was stuffed! They give you plenty of chips and a large container of salsa. I got the salsa verde which was delicious- I could drink that stuff. For my tapas I got the papas Fritas which were also very yummy! They came with a spicy mayo. I got the chicken taco which was good. It had a really authentic Mexican taste and had plenty of guacamole. The chicken itself was super flavorful. All of this was $8.19. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp!
