Yet another great experience at Jalapeno Inferno today. Came in around 4:30, right before the Sunday dinner rush. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and attentive. We were promptly served delicious flour tortilla chips which are dangerously good. Tonight I ordered the blood orange margarita which was tart and delicious.

I had a sampler platter tonight which included a corn tamale, mini fundido's, a green chile quesadilla and queso w/ spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. I ate way too much because it was oh so good! My fiance had the queso skillet chicken which was amazing as usual. The ambiance is also really nice here and it was a beautiful day to have the patio open with a nice breeze.

Overall I am very impressed with Jalapeno Inferno. I will be back to try more!

(Going to try the lobster taco's on the next visit)
