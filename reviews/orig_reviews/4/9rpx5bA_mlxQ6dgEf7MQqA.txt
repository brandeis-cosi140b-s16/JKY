Had dinner with friends who like it here because of the vegetarian menu options. My personal diet is very low carb at the moment, so I had resigned myself to a salad. I ended up having cochinita pibil, achiote marinated pork baked in a banana leaf and subbed a side salad for rice and beans. It was delicious, savory and a touch spicy, not at all too salty which can be a downfall of Mexican pork dishes... The staff was friendly and attentive, my water glass never sat empty, and it was quiet & mellow inside despite having a good evening crowd. I'll definitely visit again.
