Finally, decent Mexican food in Pittsburgh! By now, I thought I would never find it but Las Velas is hands down the best I've had in the burgh. Granted, there are a few places I haven't tried yet which are supposed to be good, but for now this one wins!

Chips and salsa were good and appeared to be homemade. The margaritas hit the spot, but the Coronas strangely came without limes.

I was quite pleased with the chicken burrito verde I ordered, and others in the group enjoyed their tacos al pastor and mole enchiladas. Many of the tables have a nice view of the square, and the only drawback of the whole experience was the service. Unfortunately, our waitress was often absent when we needed something, and I had to chase her down so we could pay our check and leave! From what I could see, the other servers were doing a better job, so this is probably just bad luck.

I will definitely come here again!
