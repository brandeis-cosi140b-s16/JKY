Hawaiian Style, comfort, and flavor all in one. This isn't a restaurant where I could eat all the time however, when your in the mood for something different this is it. The pig is a best seller and tastes the best in my opinion on a burrito. It is tender fall apart in your mouth moist very flavorful pork. They highly recommend it with the mango onion salsa. Which offers a sweet slightly spice extra something something.very good fully encompasses the Hawaiian culture.
