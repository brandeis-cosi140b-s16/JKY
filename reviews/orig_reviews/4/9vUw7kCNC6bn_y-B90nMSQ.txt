Most expensive enchilada I've ever had, but by far the best and great people watching location!

I generally don't get too enamored by Las Vegas glitz, but this place had it going on from the Medieval entrance to the copper menus.   The margaritas were $13 bucks and appeared to be a little lacking in the Tequilla department.  Also, it was kind of lame you had to pay for chips and salsa, but they offered 3 varieties of salsa that appeared to be homemade and the basket of chips was large enough that we didn't need a second one.  I ordered the chicken enchilada and the tortilla tasted either homemade or very fresh.  As I mentioned, it was pretty pricey as I'm used to the typical cheap Tex-Mex, but it was by far the best enchilada I've ever had.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are hungry on the strip.
