Even though Tivoli Village is a Ghost Town waiting to happen.  I applaud the amount of restaurants they have there.  I've seen a few turnover (Petra / Double Helix) however stopping in at Cantina Laredo for their happy hour made my trip worth it.  Their Happy Hour is from 4pm - 7pm & 9pm - close.  We hit the later up.  Our party of three went through 2 rounds of their Casita 'Rita ($3) and a bunch of their flavorful tacos.  Would go back for the value during happy hour.
