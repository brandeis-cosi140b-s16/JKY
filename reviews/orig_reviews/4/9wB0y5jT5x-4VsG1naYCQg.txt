OK I am a bit of a taco freak but with that said, very well done.  Nice choice of tacos, sides, drinks, etc...very friendly staff - simple, small & cozy atmosphere...  I found it easily enough but I could see how some might have trouble with the lack of a sign.  The inside of Container Park is pretty simple though in what you see is what you get.  Clean & easy to navigate.  Be careful with the hot hot salsa though - they are not kidding with it.  Had the Al Pastor, Chicken Mole & Fish tacos and found them all to be very satisfying.  This place is nothing earth shattering mind you but it is solid and for the price it was exactly what I expected.
