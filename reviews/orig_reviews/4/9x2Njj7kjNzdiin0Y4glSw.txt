I have been here a few times and can say without hesitation that Tacos El Gordo deserves 4 stars. The restaurant is small with only a handful of tables inside. It has a nice comfortable feel to it which is only made better by the amazingly friendly service that I have received every time I have gone in. 

Everything I have tried has been excellent but the standout at this point has to be the taco de cabeza. I am a big fan of tacos and I can say that these are the best I have ever had. I have tried 4 or 5 different tacos which have also all been excellent. Tacos El Gordo is exactly what a small restaurant should be. Great service with great food. I really can't recommend this place enough.
