I tried this place out for lunch with a co-worker and was pleasantly surprised. The place was crowded so we sat at the bar. I ordered the house salad with creamy cilantro dressing and the sofrito beans. My friend orders a couple of tacos. My friend actually received her plate 10 minutes before I did, which didn't make sense, but whatever. The salad was really good. The beans were a little salty, as though the sauce had been reduced too much. I added the beans to my salad and it was heavenly. The atmosphere is a little loud but tolerable. I definitely recommend!
