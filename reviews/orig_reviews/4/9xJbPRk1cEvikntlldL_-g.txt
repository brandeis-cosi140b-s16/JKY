Arriving in AZ, we and our friends headed to Carlsbad Tavern to have lunch with our daughter who lives in Mesa.  What a great choice to start the trip. The tavern is very cool with lots of Southwest/AZ hip decor. We were seated promptly outside on the patio right beside the beautiful water feature.  It was cool and comfortable. Our server was prompt and courteous.  Food and drinks were spot on.  We had a totally relaxing and enjoyable time at this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.
