I've read a lot of reviews about the decor not being much to look at. I found the restaurant comfortable. If they just dimmed the lights a little it might be downright cute. Jake: Much to my disappointment, I saw no magic eyes. But the mural was hilarious!

The service was excellent when we went! We had a party of 6, with diverse tastes. The waiter sized up each person and knew just how to make suggestions and offer helpful advise on menu selections. He was quick with a refill, but not obnoxiously so. He definitely got this place the four stars!

The food was pretty good. I wasn't expecting much when I saw Chimichangas on the menu, but the green corn tamales were to die for. I also had an enchilada, but I would probably stick with the tamales when I go back, which should be soon!
