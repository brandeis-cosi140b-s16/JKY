Ricardo's, Ricardo's what can I say? Well I am a bit upset with myself that I am just now trying out this place! It was very good and the service was fantastic! I went with my best friend on the spur of the moment! I forgot they are available with opentable.com and we were both in the mood for Mexican and looked up some things that were in the area! Ricardo's appears and sure enough we booked a reservation for two please! As soon as we arrived we were greeted immediately from the host and a server that was already available! Seated swiftly! I think we are on a roll here! After we were seated our server came over introduced himself and made some great recommendations! I had a huge burrito that was filled with I believe rib tips or something in that nature can't remember all I know is that it was very filing and good! I will be returning soon!
