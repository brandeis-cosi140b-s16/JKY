I needed to take some mid-western family members out to eat and they requested Mexican. I instantly researched places that would meet the following criteria: not a chain (like Chili's or something), sit-down place (not a taco shop), large portions, at least some authenticity. 

This place left me pleasantly surprised and was just what I had in mind for my visiting family. The place is huge, so we were able to be seated right away at a large table. There was a man with a keyboard singing the whole time, which was a nice touch although it prevented us from doing a lot of talking as one of my family members is a little hearing impaired. 

They brought out the standard chips and salsa but also had some tasty bean dip. Pretty good but the only problem that occurred is when my water was being refilled, the waiter spilled on the chip basket. He took it away and never replaced it. Bummer.  

I ordered beef flautas with flour instead of corn. Pretty standard flautas and when I tried my boyfriend's dish, I was upset that I didn't branch out and try something different on the menu. He ordered the coca-cola steak where the coca-cola sauce served to soften the meat while lending a sweet sauce. It was interesting, but in a good way. My dad said the taco he had as part of his combo plate was one of the best tacos he has ever had in his life. 

Of course, since we went about a week away from my birthday, my parents told the waiter that it was my birthday. So I had to endure a birthday song sung by several of the staff and then a surprise tequila shot! It also came with a slightly stale churro. But that is just me complaining because the only churro I like is a fresh and hot one. 

My family members loved the place and they enjoyed all of the other extra curriculars that came with it, like the singer, the birthday celebrations, and the decor.
