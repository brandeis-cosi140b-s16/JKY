I had a business lunch here last week and it was great. I had their Shotgun Lunch Special - two tacos and tortilla soup for under $10. It was more than what I could eat so that was a great value. The flavors were quite good and I appreciate that a number of their offerings are gluten-free and well-marked in the menu.

The staff was impressive. I told them that I was meeting people and we needed to be able to talk, she selected a table that let us sit closer to each other. And when one of my dining companions knocked a glass bottle of hot sauce off the table and broke it, the staff was over in the flash and cleaned it up in under two minutes.

I really love that the owners. who have several restaurants in the area, bought a lot and turned it into extra parking.
