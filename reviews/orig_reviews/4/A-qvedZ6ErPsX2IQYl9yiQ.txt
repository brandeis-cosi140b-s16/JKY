I could not help but the Chinese/Mexican food posting on the sign in front and had to try it out.  The menu has a great variety of Chinese and Mexican inspired menu items.  I had the Jamaican Jerk chicken which was hot and spicy and actually tasted the way that it does in Jamaica!

The fried rice has options - brown, chicken or pork.

The staff is friendly and will even give you samples before ordering.

In addition, each meal comes with a cookie.

The place is a dive, but you cannot go wrong with it.
