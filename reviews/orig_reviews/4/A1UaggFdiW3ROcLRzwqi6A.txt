This place is great (shredded beef chimichanga w/ green sauce!!) 
Saturday night place was packed, 7:15pm, 20 minute wait we where told after waiting 5-10 minutes probably too 25-30 instead of 20 but the where slammed!!! 
Got our table place is packed little loud but not too bad. We where read to order when we sat down waiter came a few minutes later dropped off chips placed the orders  and he was gone --- never saw him till we got food never did get to place a drink order 
Food was great came got our plates and again gone waited 30 minutes finally I had to go find someone to get the bill 

I'm posting this review hoping management may see it 
You can turn tables quicker if you get people their bill soon after picking up empty plates --- customers can get seated sooner 
You can get more $$ from your customers if the waiter take the time to let you order drinks 
Foods great staff friendly eager to help if you can find them, maybe it was just one of those nights?
