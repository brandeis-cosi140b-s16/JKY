I was really pleasantly surprised by my meal here. I had arrived at a gate pretty much directly across the hall, and so I whipped out my phone, checked its Yelp reviews, and decided to give it a try.

The space itself is nice--not nearly as cheesy as most airport bars/restaurants. I liked that you could look into the (clean) kitchen as you sat at the bar. Bar stools were comfy and spaced far enough apart to allow for luggage behind you.

I ended up asking the bartender for her recommendations, and she suggested the Mexican chopped salad, with corn, guacamole, beans, tortilla & Rancho dressing. At just $11 (which included an extra $3 for grilled chicken), I was expecting a pretty measly portion, but it was huge. All the ingredients seemed really fresh and flavorful, and the corn had clearly been grilled. It was pretty delicious. I also had a Four Peaks Kiltlifter beer, which was good.

The bartender (I think her name was Christine) was friendly but not at all intrusive. Even sitting at the bar, it wasn't too noisy or cramped. My salad was out in just a few minutes--definitely much faster than I was expecting (but great for a layover).

It seemed like a steal, especially for airport fare.
