We were big fans of Silvana's original restaurant, Barrio Cafe.  And then we moved further away and didn't get there quite so often. We were very happy when Barrio Queen opened. We like it.  Each time we've gone, we've been promptly greeted and seated. The staff has been very professional and courteous.  The food tastes really good. Lots of flavor and interesting ingredients.  And the margaritas are out of this world.
