Went to Blanco for lunch today with a friend and had a great time. A co-worker of mine raved about this place so I was eager to check it out. Nice spacious restaurant with a more than friendly staff who were very attentive to both me and my guest. The food was really tasty. It wasn't traditional Mexican food, but I really enjoyed it since I'm not really into sweating while I eat from hot and spicy food. Try the green chile pork enchiladas and wash it down with a Chucabras' Pale Ale. Lastly, sit on the patio before the heat hits. The place is definitely a scene as well if you're into that kind of thing.
