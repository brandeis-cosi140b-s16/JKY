Was here for the 5th meeting of the Breakfast Club UYE. Such a great group with a few regulars and a rotating band of others. I always enjoy meeting new people and it is good to see the regulars as always.
It being Cinco De Mayo month a Mexican theme was chosen and Aunt Chilada's was the place. I have been to the Tempe location a few times but I think I might prefer this one. The patio area was really great. The weather was perfect to sit outside. Probably the last time it will be. I like the fact that the main restaurant has been there forever. I like historic old buildings.
We sat down and a few others trickled in. Our waitress brought us out the chips and salsa and also informed us to not leave the table unattended because the birds will have no problem stealing your chips. She took our drink orders and once everyone was seated and ready our food orders. I settled on the Chorizo con Huevos with the eggs over easy.
My food was very good. According to the menu the dish contained Jesus's homemade chorizo which was "heavenly", wacka wacka. I have never had this before but the eggs with the meat was very good. It was all stacked on a crispy blue corn tortilla. It came with a side of re-fried beans which had a little bit of a skin on them but once I stirred them up they were fine. The entire meal was delicious.
They do include a chocolate fountain with all breakfasts but I am not that into fruit so just had a few chocolate covered marshmallows.
I will say that the service was a little slow but with all of the great conversations going on it was a little hard to notice. Plus it did take a little while to get our checks and get them paid but the waitress did split them up for us which they don't usually do for a group as big as ours. Overall she did a great job for having two large parties plus other tables to deal with.
I would like to go back again and try the other breakfast items plus maybe some of the dinner selections.
