We love the food, freshness and flavor, however, the line has been ridiculously slow. I don't know if it's lack of management. Hire more people, train them right, treat them right and it will be 5 stars again. The reason we started eating here when we first moved here years ago, it was fast and fresh. Now the line is slow, the food are mixed and does not look appetizing, the staff is lack luster (as compared to before). Please, shape up!
