With only one visit under my belt, I can't rave about this place, but I will say it's definitely better than average. Which is why it barely gets 4 stars.... 
 
The vegetarian options were pretty slim, but they did have a very tasty mushroom quesadilla, and I really enjoyed the chips, salsa and guacamole. I just wish the chips and salsa was complementary.  Unfortunately, with only one vegetarian option, it doesn't entice me to keep coming back. This really is too bad, because we live right around the corner.  Hottie said his spare rib taco was delicious but the carne asada was just so-so.  

We are huge fans of all the Uncle Sals concepts, their food and service is always good. This is no exception. The Blind Pig has great potential, despite the fact that it didn't blow our minds on the first try!  The only thing I don't understand is how the butcher shop ties in with the Mexican menu. 

What to expect?  Well like Side Door, it's more of a neighborhood bar feel, nothing fancy.  It will be packed on a weekend night, so prepare to sit at the bar, outside or wait. It's a very small place.
