As always, Yelp is never wrong. A solid four stars for the pork carnitas and the wife says 4.5 for her shredded beef taco. The fried ice cream was different than expected with a decidedly unsweetened crust of cornmeal, not bad just not expected. It kind of grew on us by the end of the serving. Will return soon.
