Very very good, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU GET. My 4 stars are for the green chili chicken burrito and their red and green sauce. Absolutely delicious. I've yet to have another one just as delicious. I've also has other items like the carne asada burrito which have all been meh, but that green chili chicken burrito is worth driving all the way from south east Gilbert for.The restaurant is small and a bit rundown. Expect to have to wait for a table, sit outside or take it togo.
