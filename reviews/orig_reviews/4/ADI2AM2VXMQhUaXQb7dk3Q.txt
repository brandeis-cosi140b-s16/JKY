Being from Texas we were desperately needing a fix of mexican food.  So we reviewed Yelp and found this place.  We decided to give it a try.. The food was good with great favor.  They had a very friendly staff.  I considered the plates to be over priced but we were in Vegas so I guess that's excusable.  But I have never heard of $16 a doz.  Tamales but they were huge.
