diego is one of my favorite fancy mexican restaurants in town. its on restaurant row of mgm grand, their interior is lively w brightly lit walls. one of the best things they have is their table side guacamole service. fresh fresh fresh! you gotta order it, it is delightful. 

the salsas with their chips were really good. everything seemed really fresh, the chipotle one was the best. i had the chicken mole and it was delicious. tender fall off the bone chicken and their mole sauce was to die for. the prices are reasonable and the place was pretty laid back and casual but still on the higher end side.

a good place to go if you are looking to get your mexican food fix thats decent, well prepared, wout worrying about mystery meat in  your plate :)
