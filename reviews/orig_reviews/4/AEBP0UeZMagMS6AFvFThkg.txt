Tiny place, but nice. Food was great (minus the salad). Service was a little slow. I ended up getting up and refilling my own drink. The waitress had a piercing in her arm that looked infected- a little gross. Should have been covered up, especially around food.  but she was nice. We had mahi tacos and chicken tacos and a small Caesar salad. The salad was HORRIBLE!  It tasted like acidy Italian dressing- lettuce, crumbled cheese, and tortilla strips and WAY too much dressing.  We WILL definitely go back for the TACOS. Pass on the salad. We've eaten at lulu tacos down the way- WAY over priced and greasy and joyride across the street- WAY WAY overpriced and weird foo foo tree hugger type food. This place was definitely the best by far!!!
