Maybe it was because I was starving... I liked the food.  We were at the Pointe for a trade show and this is where we ended up for lunch.  We had no wait and the food was really good, I got a shredded beef cheese crisp and my coworker got the chimi plate.  The chips and salsa were good.  Only issue I had was my empty ice tea glass, I finally had to ask for more when our bill was delivered.
