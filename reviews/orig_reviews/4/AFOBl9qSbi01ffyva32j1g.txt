Had a 10 for 20 dollar Living Social coupon so me and the fam decided to try it out. I guess I went AFTER the improvements were made all around because I had a very pleasant experience. Half the reviews were not too positive, but until you actually experience it for yourself, then you can reflect it here on Yelp. So my expectations were neutral.

As we came in, the hostess greeted us and were sat down right away. About a minute later, Victoria, (who was our server), came by to take our order. As soon as we informed her we were noobs, she politely gave us a little overview of the menu. As we were deciding she got our drink orders and left to get them. When she came back, she gave us a small order of the Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins! I gotta say it was good and just the fact that Victoria gave us some to try was very commendable! 

I got the Fajita Nachos, my two kids got basic kids items, (chicken fingers, bean n cheese burrito), and my wife got endless chips and salsa. Good thing I only ordered one plate of nachos because what they give you is a lot! All for of us shared it after they ate their meal already and we still couldnt finish it! The chicken fingers were basically cooked like Katsu! For those that don't know what that is, its a chicken breast lightly breaded and deep fried to a golden crisp. 

For dessert, we had two choices: Deep Fried Ice Cream or a Churro topped with Ice Cream, Chocolate Drizzle, and surrounded by different colored tortilla chips. We chose the Deep Fried Ice Cream! Again, we all had to share it because it was a pretty good sized item.

So props goes out to Victoria and the rest of the Nacho Daddy staff. I wouldnt mind bringing new people to this place especially if they are craving nachos.
