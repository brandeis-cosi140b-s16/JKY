I was really excited to try the tacos here because of all the great reviews. At the same time, I was worried I'd set my expectations too high and would be disappointed. I am happy to say that I suffered no disappointment.

I paid my $2.50 for a taco inside the grocery store, then returned outside. I did not experience any language barriers. After I chose my meat, the man placed a tortilla in the box and added a generous amount of carnitas. (Other choices included chorizo and chicken.) I saw him warming tortillas as I entered the store; the meat was already cooked. I then took my taco to the condiment station and added tomatoes, pico de gallo, cilantro, and guacamole. My spice tolerance is really low so I didn't try any of the salsas. I then walked for about five minutes before I ate, so the food wasn't hot.

The tortilla alone is just a little crispy, thick, and delicious. The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful. There was a lot, especially considering the price. Usually, that wouldn't be a pro for me, but at the condiments bar, I was able to add a lot of vegetables, which really helped balance out the meatiness. Everything was fresh, and the guacamole was good as well. The pico de gallo was a little spicy (just bearable for me if I ate it along with everything else), and I actually enjoyed the kick it lent the taco (I usually avoid spice). Next time, I'll probably try some of the salsas. I also want to try the taco as soon as I add the toppings, when it's really warm. The tacos are a pretty great deal--I'd say two or three would do for a meal. 

I also took a quick look around the grocery store. It's small and really cramped. They have a lot of pantry items, some produce, and some bread.
