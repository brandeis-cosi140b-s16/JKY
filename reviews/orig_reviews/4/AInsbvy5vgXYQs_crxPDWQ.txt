Surprisingly good eatery for an airport.  The place was packed and servers running about madly attending to hungry flyers.  My server eyed me from across the bar, reading my impatience and immediately came over.  I had the carnitas torta (Mexican sandwich on a hard roll). with fries.  The pork was tender, super juicy, and bursting with flavor.  The bun was good but could have been a bit crunchier.  Fries were fresh and tasty, accompanied by spicy ketchup.  The Cadillac margarita was excellent.  Take this out of the airport and it would be a winner.  All in all, a good experience.
