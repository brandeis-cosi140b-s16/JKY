Great burritos that will rival some of the best I have had over a couple states. The only reason I give a 4 and not 5 is - they are pretty heavy on the stomach. 

Cool joint to hang out outside and relax.

We had the California and the southwestern - both were good but I am a fan of the southwestern.
