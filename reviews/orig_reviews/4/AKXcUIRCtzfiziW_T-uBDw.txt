It's been many many moons since I last had a meal at Rito's. I'm talking like 1994 and not much has changed, it is all so like back in the day.  I still get the feeling I'm visiting my grandmother and driving through the old neighborhood to get to the converted house to restaurant gives me the feeling of going home.  

Today I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with a side of beans just like I used to have every payday when I worked at the local bank up the street. This burrito portion is huge and the red sauce was just a little over spicy like I remembered. I even had to wipe the sweat beads off my nose a few times.  So good, I'll say.

The menu is online, I called a head for pick up, I took cash, there is limited outdoor seating and parking might be an issue.
