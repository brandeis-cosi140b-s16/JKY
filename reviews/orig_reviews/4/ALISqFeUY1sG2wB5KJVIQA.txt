I made an online reservation for the same evening for two couples. We walked right in at the time of the reservation and they took us directly to our table. It was awesome. The service was superb and the food was good. Especially the tequila flights. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I thought the live band was a little too loud for where we were sitting in the back of the restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy live music, but it was hard to visit at our dinner table without yelling at each other. I will always look on yelp before I go to any restaurant for online reservations. I highly recommend it!!!!
