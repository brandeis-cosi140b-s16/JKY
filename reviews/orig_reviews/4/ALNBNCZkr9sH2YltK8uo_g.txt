Likes:
-Cheaper drinks than most bars in Phoenix (cough-ihatecopperbluesprices-cough)
-Hearing music playing in the venue area
-Not being rushed to leave tables and you can hang in here awhile

Dislikes:
-1 stall bathroom for women (and men apparently?) I know they probably don't have the room, but it really sucks when someone takes more than 5 min. and you are waiting
-Brought in a coupon that apparently was "not approved by them" but on a top coupon site. I got a "well fine.. we will honor it this time, but only on one drink. you can't use that here again, we don't approve those coupons" I felt like a criminal. Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea
-The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink, you got to just grab the bartenders attention. I wish the had a system because it makes it difficult when it is busy
