Maybe the last time I was here the atmosphere just didn't do it for me.  Also, I was here last time in the not so busy I GUESS time of the year. 

-This time in 2013, I was here during NBA FINALS weekend and holy shit, this place was busy. It was Game 7, yes that time and my friends and I of course wanted to watch the game not just in a hotel room but in a bar packed with all the excitement from SPURS and Miami Heat fans of course.  The drinks here were on point, had some margaritas that were much better this time also, had plenty of drinks from earlier day drinking so that helped.  The chips and salsa were on the money, SO GOOD. I also had the Veggie Burrito and it was GIGANTIC. I did not think I would be able to finish it all.  Loved that my group and I at least did get a seat among all the crazy fans, was sad though that MIAMI actually ended up winning in Game 7.

-Would completely come back here for Food next time I am in Vegas.  Great service considering how packed it was too.
