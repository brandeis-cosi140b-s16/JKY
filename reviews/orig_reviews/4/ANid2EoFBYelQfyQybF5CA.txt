First time here, ordered the #1 Combo, Cheese Enchilada, Taco, & Tostada with Rice & Beans. Salsa & Chips served as the appetizer. The salsa reminded me of enchilada sauce and it's SPICY! Have a glass of water handy! The enchilada was adequate, the taco was ground beef and tasted like it had a Taco Bell type seasoning in it. (A huge no-no for any restaurant other than Taco Bell!) But the shell was fried true Mexican style, thank goodness! Next time I'm going to ask for a shredded beef taco. And I hear the Quesadillas are excellent so there will be a next time! I also had an Arnold Palmer and it was one of the best I've had!
