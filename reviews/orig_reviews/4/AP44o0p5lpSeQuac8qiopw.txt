Authentic street tacos with tons of meat options from the standard carnitas to organ meats like brain. The spicy pork was amazing and the best taco I've ever had. This is a quick service operation where you line up in front of the station that is serving your taco of choice then you pay at the register. Additional condiments to are available near the drink stand. The sodas include horchata and cream sodas. We were there around 2am on a Monday and the line was very reasonable at about 10 minutes for both the tacos and register. They have plenty of seating options both indoors and outside. The location sits at the top of the strip just north of the Wynn and walking distance from Circus Circus and Rivera.
