Los Dos is not for the weak. If you can't take heat go to taco bell. If you want real authentic delicious mexican this is the spot. 
The Adobado ribs are so good I want to rub them all over my body before eating them. The shrimp (probably the least spicy thing on the menu) is served in garlc butter and the portions are generous. The rellenos are delicious and the green sauce to die for. There can be quite a wait (up to 2 hours at some points) but grab a drink and have some chips on the patio, it is worth the wait. The sangria tastes like they murdered an entire hibiscus bush to make it, but is strangely very good. I would however stay away from the margaritas, they are pretty watery. They have a sign inside that says "Please control your kids". AWESOME! the last thing I want is a bunch of screaming brats running around while I am trying to enjoy a meal.
Now for the complaints - the staff is incredibly rude and pretentious, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, the tables are too close together, the decor is gaudy and the food will burn a hole in your mouth going in and going out... well enough said.
Even though the service is poor the experience and food are a must try for any Arizonian.
