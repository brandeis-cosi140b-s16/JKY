I want to say that the food was good.  I think it was.  Can't quite remember.  I went to Border Grill with 14 friends (shoulda been 16, but two of them couldn't get out of bed) for dinner during my bachelor party, and well, damn it if my memory of the evening ain't a bit hazy.  I can say this with confidence, however.  The staff was extremely friendly and tolerant of our antics, and everyone in our group had a great time.  One server brought me so many shots of tequila that I asked her "Como se dice vomit en espanol"?  She refused to answer and told me to drink.

My kinda place.
