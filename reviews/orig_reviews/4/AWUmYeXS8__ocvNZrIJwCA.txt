Viewing the other reviews here, I could totally understand how this could be the kind of place that has spotty service. I came here with my co-workers on a night that wasn't very busy, and we had very good service, but it was just slow enough that it was on the verge of being not-so-great service.

I wasn't blown away by the drinks, but where I found this place's strengths was in the food. I had the Durango, which was basically a sampler plate featuring a chile relleno, a chicken mole enchilada, and a spinach enchilada. The chile relleno was tender and really brought out the flavor of the pepper, which I like more than the cheese-filled disasters that some restaurants serve. The chicken mole enchilada was delicious, I especially enjoyed the mole sauce. The spinach enchilada stood out the least but it was very tasty, just not as good as the other two dishes.

We also had very good guacamole and chips before our meal, and they were cool about us adding several more people to the table as the night went on. At the end of the night we had a decent sized bill (that my boss was cool enough to cover) so I don't think this is exactly the cheapest food in Scottsdale, but I would definitely go back.
