A great restaurant in Vegas (inside the Venetian right along the canal) which is a great escape for solid Mexican food flavor. 

There are many very expensive restaurants in Vegas and this is a good balance between "nice" without breaking the budget. 

I ordered the Taco Platter which featured 5 different tacos that all brought their own distinct flavor. I will definitely visit this restaurant again in the future.
