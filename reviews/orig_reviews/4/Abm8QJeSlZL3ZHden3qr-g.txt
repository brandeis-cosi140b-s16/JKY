Came here with a group of friends after an extremely long weekend of drunken debauchery on the Strip. It was a Sunday morning and not too busy yet. We were seated right away and offered drinks. I desperately tried to avoid more alcohol but they suckered me into ordering a mimosa. I tried to convince myself that I only ordered it 'cause you get a complimentary drink (sangria, margarita, or champagne) when you order their brunch buffet. The mimosa was fresh and yummy. 

The brunch buffet was $12.95 which includes the free drink and chips & salsa. The chips also came with a bean dip which was quite tasty. The menudo and posole were delicious. Rice and beans were great. Tortillas are handmade and served piping hot with your meal.

The staff was friendly and attentive. They seemed as if they actually enjoyed their job.

The bathrooms were clean and they smelled wonderful. I don't know what air freshener they use but it is divine.  

I took one star off 'cause this place is pretty far from the Strip but worth the extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that there was a sign on the front window that said that they had been voted the "Best of Vegas" award for two years. That can't be a bad thing right?

I loved the fact that all the servers wore shirts that said,"Save water, Drink margaritas!" Definitely my kind of place...
