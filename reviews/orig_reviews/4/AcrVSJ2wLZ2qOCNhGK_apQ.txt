I was in the area and was looking for a casual Mexican restaurant and stopped in here on a whim. Juan's is in a older building and there's nothing fancy about the place, but the food met and exceeded my expectations, in flavor, quantity and price. I had a Chile Rilleno and a Chicken Enchillda with retried beans, and it was all delicious. When I ordered the Relleno my waitress raved about how good they were, and from the first bite I understood her enthusiasm - I wished I had ordered 2 more! The salsa was good enough for me to take home some - I'm kinda tired of the diced-tomato kind, Juan's is more like a sauce, and I'm still enjoying it at home. I'll definitely keep this place in mind.
