big portions...solid americanized mexican food....basically a differ version of El Torito....

convenient location as i stayed in the palms....

the downfall is that the gaucamole wasnt very impressive...i liked their bean dip more...and thats odd... how do they not make great smashed up avacado dip????

i had this dish that was like a burrito and nacho combined...the bottom was toritila chips and topped with carnitas and cheese with their house sauce...
