FANTASTIC !!!  We ate here last Friday for my husband's birthday.  Since we wanted to try different things, we just had several appetizers rather than ordering entrees.
The chips brought to the table were very good, freshly made in house.  The salsas were dynamite, not your typical restaurant salsa.  We ate:
1. Baja Ceviche  - absolutely perfect!
2. Queso Blanco - tasty, but nothing special.
3. Crawfish Hushpuppies - very unique and delicious.
4.  Duck Tamale - imaginative and outstanding!
The Margaritas were very good but not in the top 5 best I've ever had.
The service was excellent.  Erica was our server and.did a great job.  She had a large area to cover, including one big party.  
The reasons I did not give five stars are for the noise level, and for the slow service from the bar.  This was due to the lack of help behind the bar rather than any shortcoming on the part of Erica.
