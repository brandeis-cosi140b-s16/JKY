So good!

Sunday through Thursday they have deals for $15.95 that offer a pretty decent-sized, though watered-down margarita with your meal!

The hubby and I got this deal:
- I got the chicken and shrimp suiza. Jam-packed tortilla was moist, well-flavored shredded chicken and fat, succulent grilled shrimp with sour cream and guac. The dish also came with black beans and a green-colored rice that was okay. I paired this with their classic lime margarita on the rocks. 
- My husband got the shrimp and lobster chile relleno. I don't really like chile relleno and this was no exception; it was soggy and I don't the batter they cook it on. His meal was served with refried beans and green rice. He paired his with a blended mango margarita.

Good Spot for
- people watching
- not waiting forever to get a table
- cheesy, delicious Mexican food
- FAST service

Bad Spot for
- a quiet meal (Screaming patrons on the roller coaster that goes indoors right above)
- getting drunk for moderately cheap (watered-down drinks)
- free chips and salsa. They are really good and well portioned, but they cost money. I'm from CA and I'm not used to having to pay for that.
