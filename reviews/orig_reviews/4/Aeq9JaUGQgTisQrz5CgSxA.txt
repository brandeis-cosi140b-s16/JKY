I have been to this place several times now and I have had a good experience every time so far. The service is good and the tacos are tasty.

To anyone who doesn't eat meat - the vegetarian taco is so flavorful and delicious!!!! Order a couple of these and a beverage ;)

I love how they fresh squeeze all their juices and the happy hour is a great deal. I recommend the fresco drink with fresh pineapple juice and tequila.
