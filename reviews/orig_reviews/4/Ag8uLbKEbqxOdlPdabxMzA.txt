Long-time fans of the downtown location, we were excited to have one near home as well.  So we stopped by after work for a quick dinner.

The quality of carne asada is constant.  It's fantastic, just as good as the downtown location IMHO.  

We went just a week ago, and they had just opened.  So fresh, in fact that the smell of fresh paint and paint thinner was still fairly strong.  So a negative for now, but I'd imagine with a year of constant grilling and the influx of ASU students in the fall, that minor downside will disappear in no time.  

Highly recommend the America's Favorite for two (if there are two of ya!).  Gives a sample of the taco as well as the burrito along with some chips and delicious salsa.  Only wish you could get a smaller side of guac for less than $5.  But, the guac is tasty, albeit not amazing - but definitely a nice addition to the burrito.  The habanero sauce in the bottles on the table work nicely with it as well.  

I'd say it's 3.5 stars, but with a bit of seasoning and experience, I'd imagine this will be a 4star easy.  

I would also imagine you should take advantage this summer before school gets back in.  I can only imagine how busy this place will be when school is back in session.

BTW, for anyone who's not familiar with America's.  They do one thing and they do it well:  Carne Asada.  Don't expect a wide and varied menu.  You can get carne in a burrito or a taco.  Maybe a quesadilla.  That's all the variety you'll get here and it's alllll you will need!
