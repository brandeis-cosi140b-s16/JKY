Jalepeno margarita. Hibuscus margarita. Strawberry margarita.  Just a few of their homemade flavored margaritas.  

I've only been here for happy hour, but the prices were good and the margaritas were great, we got some taquitos which were really good too, the sauce was to die for. 

I Can't wait to hang out on the patio. 

Only one thing, wish they were open on Sundays.
