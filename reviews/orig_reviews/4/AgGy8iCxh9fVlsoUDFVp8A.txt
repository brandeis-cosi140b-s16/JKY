Went there yesterday for lunch.  Service was great and the food was very good.  I had the green chili burro and it was one of the best I have had in PHX.  My wife had the chicken flower enchalada and she said it was very good.  Portions are large and the the free chips and salsa are a welcome addition.  The drinks could have used a bit more liquor.  Over all it is a great place and we will be back.
