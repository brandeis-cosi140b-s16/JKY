I was very impressed with Distrito. The overall ambiance caters to the younger crowd, which Old Town Scottsdale is known for, rather infamous for. With a live Dj, low lighting, and modern decor, this place is not for the older patrons wanting to have a quiet chat while dining. 
The street style Mexican cuisine is right on point. I tried all five of their tacos, my favorite being the mahi-mahi, the grilled octopus was unlike any flavor or texture I've had before. Very Impressive. The duck dishes were perfectly cooked which shows just what kind of talent is working in the kitchen. I highly recommend trying the cuisine here, but make sure you've brought some money. The prices can get very high for a small amount of food, the only thing holding Distrito from five stars.
