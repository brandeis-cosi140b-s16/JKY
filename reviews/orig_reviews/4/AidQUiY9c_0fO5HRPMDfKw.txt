I went here briefly before they were closed so I expected somewhat crappy service.  But since I was craving for some chicken wings, I braced myself for the abuse.

 I was shocked when the food came out literally seconds after we ordered it.  I have never in my life received food so fast.  Not even from a fast food restaurant.  I was thinking that it was just me since I had wings, but even a table of four that came in after me, was served in less than a minute.  

It was the best magic trick I had seen in Vegas! Go there just for the show, if anything else.  

I am not big on Mexican food, hence the reason I ordered chicken wings at a Mexican restaurant.  Don't judge me...the wings were excellent, by the way!!
