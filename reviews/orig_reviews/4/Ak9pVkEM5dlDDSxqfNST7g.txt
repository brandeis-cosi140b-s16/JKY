San Fran meets Tijuana in Las Vegas.
Reasonable prices for delicious variants of Chinese and Mexican fare.  My table tried 2 noodle dishes (1 hot / 1 cold) and 1 rice dish.  Well done!
The air margaritas was interesting.  The salt was whipped into the airy topping.  So let your lips touch each sip to enjoy the salt with your drink.
