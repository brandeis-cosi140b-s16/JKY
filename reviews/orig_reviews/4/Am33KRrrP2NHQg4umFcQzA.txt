I saw this place in an old RJ Best of LV poll as best tacos which seemed weird to think of as a Korean Taco.  I was really surprised how good these tacos were.  I ordered a trio of tacos which came very quickly.  One was spicy pork, one was chicken, and one was Bulgogi beef.  I liked the spicy pork the best.  I also ordered an order of Pork Belly musubi which was tasty, but not a great deal for $6.  Tacos are an excellent price for $2 each.  I will try this place again.  The staff was really helpful and explained everything when I said this was my first time eating Korean tacos.  They also have a straight up Mexican menu, but I like Asian so I decided to give it a go.   Two thumbs up.
