We were running errands in the Gilbert area and this restaurant came up in our Yelp Search. It's a pretty small restaurant but it wasn't too busy when we had gone in.

I ordered the #6 Combination Plate (which is as follows: grilled chicken burrito with pico de gallo, beans, guacamole, cheese smothered with Hatch Chile sauce and topped with sour cream) with only rice and my date got the #6 Combination Plate (which is: three Carne Asada tacos with onion, cilantro, tomatillo salsa) with rice and beans.

While we were waiting for our food, we enjoyed some free chips and salsa from their complimentary chips and salsa bar for dine-in customers. They had three types of salsa - a pico de gallo style, a green chile one, and a hot salsa. All were equally delicious ... the hot salsa definitely had a big kick to it and the other two salsas were really flavorful.

As far as the food goes, the burrito was really really big ... way bigger than I had expected it was going to be. I had ordered it smothered in the green chile sauce, which I thought was just okay but the chicken, beans, guacamole, and sour cream made for a delicious combination. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a bite of the Carne Asada tacos and they were really good as well - they had the perfect amount of onions & cilantro to compliment but not overpower the meat.

Also, the price was definitely right. I paid $8  and some change for my giant meal, half of which was leftover. We'll be back.
