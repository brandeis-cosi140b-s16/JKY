Definitely worth a try if you are around.
I'm torn between a 3 and 4 star review. Here's why:

Good: Torta, guacamole (sort of)
Less good: Chips, guacamole

Good torta's are always hard to find and this one was among the best I've had outside of Baja.

Guacamole is made table side and is fresh and flavorful...but we were left with a bowlful of huge chunks of avocado, like basically two big pieces of avo. Had to crush it the rest of the way. No, not a life-ending problem, but just sort of weird.

Chips were flavorless and seemed day-old. Bummer.
