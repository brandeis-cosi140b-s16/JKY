Busy for late evening, Friday night. Good margarita on the rocks, rim with plenty of salt, twangy lemon lime cold but not too much ice, a more perfect drink if I had made it!

Order half nachos for app, layer of beans first then tossed with beef, chips melted cheese sour cream and guacamole jalopenos pica de gallo.

Burrito chili verde soft tender generous portions of pork, smothered in chili verde sauce and melted cheese. Very good flavors. 

Service good friendly and fast good food
