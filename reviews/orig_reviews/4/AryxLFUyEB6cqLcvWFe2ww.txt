Always a great choice, one of my favorites and I'm rarely disappointed with the food or service. The atmosphere is lively and exciting, great full bar, and incredible cantina Mexican dishes. LOVE the salmon and the mango salsa - I want to buy it by the carton! 
Only con: parking is consistently a terrible experience. The valet is fine and helpful but on busy nights it's tempting to just scurry off to another place and avoid the whole mess.
