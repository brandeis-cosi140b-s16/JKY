We were fans of the Scottsdale location and now we go to the Biltmore Blanco at least once a month...
My kids don't eat Mexican but they have burgers and fries in the kids menu so that takes care of that (I know, leave them home, right?).
Love, love, LOVE the shrimp cheese crisp with grilled corn to start.  The chips and salsa are perfect because my hubbie and I both enjoy it (rarely do we agree on salsa; this has more of a smoky flavor than spicy).
And I've now tried every style of street taco and I love them all so I just close my eyes and choose 3 different ones each visit; they never disappoint.  You can mix it up with sweet, smoky and spicy--all great and not too filling.
My only complaint is the somewhat high prices and sometimes slow bar service...
