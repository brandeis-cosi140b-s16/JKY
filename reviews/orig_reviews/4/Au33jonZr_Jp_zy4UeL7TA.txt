The tortillas here are divine! So yummy! The food is fresh and the service is efficient and attentive. It's a line up, order what you want cafeteria-line style, pay, and go find a place to sit type of place.

My fiance had the pork burrito (which was a pretty good size -- sure filled him up) with a side of sour cream for about $8. He enjoyed it b/c he didn't speak a word while eating haha. I got a shredded chicken taco and a vegetarian taco. They gave me plenty of chicken and toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, pico de gallo, and other salsas, but they ripped me off on the guacamole that was supposed to be in the veggie taco. I got about 2 bites of guac (which were yummy) and that was it :( -- so make sure to check for it haha. I also got rice and beans with my tacos, which were whatever tasting. I couldn't finish both tacos, 1 is filling.

Definitely a place that can satisfy hunger -- really good sized portions. Also, it's a great place if you're in a time crunch because you can get in, order, eat, and be out within 30 min. If I have a choice of eating here again, I definitely will be back.

Our total bill: for a pork burrito, side of sour cream, 2 tacos with rice & beans, and a regular soda: $18.74.
