Great place. Tell them it's your first time and they'll bring you their signature Best of Phoenix Sweet Corn Tamale. So good!

HH- 1/2 off appetizers, 2.50 domestics, 3.50 imports, 3.50 signature margarita. 

My wife and I had their delicious chips and salsa then split the mexican pizza. It was way too big to finish! We were bummed that we were too full try try an entree so we'll have to give this place another try soon.
