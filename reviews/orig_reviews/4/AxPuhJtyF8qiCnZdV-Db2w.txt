Let me start of with the service. Let me tell you it was excellent. We grabbed a table outside and enjoyed the nice weather. The only drawback was the bees by the flowers. 

We ordered a margarita and had chips and dip and it was really good. The margarita was actually pretty good also and pretty strong. 

I had a wet burrito and my boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas. All was amazing and should have been since they make their own tortillas right there in the front. 

I definitely will be going back again because i really enjoyed myself.
