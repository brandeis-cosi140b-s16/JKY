After a 6 month hiatus, I had family in town and we wanted Mexican food.  On Black Friday, we knew restaurants could be packed because of hungry shoppers taking a break from their door buster deals.  I reluctantly went back to Macayo's and I'm glad I did.  Whatever beef they were using before is back to the original and the menu items tasted just like I remembered it.  This time I ordered the shredded beef Macayo Chimi with rice and beans and oh was it good!  I barely finished my plate and I was relieved the quality of food had returned.

Our server tonight was Ken and he rocked it.  He made sure our glasses were full and he served our food real quick and we had everything we wanted.  Even at the end he noticed my Father-In-Law's name on the credit card (he paid the bill) and said "Thank You Mr. Rausin for dining with us tonight."  That was a nice added touch.  He really seemed like he cared about his customers.  We've never had bad service at this location.  My faith in Macayo's is restored and I will be back!
