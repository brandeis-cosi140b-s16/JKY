**Amended** There was a very unfortunate oversight on a catering order which left us hungry and disappointed. That was remedied with immediate attention and customer service that blew me away, however. Which is a huge relief, because the food is fantastic and the atmosphere is really great and I was bummed at the idea of not eating there anymore. (Now I want guacamole)
