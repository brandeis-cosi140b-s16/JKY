If you consider yourself familiar with the Tukee area... than you KNOW about the Original Burrito Co. Mainly I tend to go in the morning for one of their delicious breakfast burritos! Along with the burrito you get a small bag of chips and salsa... for breakfast you ask?! You betcha!! mmm mmm mmm. It does, tend to get pretty busy, so sometimes I call in an order ahead of time and pick it up to carry out. 

In response to Abe S's previous review, they are indeed moving to the formally occupied KFC. Mr. Delacruz, the owner seems to view this as an opportunity to expand and perhaps open a drive thru! YAY! I'm all for the drive thru expansion! Apparently "spring" is when all the major changes are happening...
