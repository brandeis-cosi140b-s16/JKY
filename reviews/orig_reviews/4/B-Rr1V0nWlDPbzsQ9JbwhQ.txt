I don't typically disagree with Mr. Fiere but this place is just okay.  It is different and it is a bit strange eating a quesadilla with fried chicken, for sure.  I was going to give this place three stars but the staff are really great and they welcome you here with a great experience.  If you like authentic Mexican food, don't come in here expecting it.  Definitely going to be a place you will love or just enjoy.
