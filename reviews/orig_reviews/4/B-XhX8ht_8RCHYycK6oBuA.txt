Came here with some friends to grab some cheap food and drinks on Ladies' Night.  I had no clue what to expect, but Sandbar definitely exceeded my lack of expectations.  From the half-price pink margaritas (were they actually pink?  I'm still not sure.  Man, they didn't skimp on the ETOH content) to the cheap appetizers (many of which were $4!), there are great deals to be had.  I tried to be healthy(er) and ordered off the normal menu instead of the Ladies' Night specials and was super pleased with my Shrimp Tacos.

We also liked that there is literally sand on the ground outside (so you track sand into your car, just like the real beach!) and that we could watch my husband's fantasy team players suck it up on the big screen.

I think I've found a new favorite sports bar!
