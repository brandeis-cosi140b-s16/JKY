The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had to wait forever to be seated. We went during lunch, but the place wasn't crowded.  Our server, Sara, was new but she did an excellent job. The food was great. Lots of flavor! The music and ambiance was great. Looks like a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends. 

 For 2 people, I paid $25 (not including the gratuity).
