We went to joyride a couple of times over the past few weeks. The tacos are all pretty tasty. My favorite is the shrimp taco. We also tried the nachos and the guacamole. Both were quite tasty. The ambience of this place is pretty great as well. Nice open space. It can get pretty loud and crowded, especially on the weekends. All in all I think joyride is tasty and a fun place to eat. I'd go back for sure and would recommend it to most.
