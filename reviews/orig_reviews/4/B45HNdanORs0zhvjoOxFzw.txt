A decent taco place near our apartment! Though not the best tacos I've had (which clearly goes to Tacos El Gordo), It would still satisfy any taco fanatic's soft taco cravings. From pastor (adobada), tripa, lengua, or the usual carne asada, Taco taco is definitely a place to bring your friends and have some guilty pleasures. Just make sure to wash your hands after.
