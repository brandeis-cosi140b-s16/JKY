Whenever I'm at the Hard Rock for a concert, sign me up for the PINK TACO! If it's a day/night, sit out by the pool. Service is great, food is pretty good too. I've never had anything bad there. They know how to get people in and out when you tell them you're on a time crunch. Would try to go here every time I'm in that area and wanting Mexican.
