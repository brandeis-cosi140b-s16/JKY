Went here with my sis and cousin and friend, the service was excellent, we informed them that the margaritas tasted watered down and weak so they gave us fresh ones that tastes awesome and gave us complimentary shots. The food was excellent and I enjoyed the atmosphere for a tiny place, I'll be back!
