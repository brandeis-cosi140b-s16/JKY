It is a great little hole in the wall on the Northeast corner of Lindsey and Pecos.  You probably wouldn't notice this place if you were driving by because it is set back off the road and it is quite small.

My wife and I like New Mexican style chile and there is a big difference between it and the Mexican (Sonoran) kind.  The green chile at this place is made with Hatch chile's.  The green chile isn't as spicy at this grill as it is in New Mexico but the flavor is undeniable.  My wife had the Chile relleno Christmas style this morning and I had the red chile pork  adovado with eggs.  My wife loved her relleno, even though it was only mildly spicy, and I thought the adovado was a decent substitute for real New Mexican food.  The adovado is in no way as good as Dick's Hideaway but if you don't want to drive 30 miles, it will do.

We have had other things on the menu including the Juevos Rancheros and we like it all.  I held off the fifth star in hopes that he will use Chimayan chile's for the red sauce and Hatch XX hot for the green.  Hey, a guy can dream!
