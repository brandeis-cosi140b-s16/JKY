Always good, and a great idea when you want something a little different.  Eating in is ok but the dining area is no frills, a little less than no frills.

We have been several times now, mostly we get take out which is fairly quick and easy. 

Do this, Jen Red Chicken and Jade Red Pork with either chicken fried rice or pork fried rice and refried beans.  You'll love love love it.

Two can dine with drinks for about $20....including a cookie.  

Friendly staff always which we appreciate! :)
