I'll keep it short and sweet...

Carne Asada and Crispy Fish tacos....yes!! Sub corn tortilla for the flour on the fish. 
$2 tacos after 2pm on Tuesdays, and from 2pm to 6pm weekdays. There are actually SOOOOOOO many specials. $5 drink specials until 5pm like the other Upward Projects establishments, but some specials until 6pm.
Service is hit or miss but it's better than Windsor, that's for sure..
Sit at the bar as long as there is more than one bartender. We've never had an issue until the one time there was only one guy doing everything.
Pineapple mojitos....that is all.
