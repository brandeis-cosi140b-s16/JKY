Another great Two Hippies concept!  We stopped by a few weeks ago to grab a quick dinner and loved it.  My hubby had the rice bowl and I had the fish tacos...delicious!  I also enjoyed an icy pineapple lemonade...so delicious and refreshing on a hot day (comes with a free refill too - bonus!).  The staff was so super friendly and welcoming to our dog who joined us on the patio.
