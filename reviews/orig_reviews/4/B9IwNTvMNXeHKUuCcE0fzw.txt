Growing up in Southern California it is hard to find quality Mexican food in Las Vegas. Taco y Taco is the best authentic Mexican in town. Lucky,  I work in the Henderson area and always come here 1-3 per month for lunch. Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. They also offer Vegetarian option for those non-meat eaters which my co-worker loves. Unlimited on beans, cucumber, grilled onions and sauces. Prices can be a little high but totally worth it. The place is always clean and plenty of space for everyone.  I would recommend to anyone looking for Mexican tacos.
