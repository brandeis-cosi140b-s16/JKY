I am always happy to go to Mad Mex for drinks. The margaritas come in fun flavors, and you can't beat the prices after 10pm.  I have not ever been there for a meal, but I do feel pretty strongly about one thing: chips and salsa should be free. If not for the fact that they make you buy chips and salsa, I would find it to be a perfect pseudo-Mexican bar experience.
