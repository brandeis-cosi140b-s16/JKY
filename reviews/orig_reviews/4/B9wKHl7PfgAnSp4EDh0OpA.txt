Spending xmas in AZ, this was one of the places we stopped at for lunch and because my cousins fiance works here...I promise no biased opinions! 

This place if off Mill st. which is I guess popular among the college crowd especially during the nights because they have a DJ. 

Pretty swanky inside, we sat at the bar and i got kinda confused about the seating, it was like a long table but really thin and not wide, the chairs were interesting too, I didn't think we could fit 5 people but we did and then some, all of our plates fit but it was a very different type look..kinda modern.

Anyways, had a good margarita, ate some chips and salsa and ordered the quesadilla. Kinda dissapointing because it was weird and fried...

I have no idea what this place is like at night I would love to come back sometime and check it out when I am in AZ again. Definately like the ambience.
