I see some reviewers have given this place low scores because they are not selling Sonoran food. Hey, you people, it says in big letters on the building MEXICO CITY CUISINE.It is not a Sonoran Restaurant. Its like people ordering spicy Thia food or hot wings and then complaining about the spice. Thanks to these sorts of people restaurants end up dumbing down their food to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Stop it. Go to Taco Bell if that's what you want.

Anyway, this is the third location of La Parrilla Suiza I have visited, the first was Tucson and the second was the 35th Ave. location. Nice looking place. The food was more or less as I remember it, though the chorizo might have been a little less tasty. Their chips and salsas are awesome so be careful not to fill up on those before your food comes. Prices are in line with most other casual dining places. They also have a really nice bar inside. Service was also very good. 

If you want a change from the typical Sonoran give this place a try.
