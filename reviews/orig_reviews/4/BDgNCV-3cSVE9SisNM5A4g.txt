Food and Service was excellent.  This place is close to the Trump/Wynn/Encore and in the Fashion Mall area.  While you sit and eat you have a great view of the Wynn and Encore.  The Margaritas were great.  If you are starving I recommend the chips and salsa starter, which is only 3 bucks and gives you a lot of salsas and homemade chips to start with.
