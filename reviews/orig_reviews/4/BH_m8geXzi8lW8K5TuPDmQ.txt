I came for the Blood Orange Margarita (excellent), and just to be sure it was legit, I had two...was tempted to have a third, and thought the wiser since it was Tuesday and a early morning mtg was lurking.

So, to keep the buzz going, and achieving my goal for the evening, I only ate half of my enchilada, which on a normal day would have been finished. It was the green chilli number, with pablano peppers, or something like that; anyway, it was layered like a lasagna, and came in it's own cute little skillet! Good flavor, and the tortillas cooked just right, not soggy or too well done.

Pro tip: only eat half, and consume all the sourcream (it doesn't heat up well) and bring the rest home for lunch and add your own fresh stuff.

Tried eating all the black beans, which were good, however, one can only do so many while catching a buzz on Tequila, and fresh juice and eyeing lovely ladies (oh snap, I knew something was missing). Perhaps I shall return on a Friday night.

I sat at the inside bar, which was a bit too compact (this made for superior efficiency, however), or maybe the TV too big, because I was having to look up at an angle that was non-conducive to my personal preference. The outdoor seating along the bar looked to be at a better distance from the TV, but I decided not to look the part of a social outcast and stayed inside...I know, I should have stayed home if I was going to drink and watch baseball, right?

Cool place to chill during the week, and a bit more happenin' on a Friday night (see comment above), especially now that the evenings are cooling off...Yay!
