THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! We ordered and got our food within 15 minutes! Great atmosphere. Located in Downtown Las Vegas - I highly recommend this restaurant! Clean, inexpensive and great quality food! They even had live music//band playing! Margaritas were also to die for! I had the cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken tacos! His exact words "These are the best tacos I have ever had!"
