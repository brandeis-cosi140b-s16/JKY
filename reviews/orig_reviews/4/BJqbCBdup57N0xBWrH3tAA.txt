La Mestiza knows how to do dips and salsa right! I have never tasted anything like the tomatillo salsa that comes with the complimentary homemade tortilla chips. It only got better with the freshly made guacamole and the rich mole sauce on my enchiladas. The chicken was a little dry and it definitely needed the sauce.

The margaritas were delicious and they don't mess around with a glass half full of ice. They are straight up with only 100% agave tequila. 

The music was very loud and a little distracting from our conversation. The waitress was very friendly and I'm sure would have turned it down had we asked. 

There is a lot more I would like to try on the menu, including the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork wrapped in banana leaf), so I will definitely be back!
