If you are looking for a fast and great food on a budget. Look no further, la salsa
cantina is right fit for you. We currently live in Phoenix and i would have to say this is the freshest mexican restaurant i have been to in years. If you get the drink, I
would get the top self Margarita. The quality of the food is hands down
the best in Vegas I have seen.
