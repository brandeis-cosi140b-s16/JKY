I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner and I think it's great. 

For the dinner service we make online reservations ahead which turned out to be awesome. The non-reservations people that walked in ahead of us waited nearly 30 minutes for a table on a busy Friday night. Suckers. Anyway, the tableside guacamole was really good, the margaritas were good, and the enchiladas were tasty. I like that there are vegetarian options for the enchiladas that don't just include cheese, sauce and tortilla. 

When we went for lunch the food was just as great, but the service was a bit slower. Some diners got really fast service and were in and out, others (like us) had to wait a little longer at each step of the process making a working day lunch a bit too long. 

Other than the slower lunch service, I'd recommend this as a solid Mexican food option in this city.
