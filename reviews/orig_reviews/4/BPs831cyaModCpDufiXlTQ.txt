Two words: TACO TUESDAY!

Tecate beer - $2.00
Beef Taco - $1.00
ALL DAY

This place was packed.  Live music started at about 9pm.  I have to be honest...I only had the beef tacos (they were a dollar each!) and a beer...I did sample my friends Margs and they are delicious...each one handmade, no mixes!  And there is a pomegranate tequila you must try.

You have to go on Tuesday night!
