DELICIOUS!

This was my first time at this restaurant and the hype from my friends was certainly legitimate. I've never been to any of the ones in Los Angeles, but supposedly (according to my fellow Yelper, Cori G.) the Vegas one is far superior. 

We came here for lunch after driving all day and I had peeked at the menu ahead of time so I was already prepared to order the Baja ceviche. The waiter then informed me that if I wanted, I could order all three or mix two different ones together which was intriguing. I opted for just the one but I think next time I will have to try all three because I was totally blown away by the Baja one. It was bright and acidic with lots of onion and delicious tender chunks of fish and shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about those tart, tangy flavors with just a little bit of spice from the jalapeno. Yum!

We had also ordered the guacamole and a couple plates of the crispy rajas tacos and both were equally delicious. The guacamole could have been a lot bigger in my opinion but it did the trick, and the tacos were a very unique appetizer. They were simple, crispy potato tacos accentuated by the salty cotija cheese and the sweet roasted corn. All the flavors came together very nicely in this dish, but it's a shame that you only get two for $10!

Of course, the prices here are pretty high but I was expecting that for a restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area that doesn't mind splurging a little on a meal. I am also really interested in trying the Los Angeles chains, and hopefully they are equally as good.
