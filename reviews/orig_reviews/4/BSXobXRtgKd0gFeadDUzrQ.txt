If you want fast, no-nonsense tacos, you've come to the right place.  Even though the food comes out quickly, they do not compromise authenticity for speed.  It's not a very extensive menu, but expect to be full and satisfied.  The dining area is really small with limited seating (although there is a patio area with misters) so I would suggest taking the food home to enjoy.  A solid experience.
