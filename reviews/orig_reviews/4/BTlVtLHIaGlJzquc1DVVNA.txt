Ok...so I am not a big Mexican food fan generally.  I love the idea of it; the big margaritas, always a fun time, but the greasy food usually leaves me not feeling too good after. This is not the case at Los Sombreros!!! 

The atmosphere is sooooo great -- an old house thats been redone with a great porch and fantastic big outdoor bar.  For food I got the mango crab salad which was amazing!!! Light and refreshing, but incredible flavor.  We also had an awesome watermelon salad and my date had a pork dish that was really good too.  His portion was so big but not overly creasy or heavy...just too much.  Mine was the perfect light meal even though the waitress said it was small; thus they probably are accustomed to big portions. 

This is not your typical mexican fare.  Everything was very fresh and not too greasy.  The sangria was good and the margaritas were pretty good as well, although not fantastic.  Over all a winner!! Sit at the covered outdoor bar if you can and watch the monsoons come in.  A great date night out!
