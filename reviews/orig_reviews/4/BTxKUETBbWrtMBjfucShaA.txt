I grew up eating at this place, going back to the days when it was on the corner of 16th and Bethany in the spot where TexAz is today.  I would say that this place is very dependable.  The food is solid, and it's a steal.  I had a machaca burro enchilada style with an iced tea, and it set me back about $10.  It is a real Phoenix institution.
