Friendly staff and good food; we had no complaints. The margaritas were very good as well. I had the chicken taco salad with a side of retried beans. It was very good and the largest I've ever been served, I couldn't eat it all, but I tried! The guys both had enchiladas, and both said they were very good, but couldn't finish ( which is saying a lot!). This is the second time we've been here, and seems to be reliably good food and service.
