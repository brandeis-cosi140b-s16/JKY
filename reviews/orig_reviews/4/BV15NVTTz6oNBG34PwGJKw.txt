First time today really love the quesadilla shrimp it is not fried. Diet coke was great but coke was not.  It's Tuesday but two get one free including the quesadilla. So they had no chicken I will go back and try and edit review if need.  The fried shrimp taco was good I just don't love fried food. I will stick with the shrimp quesadilla which is not fried. I can see why this place has such great reviews
