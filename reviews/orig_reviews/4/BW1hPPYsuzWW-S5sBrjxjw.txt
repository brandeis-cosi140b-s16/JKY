We had a great meal here. I am not sure if it is new owners or what but the place was clean, the food was perfectly prepared and alot of it too. 

I had the sampler platter, the pollo fundito was one of the best i have had, filled with white meat, perfect spice to the sauce, the beans were good, the chips and salsa was really good. 

We will go back, and judging by the 100's of others there, so will they. 

Please try it and let us know.
