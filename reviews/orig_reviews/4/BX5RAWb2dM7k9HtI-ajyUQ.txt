I am a big fan of this place. Open 24/7. All organic and non-GMO. And it's actually some pretty amazingly authentic Mexican food. It's located next door to the Sapphire strip club. Definitely don't let that deter you. This is some seriously awesome food. They have discounts for locals. Their happy hour is pretty great ($5 margaritas and several $5 food items). The servers are friendly and attentive. It's a small-ish place, but there's always plenty of places to sit. It's very clean and well kept. Good ambiance and decor. The three complimentary salsas are amazing. I could just sit here and chips and salsa all day. I really like their sangrias. The wings are decent. Far from hot. But good crispiness and coated in loads of sauce. The tacos and taquitos are delicious. They even have grasshoppers. It's a pretty extensive menu with all kinds of options. I have yet to really dive into the entrees, but I'm looking forward to doing so. If you want good, authentic Mexican food, you need to come here.
