I love this place. On my visit last night I had the steak ranchero and it was great. Never disappoints!!! I have had several dishes here and they are always consistent. The staff is always amazing. The manager checks on you to make sure everything is right. I even love the man singing and playing music. Not too many places in Vegas that are great across the board...but this place is close.
