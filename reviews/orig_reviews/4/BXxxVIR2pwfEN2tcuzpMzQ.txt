We were by spectrum mall and wanted to grab a bite, my wife found this place not too far down the road and was craving posole- so we tried it out. I wasnt hungry but after seeing someone receiving their breakfast quesadilla, I had to try something. I chose the breakfast torta, scrambles eggs, chorizo beans and avacado- a few of my favorite things. My son got the regular quesadilla and my wife got her posole. We had to pay extra for the chips but the salsa's made it worth it- the green was my favorite but the red was better than most restaurants we visit- we didnt touch the chunky as it seemed to have too many onions for my taste. The Torta bread wasn't very thick, but I am not a big fan of huge bread slices- it was toasted nicely with butter and although I couldnt taste the beans- it had a nice combination of the ingredients. My wife's posole was tasty but didnt have much corn and she left unsatisfied as that is her favorite part, my son had a side of beans he layered on his quesadilla and what he didnt finish I helped out with. 

Good food, I would definitely come back, hopefully hungrier so that I could trr the shrimp burrito or enchiladas with an egg on top.
