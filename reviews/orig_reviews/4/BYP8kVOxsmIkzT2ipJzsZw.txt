Yummmmmmmmmm

Loved the interior.  Loved the comfy booths, dark lighting, and cool music.

Loved the food.
My honey ordered the lamb chops with jalapeno mint jelly, he loved them
I ordered the garlic cream sauced pasta with avocados and shrimp

YUM

Paying for chips and salsa does irritate me though.  LAME

I'll definitely be back.
So happy we have a place like this in the Tuke!
