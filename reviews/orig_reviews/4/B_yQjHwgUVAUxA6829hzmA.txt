Excellent happy hour!  I love this kind of place where they serve  the HH menu at a dinner tables and our comfy booth.  
The 3 sauce dip was outrageously good-  we gobbled up that cheese sauce and guac, and the charro bean dip was delish too.  Kids quesadilla was a big portion.  Street tacos are small but full of deep flavor.  I'd come back anytime!
