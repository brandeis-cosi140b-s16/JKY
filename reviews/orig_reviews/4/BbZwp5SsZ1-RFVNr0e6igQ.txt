I finally got a chance to try this spot not to long ago. It was really good! I had the Carlitos Shrimp Burrito and payed the extra $1 to make it wet with cheese on top. The price is very reasonable too. The staff behind the bar was friendly and it looks like they had some mixed drinks and beer available. The reason for the 4 and not 5 is the size of the place. It felt very very cramped. Also I plan on going back and and trying other items so if they are just as good ill raise it because then the size of the place won't matter.
