Once again, loved this place.  Our waiter, Raymond, was a great guy.  On top of all of our requests.  We happened to be here during the running of the Kentucky Derby.  Place was hopping. We will always have a fond memory of this place on that particular day, as my wife won her first bet on the Derby.  Dinner was basically free!!!

I had the fish tacos, SO good!  She had chicken taquitos.  Though the chips and salsa come for a small cost, Raymond gave us extra to go, which was very much appreciated.  I have to say, possibly the best part of my meal was the salsa.  IMO, some of the tastiest salsa ever.
Great environment within NYNY.
