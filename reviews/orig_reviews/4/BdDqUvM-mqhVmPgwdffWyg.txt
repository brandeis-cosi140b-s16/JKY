I have found the the holy grail of Mexican food in Phoenix and Scottsdale, finally!  Absolutely the best Mexican food around hands down.  You can always tell when the place has good food before you even walk in.  The old musty smell of the long past cigarette smoke that still looms and the hard to find entrance to heaven.  Decor is the same as it was back when Bush supposedly came here to eat and the menu still has not adapted to integrate any sort of desert menu to increase profits.  That's ok.  Owners must be doing so well they just do what they like.  

This is awesome for those old timers that want to keep the bar area a social gathering for over the hill drinker regulars. 

As a suggestion, add some desserts to the menu and make it more of a family establishment.  The bar can stay separate of course.  But the food here is too good to limit to just old has been regulars.  

Trust me when I say new generations will appreciate the delicious food served here and the ambience.  

Get desserts!!  Bring the kids!  :)
