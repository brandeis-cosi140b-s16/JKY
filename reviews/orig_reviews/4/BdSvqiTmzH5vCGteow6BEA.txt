I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place as it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in north Scottsdale. I have been here many times for either lunch, happy hour, or dinner. Every time, service is very attentive and food tasty. 

They have a really good lunch menu and happy hour. I consistently get the carnitas street taco meal with 3 tacos and rice. Their guacamole sol is another favorite made with mango, tomatoes, onions, goat cheese, pepitas. Fantastic. And the chips, salsa, and black bean dip? Fugeddaboutit. 

I have had other dishes, some just okay, and others very good. The items I love keep me coming back for more...
