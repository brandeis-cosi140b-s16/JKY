I've been coming here since I was a kid. I always loved the decor, but more importantly, the salsa and refried beans. It's tried and true. When my husband and I don't feel like going on a dining adventure (we love trying new places) this is where we come -- with our Bob and Cha Cha margarita glasses in tow! Their chimi is awesome and big enough to share.

I'm not loving their recent "modernization" and menu change. But we'll be back.
