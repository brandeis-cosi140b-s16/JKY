I loved living in Scottsale because of the warm weather and sitting outside! Tortilla Factory has a HUGE patio

I don't really understand all the bad reviews aside from the service being really slow. Slow service and bad service are not the same. We had to send our queso back because it tasted really watery and the server didn't give us dirty looks about it or anything. The margaritas are delicious (could probably use a little more tequilla..but i like to taste the alcohol), and the tortilla's they give you are really good too. The chicken entree I ordered was also very tasty.

Would probably come more for the ambiance than the food but it def does NOT deserve 2 stars.
