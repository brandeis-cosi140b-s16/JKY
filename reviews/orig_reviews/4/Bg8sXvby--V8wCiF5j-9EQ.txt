Great food at a resonable price. So good you don't even mind the older small dining area. The have plans to update the dining area soon. The best items are the fusion menu items: enchiladas, nachos, and toastadas. The best meat is the pork by far. If you eat pork skip the others meats if you don't try the beef. Great value for flavors and porition sizes.
