Ok second night in a row here.  They start with a  bean dip salsa chips.   If you get a dinner comes with a wonderful soup.  Prices are good if you are a light eater. Menu has 9 items under $6.00.   Otherwise can be a tad expensive.  Played big enough to share.  And yes folks it is diet coke.  

Service is quick and with a smile. 

Almost forgot. Free dessert also.
