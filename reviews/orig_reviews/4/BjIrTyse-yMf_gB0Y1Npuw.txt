Good food, great service! We have used them for catering twice now and both times was a pleasant experience! They showed up on time, set up for us, food was great and a lot of people commented on how delicious and fresh everything was. I love supporting local business and this one makes it easy. I would give five stars but they definitely need more spices on the beef, kind of bland.
