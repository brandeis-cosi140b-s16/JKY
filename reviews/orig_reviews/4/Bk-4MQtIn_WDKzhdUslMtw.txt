Beautiful authentic Mexican restaurant with decent food, moderate prices and good service.

Chips and Salsa (5/5): Complimentary but most importantly one of the best Salsa I have ever tasted.  

Guacamole appetizer (3/5): Decent portion but it's pretty much avocado mashed up. Basically bland taste.  Couldn't taste lime or salt or jalape√±o, definitely no tomatoes or cilantro. 

Fajita (4/5): sizzling and tasty and a good size portion. What disappointed me was the lack of beef strips. Instead there was just a lot of onions. But I would definitely recommend it since the portion when put together does make a delicious Fajita. 

Pollo Fundido (4/5): highly recommended on Yelp. Yet it failed to impress me.  That being said it is a filling dish with a good presentation. I just couldn't really taste the special marinate in the chicken

Service (5/5): Hands down excellent. There were two waitresses attending to my table. Both were extremely nice,  very helpful and checked on at appropriate times

Atmosphere (5/5): Really transforms you into a different world as soon as you walk in. Very spacious, clean, beautifully decorated. Even the fixtures on the walls and ceilings add to the whole Mexican vibe the restaurant is trying to portray. 

Conclusion: Even though the food is average,  the atmosphere and service definitely compensates.  A must try.
