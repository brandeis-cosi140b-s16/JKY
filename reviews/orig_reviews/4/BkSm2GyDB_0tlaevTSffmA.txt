Good beer selection on tap. That alone is a reason for me to go. As a lower calorie option, you can get the tacos plain, and they still taste great. Allows you to really enjoy the taste of the meat without all the toppings interfering. The meat tastes great on its own, and you get a very good amount with every taco.
