In my last review I mentioned the taco plate was $5, it's actually $6 - either I got it wrong or they raised the price a dollar since January. I still recommend it as they are pretty loaded with fresh ingredients and really good tortillas. I usually get one carne, one chicken and one pork - but the chicken is my favourite as the chunks of meat are HUGE and cooked to perfection. It's sure to fill you up.

One note: avoid the frozen lemonade. I was expecting a generous sized fresh lemonade slushy with a lot of flavour (I ordered blueberry) but what I got was a 24oz paper cup with Minute Maid lemonade, too much ice and hardly any extra flavour. Definitely not worth $3.

Minus one star from my last review for the pricing. "Outrageously" yummy but also some things are outrageously priced. You'd think that accepting cash only and charging no tax would also keep the cost down.
