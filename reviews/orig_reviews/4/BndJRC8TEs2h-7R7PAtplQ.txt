Loco is a very dependable, if not incredibly authentic mexican staple.  Having tried most of the menu, I haven't found anything I didn't like.  And I'm picky.  Very.

Enchiladas, tacos, burritos &c are available with a wide variety of meats, and the green sauce is very nearly perfect.  LL is also good at answering strange requests (at one point, missing my local back home, I ordered the cheese enchiladas with green sauce, with carnitas and fajita vegetables on top; this was no problem at all).

Their lunch menu is not cheap, but it is inexpensive and delivered quickly.  Great if you're in a rush, or really need to hear some south-of-the-border polka to survive the day.

Dinner is broader and universally delicious, but unremarkable with one exception: the spicy shrimp dish is heavenly.

Dessert?  Tres leche.

After dinner or saturday afternoon on the patio, the usual drinks can be had, but the quality is above-par.  For instance, their well margarita is made with cuervo 1800.  The tequila selection is not amazing, but should be plenty adequate for the casual connoisseur.

If this review seems tepid despite the four stars, it's because I can't find anything to rave about.  Everything is dependably good, and that's rare.  I have never been disappointed, and I'm there quite a bit.  It's a workhorse, a staple of my weekly fare, and I have no plans to replace it.
