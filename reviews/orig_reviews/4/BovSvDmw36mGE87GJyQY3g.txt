Tiny parking lot, but parking nearby. Great patio and plenty of seating. We sat at the outdoor bar. Really enjoyed the watermelon margarita. The coconut one was good as well. Liked the salsa which came with the chips, but I wouldn't order the guacamole again. I had the chicken green chili tacos and they were tasty. Definitely going back to enjoy that patio.
