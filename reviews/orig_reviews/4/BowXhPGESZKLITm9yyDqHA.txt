The customer service here is great! The atmosphere is retro and cozy. The food is good and big proportions. I had the wrong dish come out for me and they were so good about getting me the right plate and they let me take home the wrong dish and didn't charge us. The kids menu is awesome, big servings for kids and super low price. I haven't found my perfect dish there yet but we will be going back!
