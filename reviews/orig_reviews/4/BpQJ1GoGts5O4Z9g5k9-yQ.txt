La Canasta, why do you have a big security guard at the front door? Perhaps because you are afraid a bunch of bandits may sneak in and steal all of your delicious salsa? I wouldn't be surprised. The chunky salsa was fresh and full of green chilies and peppers.. The hot sauce so smokey and powerful I had to stop myself from sucking it right out of the bottle. I went for lunch and ordered some special chimichanga.. It was loaded with tender chunks of marinated chicken, covered in a spicy red (not enchilada, more chipotle tasting) sauce and covered in cheese. Wow - really really good. My only complaint? I spilled my margarita right after they sat it down :( Damn clutz, and they charged me for another..Hey it WAS my fault..I was so depressed I ate the entire chimichanga plate and washed it down with another bottle of hot sauce.
