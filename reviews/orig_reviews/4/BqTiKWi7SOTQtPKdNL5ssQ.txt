Viva Mexico! Mmmm Cantina - your guacamole never ceases to amaze me. This is a convenient place I frequent whether I need a big, tasty margarita and a few delicious appetizers or when I require a full blown Mexican fiesta.

Some of my favorites include the incredible table side guacamole - that you can request as spicy as you like, the "street" tacos - the pulled pork with pineapple and the fried shrimp are amazing, the Mexican chopped salad - which also comes in a smaller (more manageable) lunch sized portion and, of course, the tres leches cake.

Cantina definitely has a hold on modern Mexican cuisine - just make sure you make reservations or get there early enough to score a table. It gets especially busy on Thurs - Sat evenings. Hubs and I routinely grab a table in the bar area to avoid the wait. They also have a great patio that looks on to East Blvd.

Great food, great service - I'm a big fan of Cantina!

Oh and be careful where you park - while Cantina does have quite a sizeable parking lot, make sure you read any signage posted - the neighboring stores/tenants will tow you if your in the wrong spot at the wrong time!
