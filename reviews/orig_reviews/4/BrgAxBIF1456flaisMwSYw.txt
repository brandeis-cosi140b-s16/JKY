4 1/2 stars actually...

I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.

Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my "vodka surprise" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)

I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.

I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!
