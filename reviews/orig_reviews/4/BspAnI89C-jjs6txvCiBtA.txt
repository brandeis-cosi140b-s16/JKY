I liked this restaurant VERY much. This is where I watched USC beat ASU for the Pac 10 championship of 2009!  And with ASU fans in the house!

They have a DAILY happy hour!!  Draft Bud Lights are like 2 freakin dollars! And all their appetizers (nachos, jalapeno poppers, etc) are all half-off. We got the nachos, and BOY were they loaded!!!  Ground beef, cheese, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, tomatoes... mmmm!!  

So we were like 3 of 5 people who were there on a Saturday afternoon at 3 p.m. but around 5ish more people started filling in. They also have this live band set-up but they weren't on when we were there. 

So it's a great spot to be to watch a game (oh they also have soccer via satellite) and have a couple beers.
