I liked this place! The food was pretty good! The only thing was that there was a lot of big party's so I felt like we were kind of ignored. The girl came and took our plate and we waited for about 20 minutes before she came back with the check. But we were understanding. But other than that, it was great and I would definitely come back next time we're out here!
