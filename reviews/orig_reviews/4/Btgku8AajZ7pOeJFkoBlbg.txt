Am I blue? Only in a good way...  as in the BLUE ADOBE GRILLE variety, baby! This is one of those restaurants that serves REAL southwestern (New Mexico style) cuisine... not some chain themed thang. Naw, this is the real deal.

I have only visited the Mesa location, and while its not much from the outside, its got everything you need on the inside. Like the Prickly Pear Margarita for starters -- sweet and refreshing on a hot summer evening. I had the Tango something or other... which is not currently shown on their website menu. It included a mushroom enchilada that was to die for, as well as some fresh zucchini and carrots julienned and I believe a polenta/seafood thang which was scrumptious. Their salsa is down-right addictive!

Service is excellent. I will be back without a doubt. Website and menu design needs help.
