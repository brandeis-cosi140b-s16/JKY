I have visited Moreno's several times, and am always happy with my experience there!  The staff is friendly and the food is delicious!  The restaurant is small and has been busy each time I have gone, but I have always been able to find a seat.  Most tables are indoors, but there are a couple tables outside where guests can sit.  Don't plan on sitting outside if you want an alcoholic drink, though, since they cannot take those outside to you.

Upon arrival, guests seat themselves, and the waiters don't take long to come over with menus and to get your drink order.  I recommend the house margaritas... they are always delicious!!!  My husband loves the Coca Cola they offer - the good stuff with the real sugar in the glass bottle!  They will bring you a cup with ice, if you would prefer to drink it that way.  A server brings a basket of crispy tortilla chips and three tasty sauces to your table not long after you arrive.  The first basket of chips is free and my husband and I have never had to order another basket-one is enough to tide us over before our dinner arrives.  Though Moreno's is always busy, we have never had to wait long for our order to be taken or for our food to arrive.

The first meal I ever ordered was steak fajitas.  They came out sizzling hot and were fantastic!  I have also tried a couple other dishes, including the tacos, and everything has been good.  The mango salsa they use on a couple of their dishes is very fresh and delicious.

I will definitely be visiting here again!
