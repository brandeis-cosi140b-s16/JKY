We've lived here for 10 years and I've been training myself to eat hotter food over that time. The first time we went to Los Dos was almost 20 years ago and I could hardly eat the food, it was so hot. Now I just salivate when I think of it.

I used to eat the Garlic Shrimp which is tasty but not hot. I've graduated. I love the Garlic Roast Pork and the Green Chile Stew. Unlike the other entrees which normally come with rice, beans and a tortilla, the Green Chile Stew comes with rice, beans, sour cream and 4 sopapillas. Yum! It was so good! We had the Garlic Pork and Green Chile Stew last Sunday... and my hubby drove in from Gold Canyon to bring the same plates home tonight. I'm set for a few weeks now. 

I'm not crazy about their salsas, personal preference.  Their chips are nice and hefty.

This is a NEW MEXICAN restaurant, not Mexican. You can compare the two things, but they're not the same.
 
It gives the initial appearance of being a dark & dirty dive, but it's not. It's clean. I don't have to check my seat or table before I sit.
Parking can be a problem but who cares? The food is worth it. 
Service sometimes lapses... see above.

I wish it was in my backyard instead of @25 miles away.
