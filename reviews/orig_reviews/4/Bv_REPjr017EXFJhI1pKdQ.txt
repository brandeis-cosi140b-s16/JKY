I was given a heads up by a couple of friends that this place was really good, and it's walking distance away from my house.  Finally something good in my ghetto?  We shall see!

I ordered the bulgolgi burrito to-go.  I was impressed!  The finely chopped veggies were fresh and delightful, and the bulgolgi was well prepared, although maybe a little saucier than I like.  While not the best Korean food I have had in Vegas, it is better than most.  I enjoyed their Mexican take on the dish: wrapped in a flour tortilla burrito in style.  The best thing about this place is the price, about half the cost of my favorite Korean spot!  For your hard earned bucks, you get an amazing quality of food here.  Be careful coming here on the weekend for lunch, the place will be jammed packed!  

Thanks to my Yelp friends for giving me a heads up on this one.  I will definitely make this a usual spot especially for a super fast and cheap meal by my house!
