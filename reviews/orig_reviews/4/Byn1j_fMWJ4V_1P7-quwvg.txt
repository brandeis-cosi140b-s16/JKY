This place could as easily be called "Cool Bro Burgers" - low key atmosphere run by beared men who appeared in their 20's. Service was casual but prompt. This place gets 4 stars for creativity on the menu and 3 stars for execution/taste. The burgers all sound amazing. Mine was an egg and onion concoction. It sounded amazing but was just ok. I wasn't asked how i wanted my burger cooked. It was also gone too quick... I was glad i had ordered the sweet potato tots for an extra $2. They were very hot when served and were great with the jalapeno ranch. I would definitely try this place again because i am so curious about the rest of the menu but i hope to find one more satisfying in taste and bulk.
