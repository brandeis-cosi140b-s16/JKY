Now that Tacos El Gordo closed down on the strip, I guess I will start coming here. Prices are pretty expensive for tacos. They serve the same things that El Gordos served. As long as they have lengua tacos, I'm happy. But for $2 and some change... that's quite expensive. They also have beer on tap here.
