Went here for a few drinks and dinner with coworkers... on a Monday. It was empty, and the service was pre-occupied with some game, but I didn't mind since I took my sweet ass time ordering. 

Beers were hella cheap, and the food was palatable. I'd go back if I were looking for a place to drink first, eat second.
