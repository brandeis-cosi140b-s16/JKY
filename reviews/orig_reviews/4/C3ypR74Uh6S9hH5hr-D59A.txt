I absolutely love this place. I joke around that it would make my Mother jealous if she knew how much I liked it. My Dad says the same thing. Growing up on Mexican food I can honestly tell you that the food tastes just like Mom and Nana used to make. I would try different places from time to time and felt like I was a bit of a critic holding them to the "food I grew up with standard". Little did I know how excellent Someburros is. 

Tamales take an incredible amount of time to make and the ones here are pretty tasty and I have no idea how they do it. The chicken tacos are wonderful and even the corn tortilla that it is in reminds me of ovens full of tacos that Mom would feed us with. The red sauce on the enchiladas is excellent and tastes just like Nana's.

When a simple lunch triggers childhood memories, it's good enough to rave about in a review. This is not a corporate joint, so do not expect that. It is a family owned establishment that makes some pretty authentic Mexican food. 

It is discouraging to see people compare this restaurant to a Rubios or Baja Fresh. The food is fast but it definitely does not taste like fast food and I seriously doubt they have horchata at either of those places. While it is as close to the real deal as I have tasted, it is just as good, if not better, than some of the sit down Mexican restaurants that I have been to.
