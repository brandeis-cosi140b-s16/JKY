Excellent food. Great vibe!

Can't wait to get some more Short Rib Tacos and Orange Cucumber salad appetizer. It would be 5 stars but the service was attentive but slow and confused (I think they had to many staff people) but that I know will improve with time. I can't wait to try other dishes and drinks. The menu looks TASTY.  The decor was great and comfortable. 

It was hard to identify employees from customers since they don't have anything on to identify them as an employee.  

I can't wait for it to cool down and be able to sit outside.  Looks really nice out there.
