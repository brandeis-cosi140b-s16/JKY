I found out about this place from a friend who was surfing Instagram; she kept seeing pics of the food from this place and since we were already planning to be in Vegas we decided to try out this place; our server was so friendly and the food was amazing; the sauce of the chicken enchilada was delicious. it was a happening spot busy; we made reservations ahead of time. it has a bar. parking was not a problem found it on the street and outside lot.
