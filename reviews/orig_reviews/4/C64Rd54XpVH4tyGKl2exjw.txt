A modern take on traditional Latin cuisine, the Mission is a perfect option to try something a little different while in Scottsdale. From start to finish I was impressed. Our group enjoyed a 3-course meal which included a sweet, savory and crunchy pork belly lettuce wrap. It was heavenly. Second came the kale salad. I wasn't too much of a fan, but it seemed to pretty popular with my dining companions. It's probably a matter of preference as it was accompanied with a unique tangy dressing. Lastly, we had various tacos. Sounds simple, but they were a far cry from your typical tacos. Seasoned, juicy and garnished with toppings the chicken, beef and pork were anything but ordinary. On top of great food, the ambiance is reason enough to drop by. Apparently Autumn in Arizona means pretty much perfect weather. Their gorgeous patio is a large, romantic dining option that added that much more to our overall experience.
