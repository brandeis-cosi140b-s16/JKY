Well, after perusing the Queen City for burritos and free chips and salsa on any occasion, Cantina 1511 has popped up on my radar a few times. Known for pitchers of sangria and fresh, tableside guac, it might as well be a bulls eye. 

We've stumbled in on multiple occasions to this location. Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. Optimal time for us is a weekend afternoon. Not buzzing with margarita vultures and other seekers of neon drinks with umbrellas in them. We're just here for the food, typically. However, I've seen quite a few neon blue margaritas floating around. They must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea....er...booze. 

My wife and I love the mushroom and goat cheese quesadilla. Perfectly simple and just enough pungent flavor to keep everything interesting. The goat cheese works perfectly with crispy, buttery outer shell of the tortilla. It's somewhat phyllo-esque upon each bite. So flaky and fragile. The mushrooms could be sauteed a bit better, but the flavors are all there. Huge win. 

The tableside guac is an absolute win. Perfect amount for a table of four or two starvacious diners. Balanced well with tomatoes, onion and citrus. I'm not a huge fan of guac that has too many additives. Cantina does it up right. Smooth avocado and the rest of the veggies take care of the chunky aspects. My only gripe is the chips they give you to dip with. Not flat. All folded and intermingling with one another. I want my chips to be separate. Playing by their own rules. Not hugging one another. The flavor is all there. Just too much fraternization. 

Love Cantina. Now, to expand my horizons and check out some of this ever-present booze they have going on. Cheers!
