We wanted simple, but we couldn't resist the "ultimate grill experience."   For$42/pp you can literally try pretty much everything on the menu and order more of things you liked.  Not everything was a winner but it was fun to try everything and wonder what would come out next.   Dishes are tapas size, but you do get full pretty quick.  It was very hard not to fill ourselves with their freshly made chips and salsa.  The chips were warm and with just the right amount of salt.  They were totally addictive.  
I wish I could remember the amazing server we had.  She was so friendly. She chose the best dishes from the menu for us to try, and we weren't disappointed.   I asked for duck chilaquelles (sp) at the end because that was the dish I wanted to order full size at first.  I'm glad I didn't because I wasn't too crazy about that dish, but it could have been because I was so stuffed from eating 6-7 dishes at that point.  
I think it was a nice break from Vegas high-end buffets.  You pay about the same but get the full service experience and prettier presentation.  We didn't have room for dessert at the end,  unfortunately.  If you have a big appetite, do give Border Grill a try.
