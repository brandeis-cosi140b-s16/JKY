Cantina, Cantina...

This place is always a go-to if you want to go out and can't quite decide what you are in the mood for.  

Be warned, this place is packed!  A friend & I went last night for dinner (on a Tuesday) and had to wait for a seat.  So we sat at the bar instead, which was good with us anyway.  The bar area is open with high tops and seats at the bar and has a much more peaceful atmosphere than the restaurant.

Their drink specials are usually on point.  I ordered the 1511 Margarita with their fresh-squeezed orange juice and it was a 10 out of 10!  Their wine selection is also not to shabby for a Mexican joint either.

Food is always good. Hot chips & fresh salsa come when you sit down.  I wouldn't call it authentic Mexican.  I mean, they don't even have tamales on the menu (huge disappointment), but their Mexican Chop Salad and Tacos are always my recommendation.  My friend got the fish tacos and ate every bite.  The fajitas look stellar, but I just can't shell out $16 it - so I stick to the less expensive, just as delicious items.

The wait staff is hit or miss.  Our waitress was similar to Daria reincarnated in human form.  It's like she really (really) wanted to be nice and personable... but in the end she gave up.  In her defense we got our food fast, drinks fast, refills on chips, and she got our orders 100% correct without writing anything down.  So do I really care if she wasn't the most friendly person I've ever met?  Nahh. Rock on with your bad self.  No judgement here!
