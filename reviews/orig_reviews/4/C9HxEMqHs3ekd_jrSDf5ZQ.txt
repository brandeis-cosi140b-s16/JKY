Just tried this place tonight. I liked the free margarita that they give you just for checking in on yelp. I ordered chicken enchiladas with green sauce and they were really good. They came with rice and beans. I thought that the service was good, but I didn't get asked if I wanted anything else to drink when my margarita was getting low, but that is okay. My friend ordered the steak in coca-cola sauce which was good. I think if I end up going back here, I may order this dish. I liked the laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant and the prices were good as well.
