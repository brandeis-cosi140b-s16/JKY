The food is a bit too spicy for me.  If you like spice and can stand the heat, you'll want to try this restaurant (salsa, sauces,  green hatch chile, etc.).  Their white salsa tastes like a mix of spicy salsa a day thinned out white quest dip.  After two chips with this salsa, my mouth was on fire.

 I love the chicken quesadillla!  I always request fajita veggies to be added.  Delicious and fresh!   

This visit (1/13) I had the cheese enchiladas plate and it was great!  Although, the "mild" green sauce was not exaclty mild.  The cheese crisp was smaller than that of other Mexican restaurants and was not crispy (compared to restaurants like Rositas in Mesa or Nandos in Chandler). The guacamole wasn't my favorite.  Sopapillas with cinamon, sugar and honey are yum-my!  Service was attentive and friendly.
