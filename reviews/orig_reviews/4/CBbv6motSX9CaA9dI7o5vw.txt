Fa jeetas

3.5

I have a love hate with you. 

I love the food, although generally average it all works and works well. The tortillas are a tad thick but that is why I love em. The fajitas are always good. Never had bad quality of meat. The chips, beans, sides are all good. 

The hate.. I hate stinking when I leave. I also hate the belly ache from the tortillas and water swelling all up in me. 

The service is usually good. There never is too long on a line.
