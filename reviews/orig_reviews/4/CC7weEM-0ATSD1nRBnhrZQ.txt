Seriously good Mexican food. I had the mole enchiladas which are one of the best things I've eaten in a long time.  The fish tacos were also ridiculously good. Wish I could have eaten more!

Service was solid too.  The only reason it's not five stars is because it is a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is a bit nicer than your average Mexican restaurant, so I understand why I guess.
