Great beer list, excellent margaritas and tasty tacos. Good ambience even on a Tuesday night with a live DJ!

The only negative of this awesome taco place just off the Vegas strip was that my fish taco was really fishy but we are a ways away from the ocean where the Mahi Mahi was born... We'll definitely be back, maybe even this week.
