I'd like to give this place a second shot after an underwhelming first visit. I got some sticker shock (after being told how cheap it was), paying almost $10 for a fish taco and a very small tostada, both of which were good for Champaign, but a bit bland. I'm hoping other menu items will be more fulfilling, and at the very least filling.

I'd also assumed that, since they apparently offer free chips and salsa at the restaurant, I would get some with my takeaway order. I was disappointed to find out, upon arriving home with my order, that is not the case, so it felt like an even worse deal than I originally thought. 

I will definitely give it a second shot now that I know what to expect, but I wish they had their prices listed on the website and that they made it clear you only get chips and salsa with dine-in service. Service was friendly and fast. Parking is horrendous (only a few parking spots, and very limited street parking nearby), but that is no fault of the restaurant; just be aware you might have to circle the block a few times before a spot opens up.
