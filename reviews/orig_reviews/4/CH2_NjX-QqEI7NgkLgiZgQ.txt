Delicious food and friendly staff. 

Sit "outside" overlooking the canal and listen to the gondola drivers serenading their passengers.

I ordered the torta carne. Super soft bread, tender steak topped with cheese, salsa and sweet caramelized onions. The sandwich seemed huge and was accompanied by a giant pile of fresh mixed greens with a light house vinaigrette. It was all I could do to NOT eat every bite of everything I was served. We ordered chips & salsa to eat while we waited for our meals. Nice crisp chips, not greasy at all, and salsa with just the slightest kick to it.

We had great service and great food. Affordable and tasty. Would definitely eat here again.
