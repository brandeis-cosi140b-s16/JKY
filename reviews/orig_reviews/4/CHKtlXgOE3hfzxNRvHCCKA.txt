I really like Garduños.  We used to go to the outlet in the Santa Fe, but I prefer going to this Garduños.  I had the chili verde con machaca.  That's what I always have.  I think they have the best chili verde I ever order.  It's spicy, tasty, and filling.  The sour cream, cilantro, and red onion that come with the chili are very good additions.

The salsa bar is good, but I wish the cups had a bit larger top.  It's a small thing, but have you tried to dip a chip into a salsa container the size of a half dollar.  I sometimes just spoon the salsa onto my chip which is backwards.

We shared flan for dessert.  It's a different texture flan than I'm used to, but it was a good dessert and just perfect for two people for sharing.

I'll be back!
