On a recent trip to Vegas we decided to eat dinner in the hotel since we got in a little late and decided to explore other options outside the hotel over the next few days. The Border Grill was a real find we called ahead but since it was a Tuesday night it wasn't overly busy so we were able to get a table for four right away. 

We started out with a nice cocktail while exploring the menu everything looked so good. I started out with the Blood Orange Cerviche this turned out to be a great choice we ordered a mixture of different entrees to share wow this is gourmet Mexican Food. Our server was perfect and we ordered from her recommendations and wasn't disappointed. We found everything we orders delicious and the presentation was over the top. There are so many great places to eat in Vegas we had plans to eat another meal here but that didn't work out. I will definitely bookmark this for future reference if you are in the area and decide to try them out you won't be disappointed
