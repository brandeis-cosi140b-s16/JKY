Enjoyed my tacos. Chips were good. Roja salsa was good.

A little quiet when we arrived, we were the only occupied table in the dining area. I probably should have moved to the bar area that seemed a bit busier, but what the heck.

$3 draft Dos Equis Amber went down nicely while we chomped on chips (and GREAT "Roja" salsa) and reviewed the menu.

My daughter opted for the gringo Mexican pizza but I'm sad to say that she didn't particularly enjoy it. It's huge but it just wasn't great. She only ate about a quarter of it.

On the other side of the table, I opted for tacos. I mean, it's in THE NAME. So I got a plate of two tacos. Number one that was the Jamaican chicken. Excellent with some spicy jerk chicken and sweet fried plaintains on there. Yum! And the number two was the Chickpea Felafel. Absolutely excellent with cucumbers and pickled oions and Greek yogurt. Both were very tasty and delish. For my side, I chose the "Spicy cilantro lime fries." Tasty but not really all that spicy but the cilantro was sprinkled on top and the lime squeezed in there too. I definitely made out better here.

Several televisions tuned into the sporting events of the moment. Service was decent, even if we were the only folks at a table in the back area. Food took a bit, but fresh food cooked to order is gonna do that. No complaints.

Good vibe, good food, good service. It's good. I'm a fan!
