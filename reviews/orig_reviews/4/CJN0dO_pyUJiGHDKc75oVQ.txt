This particular location is in the deep part of Arroyo Market Square, but it is a really nice location to visit if you enjoy Chipotle. The restaurant itself is clean and I haven't had a problem with the staff. One of the things I like about this particular location is that they have outside dining that provides a calm, relaxing environment. If the weather permits and it's not too it or cold, take your meal outside and enjoy it!
