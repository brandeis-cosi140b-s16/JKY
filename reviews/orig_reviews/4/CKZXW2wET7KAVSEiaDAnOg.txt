This place is a fantastic Mexican restaurant, but it loses points for being in one of the worst parts of Vegas.

My parents have been bringing me to this restaurant since I was a baby, even back when they were in their old location on Charleston. As anyone who reads my reviews knows, I am not a huge Mexican food fan, but this place has amazing food. From chips and salsa right down to entrees that consist of a little bit of everything Mexican, I don't think I have ever eaten a bad meal here. It's difficult to recommend a particular item, but I doubt any fan of Mexican food will be disappointed.

The staff are also extremely friendly and courteous. Having gone here for years, my family is often recognized when we pay the place a visit. These are great folks, and they definitely treat their customers like family.

The atmosphere is average, though it does get a bit annoying when soccer games are going on on the TV, and people start cheering loudly. Also, for no apparent reason, there are tons of posters for old Las Vegas boxing matches on the wall. Not complaining or anything, I just thought it was a bit strange. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving this place a higher score is its location - the run-down, old end of the Strip. If you've ever watched Pawn Stars, this place is kitty corner from the pawn shop. There are always seedy characters down here, and it's common to have the homeless begging you for money. It's too bad the owners here can't borrow Antoine from the Pawn Shop to clear out the riff-raff that often fills the parking lot.

Still, despite its not-so-great location, Dona Maria's has some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. Come for the food, but do yourself a favor and come armed.
