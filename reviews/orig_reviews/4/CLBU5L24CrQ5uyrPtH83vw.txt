I really liked this place and will definitely go back but its far from perfect. Not the cleanest or nicest place, but that's cool with me I'm used to going to crappy run down spots in Chicago that have amazing food. I got the Del Ray Torta, OMG it was crazy! Sooo good though! Its like the biggest sandwich I've ever had. I also had the watermelon juice that was so delicious! 

Disappointments include: 
music that was too loud
no tortilla chips?! they only have ruffles!
