Street tacos galore here! I've been here twice so far. Both times were after a run event down in Tempe, because I live way far way in the NW valley. When I do make it to make it this side of town, I think about this place, because I love street tacos.
Guacamole! You must order this, because it is soooooo- good!
My friend had the Sonoran Margarita with prickly pear juice and I had the Hibiscus Float Margarita. Both are worth trying since they are a bit more unique. 

Atmosphere is on the modern side. You have the choice of sitting either high on bar top type tables or very low, on couches with a low center coffee table. I recommend getting a bar top on the patio or even inside if you plan on eating, because you will make a mess of yourself if you try eating on coffee tables! I've only been here right when they open at 11am both times I've been here, so crowding hasn't been issue. It's like having the place to yourself if you come when they open on the weekend, and it's great, because it's laid back and you get great service when there's no people there yet. Even the manager stopped in and checked on us too just to make sure we were happy both visits. 

I discovered this place via Phoenix Magazine's Best. I can't remember if it was Best Resturants or Bars, but regardless, get guacamole, street tacos, and margaritas here all together at the same time!
