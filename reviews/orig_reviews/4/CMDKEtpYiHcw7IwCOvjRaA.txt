This is one of two places in town I send out of town guests when they ask for a good, authentic Mexican restaurant.  One friend from Baltimore loved it so much that later in the week when his wife arrived, he took her back instead of trying something new.  I am especially fond of the chilaquiles, which a Mexican friend vouches for as being authentic.

I do try to avoid flamenco night as it gets rather loud and impossible to have an intimate conversation.  But other than that it's one of my Phoenix favorites.
