After having moved back to Phoenix 2 months ago, I stumbled into this happy hour spot because I read somewhere that it has free wi-fi. Lucky for me, I think this may soon become my favorite happy hour place in Phoenix. The cellar was really intimate and cozy. I actually have no idea what the upstairs restaurant looks like. There was a confusing fireplace downstairs which is perplexing when you come in from the 100+ degree heat. It definitely made the ambiance more intimate and I don't even remember feeling the heat inside.

The menu was really awesome, and I had a lot of trouble deciding which happy hour appetizer to choose. I decided on two which ended up being more than too much food. The ceviche was all white fish, and sweeter than I typically like, but it was definitely fresh. The steak tartare was also very fresh. I only wish the bread was sliced a bit thinner. The beer selection was not too bad at all. They have Chimay on tap, and Hoeegarden in the bottle which is all I need. For the amount of food I ate, and the beers I drank, the price was really affordable as well.

I also really enjoyed the prompt, and friendly service. I will be visiting this place pretty often, and hopefully with one or two friends. The cellar is not really friendly for large groups.
