Good stuff.
All the meat, beans, and tortillas are made fresh and all are good.
They have a very wide selection of meats from your standard carne asada/carnitas/shrimp to the more exotic cabeza/lengua/3 things I never even heard of! On top of all those meats they even have soyrizo for you veggie types and I overheard somebody say the beans are prepared vegetarian as well.
The ingredients all seem really fresh, and I liked the setup of different stations for the different meats (although nobody seemed to be following directions the day we were there). 
One complaint: while delicious, the 'gran taco' is definitely overpriced at ~$4.50 for fish or shrimp.
It's not super close to my house, but when I'm feeling a taco, I would definitely go out of my way for taco taco.
