First time visiting this new taco shop in downtown Gilbert. The interior is small (maybe 8 tables) but there's a large patio in the back with plenty of misters and shade. I went around lunch time and was happy to see the place pretty much packed. In fact, I had to wait about 5 minutes to get an indoor table. We met the owner, who seemed like a cool guy- friendly and thankful for our business. His father owns a seafood market in Mesa so the food served his is super fresh and never frozen. The decor is surfer/beach with surfboards hanging on the walls and beach blue shades of paint splashed everywhere. 

The menu is simple with great options. Of course the specialty is tacos and, more specifically, fish tacos. My buddy ordered the fried cod tacos and I went with the chicken (they offer carnitas and steak as well). For $6 I got 3 good sized tacos loaded with a good portion of grilled chicken, cabbage, diced radish, onion, cilantro, and an avocado/garlic sauce. They were delicious and filling. You also got two small sides of rice and whole pinto beans (+ a small side of their house salsa for additional flavor). It's a great deal for the $6 and seems to be much cheaper than the rival taco house located further down the street (Joyride). I also ordered their chips & salsa, which were tasty and a good way to get started. You have to order this ($2) as they are not complimentary with the meal. My friend's fish tacos (2 of them) were large and full of fish. He liked them very much (he's already visited 7 or 8 times).

Overall, I would definitely come back for another visit. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They don't pester you but know right when to swing by for refills, check-ups, etc. 

Price, friendliness, high quality food, good drink options, and a great menu should take you to SoCal Fish Taco Company.
