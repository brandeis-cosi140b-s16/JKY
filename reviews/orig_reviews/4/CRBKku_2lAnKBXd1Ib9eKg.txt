This is one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food.  The place is always super clean and a great place to eat with the family. I ordered the Chicken Chimis with the queso sauce. Comes with rice beans guac n sour creme. This is my favorite thing to eat here. I' ve had their enchiladas here before and they are not that good. The chimis have green peppers inside which is magnificent.  I also ordered the hot salsa which i poured over the chimis and bam.  Was awesome!! This sauce is made with habaneros which is great but very spicy. The service by Chip was great as usual. This is the the second time we have been served by Chip and he is definitely one of the best servers at Abuelos.   I only had one negative on our dining experience; my favorite thing about Abuelos was their cold beer in the ice frosted Margarita glasses, however today my beer was served in regular glasses. The beer was not cold, so I was disappointed.  I still left Chip a generous tip, and he told me they did not have these glasses,...what  a disappointment. Still give them 5 stars for meal n service but 4 stars for the beer failure. Overall 4.5 stars for this place.
