Cutting straight to the chase, the Spanish soup is AMAZING! 

So one summer afternoon my friend and I decided to go to Bass Pro shop to check it out. After we were done there we looked around Mesa Riverview for a place to each lunch. Not being familiar with the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was around and found Matta's. Me being a vegan, it probably wasn't the best place to go as everything (except the Spanish soup) has dairy. The waitress wasn't really that helpful in telling me what items I could pick from. All she said was, "this probably isn't the right place for you." Kind of a rude comment...especially since there's only 1 item on the menu. Anyway, I will say that the Spanish soup was delicious and I would go back just for it.
