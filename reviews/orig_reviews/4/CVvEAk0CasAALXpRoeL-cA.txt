Because the sign said "cantina", we were expecting more of a restaurant and bar than a counter with tables. We walked in and thought, ok I guess we place our order at the cashier and then find a seat. But we were seated and given menus, though they were paper and all the other service items were paper/plastic except for my margarita glass. It felt odd because it was kind of trying to be a restaurant but only in certain ways. I guess I shouldn't complain because the prices were very reasonable. We had a nice waitress with good service. Overall the food was great! I wasn't that hungry but the blackened chicken tacos with a hard shell were awesome and could have eaten 5 or 6. If I could get specific with improvements, it would be to offer real plates and glasses for all table service, upgrade the paper napkins and menus and warm up the chips and offer them complimentary.
