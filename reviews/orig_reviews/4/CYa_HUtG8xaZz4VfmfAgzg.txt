4 stars for very small things, but the good things first... Customer service is A+++ and the lady at the order window was very helpful with our first visit. The breakfast burritos were awesome and very affordable. My son had a small bacon burrito and still couldn't finish it. My wife and I had shack size Country burrito and The Works and they were very very good. Knocked off one star for the number of flies in the eating area (minor nuisance) and that the burritos were not wrapped well and opened at one end while eating them. Overall very good experience and will be back!
