The wait was longer than I would have expected on a Monday night (20 minutes) but luckily there was room in the bar. 

We got there a little before 7pm and were able to order off the happy hour menu. We got the queso, which was good but more cheese than 2 people should eat in one sitting.

For my entree, I got the 2-item combo (I love a combo!) with chile rellano and chicken enchilada. I enjoyed both, especially because the chile rellano wasn't heavily coated with batter. Came with soup, which I liked so much I also had the hubby's portion. For dessert, we ordered the fried ice cream which I liked. Ice cream is a combination of 3 flavors (I think caramel, vanilla and chocolate?) and was still very cold inside the deep fried batter, but the batter was chewier than I expected.

My overall experience was good. The only thing that dampened it was there was a large projection screen in the bar, which was showing the hockey game and the table next to us was overly loud and obnoxious with their hockey commentary. But that's not Juan's fault, lol.
