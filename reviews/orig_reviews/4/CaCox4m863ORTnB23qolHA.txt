Saw a bunch of good reviews for this place & decided to try something different. This is kind of a "hole in the wall" spot on Decatur amid boring & bland restaurants & shops (except Pepe's!) so I wasn't expecting too much. But their menu & customer service were pleasantly surprising! 

Boyfriend got the fusion torta with pork belly (which was extra) & I got the fusion chimichanga with bulgogi. Yum! My chimichanga was topped with their "Komex Slaw" which had tons of flavor & made the dish IMO. (Boyfriend got a side of it & put it right in his sandwich. He says if you get the torta, this is a must) 

All in all, not a bad way to spend $20 & we'll definitely be coming back to try their other dishes!
