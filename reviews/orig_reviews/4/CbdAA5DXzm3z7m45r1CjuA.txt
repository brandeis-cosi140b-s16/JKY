SumoMaya has a fun menu. We ordered several things from the happy hour menu. I loved the unique flavors and combinations. They also have an amazing mango habanero sauce that you can use on any food item you choose. The salsa platter wasn't that interesting but the guacamole with crab meat was awesome. I would recommend coming and sampling off of the happy hour menu.
