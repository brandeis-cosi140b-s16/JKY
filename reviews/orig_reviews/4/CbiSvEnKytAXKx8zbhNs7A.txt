If you're not familiar with New Mexican food; be warned: it is pretty darn hot! Its very good at La Ristra though and somewhat more high brow than some I've tried. The portions are a little large for me partly because I drink a gallon of tea to douse the heat. Its a little expensive in my opinion but the service makes it worth the extra few dollars.
