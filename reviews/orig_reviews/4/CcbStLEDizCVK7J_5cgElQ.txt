Wow, this food is amazing. We went for lunch on a very busy Friday and waited in line just short of an hour. Which is a bit crazy considering its a pick your own ingredients kind of place. On our visit they seemed short handed. Everyone was trying samples of things which seemed to slow down the whole the process. At around 12:30 another staffer came rushing in and threw on some gloves. This sped things up immensely. He must have been late or on break, I can't see how a restaurant would let someone start that late during lunch rush. I was annoyed by the long wait but my burrito was so freaking amazing that I just have to give them 4 stars. Bravo!
