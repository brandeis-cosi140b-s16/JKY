You really can't get a better deal than $1 tacos. After nearly risking your life parking off the street just wait in line for 15 minutes to place your order. I have to admit that the hype lured me in... Anything that takes 15 minutes just to order better be worth it. 

It really is. Yum!.. I personally think it's the corn tortillas which they heat to perfection. I mean, who wants a soggy taco? Very zesty salsa, thanks for the extra limes, and the asado and pollo both are succulent. Very tasty.
