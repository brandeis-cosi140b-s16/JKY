Yuuummmm. Typically, I enjoy going to little hole in the wall Mexican restaurants and tacos stands... This is the only non-authentic Mexican place I've ever been to that could hold it's own (when it comes to tacos at least). Their street tacos were so tasty!

Atmosphere was a little off though... Just one bartender/waitress serving half of the people in the restaurant.
