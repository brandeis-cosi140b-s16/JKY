Drove by this place & was intrigued but filed it away. Then, minutes later other relatives who had also driven past it mentioned it so we decided to give it a try based on previous reviews.
Um, YUM! Between the 8 of us we had quite a sampling of the menu and no one had a single complaint. Carne Asada burrito was the best!
Super inexpensive and huge portions!
Only 4 stars because it took them 10 mins to give us our drinks and an additional 20 mins before the food was ready.
They ran out of chili beef and comped us some chips but it was still a disappointment to those who really wanted it.
We will definitely be back the next time we visit the parents!
