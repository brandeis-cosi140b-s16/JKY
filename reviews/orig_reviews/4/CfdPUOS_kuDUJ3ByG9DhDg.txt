TWO IS NOT ENOUGH

Some of us may remember the Sabor Restaurant behind Mimi Cafe on Stephanie in Hendertucky. Yu-go Chauffeur was absolutely in love with Mexico's west coast prehispanica influenced cuisine.   Sabor's menu pricing was a bit too rich for Hendertucky back then. It's no longer with us.  I think Las Cazuelas brings back that sabor cuisine favorably and much more affordable.

The American perception of Mexican cuisine is of a yellow bell i.e. tacos and burritos. This afternoon we ordered their sweet chocolate Enchiladas de Mole Poblano plus Enchiladas de Verdes. Oops, we also got  a small bowl of nachos and salsa to start. Next our meals are delivered on Azteca mirror like polished metal plates with shiny brass handles accompanied by white plastic forks. I can relate to the pallets creatively utilized as their wall decor.

On each plate lies four chicken enchiladas. One with sweet not bitter chocolate sauce and the other with verde (green slightly spicy) sauce. Let's just say it faster to prepare four small taquitos than one or two heavier enchiladas.  Not gonna pull the sheet over your eyes and say it was a fulfilling eating experience. Personally I think another entree would have enabled us to leave without having to stop at a taco stand.

The next time I am better prepared to order differently.
