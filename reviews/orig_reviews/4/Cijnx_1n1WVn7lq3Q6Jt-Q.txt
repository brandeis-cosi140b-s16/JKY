I have always been a fan of Elmer's. Their food is delicious and the staff friendly. I am upset though as they seem to have recently changed their serving sizes. It feels like the price went up and the serving size went down which bums me out. I have been going to Elmer's since I moved to Arizona and really love supporting a family business.
