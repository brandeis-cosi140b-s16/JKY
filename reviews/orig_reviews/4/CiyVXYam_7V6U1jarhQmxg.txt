Fantastic Authentic Sonoran Tacos. This would be what I call your street vendor style food. If you want gourmet there are other places for that such as La Santisimas. With that said, this is the style that I crave the most. 

I recommend the Carne Asada and El Pastor tacos. They are rich and flavorful. 

Make sure to snag a bottled coke while your at it.

I will be back!
