Went here because I got an Amazon Local deal, and now I am glad that I did! The place was empty when I got there, which worried me a little, but the service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious. Between my husband and myself we had the machaca fish, shrimp and battered fish tacos, and they were all really tasty. The corn tortilla had just enough elasticity to hold together without tearing, but was not chewy. The battered shrimp and fish had good flavor and did not taste like the fish sticks you get at the grocery store, like in some places. Two tacos was enough to fill me up, and they leave the topping choice up to you (there is a little fixings-type bar with slaw, salsas, etc). Worth the trip to check it out!
