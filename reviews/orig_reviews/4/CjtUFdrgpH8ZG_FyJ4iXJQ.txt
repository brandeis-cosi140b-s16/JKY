Found this local place on Yelp rated 5 stars while in the Downtown Vegas area.  

Berto, the only wait staff (at the time we were there) was attentive, funny & helpful.  5 stars for the wonderful service.  

Was disappointed that they did not serve top shell margaritas but we had their Bud Lite margaritas served in a mason jar, came in lime/strawberry/mango flavors.  We had one of each and they were good and pretty strong.  

Our meal was good.  Started with their Campechana (shrimp/octopus cocktail) and it was excellent and shrimp was plentiful.  I had their snapper deep fried served with an onion jalapeño spicy sauce.  Mind you, I like spicy and this was spicy!  I asked for fresh sliced jalapeños on the side and didn't even need it!  Mom had carne asada and the beef came out too dry, comes with grilled cactus and jalapeño. Sis had their shrimp enchiladas and said it was very good.  

You get a free horchata with check in.   Had no idea what it is and Berto came back with a sample.  His description was pretty accurate, "left over milk from cinnamon toast crunch cereal".  We were too stuffed to take advantage of it but it was good.

Overall a good experience!
