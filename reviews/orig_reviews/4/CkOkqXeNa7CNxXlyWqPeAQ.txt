We have been traveling all day, and all we wanted was a decent meal that wasn't fast food. We were going to wait until we got home, but when our flight was delayed, we couldn't wait.  We really didn't want airport food at all. We were pleasantly surprised! Quick service, lots of great flavor and filling. I had the pollo pablano and pasole. My husband had the pork tacos. It was definitely better than our expectations.
