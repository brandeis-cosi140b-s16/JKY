Got into Vegas on a Sunday night and came here because my boyfriend had been here for during the holiday season and just loved it. It was a great place, took us a min to find in the Mandalay hotel but once we did we were pleased. Sat immediately with smiling faces and sat at a nice table. The decor was contemporary, I loved the glassware. 

Chips and salsa were good but could've been better (salsas just weren't to my liking-personal preference) they were too...um...watery? I like thick/chunky salsas but then again maybe it was good so I didn't fill up on them because the chicken quesadilla I ordered was great, my boyfriend ordered the beef tacos, delicious! had cadillac margaritas too...can't have mexican food without a margarita! :)

We'd definitely go back.
