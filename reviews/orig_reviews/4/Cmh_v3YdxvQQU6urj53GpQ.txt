I've been waiting for this place to slow down a little after their opening and it was well worth the wait. I used to go to the location on Charleston so I'm glad the one in North side has finally opened up! I usually get the adobada fries and man, were they good! The spicy pork was so delicious especially with the green sauce on top of my fries. The only thing that bugged me was that this location doesn't give you as much fries as the other location. Other than that, I will frequent this place more for the adobada! Yum!
