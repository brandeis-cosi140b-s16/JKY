My love for America's remains, but went down a star for the inconsistency of the hours.  On more than one occasion in the past month we have arrived to find the restaurant closed in contradiction to business hours.  There has just been a printout on the door saying "we're closed please head to the Melrose location, mention this and get 20% off your order."  By the time I've been disappointed in my decision to choose a closed restaurant for my meal, I am certainly not interested in traveling to another location.  I want something close and convenient (like this location).  So now we're still fans, just only during weekdays, which seem to be the only days they're open.
