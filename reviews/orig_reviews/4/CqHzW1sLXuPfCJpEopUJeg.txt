Great dinner!  Stopped on our way to Flagstaff on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed.  Restaurant is clean, food was delicious and everyone working was very polite and super friendly.  Chicken tacos were moist and chimis were delicious.  Will definitely stop again when we are in the area.
