My aunt gets food from Pedro's almost every week and when I can drag myself to that side of town I always eat here.  We were here last week for dinner and had a delightful cheese crisp (truly the best invention EVER!) as an appetizer.  I usually order their combo with chicken tacos but decided to order a chicken burro this time.  Their burro plate comes with a burro (no sauce) and rice and beans.  The burro was decent (beware, their chicken is cooked in a sauce so if you are not a fan of sauces it may catch you off guard.  I like it though!)  I like the beans but their rice lacks something...  The rest of their food is really good.  My mom always gets the shredded beef burro enchilada style with green sauce and it's delicious.  Lots of shredded beef!

Bottom line: This place has been here forever and is always packed.  That should speak volumes as there are a milion restaurants in this city.  If you're in Glendale, go to Pedro's!
