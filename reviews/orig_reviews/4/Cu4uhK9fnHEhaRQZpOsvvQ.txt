A friend of mine turned me on to Tacos Atoyac...and one day we forgot it was closed on Mondays, so we went here to the Tacos Atoyac Alumni joint...its every bit as good if not better.  If you want a fish taco like no other...this would be the place to go.  Not kidding.  This is a small place.  Mucho Macho tacos uses the freshest ingredients skillfully and delivers big flavors.  Check out the special salsa in the refrigerator below the salsa bar...totally worth it.  Its almost like the secret stash.  Don't miss this place but get there early, its an old, Circle K location that features 3 tenants and it isn't 'long' on parking spaces.
