We were really excited to go to this new spot in town and we were just as excited if not more walking away planning our next visit with fully bellies and big smiles. The burgers were very tasty. The fries were good and the shakes were seriously out of this world. We got a salted dulce de leche and then special ordered a chocolate banana stand shake. 

The staff was super friendly and we chatted with the owner for quite some time. I love her vision and her desire to serve a great product at a low price in an awesome atmosphere. They've only been open for a week and she's already achieved it! 

I'm excited to send my friends here and to come back and try the tacos, lemonade and horchata.
