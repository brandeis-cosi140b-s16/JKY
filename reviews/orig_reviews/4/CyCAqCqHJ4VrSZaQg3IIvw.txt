i loved this place its the coolest.  Its such a cool thing to hear about a restaurant or a club in a far away city and then actually get to go there!!  The tacos are really good and the service was great.  It was clean and had good muzik to eat too........for some reason that's important to me I'm finding out as i yelp more, I'm a Mexican food lover its pretty damn good here.  When your done you can cruise across the hall to this hookah bar and have a smoke if you know what i mean so cool love the ambiance
