This place was great. Our server he was very very awesome. I went to meet my mom and step dad to have dinner. The woman at the front was very polite and greeted. It is inside the mall also has an outside patio area to eat.

I worried because it was so packed we might get slow service. Jason was very punchioual with bringing out our drinks. He recommended the frizen margaritas which was really good. They brought out corn bread which I've never really been a fan of. But surprisingly it was really good. We didn't wait long for it food, I could tell it cane out fresh. I ordered the green chili enchiladas which was great. They gave me about a spoonful of rice and like half my plate was full of blan black beans. 

The restrooms were very clean, I give 4 stars because it felt a little dark, the beans, and the rice.
