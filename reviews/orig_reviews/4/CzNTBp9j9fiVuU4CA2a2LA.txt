I got the Pollo Rico.  Huge portions with lots of cheese and more cheese. The chicken was good, not very spicy.

Another member in my party got the Rl NÃºmero Seis. They did not enjoy it! I tasted it and did not care for it either. The beef was very salty and very salty with a lot of spice.

Chips and salsa were good. Atmosphere was fun.
