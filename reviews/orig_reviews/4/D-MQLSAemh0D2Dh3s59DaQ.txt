Craving for Mexican food and ready for a late lunch, my boyfriend and I walked over there from Freemont Street after reading the reviews... And for us it was a hit!

I went for a combo plate with 3 tacos, rice, beans and chips and my BF went for the burrito with lengua. We also took a plate of chips, salsa and guacamole. 
The plate with salsa and guacamole was very good, both dips were so fresh, not overwhelmed with spices so you could actually taste the flavor of the avocados and of the salsa. The chips were great too!
I got the al pastor, carnitas and pollo mole tacos. Neither of them disappoint. The meats tasted great and well prepared. Personally I actually prefer when the tacos are coming with just one tortilla, you are full less quickly. The sides were both very good too, particularly the beans. 
Regarding, the burrito. My boyfriend said the meat was excellent and with a great taste of lengua. It is not over packed with rice. And the cilantro finish to give a fresh taste. 

Now the service... The all crew was very friendly. When we entered, we looked at the board to decide what to get and the waitress just told us to take our time and go at the cashier when we were ready, it was nice. For once we didn't feel rushed into making a decision. After getting our food, both the cook and the waitress came to check if everything was ok and seemed very pleased when we told them we greatly appreciated the food.

Finally, regarding the quantity-price. The portion size are good for us (both European). We were both full at the end of our meal and felt that the price were quite good for the quantity and quality of the food you get.
