I'm giving 4 stars based on exemplary service, pretty good margaritas (2 for 1 during happy hour!), and table-side guacamole.  There were about 10 of us (started with 5, we kept growing over the afternoon), our servers were fun and friendly.  We had a blast!

Great outdoor people watching and good margaritas!
