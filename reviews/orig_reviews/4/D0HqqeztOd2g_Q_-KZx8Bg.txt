Carne Asada how it was meant to be eaten. The carne asada here is great. While Americas Taco Shop is not the most authentic, they have created excellent carne asada tortas and vampiros. If you go here and order chips & salsa, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy, and it tastes great. Parking can be scarce in the small lot behind the restaurant, so parking down the street on a side street may be your best bet.
