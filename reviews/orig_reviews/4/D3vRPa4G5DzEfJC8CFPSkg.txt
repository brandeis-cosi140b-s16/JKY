The decor is a bit spare, but the food more than makes up for it!  If I had to choose between a place decorating on a budget, versus cooking on a budget, I'd do the same thing PVB did - give it some kitschy yet modern touches but focus on the food.

First, the sweet potato tots are excellent!  Crispy outside, tender inside, and very tasty - if you like sweet potato fries definitely give these a try. (And if some maple syrup finds a way to your table - dip 'em!)  Homemade chips were great too.

The basic paradise CHZ is a very balanced burger - the brioche bun is perfectly toasted and I love the unusual options of havarti or smoked mozz in addition to cheddar.  They do the fixings a little differently too - pickled onions and cucumber are a fresh idea, and a nice change.  My only complaint was I ordered without either sauce - jalapeno ranch, or the 1000 island that I was given.  I dealt with it instead of asking them to remake the burger, but mentioned it when they circled round to find out how it was. They apologized and without asking comp'd a basket of the french toast fries!

Now, I don't know why the world has not discovered the mouthjoy created by these simple, delicious morsels before. Holy crap. Hot, dusted with powdered sugar, served with maple syrup. Holy moly, dear lord I want more of them now.  And now. {shudder} Already having withdrawal symptoms...

Fountain soda! They do have a gun now, for those of you who would like a fountain Coke and not just the canned selection or brewed iced tea.

So yes, we'll be back to try the specialty burgers, shrimp club and tacos - and the shakes.  And I'm looking forward to it.

(Hmm. French toast fries, dipped in a marshmallow malt?  Yup.  Gonna try that FOR SURE.)
