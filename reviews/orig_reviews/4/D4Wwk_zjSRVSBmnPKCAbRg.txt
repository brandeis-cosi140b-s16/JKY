Holy Shit, I don't really like Mexican Food other than this small street cart I tried in Playa Del Carmen, but this place is the F*&* Bomb!  Best Tacos in Vegas, you must also try the green onions, it's delicious!!!!

Only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the way they have the lines setup.  There are three lines, the left is for beef, right is for their spicy pork and the middle is everything else.  So, after waiting in one line then grabbing your food, you have to get into another line to order something else.  By that time, my tacos were a little cold.  

**Tip**
If you pretend your ignorant and order everything in one line, you might be able to get away with it.  :)
