So I was at my office and we were discussing what we wanted. We wanted to try something new! And let me tell you, Bruddahs was a FANTASTIC choice! 

It was super close to my office, and when I walked in I received a friendly ALOHA from all the staff. I immediately felt good right off the bat. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are big. So sharing is a definite possibility if you know you don't eat a lot.

I tried all three of the meats. Steak was by far my favorite! It was cooked so tender it nearly fell apart and the flavor was so yummy. Their salsas were flavorful and accented the meat. I tried the seaweed rice as well and it was fantastic! Everything ordered was superb, and all my coworkers loved it as well. I will definitely be going back to try everything else and different combinations.

I would definitely suggest trying this place out for good Hawaiian food!!
