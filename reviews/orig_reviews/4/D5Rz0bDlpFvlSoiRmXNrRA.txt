The signature margarita as good as it gets! Another virgin, blood orange, cocktail outstanding too. Side table guacamole excellent, popular too. The chicken torta was good, not unforgettable though. Mahi tacos battered, not necessary in our opinion. The mission fries were a mix of sweet and regular potatoes but mostly regular. Would not recommend. House chips and salsa great!
