This place is pretty pricy I have to say. I ordered a breakfast Burritto like everyone else. The confusing thing about this place is them asking you what kinds of chili would you like. The green chili was spicy but very flavorful. The red wasn't so great.  It tasted powdery. Overall the burrito was big and lots of flavor.  A little dry though.  Will definitely come back to try a different kind.
