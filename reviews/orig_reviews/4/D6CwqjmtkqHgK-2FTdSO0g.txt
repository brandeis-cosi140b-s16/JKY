Brunch was excellent.  Service was attentive.  Make your own Bloody Mary and mimosa bar is a must!  Brunch was served with a choice of warm muffin and fresh fruit before entree was brought out.  Had the apple muffin, warm and moist, carrots, walnuts, raisins and coconut in the muffin was yummy.  Entree was pablano pepper stuffed with jalape√±o bacon and scrambled eggs.  Everything was absolutely delicious.
