The main reason I come to Blanco is for their margaritas - mainly the Peach Hibiscus Margarita as it is divine! I could drink these all night and promised my husband we will come for happy hour and do just that. Seriously, best margaritas. (I've tried their pomegranate one as well, which is really good but the peach... oh, the peach.) 

Happy Hour is 4-6pm and half off all margaritas, well cocktails, beers, and some appetizers. We've had their guacamole and we really like their three cheese quesadilla with chicken.

As for dinner, I love their beef 'house specialty' enchiladas - braised short ribs in a red sauce. Super delicious and one of my favorite meals. Makes really good leftovers for lunch the next day as well! My husband likes their burritos and normally gets the machaca. When ordering a dish, you have the option of black beans or pinto beans. I always get the black beans, but I'll have to try the pinto at some point. Additionally, the rice is super buttery and delicious. 
 
I would highly recommend this place for a date, a get together with friends, or if the family is in town. There is always ample parking out front (or valet services), the inside is decorated nicely and the patio is wonderful. I've already promised my aunt a margarita when she visits, but I'll definitely be back before then!
