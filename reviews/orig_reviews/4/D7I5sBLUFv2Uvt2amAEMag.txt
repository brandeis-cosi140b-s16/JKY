This is definitely a weekend full of new favorite places for me.
Revo Burrito definitely topped my expectations. I saw it when we were leaving Delux the day before.
The interior is amazing...loved the decor-from the eco friendly bathrooms to the sinks. 
I ordered the chicken fajita bowl, with brown rice-It's safe to say this is my favorite restaurant brown rice to date-it's flavored with lime and cilantro. Perfect!!
Loved the presentation, and I had the sugar free lemonade.
Service was polite and quick, and we had a nice night sitting outdoors at the several tables they have.
It's open late, which  is great-we have such a hard time finding decent late night dining.
We'll be back!
