I live near by.

I love me some burritos.  

I love me some carnitas. 

I love me some carnitas burritos. 

I have a healthy fear of carnitas, but not from here.  

Lil' dirty, (not like nasty, but obviously not OCC about shit here), little hokey inside ('cept the bathroom door - art nouveau shit is tiiiiight) - putting my Bob Ross hat on for a min... I'd say a wee bit o' nepotism is prevalent; e.g. someone's neurotic auntie got the nod to hang their interpretation of modern 'Mehican'.  Regardless, I'll be god damned if I'm not here at least once a week.  

Open at the butt crack o' dawn (6:30am)  slinging chorizo and egg 'ritos, delivering scrumtacular nacho-quesadi-lladas at night  (like 5:30pm - 9:00pm...ish).  Set the bong down, and give em' a call.  
 
Repeat after me:  'I'd like the carnitas burrito'
