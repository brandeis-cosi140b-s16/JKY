Well it's cinco de mayo so naturally it's mexican food for dinner.  Found this place on yelp and gave it a shot since it had 4 stars and everyone bragged about the tacos. 

The place feels like a real Mexican restaurant.  It had the colors and decor of Mexico.  Even had mexican music playing.   There is a salsa bar with 4 different salsas.  Don't expect chips because to go with the salsa because it's not that type of place.  

I had the number 41, 2 fish taco meal.    The tacos were good, They were 4 star good.  It came with rice and beans which were also authentic.  

My wife had the spinach chicken enchiladas.  They were smothered in a cheesy sauce.  My wife ate one and she liked it.  I had one and didn't care for the chicken, they were 2 stars for me.  I had a large piece of tendon or something.  Plus the chicken seemed dry to me, maybe that's why is smothered in cheese. 

I would try this place for the tacos.  I will try it one more time for the shrimp tacos.   The staff there was 5 stars.  They were helpful, courteous and friendly.
