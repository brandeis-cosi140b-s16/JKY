I was searching for a bottomless brunch spot, and Border Grill more than filled that void.

The good:
- For $35, you can try anything from huevos rancheros to steak and eggs to breakfast fries (similar to poutine but better!).
- For an additional $10 - I repeat $10 - you can also get bottomless mimosas.  You seriously can't beat this deal, as one mimosa can typically run you anywhere from $5-8 each.  There are various seasonal juices (at least 9) and all were fresh.
- Service was great, and our waitress even let us order about 30 minutes after brunch ended.  Score.
- Atmosphere was lax and inviting.  The outdoor patio also overlooks the pool area and lazy river.

Definitely recommend.  Cannot wait to go back (hopefully each time I'm in Vegas!).
