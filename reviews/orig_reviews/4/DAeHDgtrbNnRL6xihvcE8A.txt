Atmosphere, Service and Food!

This place hits the marks on all three, from the moment that you enter the place you feel instantly relaxed, like your in an old mexican cantina, the service is top-notch! very team oriented, from the second that you take your seat a server is getting your drinks while another  is bringing you chips with two types of dips which are both awesome btw followed by yet another person with tomato soup! really well orientated. The food is delicious, I've had the fish tacos and camarones adelita there both great! bursting with flavor served in oversized portions, come hungry and be prepared to roll out of this place. My only gripe is the prices which can be a little on the high side, the camarones adelita is almost in the $20 range.

All in all, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.
