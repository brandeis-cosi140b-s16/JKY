Was very leery of a fish-taco place... but I am sold!!! I am trying to talk my other half into giving it a go...and I am betting he will be converted too!
Went with a friend who knows all the out of the way, non-chain places to eat. Had the corn salsa-yum! Liked the beer-batter fish. Very crowded, not big on the "ambience"...but it was soooo good!
