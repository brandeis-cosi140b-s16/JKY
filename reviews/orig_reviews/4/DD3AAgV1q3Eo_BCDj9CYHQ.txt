So there's one thing on the menu here that I'm a huge fan of. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have rated Cafe Rio a 4. 

Go to Cafe Rio on a Tuesday. Order their Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Eat the Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Leave Happy. 

These tacos are seriously heaven on earth. You can order 1 or 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans. A fountain drink comes with the tacos since it's the daily special. Each taco is stuffed with 2 or 3 pieces of coconut breaded shrimp, lettuce, some cilantro and comes with a side of warm mango chunky salsa. It's really unfortunate that these tacos are only available on Tuesdays. Or else I'd be there every single day as their star customer! 

Their rice and beans are alright, nothing to gush over. Personally, I think the rice and beans at Chipotle are better. They have homemade tortillas here. Those are alright, too. If you get their burrito, spend a dollar more to get it "enchilada style". They douse their hot sauce over the burrito and sprinkle cheese on top. 

Cafe Rio recently started to put their specialty drinks out by the fountain drinks. Their strawberry lemonade, mint limeade and horchata are all available to refill for free! I personally like to mix the strawberry lemonade and the mint limeade together. It's really refreshing - a must-have for the Vegas summers. 

Don't forget to get a stamp card! Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!
