Most Mexican food snobs or "foodies" would spew guacamole out of their nostrils at the mere mention of ground beef tacos BUT at Restaurant Mexico since the '70's this is what I order like 4 out of 5 times (80% . You didn't know there'd be math on this quiz, did you? Well DIDJA?!).

     The Taco Duros with the picadillo aforementioned ground beef with teeny-tiny bits a taters, topped with lettuce, sauce and queso blanco in the fried tortilla is the best ground-beef taco going.  And the only gb taco I eat.

     The mole also is well above-average, as are the bean & guacamole enchiladas. Never had a sub-standard enchilada here; always tasty.  Decent chimichangas, and a good change from the usual is getting the chimi topped with the radioactive-colored red sauce.  Not spicy, just visually roja-radioactivio.  Harquahala.  IF ya know what I mean.

     The Salsa - not as red red as most, not very spicy, but tasty and worthwhile.

     On Mill in the midst of a busy buncha stuff, good neighborhood atmo.

     Later.
