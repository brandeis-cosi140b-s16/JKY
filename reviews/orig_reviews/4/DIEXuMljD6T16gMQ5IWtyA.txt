SO after working all day... then going to school.. first english...and then a TWO HOUR MATH class... i start craving some horchata like no other!! the entire drive home all i could think of was that luscious creamy rice milk.... mmmmm..... 

i get home and its 930pm already.... we don't go out much... so we kinda drove around until we found a Mexican food restaurant that was open and pulled in... there were still a few people inside so were thought SCORE!!!! we walk in and the guy at the cashier was super nice... he seated us... 

i of course ran to the ladies room... mmmm i give it a 3..... its didn't smell to pleasant.... and yes i do expect a bathroom to smell good... you don't wanna your customers to loose their appetites right?? 

by the time i got back we already had our drinks and some chips and salsa i love so much! right away i order some horchata!!! but they freeze theirs.... i never had it like that before... but it was good : ) 

I Got a beef Tostada... oh it was shredded beef.. and they were very generous : ) and my roommate got a Quesadilla it was the size of a med pizza!! it looked sooo yummy!!.... 

the service was supper speedy but our waiter seemed a little irritated... and then the bar turned off its lights... lol we were those annoying people that come in 5 minutes before closing!!!! i felt soooo bad!!! especially after hearing tid bits of what the other employees were saying to our waiter before they left.... (they were speaking Spanish... i know very little) 

we tried to eat as quick as possible... the cashier guy came over and finished being our Waiter... he was so nice... they closed at 10pm we were done and out by 10:08..... i don't think I've ever only spent 18 minutes in a sit down Restaurant before! lol 

ahhhh the things we do for our horchata cravings....
