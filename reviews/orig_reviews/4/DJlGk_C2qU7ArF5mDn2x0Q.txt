This place was pretty good.  Cool atmosphere and good food.  The chips were fresh and the queso was addicting.  The fish taco was ok but the short rib taco was wonderful.  I came here for a girls night with a bunch of friends and it was hard to hear the other end of the table.  That isn't really a complaint, just an observation.  Some of the girls split a margarita pitcher and they said it was strong but also very good.  I stuck with beer, can't go wrong there.  Anyway, its a fun place!
