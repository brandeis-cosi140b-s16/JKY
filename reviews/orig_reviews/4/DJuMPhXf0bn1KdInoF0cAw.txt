This is certainly one of the best "neighborhood" bars in Gilbert. Their tequila selection is second to none, have a nice selection of draft beers and make a killer margarita from fresh ingredients. Recently, the quality of the music on Friday night has increased dramatically with the likes of Ian Eric and Holly Kirsten. In addition, La Ristra have hired several new people for their wait-staff - I am particularly impressed with Alissa. Having someone who remembers you from week to week goes a long way towards making a neighborhood bar really feel like part of the neighborhood.

In addition to the bar scene, they also have a very nice dinner room - however, their great selection of New Mexican Cuisine is also available in the bar area. 

La Ristra remains our go-to place for Friday night.
