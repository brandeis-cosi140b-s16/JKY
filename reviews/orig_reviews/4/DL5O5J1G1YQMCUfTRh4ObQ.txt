Gobblerito- thanksgiving dinner in a burrito. Amaze balls. The pick-a-dippa was a great appetizer with some mildly spicy salsa and cheese. Unique concoctions in addition to traditional Mexican cuisine. 

So why did I dock it 1 star? 
Service. 
We had to hunt our server down 3 different times for refills. A fourth time for our check and to-go containers.
The cooks also messed up a couple orders but the server graciously compensated us for the inconveniences. We'll definitely be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!
