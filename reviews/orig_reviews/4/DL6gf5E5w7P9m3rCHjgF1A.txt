Molcajete WHOA. This place is really fun and delicious! It does get pretty loud when the mariachi band comes in on Friday nights, so beware. The d√©cor is bright and vibrant, and I'd say the usual vibe of the restaurant matches how it looks. This restaurant is so good that it draws a diverse crowd. 

I've been here a few times and can never get away from the molcajete. I've tried both the red and the green and I think I prefer the red, although both are absolutely delicious. It's definitely enough to share unless your dining companion is a troll. The molcajete is served with chicken, beef (carne asada), and fish. There is usually some seafood swimming around in the molcajete "stew" as well. It comes with tortillas on the side and you can make delicious fish/chicken/beef/molcajete tacos! 

The area of town is a bit sketchy. I've been approached by homeless people for cash when I'm leaving the restaurant. I'm not put off by that but I know some people aren't into that.
