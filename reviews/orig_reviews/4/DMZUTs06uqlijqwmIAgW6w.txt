I havent been here in a while but I'm glad I came back. This little corner has a handful of great restaurant/bars to choose from and some even share parking lots. It was a Saturday and I got semi rockstar parking and they werent needing to do valet since its not peak season(according to one of the hosts). As you walk in you wil see the U-shaped bar with plenty of seats and then tables both indoors and on a decent sized patio. We were a group of ten and Austin was our main server. He was always paying attention as each person showed up and made sure no ones drink glasses were empty. Same with checking on orders making sure it came out and the way you wanted. We had a veggie burrito that was supposed to be no mushrooms he realized kitchen didnt do it right. Got a replacement on the fly boxed up the old one and even took it off the bill!. 

A handful of people had the corn to start I just my serrano margarita which I would get again and again and again. Some reason last night I mixed it up and switched to beer once I got my tacos. The whole table loved the carne asada whether it was in a taco or burrito. I was expecting flavor from the adobada and the braised beef. Ive had other tacos there that I liked more but carne asada everytime for sure. Since I've had the ceviche before Il comment on that. It was good size nice flavor great mix no one else at the table seemed real excited about having it so I didnt order it last night but I'll get it again. 

Good prices Great service (split checks for ten people never fun) nice clean fun vibe.
