Chingon Mexican Food Here. 

The style of service is similar to that of the cafe inside the Ranch Market. Large menu, with lots of the usual Mexican restaurant fare. A long line of steam tables, keeping that food hot and ready to go. 

Food was delicious. I had the Carnitas Gorditas. It was a bountiful offering of slow cooked pork, on a fried masa cake cut in half. Served with shredded cabbage, Queso Fresco, and a big ass dollop of sour cream. 
I ordered two thinking I was a bad ass. Not so. This was a gut busting meal. I washed it all down with a Jugo de Melon, which is cantaloupe juice. 
The bakery offerings looked delicious and inviting. 
Nice, clean place to get some good Mexican Grub.
