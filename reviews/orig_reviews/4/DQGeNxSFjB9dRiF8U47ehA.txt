Let me start by saying I am a picky eater. It takes a lot to find something I am willing to eat.

We ended up here for a girls night out dinner. OMG, my food was awesome!!!!! The table side guac is to die for. I practically ate the whole thing and said forget about dinner. I had the pork tamale and it was yummy. It comes with a bit of mole sauce on top of it. Loved the rice! I would totally eat here again. Others at the table said they enjoyed their meals as well. 

The service was so-so. We never got a few things we asked for like straws, hot sauce, etc. There are a lot of different people waiting on you so it's not just your server. That made things a bit difficult when were trying to track down our server for the check. 

Price wise, it is not the cheapest thing on the strip nor is it the most expensive. My meal plus the guac was probably about $30ish. 

They do have menus outside the restaurant so you can view your options along with the pricing. I highly recommend checking it out.

***I'm a little confused about the reviewer who said this was in the airport. There is a Mexican restaurant in the airport but this is not it. It's in the MGM Grand between the casino and the pool, in their shopping corridor.
