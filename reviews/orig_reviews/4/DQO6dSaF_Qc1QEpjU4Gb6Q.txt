I've never had a bad meal here. I love Mexican food, but I'm such a picky eater it's kind of difficult to choose something. The servers here are bilingual and some of them struggle a little with English, but they're always polite if they don't understand. They always manage to get my food right, also. The wait on all aspects of service are a little long, no matter if it's busy or slow.
