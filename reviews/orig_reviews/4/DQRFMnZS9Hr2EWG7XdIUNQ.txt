FUCK! the line is hella long... imagine standing in line for 20 mins or more IN VEGAS in the heat at a place that doesn't have AC and jacked up fans... 

Hey, the line is SO WORTH IT!! Oh. My. Gawd....!!! I am a fan. It's so good I'd wait inline again.

I felt like I was in Mexico... VERY authentic.

I got the chicken and beef tacos. I ordered 10- 5 for me and 5 for my sister. We were starved! My nephew had AAU Basketball tournaments all day.

Once you get in:KNOW what you want. There are line for each option. 

Next time I am going to try their Carne Asada fries. mmm! 

minus a star for the long ass lines and hot ass spot!
