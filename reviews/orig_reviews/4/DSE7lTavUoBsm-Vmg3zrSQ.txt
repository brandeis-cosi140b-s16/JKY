We visited La Comida on a Sunday afternoon. The weather was perfect for this open and airy establishment in a really cool spot that adds even more character to the Fremont area. Its around the corner from Commonwealth and across the street from B3.  Our waiter, Chris was awesome and attentive. He knew the menu well and was able to make appropriate recommendations. The Manager, Suda was also great. She recognized us as the Curly Girls from another downtown establishment and came over an gave us a hug and everything. So sweet when people take the time to engage with you! They even sent us some yummy guacamole. The food was tasty and flavorful. I had a shrimp quesadilla and a prickly pear margarita. We'll be back.
