A friend and I came in after she had boot camp, to undo the progress she just made. She had chicken fajitas, I had a beef enchilada, pretty standard fare. I definitely like the location, and it's very big. There isn't a whole lot of parking, but it is close to the light rail. They also have a big outdoor patio which seems great for happy hours or birthday parties or anything where you have a big group. I didn't notice if they have misters, but there is a bar outside and I believe they have games outside, too. The service we had was good. Our food came out fast, our order was correct, and it was pleasant, except for the person at the next table celebrating her 28th birthday with a loud song from the staff. Never understood that bizarre ritual myself, but it seemed like she was enjoying herself, too, so good on Macayo's!
