I went here for the first time the other day. I had heard mixed reviews from my co-workers and I just had to try it out for myself. I was greeted by a very nice lady who gave me options of where to sit. I was the only one there, so it was nice and quiet. The decor was pretty, especially when they turned on the chandeliers. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly my food came out. My only issue was that I had to flag down someone to refill my water after 30 minutes. Service could had been better, but everyone was very friendly, prices are reasonable, and the food was good. I will definitely try this place again.
