A lot of goods things about this place. Decor is decent. Chips were very good though i wasnt crazy about the warm salsa. Ok beer list on tap. The red skin potatoes were excellent and the flat steak i had folded over grilled veggies was also excellent. Rare meal where the sauce (a spicey tomato?) took away from the meal so i didnt use it. Service was friendly but a little hit and miss in terms of waiting.
