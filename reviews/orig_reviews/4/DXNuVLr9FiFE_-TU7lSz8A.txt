After our Farm Session and Old Town Farmer's Market tour, we walked around Old Town for a bit.  By now my daughter was hungry and everyone else in our party said, they could have a "snack".  We had coupons that Kevin N. had picked up so we were good to give David's a shot.  I was kinda torn between nachos and a Texas Burger.  I waffled but when it came time to order I went with the burger.  My daughter had a hot dog.  The Texas Burger is like the Carl's Jr. Western Bacon Cheese Burger which is one of my favorite fast food burgers.  Except this was a real pattie that looked like it had been shaped by human hands.....not shaped by a round or square cookie cutter.  And it tasted like a real burger should.  The bacon was crispy, cheese was melty, and the onion rings were crisp.  This was a good burger in my book.  The fries were crispy on the outside...just the way I like them and fluffly on the inside.  My daughter gave the thumbs up to her hot dog and devoured the whole thing.  My companions enjoyed their food as well.  The one drawback I would say is that the service was slow.  We waited for our drink order to be taken and the waited for our drinks.  Our drinks were not refilled very quickly.  It was not super busy when we were there so maybe they were short staffed, I don't know.  Will I go back...yes, because the value was there.  It was a good burger for the price, with or without the coupon.
