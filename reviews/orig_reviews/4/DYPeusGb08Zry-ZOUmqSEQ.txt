Most creative taco place! The first time I went I ordered the BBQ mahi tacos and they were AMAZING! Super flavorful, fresh tortilla was perfectly crispy and they had a good texture from the slaw. Definitely a hipster vibe/setting, portion size was good for the price. I've been back a few times since and I've tried the tempura salmon tacos (daily special) and the crab dip. The crab dip is probably the best thing on the menu, next time I might order that as my meal! Only downside...I wish the chips were a little hotter and I wasn't a huge fan of their corn salsa it was more of a pico but overall great place!
