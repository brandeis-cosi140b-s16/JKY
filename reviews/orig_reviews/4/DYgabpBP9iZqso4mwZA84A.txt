My review is of Tex Tubb's catering service/food (which is very much a slimmed-down version of the in-restaurant menu):

Tacos! For a wedding! YES!

This may be the most talked-about part of our reception. A taco buffet was a unique choice, but it was one that everyone loved. Crystal, the catering manager, worked with us to create a slightly custom menu from their usual catering options and then they ended up bringing even more food than we expected. While this was great, it did feel a little wasteful. Since Tex Tubb's does a "drop off" catering service with disposable chafing dishes, etc. we were left with a lot of food and taco shells at the end of the night. Thankfully the staff at the venue were happy to take the extras (along with extra wedding cake!) to nibble on before going home and to have a football party the next day!

At first I though the pricing was high for being tacos, but they had so many sides and options (great for meat eaters, veggies, vegans, etc) and TONS of chips & salsa that, considering the catering market in Madison, I feel we got a decent value. They definitely made for a fun wedding meal!
