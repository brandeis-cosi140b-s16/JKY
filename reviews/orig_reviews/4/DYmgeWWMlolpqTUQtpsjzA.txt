Lindo Michoacan is a true authentic. Mexican restaurant. They make home made tortillas and guacamole. 

They do not play with their margaritas. I had a mango margarita which I could not finish due to the amount of alcohol. I'm not a drinker so it hit be before my meal came out.
I'm definitely not complaining, but be ready for it! 

My husband had the traditional grilled chicken enchiladas and I ordered a chicken dinner off the specialty menu, which was amazing. 

I give this place 2
