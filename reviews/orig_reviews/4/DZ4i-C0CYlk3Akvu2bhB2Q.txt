I really like the choices of salsa. They give you some interesting flavours and textures by using pecans and jicama. As weird as it sounds, it's worth trying it out to discover new things and it might surprise you like it did me. 
When I came here, I was a little disappointed because they didn't have any shrimps so I couldn't get one of the tacos I wanted. I ended up getting  the Baja Sur Shark Taco and another taco. Both were very good, but I did prefer the Shark Taco. I also had their horchata which was just okay...it had too much cinnamon for me, but I like the addition of fruits and nuts with it. 
This place gets crowded especially during lunch time and it's a small place. They've got interesting paintings on the walls.
