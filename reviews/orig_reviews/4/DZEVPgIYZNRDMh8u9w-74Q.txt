Great place for a quick lunch or afternoon cocktail and apps.  Food is outstanding, drinks were also quite nice.  HH til 5pm every day, means $5 cocktails, pitchers of beer and glasses of wine.  Local/seasonal beers featured on draft.  Interesting 'aquas frescas' cocktails can be ordered virgin, as well.  Love the building/setup.  Great patio to while away the weekend afternoon.  Glad it moved in, I'll be here frequently.
