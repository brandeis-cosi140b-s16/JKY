My first time in the American Southwest.  The tacos here are very different from East Coast tacos.  Tacos Atoyac is small and definitely a hole in the wall but the tacos are excellent!  We shared the fish, shrimp, carne asada, and chorizo tacos.  All are reasonably priced and simple but cooked to perfection.  

Another nice touch, and maybe due to the proximity to Mexico but the sodas are all real sugar.  The service and staff are very nice and down to Earth.  If I have time I'll be stopping by before I leave AZ.
