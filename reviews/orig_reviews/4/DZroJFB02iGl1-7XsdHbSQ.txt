Happy to report I love Los Sombreros! I cannot wait to go back again .
We had a great dinner sitting under the heaters outside on the patio, which was very quaint. Our drinks arrived quickly as well as our Guacamole and chips.  And by the way why are they first place I have seen that has thought of a tequila / coconut margarita type drink. Love it!

We had chicken with mole  , which was a great portion size and the black beans were a perfect side accompaniment   Like I  said can't wait to go back !
