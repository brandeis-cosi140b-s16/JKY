I was not expecting much from Salty Senorita but I was impressed when we got there.  I felt like we parked really far away and came upon  the lot of a "Mexico" film set.  It was more busy than usual because of the Cinco de Mayo drinking starting up.  Our drinks were good.  -- well every one was drinking beer but me so how can you mess up  a bottle of beer?  

The food was surprisingly good for being such a party atmosphere.  The chips are good chips-- like the real kinda greasy kind.  Not overly greasy, just a nice amount and they were salted with kosher salt--- fabulous!

I had the pork street tacos and they were delicious.  It came with 3 of them and a side of mexican rice that was more like dirty rice-- still good.  and a side of pinto beans with a light sprinkling of cheese.  

Good food, good atmosphere, good service.  I wasn't expecting so much from Salty Senorita- shame on me!
