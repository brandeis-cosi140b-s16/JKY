So, a meal at the Macayo's in north Scottsdale, for whatever reason, always was a one-way ticket to Diarrheaville in my experience. Maybe the employees were angry and washing their dirty hands in the salsa buckets. Don't know, don't care.

The Macayo's on Central (of ugly Mayan-themed building and President-dining fame) is different. This is the Denny's of Mexican food - always good, always middle America, lots of screaming kids, lame attempts at kitsch. I find that takeout is a much safer way to indulge in the artery-hardening goodness Macayo's has to offer.

There are many, many much enjoyed references to dear God, as well as the Mother Mary and her revered child on Yelp. Well, if the sweet baby Jesus was ever to ejaculate, it might taste like Macayo's Baja sauce, and I mean that in the most flattering manner, i.e., SBJ might also spout forth with Cinnabon frosting. Baja sauce is this cream-cheese based, vaguely sweet, vaguely spicy green chili-tinted fatty goopy sauce that can be ladled on virtually any plain Jane item... thus turning water into wine, or some business like that. The green corn tamale slathered in Baja sauce is a most guilty pleasure that always leaves me feeling fulfilled, but slightly unsettled and a tick guilty mixed with a dash of naughty. It's the one-night stand of condiments, no doubt.

So on nights like these, where my weekend's diet has already been ravaged by Harlow's, Delux, and the pseudo-red velvet cupcakes I made at home (chocolate cake mix + red food coloring), I just gotta say WTF -- Macayo's takeout it is.
