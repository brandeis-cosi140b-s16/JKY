Atmosphere:
If you order out the first time you try TeePee, the experience is probably wasted.  Dive or no, the atmosphere at TeePee is part of the experience.  It's sort of Mod meets taco stand meets dive bar-- and I can't explain why that's a good combo but, imho, it is.  It's also dimly lit and the bar area is full of little Christmas lights that make for a great casual date.  However, that being said, I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities  

The food:
Albeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard, this place is just ultimately satisfying.  Order the beef burro.  It's a must.  I don't think you can love this place as well if you don't.  The chile is perfect- I like the red and the green equally well, just depending on mood.  I'd second the opinions about the rice- it's really inexplicably good.  The chips, yeah, probably greasy but GOOD.  It's all greasy and good.  Don't eat here regularly- it will kill you.  Eat here when you need delicious, satisfying, comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis.  

Service- I've always loved it but had one slow experience.  It's a hit and miss but I usually go during less-busy hours to avoid the crowds that can sometimes congregate.  

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's not really authentic Mexican, if that's what you're looking for and the dive vibe may turn some people off.  I personally love it.
