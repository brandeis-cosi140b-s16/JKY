Grabbed dinner there as I was passing through the Phoenix Airport.  The cafe is good, services very good and surpassed my expectations.  Food was good, definitely would go back again if I have the time as I make my connections.

Price was good, and as I have traveled many airports, it was reasonable, good portions.  I'll make there again.
