Good food and good service. Hard to find a decent restaurant in North las Vegas. This is my go to spot for Mexican food up here. Prices are fair and definitely cheaper than the chain restaurants. They have an assortment of combo meals if you have a hard time deciding.  The guacamole is made fresh right in front of you and the salsa and beans are served with a smile.
