I'm not really big on Burritos, so I usually would just come here to drink.  Awesome beer list and marg's.  Last night, I was craving a good salad, but couldn't think of where to go.  My boyfriend suggested stopping here because he wanted a good beer.  I got the chicken chopped salad and was blown away!  I think it mainly had to do with the lime-cilantro dressing.  It was pretty much like cilantro pesto and totally made the dish.  It had a little kick to it, which I liked too.  We also ordered a guac and salsa side.  Both were awesome and very fresh.  I'll be back not only for the drinks but now for the salads, too!
