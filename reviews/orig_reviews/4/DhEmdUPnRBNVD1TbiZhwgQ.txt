This place is D Licious. I haven't had a bad meal yet. It reminds me of two pesos that used to be in old town in the early 90's. Their tortillas are extraordinary and their beans taste like bacon. For a fast Mexican restaurant place I would say this is the best one. Did that make any sense? Either way try Carolinas , you won't regret it.
