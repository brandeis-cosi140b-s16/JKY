This is a Mexican restaurant located in The Summit with a few other restaurants and establishments.  Food is good and enjoyable.  Happy Hour or a regular menu are available.  Not a true Mexican restaurant but nevertheless tasty.  Wait staff keeps tabs on their customers so you won't have to flag them down.
