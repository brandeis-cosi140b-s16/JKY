I love street tacos. I especially love street tacos that can be ordered from outside of a little window, be it a truck or a window stand. Don't worry there is counter service inside the place too. I'm not sure if there is any indoor sitting, we sat outside. It's Vegas! 
We were excited to see they had Carne Al Pastor cooking. Real Al Pastor turning on the spit, and a nice little pineapple dangling above it. Mmm Mmm. I had 2 tacos Al Pastor and 1 Carne Asada, with the spicy green salsa. They have about 5 different fresh salsas to choose from. 
The Al Pastor was good, the meat had a great traditional flavor, yes I wanted more. The Carne Asada had a little different flavor maybe cumin or cloves, but it didn't taste so great so. Stick to the Al pastor. 
3 tacos 1 beer under 10 bucks.  Yes I'm going back.
