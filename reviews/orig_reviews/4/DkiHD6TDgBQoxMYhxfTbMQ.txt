It was my first time to Container Park and I came specifically to try out some of the food I had heard about. Pinches Tacos did not disappoint.

The line was pretty long, but considering the length of it, they kept it moving really fast. The staff is all very friendly and they have a really good variety on the menu. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be brought out to us, and they'll even bring it upstairs, which is nice. 

I ordered the chicken tacos which come with onions, cilantro, and salsa. They were really, really good. It tasted very fresh and flavorful. The rice and beans were also good. My friend ordered fish tacos and those also looked really good.

My only major gripe is that the drinks are pretty expensive, bottled or fountain. The fountain drinks only come in one size and it's pretty small. It's somewhere around the size of a solo cup, maybe slightly bigger.

Otherwise it's a great place. Definitely check it out!
