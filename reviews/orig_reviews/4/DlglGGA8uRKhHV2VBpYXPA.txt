Tried it for the first time last Thursday which was coincidentally $5.49 for anything on the menu day, score! The language barrier while ordering does exist but not too bad. I got the chicken curry California burrito which was pretty good, a little bland but still miles above Chipotle-it amazes me how many people like that place..

Salsa bar was a nice touch but for me the only one that had any flavour was the factory hot. Habanero I believe. Even for a seaoned chili head I will give warning- take it slow. Ordered a bit too much on my burrito which I was warned of, caution to the wind I said!! Still great taste even if my eyes were watering :)

The food could use a bit more flavour but at it's price point I'm not complaining. BTW, the manager or owner-not sure is very friendly and helpful. I will be back for sure.
