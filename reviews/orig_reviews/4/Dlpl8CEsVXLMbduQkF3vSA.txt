I had the pleasure of eating at Gallo Blanco for dinner and, let me tell you, the tacos are DEE-LISH-OUS! I had one each of the Pork, Carne Asada and Fish and they were each fantastic in their own way. My only problem was suppressing the urge to order about 3 more EACH of them....they go down pretty easy! Luckily, we had the foresight to have the guacamole as an appetizer. Very delicious and very fresh with big chunks of avocado and slices or orange (gave it a tangy zip). Don't forget to ask for their salsa. They don't automatically bring it to the table, but it's fresh and amazing! 

The food was wonderful....so wonderful, in fact, that we decided to visit again for brunch. The huevos was great and for $6, you can't beat the value. 

Overall, Gallo Blanco will have a solid place in my brunch and casual dining rotation....very fresh, very tasty, and great value for your money.
