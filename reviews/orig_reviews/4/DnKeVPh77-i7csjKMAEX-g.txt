Very busy place. Our first time there (found reviews online). Long wait (temp 109 D) but chairs available. It was Fathers Day. Service was great and food was above average. I had an "organic" margarita that was very good. Service was pretty phenomenal considering the masses of people trying to get in.  I have no idea if they take reservations. Did not check. But...will certainly go back.
