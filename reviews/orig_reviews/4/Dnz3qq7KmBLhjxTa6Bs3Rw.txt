I'm going to say, YES to this place.  My husband suggested it before, but since we don't live close to it, we figure that if we are close to the area we must try it... and happy, really happy we are... the food was good, and plenty of it... I will say that if you are on a diet, you must share...  cause is alot.  didn't have any alcohol drinks because I'm on Weight Watchers and didn't research points for drinks.  Service was good, not amazing, but quick... I will say, you mush visit...either be with friends, love ones...or on your first date...
