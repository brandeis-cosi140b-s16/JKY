we honestly stopped in because postino was super packed.. so it was kind of a back up plan.  but definitely happy we stopped by.

joyride is super cute.  the decor is fun & the atmosphere is upbeat.  i had to try a mazatlan mule, which ended up being delicious.   we snacked on the chips and salsa & cheese y mas.  the cheese dip was ok.  but the street corn was amazing.

i'll definitely come back to try some of the entrees & more booze. :)
