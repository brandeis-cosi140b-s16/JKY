I LOVE MANUELS! The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is the salsa. Everything else in this place is super authentic and delicious but the salsa tastes as if it comes from a can. (that definitely does not stop me from finishing the whole bowl though!) 
Crystal is one of the best waitresses I have ever had the pleasure of being served by. She is so polite and attentive and she remembers my boyfriend and I everytime we go in (yes we are regulars). When she serves us, we dont even need to say a word and she knows exactly what we want! The beef tacos are delicous, super greasy just the way I like them. The rice and beans are great as well. My boyfriend always gets the pollo especial and he can never seem to finish it because of the richness of all the cheese! (Im not complaining though because I love it!) 
The margaritas are strong and tasty (I love the strawberry marg frozen with sugar). Dos Equis beers are on special every day which is also nice. 
Super authentic environment, family oriented, and just a great place to relax and sip on margaritas!
