The drinks and food are fantastic! I got the La Esposa Margarita (actually about 3 of them..I love margaritas with hibiscus in them) and the  Tacos De Pescado (Mahi Mahi tacos). The only problem is the seating, as other people have said. Although we didn't have to wait too long and the staff cleaned it off very quickly for us.
One thing is for sure...Mad Mex will never compare.
