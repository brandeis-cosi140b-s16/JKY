If you're in the Arcadia area and looking for a casual place to have some good Mexican-inspired food, this is the spot. I've been for happy hour and enjoyed some of their apps, the PB & J being my favorite... pork belly sandwich? Yes, please!   Great guacamole with just the right amount of spice and chunkiness without being overly done. I sort of judge a Mexican spot by its chips, salsa and margaritas.  Milagro scored pretty high on all 3 counts.  Dang, now I want a margarita...  I digress.
I recently went here for dinner and had tacos (they let you mix n match!)  The Al Pastor and Mahi were very good, but I think the green chile pork was my favorite taco.  That could change in the future, but right now I'm having a moment with green chile.  Couple of the guys at the table got the Filet & crab and devoured it.  The non-spicy mac n cheese got good reviews from others with our party as well.  
I think Milagro is a solid spot.  They aren't usually very busy. Both times I've visited were with big groups (10-12) and we were seated promptly.  Service was good on both visits and the prices are fair.  And a note for those who like to know these things, the bathrooms are unisex.
