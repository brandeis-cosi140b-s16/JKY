Have eaten at the original location at least a dozen times, but never tried the shrimp fusion taco - until today. The shrimp quality is amazing, almost lobster-like & not 'watery' like cocktail shrimp. 

My favorite house salsa is the bright red one with green onions in it. Perfect medium-hot heat. I put at least 1 ounce of it on each taco.

Reasonably-priced, and incredibly nice service. Not exactly a great date spot or a place to impress your in-laws - just creative, quality food served up with love. Nothing wrong with that!
