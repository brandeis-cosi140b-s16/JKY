I ate here yesterday for lunch with a dining companion.  The decor of the restaurant was unique with many different wall paintings and oddities but probably familiar to those who have ever been to a Mad Mex restaurant before.  Upon sitting down I noticed that they had a nice beer list but did not order any due to it being lunch on a Sunday afternoon.

For lunch I ordered the Wing-A-Rito burrito with insane buffalo sauce while my dining companion had the Thai Curry burrito.  My burrito was comprised of rice, cheese, beans, chicken and the buffalo sauce which did not disappoint.  It was hotter than most sauces that I have ordered yet still had a good solid taste to it.  It was served with a side of salsa which was all that was left on my plate whenever I had finished.  My dining companions burrito also tasted good and did remind me of a nice Thai curry dish.  It was topped with bean sprouts and came with a side of slaw that was vinegar based.  Overall we were both very satisfied with our meals and nothing was left except for the salsa whenever we were done.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back to a Mad Mex in the future.  They have not only a wonderful selection of Margaritas and beer but the food is good and does not lighten the wallet too much.
