I think Chevy's is undergoing a revamp. New menu's, new menu items, etc. Thankfully they didn't touch their chips and salsa which I am such a fan of.
The food was much better than the last time I was there. And the prices haven't changed much. I got my usual 2 item combo with a Crispy Chicken Taco and Chicken Flautas. Doug got the Steak Fajitas. Both of our entrees were delicious. Our cute waitress was friendly and helpful. The manager was sure to greet us as well and ensure we were having a good experience.
I belong to their birthday club, so I had a coupon for a free entree. After our meal they surprised me with a song, yummy dessert sundae, and an awesome sombrero. I could feel myself blush but it was great, I haven't had a birthday song in a restaurant for years.
