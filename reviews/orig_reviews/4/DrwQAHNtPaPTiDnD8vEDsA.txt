The food was way better than I expected. I've eaten here once before a long time ago but didn't remember it being as good as it was. We sat at the bar for a couple of drinks. The micheladas here are DELICIOUS!!  I'm not sure what they do differently, but they're so good. And at full price, they're only $5, but we were here during happy hour so they were $2.50 a piece. That's a win!

We wanted to get a table but the hostess told us there was a 15 min wait, and after 20 minutes we decided to just get food at the bar. It was weird because it wasn't even busy. Our bartender was awesome though, so it all worked out. He gave us chips and salsa to start, but the chips were a bit stale. I got the "pick 3" combo of a carne asada taco, carnitas taco, and machaca beef enchilada. Everything was so delicious.  The machaca beef is like barbacoa and it was my favorite.

If you want to just hang out at the bar and have a decent meal and great drinks for super cheap, this is a great place.
