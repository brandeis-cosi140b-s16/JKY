Food is simple, but reasonably priced and solid. Wahoo bowl is my personal favorite, though large portions of hot sauce are recommended. Service is always friendly, and the bar is generally well attended with much better service than you would expect from an out of state chain. Definately a good happy hour option if you work/live in the area.
