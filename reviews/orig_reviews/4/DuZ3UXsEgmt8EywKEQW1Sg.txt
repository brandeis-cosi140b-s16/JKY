"Eat when you're hungry and eat 'til you're happy"...one of the rules I live by:)

One of the simpler rules, really...so much less difficult to deal with than other rules:

* "Neither a borrower, nor a lender be" - sure, great advice when the economy is in the crapper, but you might want to think about levering up in boom times:)

* "Do not covet thy neighbor's wife" - Hey, if I hadn't done a little coveting, the Beautiful Carin would not be my blushing bride today:)

* 9.80665 m/s2 = 1G - It's not just a good idea, it's the law (probably...in this universe:)

And so it came to pass that I was, in fact, hungry after my run and before I hit the driving range yesterday...one of my buddies called and suggested La Tolteca.

I said "Who?"...The Toltec?

But Wes seems to know his Mexican food and I seem to enjoy decent Mexican food, so off I went...to a really interesting part of town:)

I guess I don't get out much...hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am?...People urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot?...The unmistakable (and appetite enhancing) aroma of ganga being smoked nearby?

I don't see much of that from my deck in Old Town:)

I also don't get tamales that are this good in Old Town, either...m'mmm, m'mmm good...with a great big side of atmosphere:)

I chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3...two plump, succulent and spicy beef tamales, covered with red sauce...I added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my Styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area (the murals really are nice...an artistic depiction of life on Van Buren, near La Tolteca...bright and colorful:)

BTW, La Tolteca is a market and bakery, too!

If you happened to want...oh, say a beer or 4 at lunch, you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of Bud for about what you'd pay for one beer at Loco Patron...and after lunch, you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents (about 3% of what you'd pay for a crapcake at Sprinkles:)

Wes and I chatted and ate...the tamales were excellent...the company was excellent...I was charmed, by both La Tolteca itself (a sweet little outpost) and by the grittiness of this stretch of Van Buren (a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look).

It was worth the trip, for the food, for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal:)

Go during daylight hours...park in the very safe "hooker patrolled" parking lot...avert your eyes from the public urination ("ma'am...that's really not appropriate":) and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at La Tolteca...eat 'til you're happy:)
