The food is cheap and delicious. I've lived in San Diego for the past 6 years and took my easy access to cheap and delicious Mexican food for granted. We bought burritos and rolled tacos. The rolled tacos were better than most I have had in San Diego. There were two people working when I visited so the wait wasn't too long. Less than 10 minutes. BRING CASH!!!!! I read the reviews online to bring cash which I did not have. I thought it would be easy to get cash back at the gas station the restaurant is inside but it was a pain. They charge a fee to get cash back and a fee to use a debit card.
