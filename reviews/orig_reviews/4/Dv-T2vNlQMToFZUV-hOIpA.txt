Update:

DO get huli huli chicken tacos from this place. It has great flavor and wasn't dry.

DO NOT: Get a salad here. It's just sad. It's like when you go to PTs or some type of bar and they have pancakes on the menu. You could totally order pancakes, but you probably shouldn't. I understand that you want to give people options but when you serve a salad the way they do, it's best not to. 

The salad was on a bed of lettuce. Or so they said. I couldn't find much lettuce. I also got grilled veggies, trying to be a little healthier I suppose. Well technically, it is "veggies" as it was TWO types of pepper, green and red. They weren't grilled when I was there, so they were just cold and limp. It wasn't appetizing.

There was shredded cabbage and very light green and very light. I also got black beans, and when I did get a bite of black beans in it, it added flavor. I also got tortilla strips which I could barely find as well. Bean sprouts were in there. I also received guacamole (included in the price of the grilled veggies) and it was the biggest scoop of guacamole I've ever seen. Didn't help the salad at all, as guacamole is a transport or vessel for flavor, NOT flavor itself. 

I still like the place as their burrito bowls and tacos are very good. They have great salsas and the meats are very good. Stick with that. Other places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle do a decent job of salad. Those salads aren't your idea of the most healthy salads, but I can always recall seeing much more lettuce and greens in those salads than what I got today. 

Don't let this dissuade you from eating here at all, but just know that just because they offer salads, doesn't mean you should get it.
