This is one of the nicer and better mexican restaurants in the valley. It is hard to find parking, but that is because it is at the mall.

The receptionists are not nice -- at all, ever, but the wait staff is really cool, helpful, and non-pushy. 

It is cold in the front part of the restaurant by the door, but you can ask to be seated in the back by the fire and will enjoy the much more private and warm atmosphere. The food is really good.

You can save some money by signing up for their emails and get a free appetizer. The guacamole is the best!
