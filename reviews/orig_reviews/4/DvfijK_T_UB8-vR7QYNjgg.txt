came here w/ a $50 for $100 groupon for my daughter's bday.... it was still not enough for a party of 5.  food is very pricey and only ok.  I think the best was the beef quesadilla's but way overpriced.  I am giving it 4 stars for the entertainment and staff.  our servers were great & after dinner moved us closer to the stage so we could access the dance floor easier.  We ended up staying for 5 hours!  Dave the MC and 360 the band were awesome.  they really made the visit for us!  If only it wasn't so expensive even w/ our groupon ( we ended up spending over $200!!) it would have been a perfect night... well, the food would still only get at the most 3 stars tho... but 2 adults & 3 teens had a blast dancing & laughing for hours!  Sad that our kids didn't get to see much of the Siren show tho :(
