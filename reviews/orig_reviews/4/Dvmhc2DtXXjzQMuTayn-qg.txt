Random area. Must be a converted home back in the day in central Phoenix.

What I was impressed with was the table side guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. The waiter made some crazy concoction and the secret ingredient of pomegranate seeds added. Gives is texture and a sweetness to the guacamole. Absolutely genius.

The sangria was amazing as well. They serve it with a shot of Jack Daniels and it tastes like juice.

Finally the churros are soooooooo delicious. Who doesn't like fried lard sticks dipped in cinnamon and sugar filled with caramel?!!! Dude, move over Disneyland churros and Costco churros, this is your bling bling cousin!!!

My entree- some halibut, was lack luster. I didn't enjoy it as much as it was hyped up to be. Presentation of it looked like something that came out of a buffet line- messy and uninspired.  Tried a nibble of the famous 16 hour pork as well and I was underwhelmed.

In conclusion- come here for perhaps a snack? They were incredible.
