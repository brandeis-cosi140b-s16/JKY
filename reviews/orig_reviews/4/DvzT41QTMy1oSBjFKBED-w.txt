This place is very interesting and what I appreciate is that it is not a franchise. I would compare this to a Chipotle restaurant but it is different. They tend to specialize in enchiladas, tacos, and unique salads.   Like Chipotle, you select your meat, your sauces, and toppings and then they bake your tray in the oven. I think it's even better than Chipotle but the food tends to be a little spicy so just be prepared for that. I chose the mild sauce and it was still spicy for me but I ate it all, no complaints. This is a definite must try restaurant. See pictures that others have loaded to get an idea what the food is like. Prices are very reasonable too, ranging around $7.
