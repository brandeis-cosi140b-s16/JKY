Went the other night as a party of 6 to celebrate my birthday.  I hadn't been there since it opened so I was pleased to find that the food had actually improved in the meantime.  My friends love food and have great appetites so we tried several different dishes.  Two friends are vegan and shared their dishes and said that they enjoyed most of their meal.  They especially liked the kimchee fried rice.  
The rest of us shared a plethora of dishes.  My favorites were the saut√©ed eggplant and the rock shrimp appetizer.  We also enjoyed the pork belly ramen.  The broth was smoky and delicious.  
Friends had the rock shrimp sushi roll but said that the tuna in the roll took away from the shrimp itself.  The rock shrimp appetizer was so delicious and you could taste the truffle oil.  We also had the Korean beef tacos which were good and the tempura cod tacos, which I would probably pass on next time.  The pairing with sauce, veggies didn't quite fit.  Our server was as friendly as could be however I think she became a little too busy for us as the night went on.  She forgot to tell us that the kitchen was out of the sea bass which we ordered and only found out about after we realized we missed it at the end of the meal.  Some of the other servers and hosts came to help serve dishes and were somewhat attentive during that time, although we did have to ask for a few things multiple times from different servers before we received them.  Overall the food was great.  My out-of-town friends really enjoyed the meal and experience so I'm happy I chose this restaurant for our celebration!
