Not a bad place to stop if you're waiting for a flight, but be prepared to leave with your wallet much lighter. 

I stopped here since it was outside of my gate and a margarita sounded good. The waitress recommended the Ultimate Margarita since it wasn't much more expensive than the house and you get more booze. I asked how much they were, and I should have braced myself. $14-something for a house and $16 for the Ultimate. Wow. But, I was set on a margarita at this point so I decided to shell out for the Ultimate. It was good! Well made and strong, but had a wonderful balance between the booze and other ingredients. 

I also ordered some chips and guacamole. This was pricey as well at $10.99. The guacamole was great but the chips left something to be desired. They seemed like they were something you'd buy on the grocery store shelves. In the end though, they were just a vehicle for the guac! 

Service was friendly and good, but they all did seem burnt out. I heard they were hopping all day.
