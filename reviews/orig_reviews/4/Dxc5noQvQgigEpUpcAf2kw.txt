My parents and I had an itch for Mexican food, and I'm SO glad I found Viva Mercado.  After reading many positive reviews on Yelp, I knew this place had to be great.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly waiter.  He quickly took and brought out our drink orders and shortly thereafter a busser brought us waters, chips, salsa, and bean dip.  Yum!  The waiter also asked if we liked roasted onions and jalapenos, which my mom eagerly said yes.  So lovely!  Our main dishes were also delicious and we couldn't have been happier.  Large portions, so you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day.

The final touch?  The waiter brought out Bunuelos (cinnamon crisps) with chocolate and whipped cream as a small treat.

I can't wait to go back!
