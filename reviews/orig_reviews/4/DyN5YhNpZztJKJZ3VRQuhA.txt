I was a little hesitant on writing a review on this place after reading the reviews of others.  I guess all i can say is i got lucky it seems.  We were on our way to On The Border when we noticed it had closed down. So i saw this place that i hadn't heard of and said lets give it a try.  I prefer trying new places anyway.  
I walked in and told the lady that me and another family, that were on their way, were looking for a place to eat and wanted to know why i should eat here (just giving her a hard time), i asked if the service was good, the place was clean, and if the food was good and what mexico city cuisine meant.  i think i caught her off guard because she didn't know how to answer except smile and laugh.  with my group of 12 they went right to work and put tables together, and i think they knew that i was expecting a lot.  i also saw the manager getting things together for us too.  my the time the rest of our group showed up they seated us with the table full of chips and their trio salsa, which everyone enjoyed.  The food was very good, my wife and i split the fajitas, and normally you get a huge plate full of onions and peppers with a few strips of meat, but it was just the opposite here, we got  a plate full of steak and chicken and just the right amount of onions and peppers.  very tasty and all went well.  drinks were delivered well and they even brought me out an extra pitcher of Dr. Pepper just for me to make sure i didn't run out.  
I guess i have to go back to see if they could deliver quality consistently.
