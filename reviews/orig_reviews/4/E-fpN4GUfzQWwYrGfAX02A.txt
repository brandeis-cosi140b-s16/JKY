Had dinner here with the guys before catching our show at the MGM. Venue is awesome and it's right on the corner at the intersection so the outer tables have a cool view of LV Blvd. We each ordered our dishes and were very pleased with them. Prices weren't too bad. It can get busy on weekends at dinner so reservations might be a good idea. Service was acceptable given how busy it was. Our server had an awesome back tattoo!
