I was staying at the Saguaro and they gave me a card for a free guacamole and chips, so of course I had to head down!  I also ordered the fish tacos, and both were amazing.  To wash it all down I I ordered a pink drink that someone next to me had and looked good.  For the life of me I cannot remember what the name of it was, but it was some sort of pink margarita.  Also VERY delicious.  The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because I ordered the taco from the bar menu and it was only supposed to be one taco for $4, but when it came it was three tacos, which cost $11.  Since I was alone it was a bummer because who can eat a whole bowl of guac AND three tacos?  Okay....I can.  But I didn't want to.  In any case, everything was quite delicious and I will definitely be back!
