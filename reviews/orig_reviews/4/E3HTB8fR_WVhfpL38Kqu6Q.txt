Great drinks, awesome Mexican food, super friendly bar tender!

We stopped by here last year for drinks and decided to go back for a snack this year. We each had two drinks plus an order of mushroom tacos and a chicken burrito. It was delicious and the drinks were amazing.

Only thing I didn't like was the middle-aged white-haired guy giving me sexy eyes from a few seats away. Wha?
