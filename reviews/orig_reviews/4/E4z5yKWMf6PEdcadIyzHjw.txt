What a spectacular experience! From beginning to end, we had nothing but a yummy and hospitable welcome from China Poblano and its staff. This restaurant is located on the second floor of my very favorite Vegas hotel, the Cosmopolitan. The seating is comfy and somewhat communal with long benches and tables. The decor is chic and earthy. The drinks are spectacular...any of the cocktails are great. We loved the small dishes, especially the Tuna Ceviche and the Coctel de Damarones. Both of these dishes are unbelievable and the tuna and lump crab were plentiful! I was partial to the Mexican side of the menu but enjoyed everything we had. The noodles are a great selection for the Asian flavor. The Shrimp Mojo was simple but packed with flavor. The food is sultry and inviting, just like the atmosphere. You usually don't have to worry about reserving a table way in advance. I can't recommend China Poblano enough. You have to experience it for yourself. Enjoy!
