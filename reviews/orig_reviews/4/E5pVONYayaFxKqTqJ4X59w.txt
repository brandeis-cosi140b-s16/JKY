me at phat burrito: ill have 1 fish taco and 1 .... crap I still can't decide but I know he really wants the rest of my order right now .... and 1 fountain drink... and 1.. (enter random yet always delicious second taco)

my sister and I were shopping in the area when lunch time arrived. I knew I had thrown my pb groupon into my purse before we left in case we were still nearby, and she reaally wanted a salad. luckily, we could both be happy. 

I ordered two tacos, yes the fish was amazing, but what was interesting was the salad. They have a good "selection", okay pretty much the same base with whatever protein you want thrown on top (and maybe a bean choice), but the way it's presented had many people in line asking and ordering what she was eating (we were in the booths between the register and the restrooms) I personally would have smothered the thing in pico and hot salsa from the lovely bar, but she was more than content with her chicken, beans, cheese, and lettuce. (there may have been a few more ingredients, but I was focused on my tacos. the pointing from the register did catch me off guard though) 

My main rule (that I have to admit I've been breaking lately as I've come to love my knife-point decisions) for phat is, if you don't know what you want, step to the side. Not that everyone is in a hurry, but everyone there is efficient. If you need more time reading the board, no biggie, just let the people behind you go. There seems to be some perfectly oiled machine of order/create/name calling that even on my first visit I caught onto and was extremely nervous to upset. I have realized those who are unaware of this are probably the same people who wait 20 minutes in line at starbucks and still don't know what they want when they get to the counter, and I understand the employee's occasional frustration. Just order with your gut and move on- it's all good.
