We were starving when we arrived in Phoenix after a long flight. We found the Taco Guild and could not have been more pleased. Fast service, very friendly, great margaritas and the food was wonderful!  As if that wasn't enough, the building is BEAUTIFUL and we just enjoyed it all after traveling all day. 

I'm hoping that won't be the only time we have a chance to dine there, maybe we can squeeze it in before we head home to the East Coast.
