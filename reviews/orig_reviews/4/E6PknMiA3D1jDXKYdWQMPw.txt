I go here about two times a week to get their carnitas burrito and it is always great. The building looks like another Filiberto's knock-off, but trust me, this family run restaurant is in a whole other league. The employees are all very accommodating to modifying item's. Due to dietary restriction I will often request many changes to items and they comply with no question. If you are looking for some quick Mexican food I highly recommend this spot.
