I've been to The Stand several times - I'll agree with the reviewers on here who have said the burgers are fantastic, they're easily my favorite fast-food burgers in Phoenix.  I'm also quite a fan of the fries - they are a bit salty as some have noted, but that tends to be how I like my fries anyhow so no complaints here.

The tacos aren't quite as fantastic - the ingredients sure do taste fresh, but the combination on the whole is just "good", not great.  If you're really hankering for a taco, I recommend the short rib over the somewhat bland chicken.  The salsa is a mild disappointment too - the "hot" salsa is anything but, though it does have a decent flavor.

Service here is friendly, if somewhat chaotic and occasionally a bit "too" friendly (like asking if you need a refill 3 times even after you've said no).

The decor is great, doing a neat job of intertwining the burger shack feel with Arcadia stylings.  The patio is small but nice - completely enclosed, hiding the traffic and noise of Indian School (for the most part).

All in all I strongly recommend The Stand if you're looking for a burger - if you're looking for tacos, though, you may find better options elsewhere in town.
