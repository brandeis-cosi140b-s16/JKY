Best Machacha anywhere!  Their chips are also great.  They package them and sell them around the state as My Nana's which are also the best you can find at any grocery store.  It is a shame that they have switched to full service from the great order at the counter and find a seat service they used to do.  I would stick with the Machacha burrito, but the Chile Rellenos are pretty tasty as well!
