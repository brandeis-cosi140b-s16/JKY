Made my third visit to this restaurant.  Each time the food has been quite good and very plentiful.  Very big portions.  Wait staff very friendly (with one exception) and service is fast.  Value is excellent.  Many lunch specials for $8.95 which includes rice and beans - and chips and salsa to start.  Each time, I've only been able to eat about 1/2  of my entree and taken the rest home.  

The only negative is that we showed up for lunch and the hostess didn't bother to come to her podium for almost 5 minutes after we arrived.  Then, when she did, she was not friendly at all - actually seemed put out that she had to attend to seating us... once to the table, she dropped the menus on the table and left without a word.  She clearly doesn't like her job.  Very strange, since everyone else I've encountered at the restaurant has been more than friendly.  So, memo to the restaurant manager: replace your lunchtime hostess.  It's the first impression people get of your restaurant and you probably don't want that impression to be one of rudeness.

Also, they have a large outdoor patio. Overall I enjoy this restaurant and will go back.
