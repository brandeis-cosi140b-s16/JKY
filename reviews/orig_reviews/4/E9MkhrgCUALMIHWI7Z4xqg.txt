friendly staff, very fast service, good food.  
two notes: 
1. if you like to have your favorite cerveza with your lunch or dinner, you'll have to find another place.  No beer served.  Would be great if they did.
2. as someone else mentioned, the hot salsa is VERY HOT!.  If you like a little kick but don't want to burn your mouth, try mixing the 2 salsas.
Overall a very pleasant dining experience.  Will invite friends to join us there.
