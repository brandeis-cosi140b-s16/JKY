Overall excellent food. The service and cleanliness cost it a star but otherwise incredible. The people at the food line were incredibly friendly and helpful but once we got to the cashier, we asked if they had any sides (hoping they had corn on the cob), and she said "just chips." We later saw guests with other options so we were a little confused as to why she told us she only had chips. The garbages throughout the entire restaurant were overflowing and pretty gross, but otherwise not horrible for the area as far as cleanliness goes. Tacos were excellent, we got a variety of 6 and shared and wasn't disappointed with any of them. We will probably be back.
