I have to say, this was totally solid. Is it as good as some of the Mexican food you can get here in Arizona? No, but that would be ridiculous to expect from a chain. I shared the enchiladas with my mom and they were really tasty, as were the rice and beans on the side.
I came back a few days later just to get some queso dip to go (I'd been craving it, okay?), and while it was pretty good, I wouldn't call it life changing.
If you go, definitely get either the mint lemonade or the horchata-- both are great!
