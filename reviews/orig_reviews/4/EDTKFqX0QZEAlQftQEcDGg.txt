One of our favorite Mexican places on the Strip!  The funny thing is that you would think it's a Chinese restaurant based on the name.  We asked our server the story behind the name and she gladly shared it with us.  

Cool vibe, friendly staff, chill atmosphere.

Try the Sopas, Tortilla Soup (although it's better at Border Grill), Street Tacos, and OH YEAH, the Fried Ice Cream!!

We are regulars here!!
