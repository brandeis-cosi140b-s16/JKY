I try to come here at least once every trip.  The main reason?  The mussels.  I don't usually like mussels but this place has the BEST on the planet.  I could just eat that alone and make a meal out of it.  It's a big whopping plate of mussels cooked in a ultra flavorful red broth.  Comes with toasted garlic herb bread too!  I realized by coming here why I didn't like mussels before.  It's because most places don't use fresh mussels.  This place does.  There is absolutely no fishiness at all.  Just sweet tasty morsels.  I know they use fresh mussels because on a recent trip there I wasn't able to order them because the supplier didn't have any that day.  The main course are ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Their Sangria is pretty good, it would be better if they didn't fill the little cup with so much ice.  This place is worth 4 stars just on the mussels alone :)
