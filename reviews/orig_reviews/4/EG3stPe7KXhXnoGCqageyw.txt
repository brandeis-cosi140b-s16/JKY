Another great hidden restaurant in the college corridor. You know you're in for some cheap eats when there's a place around the college. The food here is really good and seasoned just right. Everyone is friendly and treat you like family (good side of the family, not the cousin in prison side). I highly recommend coming here, shrimp burrito, super chicken burrito, carne asada taco, potatoe taco, fish taco, chicken nachos, and fish n chips washed down with deep fried Oreos. Everyone here all thumbs up from the crew. Highly recommend!!
