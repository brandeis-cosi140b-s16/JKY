Their food is delish!   No matter what dish I've had , I've never been dissapointed.  I would say the prices sometimes are a lil higher but food is good!   I was a fan before they changed locations, they used to be a small hole in the wall on 16th and Thomas... I hate their new locations it's hiddend and parking sucks.  BUt the food is worth it!
