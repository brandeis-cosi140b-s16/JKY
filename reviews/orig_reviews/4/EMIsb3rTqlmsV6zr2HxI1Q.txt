My wife and I have eaten at Carlito's several times (both dine-in and take-out) and it has become a go-to spot for great burritos.

My wife has an intolerance for gluten so she gets the enchiladas or tacos.  She enjoys both.

I almost always get the Combo Burrito with carne adovado and covered in red sauce.  The red sauce is a roasted chili sauce that is spicy but not overly spicy; but it might be a bit much for some.  The green sauce is excellent, too, with a nice hint of citrus.  And you can get both: one inside and one out!

I've had other meats in the burrito including beef and pork verde.  All were good but the carne adovado is what was uniquely delicious to my taste buds.

Chips and salsa are extra.  I would not spend the money on them; the chips are not great, the red salsa is rather mediocre (though it does also come with the delicious green sauce, too!) and the burrito is enough to stuff anyone.

We have gotten guacamole three times now.  The first time the guac. was delicious and very fresh.  The second two times were rather disappointing and once it was so old that it was brown and inedible, to me.  I would say take a look at it and see how fresh it is before ordering it.

I once got fish tacos and they were not the traditional fish tacos.  They are not served with cabbage or the usual zesty white sauce, but rather, they are just a traditional taco with fried fish.  I liked them even though it wasn't what I was expecting.  But I don't think I would order them again as long as there is a burrito to enjoy.

The interior is very cramped and quite worn.  Come for the food, not the ambiance.  But the food makes for great take-out.

So things are hit and miss on the menu, garnering a 4-star rating but the burritos are 5-star excellent so go for the burrito!
