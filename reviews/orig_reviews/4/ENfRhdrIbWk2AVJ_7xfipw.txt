I like the charm of this particular Macayos
It is dated but I'm pretty sure all the Macayos are... It's part of their own history and adds a lot to their uniqueness

This restaurant is huge, inside and outside 
I was really surprised at how big it was haha
On our dinner stop the restaurant was pretty empty which was great because we were starving and had already drove all the way up from Tempe 
The hostess seated us upon walking in and our server was very prompt as well 
She was nice and very knowledgable of the menu 
After looking at the menu I got the enchiladas and refried beans
Well
That was after I devoured the chips & salsa 
We put our order in 
And
Our food came out in about 10 minutes
Maybe even quicker

And then I finished my food in maybe 5 minutes haha I was so hungry
One of the managers brought our food out and she was very, very nice 

Overall it was a nice meal and nice ambience 

I kept looking at the bar and thinking "how drab" but I'm sure their happy hour prices make up for it :)
