Been meaning to try this place and finally did. The atmosphere and aromas were telling me it was the right choice. As you walk into the line, you can see that the tortillas were being made fresh. Big plus! 

I ordered the burrito with the chile roast beef, black beans, rice and medium sauce. Then decided to make it enchilada style with the hot sauce. It was a huge portion. I also ordered a mint limeade. 

The burrito was good but way more rice and beans than meat. The red (hot) sauce on top also had a sweet component I wasn't fond of. The limeade was refreshing. 

Overall, I enjoyed it and live really close so I will definitely be back. I feel like there is a flavor combination that will really seal the deal for me. I just have to go back til I find it!
