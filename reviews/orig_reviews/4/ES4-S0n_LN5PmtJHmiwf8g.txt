I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldn't let her drink alone. And oh, I'm so glad I'm such a good friend. 

The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing. And plenty strong enough to make any hour happy. This drink defines the word elixir. It is as intoxicatingly unforgettable as its namesake.
