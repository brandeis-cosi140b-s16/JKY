Wow! Welcome to the neighborhood! The owner, Jarrett (sorry if I messed the spelling up) is a friendly guy. He came over and said hi. He nailed it with this place.  The guacamole is fresh and cold and the most wonderful texture and flavor...the chips are thin and crispy...the patio is so relaxing. I love this place!

After the guacamole, I had the Tostadas de Costilla. Which were delicious. The portion was adequate, but I wish I had one more little tostada. The short rib was perfectly sauced and the mix of unusual flavors was perfect. 

I can't wait to try the Pastel de Abuela - their own description says: Granny's spicy chocolate cake with candied fresno chiles and pistachio ice cream - YUM! I haven't tried it yet because every time I go to this place I get full from eating all of the other goodies. 

The decor is really, lovely, too. It is artistic and chic in a way that isn't cold or pretentious. It's just pretty and there are lots of lovely fixtures and pieces of art to look at.

As if this place couldn't get any better...It is mellow dog friendly, too!
