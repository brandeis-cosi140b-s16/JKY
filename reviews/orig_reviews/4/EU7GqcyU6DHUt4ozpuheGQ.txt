The BEST chicken taco I have ever had. If you order one, get the boiled chicken with everything option. Apparently now they offer a grilled chicken version, which I have not tried yet. The quality, flavor and texture of the taco is excellent. The outer shell seems soft, while the inner shell has a slight toasted crisp to it. The tacos seem to have slightly shrunk in size recently, but are still full of meat, pinto beans, sour cream and guacamole. If you prefer a side sauce, I recommend green, which isn't too hot. The chips and salsa are also very good, and a generous portion for $2. Sorry I can't review the rest of the menu. It's too difficult not to order these tacos!
