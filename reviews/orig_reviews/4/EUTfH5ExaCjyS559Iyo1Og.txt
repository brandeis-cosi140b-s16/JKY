I ate dinner here with coworkers after work last night.  I was impressed that they have a gluten free menu, and it was not as sparse as many restaurants, it offered a decent selection. I opted for the bacon wrapped shrimp fajitas. Our food came in out pretty quickly. My meal came with all the usual fajita makings (sour cream, shredded cheese, guac, lettuce), plus a cilantro lime rice and a side of charro beans. I chose the romaine leaves for my fajitas, in an attempt to be healthy, but the corn tortillas would have been a far better choice to hold the jumbo shrimp and all the fajita makings. My bad. The beans and rice were average in my opinion, however, the shrimp was wonderfully done, very tasty.  Our server (Sarah?) was on the ball and our table of 5 kept her on her toes. She did not disappoint. My work peers also enjoyed their meals, which included a chocolate molten cake and a cheesecake. I think the only GF option for dessert would be the flan but I was already pretty overloaded with dairy and quite full so refrained but would like to try it next time I'm there. And I do hope there is a next time!
