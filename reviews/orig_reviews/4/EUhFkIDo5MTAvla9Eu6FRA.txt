Nice to finally meet you Comedor Guadalajara,

My husband and I really enjoyed our time here.  We were looking for decent Mexican food.  This was our first visit . . . the parking lot (behind the building) was large (and don't let the outside of the building defer you . . . it's big inside).  The service was great from the minute we walked in the door.  The margaritas were really good (you could actually taste the tequila).  Complimentary warm chips and spicy salsa.  We both had the beef tacos, rice and beans.  Great food.

This is going to be our new go-to place when we crave Mexican food.  Prices were very reasonable.

I can't wait to go back for breakfast and try the Huevos Rancheros.  Yum!
