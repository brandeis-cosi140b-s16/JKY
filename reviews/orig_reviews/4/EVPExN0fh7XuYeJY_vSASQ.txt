Went to Richardson's on a double date. It was a Saturday night, and thank goodness we made a reservation. The place is pretty small, so it fills up pretty quickly. FYI: Reservations are only available for parties of 4+, so we were able to squeak by. :) We were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time and had a great little booth private-ish booth. I had the red sangria which was delicious. It has pulp (tasted like orange and pineapple?) which is a little unusual for sangria but actually was really good. We also tasted a sample of one of their draft beers (can't remember the name), I believe it was a Belgian pale. It seemed like the light equivalent of a Guinness. Apparently, it's made by Monks and was really good. I highly recommend it. 

The food portions are pretty large, so I would definitely suggest sharing. We ordered the Chimayo Chicken and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. The Chimayo Chicken is served with a house salad, so between that and the entree, it's more than enough for two people to share. The Chimayo Chicken was so delicious!! It's stuffed with spinach and sun dried tomatoes, drizzled with a red chili sauce and is served on a tortilla with a cheese/corn sauce. On the side is a generous helping of asparagus and broccoli, also served with the cheese/corn sauce, and a chili with a sweet-potato mash tasting concoction on top. 

The BBQ Chicken Pizza was also really good. Maybe a little light on sauce, but the onions were delicious and distributed generously.

The service was pretty good, but our server seemed a bit frazzled at being so busy. The Chimayo Chicken was $24, so a little pricey, but considering it feeds more than one, or feeds one for multiple meals, it's worth the price. I highly recommend this place, and am already planning my next visit.
