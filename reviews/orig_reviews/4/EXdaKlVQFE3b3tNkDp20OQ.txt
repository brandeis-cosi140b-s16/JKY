I love nachos so I was super intrigued by the giant sign that I saw from the freeway (and I like the name). My BF and Inwent there on a Wednesday areoundn8pm and there were only about four other people in the restaurant. We were sat and starting looking at all the delicious nacho options on the menu. We decided to split the Enchilada nachos, street tacos - one shrimp, one chicken and one Carne asada and the tortilla soup. The only issue is that by the time we decided what we wanted we still had  not been greeted and it had been about fifteen minutes or so. After the server finally came over she was very apologetic and gave us free chips, salsa, and guacamole. She also comped our drinks - nice recovery. The tortilla soup was amazing - super flavorful with great balance of chicken, broth and tortilla strips, the best I have had in a really long time. The tacos were ok - carne asada was a little chewy, fried shrimp was good but the flavor was overtaken by the tortilla and the chicken was average. Now the nachos - GREAT! I loved the way that each bite had stuff on it, I hate when restaurants put everything on the top so when you get to the bottom you just have a pile of chips. We even had stuff left over and used some of the chips from the chips and salsa. I also liked how the nachos were served on a skillet keeping the hot and crispy for longer. I will definitely go back!
