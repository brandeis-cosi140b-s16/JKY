Don't have anything bad to say about this place. The staff is always friendly, the food is consistently good, and the prices are reasonable. I like the option to buy a dozen tamales for a deal price, rather than a bunch of individuals. The shredded beef ones are my favorite. Also really appreciate their knowledge of needing gluten free accommodations. Overall nice restaurant
