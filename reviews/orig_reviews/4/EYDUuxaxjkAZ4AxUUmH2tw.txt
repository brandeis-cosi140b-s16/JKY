I was in the area getting some work on my car so to burn up some time I decided to pop in and have a bite. From the outside I wasn't sure what I was getting into. Once inside it had a nice eating area but what really surprised me was the food. The food was delicious and of generous portions. It was a good experience and a hidden secret I would bring friends to of passing by.
