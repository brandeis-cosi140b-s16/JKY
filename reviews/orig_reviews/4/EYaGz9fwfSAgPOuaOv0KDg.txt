Given the size of the restaurant and the amount of volume they do, I expected the food quality to suffer on a busy Sunday morning. However, I was pleasantly surprised to have my first impression proven wrong.   

The waitress did a good job of walking us through the menu. She said "we have some really good items so I just want to make sure you know what they are so you have a good experience."  Started with the El Sol guacamole - prepped table-side. It was nice and chunky and the cheese put a nice twist on it. 

For mains I ordered the Carlotta which turned out to be a massive tower of crunchy, sweetness topped with some amazing vanilla cream and fresh fruit. You can get it "with meat" so I ordered it with bacon to add some saltiness to my plate. Warning - this dish turns heads. I had two people literally stop and gawk at my breakfast as I was trying to dig in. 

My companion ordered two of the tacos - the vampiro (spicy) and the Xolo. The meat was well-cooked and flavorful for both. Overall great little tacos with fresh and interesting ingredients. They do have a taco on the menu that's made with ghost chiles - the Viper. I'd like to note that the waitress was very polite as she recommended we stay away from it (unless we were really in the mood for spicy... Apparently we didn't look like we were in the mood).

Only reason I'm dinging them for a star is because the size of the Carlotta was so massive that I could barely eat a quarter of it. It also had a lot of "chewiness" in the center of the toast which wasn't that appealing. The crunchy outside was def the best part.
