Since I work right around the corner from this Tempe restaurant, this is a go to place for weekday lunch. But you better get there early, because the small restaurant fills up fast. Good, fresh and tasty Mexican food. I usually get the chicken/avocado salad and then add a lot of the red chili sauce. You have your choice of dressing too, and I go with the jalapeno ranch. 
They have a drive through for take out, but you have to call ahead.
