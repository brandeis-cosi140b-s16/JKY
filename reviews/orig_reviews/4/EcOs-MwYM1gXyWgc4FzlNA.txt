Out of all the different Roberto's in Vegas, I think this one is the best.

You walk in, the person at the register is always polite, and the restaurant is normally clean.

But who cares if a restaurant is clean if the food isn't good, right? Luckily, this Roberto's is always spot on with everything they make. From the California Burrito to the Carne Asada Fries, all the way to their Fish Tacos -- it always tastes great.

If you want a good burrito, this Roberto's won't disappoint you.
