Best happy hour in town IMO (and I welcome anyone to suggest others that they love).  The beer list is really stellar - lots of local and regional micros.  The only with the beer list is that it can get out of date and have a few beers on it that are already kicked.

I'll occasionally get a margarita - they're solid for sure, but I'd recommend going for a high-end option if you can splurge for it.  They do a great job with those.

I like the food.  It's fast, tasty and fills you up.  I almost always order the same thing - Black Bean & Pineapple Quesadilla.  Perfect portion for me at a restaurant where the portion sizes can be a bit large at times.  I also really like the chicken tortilla soup, nachos (real cheese - not cheese sauce) and the spicy bean dip.

On weekend nights - be prepared for big crowds and a long wait.
