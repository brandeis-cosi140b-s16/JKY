"It actually looks like the picture!" This is what my husband said when he got his entree.

The enchiladas are "muy bien y delicioso." You will find that the price is low and the serving is plentiful! The menu has a large variety of enchiladas and other Mexican food dishes to select. The chips and salsa were good too.

Similar to another review, be prepared to listen to the news in Spanish or a Novela. The jukebox was not playing while we were there, but I'm sure they use it often. 

After reading some of the other reviews about speaking Spanish, I was excited to go and use my Spanish speaking abilities; however, once we got there, the woman spoke English and so it deflated my excitement. Regardless of Spanish or English, this food bridges the cultural and financial divide...very good and inexpensive!
