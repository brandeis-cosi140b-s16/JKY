this place is the grand master of drive-throughs.  i love that i have the option of getting tacos, burgers, chips, AND fresh lemonade without ever having to leave my car.  add a hot dog to the menu and i would flip out!

i usually go for the standard with cheese; it's huge, fresh, and super juicy.  it can often be a little bit of a mess, but who cares? this is a fast food place, people. their carne asada tacos are great as well-tender and full of flavor.  i'm not usually a banana person, but their banana stand milkshake is so so good and unlike any milkshake i've had.  definitely give it a shot if you want to try something new! 

my only issue with this place is how backed up their drive-through can get, especially during peak hours.  they make everything fresh, so it obviously takes a little bit longer than your standard fast food place, but sometimes it can take 25+ minutes to get your food. i'm not sure if they need more people dedicated to cooking for the drive-through only or what, but i would give them 5 stars if they resolved this!
