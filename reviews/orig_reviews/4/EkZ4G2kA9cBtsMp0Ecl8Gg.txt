Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. We received a gluten free menu, as well as warm tortillas and salsa (our waiter said he didn't trust the chips to be gluten free). We ordered Peruvian Ceviche. Unfortunately, we unknowingly ordered what appeared to be an appetizer. It was still delicious, just not very filling. It was good, but not amazing considering how pricy it is. Will go back again when I have the money :)
