Now ... at first blush this is kind of weird.  As you walk toward this place you see two windows ... one clearly offering Mexican fare; the other offering Asian.   You may see people seated outside, along with a hostess stand, and a single door into the dining area.  As you get closer, you can either order at the window (presumably carry out) or you can see the hostess to sit inside or outside the entrance.  Wife and I sat outside.  Here came the menu, and you can order (yes, that's right) Mexican or Asian) we ordered ... ... fresh made Guac and "when pigs fly" which are asian buns.  Food was DELICIOUS, portions are adequate, not huge, but good tasting food.  Would definitely go back to try more, particularly on a Friday or Saturday night around the witching hour for the nightclub as the people watching was worth paying for in and of itself.
