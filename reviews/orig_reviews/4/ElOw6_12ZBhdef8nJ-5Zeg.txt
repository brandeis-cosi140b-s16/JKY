Had an amazing lunch here.  First off the decor is really neat.  You can sit at tables or one of two bars.  We sat at one of the bars and were able to watch the ladies make the Dim Sum.  Our waiter was really nice and helpful, he walked us through the menu, explaining that the food was not fusion, it was just both Mexican and Chinese.  I ordered the Salt Air Margarita.  I am very picky about Margaritas and I must say that this was the best one I have ever had.  The salt foam was fantastic.  Ok, so yes, the food is expensive but it is delicious, and its from a celebrity chef at a Las Vegas restaurant so what do you expect.  I still think it is worth the high price.  My husband and I each ordered a taco and shared two appetizers.  This was a perfect amount of food.  We each loved our tacos, I had the Tinga Poblana which was awesome, kinda like a gourmet breakfast burrito.  My husband had the Silencio, which was a duck tongue taco, he said it was great and the tongues had perfect texture.  We shared the When Pigs Fly Dim Sum which was a good steamed pork bun.  We also had the Chilaquiles, it was great and even better since we ordered a side of Habanero salsa, it was super spicy and awesome.  I would eat here again for sure!
