I really liked this place. hubby and I went for lunch on Monday...we were greeted at the door by 2 lovely ladies with genuine smiles!
We immediately seated and greeted for drinks and aps...  
We had guacamole and it was great....I had the shrimp enchiladas awesome and my hubby had the chicken burrito and said it was great too. I like the family style rice and beans...just wished they gave a little more on the first plate.....a little embarrassed to ask for another plate with just the two of us.
Great spot.....would love to come back for happy hour!
