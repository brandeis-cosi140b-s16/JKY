This was one of the better Mexican food restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  We did go on Monday (when they first opened) so the service was kinda "meh".  However, the food was very good.

This is Mexican food, not TexMex.  It's not like Valle Luna (which is good that they aren't).  It's been rough finding GOOD Mexican food in the Phoenix area.

mmm Chips and dip... their salsas were really good... not full of vinegar.  Their "hot" has good flavor, but isn't so hot you can't eat it.  Bean dip was REALLY good too!  Their chips were good and weren't oily either.
  
They have a **H U G E** menu...

The Carne Asada was really good!  It's a sirloin steak topped with green chiles. Garnished with guacamole. Served with chile relleno.  Probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.

My wife got the spinach and cheese enchilada verde.  It came out with 2 friends... (3 of them). They have their special sour cream (onion flavored).  It was very good too!
