A great place to go for Mexican when you are Downtown.  The Menu has some interesting stuff on it and is priced very fairly.

Make sure to get chips and salsa to start with, they are very good.  The guacamole is also tasty.

One thing that I did not like was that they had a "Las Velas" and a "Las Velas Guest" WiFi network and when I asked for the password, they told me that their WiFi was not for customers.  Why have the guest network then?
