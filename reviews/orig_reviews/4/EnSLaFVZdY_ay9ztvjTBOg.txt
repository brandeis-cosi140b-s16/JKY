Looks a little shabby on the outside, fantastic authentic food on the inside.  We arrived shortly before lunch and by the time our food arrived the place was full and had a line out the door.

Delish: talk about flavor!  Portions might appear on the smaller side (which threw me off, eyes bigger than stomach issue) but very filling.  I ended up having to bring half of my food home!  For mushroom lovers: try the huitlacoche!

My brother lives in the area - great find broey!  We'll head back to Maize when we head back to IL for a family visit.

Deep friend quesadillas?  Yeah, I said it.  Crazy....
