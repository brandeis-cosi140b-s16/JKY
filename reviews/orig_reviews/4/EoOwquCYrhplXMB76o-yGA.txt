This place is the bomb! Similar to Chipotle but with better flavor. Very friendly customer service and their coconut bark is delicious. I always leave here full and extremely satisfied. Would've gotten 5 stars if the TV had sports news or something similar instead of just a slide show of pictures of the restaurant. All in all a very enjoyable experience!
