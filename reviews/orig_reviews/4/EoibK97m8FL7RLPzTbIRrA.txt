Cute spot for brunch. A dark contrast to the blazing sun outside. Great cocktails (and the waiter is extremely knowledgeable and can recommend some delicious drinks).

Must order: tableside guacamole. Just do it.

If you like steak, order the Tecate Marinated Skirt Steak. Make sure you add an egg. They may throw in an extra egg, just for kicks. Accept this gift.
