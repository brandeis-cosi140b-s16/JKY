The food was more like a 3.5 star but the service puts it at 4 stars!

We came one evening on a weekday so it really wasn't busy at all.  It's a fast food place in a little strip mall.  Since we were 2 families, we had 4 rugrats with us and I really appreciated how the lady took her time to make sure we didn't over order for the kids and was so accommodating in varying the dishes a little to accommodate our picky eaters.

As for us adults, I have to say I was very excited reading the menu and wanted to order everything.  But I was informed they have generous portions so I will have to come back to taste more.  =)

Overall, the food is freshly cooked fast food style --- if you want this type of food and like Korean food, then you will be quite satisfied.
