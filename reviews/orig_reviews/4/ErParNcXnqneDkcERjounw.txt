I just love the name, can it get any cuter?
Excellent location, great view of the strip and good place to watch the T.I show.
Atmosphere was great, lived up to my expectation. The celling and walls are covered in corky saying and quotes everywhere, its a fun thing to be surrounded by. 

Food was good, hot tasty and full of flavor. Now I didn't order anything off the menu I did the buffet offered up stairs! Excellent choice because down stairs get loud and crazy, a bit to much for my taste due to the live entertainment. Upstairs has its own bar area too so don't panic theres enough liquor to go around. 

Servers I think are missing a screw or two in there brains; there forgetful, standing around, and kinda clueless really. This is why they lost a star in my books.
