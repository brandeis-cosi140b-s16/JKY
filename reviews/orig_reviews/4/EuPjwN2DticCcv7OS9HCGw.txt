In Arizona on vaction, hubby picked this spot out for lunch before a little shopping. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad - it packed a lot of flavor! Dressing was fabulous, chicken had a lot of kick to it, crispy tortilla strips, fresh greens. Hubby had the catfish tacos that he was excited about but didn't really  end up loving (not sure why, he didn't really complain but didn't finish his plate...) We enjoyed the chips, salsa sampler and my husband really loved the fresh cornbread.  We just grabbed a couple beers, although I wish I had tried a mixed drink. Pretty solid place, relaxing atmosphere.
