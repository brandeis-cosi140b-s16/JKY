I did not expect to like this place at all...I figured chain, similar to TGIF food quality. I started to be impressed with my drink - a mango pineapple mojito. Ummm...yum! Mango puree, muddled mint, and not too weak or too strong. The coconut margaritas were also a hit. My albondigas soup was outstanding. Everyone else loved their food - a mix of salads and seafood tacos. Our server worked hard to keep 7 indecisive women happy. OK, so a line dance broke out mid-meal...kinda corny, but consummate Vegas. The music is a bit loud (especially those Sammy songs) making it a tad hard to talk, but it's Vegas...who needs to talk?
