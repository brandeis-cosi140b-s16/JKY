I'm so glad I tried this place. Everything is fresh made and the prices are great. The set up reminds me of Tacos El Gordo. They offer asada, al pastor, lengua, buche and sosa tacos, burritos and sopas. It's worth a stop by if your looking for tacos. This location was a Farm Basket years ago (right behind Arbys).

PROS: Buche taco
            Al Pastor taco
            Lengua taco

CONS: Not much atmosphere inside.
