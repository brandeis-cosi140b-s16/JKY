Excellent Vibes
The food was Good, but rather overpriced for what it is... $14 for a grande steak burrito that would normally cost about 8 bucks elsewhere. But its Vegas.

VERY PROFESSIONAL Managerial staff. Handled an issue well and treated us with utmost respect. We left here satisfied because of Bob! Thanks for the help.
