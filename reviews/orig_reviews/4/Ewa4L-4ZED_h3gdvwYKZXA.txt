As other Yelpers have mentioned, ambience is not a priority here. In fact, the outside felt a little like the Bates Motel! 

However, the food is quite tasty and not expensive. I enjoy the taco combo with pulled beef, rice and beans.  My companion has tried the chicken taco salad, fajitas, burritos and enchiladas.  We have always found our food to be very yummy.  I've been here a dozen times and always see the same people working. They are also very generous with the chips and salsa, and they pour a biiiig ol' soda, which I appreciate-I hate to have to continually wave down a server for a refill when the soda comes in small glasses.

It can get busy, and I love to see all the different kinds of people willing to jam into this little space to eat some good Mexican food!
