I ate here last Sunday for lunch and the food is absolutely AMAZING! True, authentic Mexican food. I went with a friend whose husband is 100% Mexican, and is use to his cooking, and she gave it two thumbs up! They greet you at the table with fresh homemade tortilla chips, 2 types of salsa and homemade bean dip. We had the Queso Fundido as an appetizer and it was glorious, cheesy goodness! As for entreés, I had the Quesa Tacos and they were unbelievably delish! I highly recommend Leticia's, and make sure to get the strawberry-jalapeño margarita! Yum!
