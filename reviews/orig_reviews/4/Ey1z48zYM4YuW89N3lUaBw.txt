Barrio Cafe is a fantastic alternative to the average Mexican food.  The atmosphere and decor have a much more refined old world charm.  The food is amazing with different takes on some traditional dishes and several twists many people might not expect in a "Mexican food" restaurant.  The margaritas are tasty along with several other tempting offerings on the beverage menu.  It can be considered a tad pricey and it's not unusual to have to wait to be seated but I would have to say it is worth it at least every now and then.  On a funny side note the space the restaurant is in used to be a little pizza by the slice place back when I was going to a near by high school.  I burned my mouth there many times before Barrio Cafe ever existed.
