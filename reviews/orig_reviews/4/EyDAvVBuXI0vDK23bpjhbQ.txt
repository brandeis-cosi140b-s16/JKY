Had lunch here again yesterday. The outside of the building is deceiving, as the interior is nicely decorated and offers a dark, modern, comfortable atmosphere. The menu is unique and exciting. They offer lunch sized portions and heartier dinner sized portions.

Their southwest pork tenderloin (i think it was a dinner special one night) was a real treat, and the chimis are perfection. Definitely request their "hotter" salsa.
