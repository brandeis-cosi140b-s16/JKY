Great place to watch the ballagio water show.... I left a pool party at Marquee and was able to cool down and chill with a appetizer sampler and a house margarita in my swim suit and take in the atmosphere. It was a quick walk from the cosmopolitan and the patio was elevated just enough that I see over the crowds in the strip. The inside looks pretty small so oitdoors was great esp with the mist spray on. The menu seems really good. Classic dishes with a modern twist. The bbq chicken wings were awesome along with the chips and salsa. I loved the queso dip with my taquitos. The sampler was enough to feed me and 3 others. The fish tacos were amazing and the chipotle sauce they add to it made it complete! The service was fast, friendly and they were always checking on us despite the full crowd they had going on. Can't wait to try something else on the menu next time....
