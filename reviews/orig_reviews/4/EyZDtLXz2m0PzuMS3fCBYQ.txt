Been here twiceactually - In the summer of 2011, some vendors suggested drinks and dinner here. Fusion TexMex fare. The grilled steak Carne Asada tacos with carmelized onions were good but the sauteed mushrooms were out of this world and were only $6. It was crowded and busy so the staff did their best considering. The Limeade was great. The second one was even better!
