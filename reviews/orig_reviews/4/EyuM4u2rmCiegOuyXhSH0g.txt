Came back for a second time. I always give even the worse ratings a second chance! Daughter was spending some time with me and we ended up here since she has never tried it. She ordered their cheese enchilada, and ground beef taco combination. I had their "The Fireman" it's like a steak picado but more spice and heat. I loved this plate, daughter loved her plate also. The rice and beans were still great from the last trip here. Their chips seem to be different and better. We ended up coming back the next night to bring my wife for her second time. She also was surprised about how much better it was. So we now have a second best place to go! Garcia's on 35th Ave is our favorite, but now at our West Valley location. Rio Mirage Cafe has now replaced La Fuentes has our favorite West Valley Mexican Restaurant! Cheers to you Rio Mirage for making changes to get better!!!
