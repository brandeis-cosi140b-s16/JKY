Well OK then.....re-visited today and ordered their signature California Wet Burrito. Wet I'm ASSUMING because they add a white cheese sauce? Nonetheless, this time I got it with Ground Beef. In my last review, I gave it an IFFY review because their steak was chewy and lacked flavor. This time, the flavors were really good and of course GB can't be "chewy." 

A BIG plus was that they had a guajillo pepper salsa. Man was that ever good! Because I like a chunky salsa, I added the guajillo pepper salsa to the pico de gallo salsa and voila! Invented my own salsa and man was THAT ever awesome!

So this time the burrito was really good and the salsa bar rocked! Given that the burrito is HUGE, I gave it an extra star this time as it all came out to under $10, including chips and a fountain drink!

The owner is a very nice Mexican lady who keeps asking if everything is good. 

So if you're craving a BIG, GOOD burrito at a reasonable price, check this place out. You'll be glad you did!
