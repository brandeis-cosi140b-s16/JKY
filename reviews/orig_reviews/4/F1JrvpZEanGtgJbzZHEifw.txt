I decided to try Taco Haus last week for lunch and I enjoyed my experience.  The carne asada taco and chicken taco were very good.  The salsa that comes with the chips was excellent.  I think they got their taps mixed up because my Green Flash IPA was something totally different.

Overall, a nice place.  I'll be back.
