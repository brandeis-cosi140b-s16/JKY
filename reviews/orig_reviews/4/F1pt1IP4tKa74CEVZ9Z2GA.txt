What can I say that other reviewers haven't? This place is awesome for vegetarians (there are like 8 different vegetarian taco choices!) and the salsa bar is awesome (strawberry salsa!). I really liked the guacamole, which was chunky and light with refreshing chunks of jicama and tomato with the avocado.
