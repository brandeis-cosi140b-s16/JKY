The Margaritas were awesome!!! Try the peach hibiscus - it's on the sweeter side but really good! I ate the carnitas tacos & you can order any of them with a hard shell; which I did. I was a bit disappointed with the hard shell because it seemed a little too prefabricated. I like a fresh fried tortilla for my hard shells. The tacos were still really great! 
I really could have stayed all night for the margaritas, chips, salsa and guacamole though!! The place had a nice modern and hip atmosphere. Give it a try!
