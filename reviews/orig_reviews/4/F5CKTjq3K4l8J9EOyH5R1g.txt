Last night a group of friends and I decided to head to Cantina to get our mexican fix.  I love the atmosphere of the place, you have the choice to sit inside or out...great music playing throughout...dim lighting, candles lit...I think this would make for a perfect first or second date night dinner :)  I had the chicken fajitas and they were wonderful - so much food that I couldn't finish it all!  The salsas were great, the guacamole was excellent, and the service was pretty good overall.  We all had a round or two of margaritas - they were ok, not mind blowing, and I thought they were rather weak (especially for 12 bucks a pop!).  If the drinks were better, I would've bumped this to a 5 star rating.  All of my friends that were with me seemed to really enjoy their food, for 3 of them it was the first time going - and they all said they would go back.  

Overall, another great experience at Cantina, I'll just steer clear of the margaritas next time!
