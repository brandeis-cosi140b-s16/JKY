Like most, I'm prepared for mediocre food in airports.  This place is not.  The food was really very good, the portions hefty, and there are outlets to plug in a laptop all around the outside to boot.

I had the guacamole (made in house, not shipped in) and it was great.  It's often hard to get good guac at restaurants that aren't in airports, so I think that says a lot about this place.  I also had the tortilla soup, which had lots of shredded chicken, was a large size, and was very flavorful.

I will be heading to this place every time I go through PHX from now on.
