Korean and Mexican food. perfect combo... well the most common fusion combination I think. they do a decent job. I've tried it several times and ate most of the items on the menu. I like to order a lot. lol
I really like the tacos. its small and I can still order something else to munch on. philly cheesesteak wasn't the greatest. I say avoid that and the sliders. stick with Mexican dishes. burritos are always a safe choice. my go to meat is pork belly, but most people seem to order the bulgogi.
