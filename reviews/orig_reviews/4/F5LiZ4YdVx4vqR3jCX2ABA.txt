I am very impressed with Frank & Fina's! I had actually never heard of the place, but I was in the area and am always looking for good Mexican food, so I thought I'd give them a try.

Turns out the food is very good, among the best Mexican I've had in Vegas (and I've been searching for good Mexican restaurants here for nearly 3 years!). I've been several times now, and the service can be spotty, but everyone is always friendly.

I wish they stayed open a bit later, but I suppose the area doesn't support many late night restaurants. :)

Overall, Frank & Fina's has become my "go-to" place for Mexican food. The atmosphere and friendliness are good, and the food has been consistently pretty good. The chips and salsa are great by the way! Price-wise, they are about typical for mid-range Mexican food.

If you haven't tried this place, definitely give it a shot!
