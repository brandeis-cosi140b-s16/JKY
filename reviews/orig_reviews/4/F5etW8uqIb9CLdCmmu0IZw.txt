My husband and I decided to give Nacho Daddy a try and catch the Cards game at the bar. When we walked in we were greeted right away by the host, he was very observant and saw we were wearing gear for the Cardinals game and sent us straight towards the bar and big screens. The bar wasn't very crowded so it was easy to find a seat. The bartender Anya was the best! I was having some trouble finding a beer on tap I wanted, they didn't have my #9 or Stella. Anya gave me a couple samples of what they did have on top and I found a local beer that was just delirious. Others at the bar were going on and on about their delicious margaritas, and how you only need one! There tequila selection is HUGE!! We ordered some steak nachos, they were very good. The bar back Roberto was very friendly and  quick to help in any way he could. They switched the TV in front of us to our game, which my husband was very happy about. The prices are a little on the high side, and the bathroom could be cleaned more often. This is why I gave 4 rather than 5 stars. Overall, this was a good experience with a fun environment and happy employees.
