My wife & I met my parents for dinner at Blue Adobe looking for something different we haven't tried before.  We met at 6 p.m. on a Saturday night and were seated promptly.  Alex was our waitress on this night and she was awesome!  She always made sure our glasses were full and checked back on us from time to time.  We started out with the complimentary chips and their homemade fire roasted salsa that was killer.  I had a frothy strawberry margarita to start with and it was blended perfectly.  it was so good I had 2!  For dinner I was in the mood for a steak so I had the Jala Holla Steak.  it was a beef tenderloin served with a jalapeno hollandaise sauce, shrimp enchilada, rice and beans.  The steak was cooked medium and was perfectly tender.  You could cut it with a butter knife, seriously it was that tender.  I would order this again.  It was a perfect balance of flavors.  For dessert all of us at the table split this plate with a flattened sopapilla filled with cooked cinnamon apples and vanilla ice cream.  Very good and very big.  It's a dessert built for 2+.  We will be back.  They have a nice patio where you can eat at that I would love to sit at next time we go.
