My daughter introduced me to this place.  I can not comment on much.  We sat in the bar, very nice bar.  Several seating choices, tall tables, bar and couches.  The service was excellent.  Started with the free chips and salsa.  There were 3 salsa, mild, med and hot.  We shared the steak fajitas.  VERY Good, good flavor and along with green peppers there was also red peppers, yum.  Came with sour cream and guac, extremely good guacamole.  I like cheese on my fajitas so next time I will have to ask for that.  My daughter said they have really good enchiladas so I am looking forward to trying them.
