My family stopped in for a quick bite yesterday afternoon before running some errands. My parents and friend had been here before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so they were stoked it was open. The location is very convenient on the Strip right across the street from the old Stardust.

The tacos al pastor were delicious, and for $2.10 each, they're a little higher than other taquerias, but much less than a full-service restaurant. There are different stations at the counter that you go up to based on what's type of meat you want - everything from carne asada and al pastor to sesos, lengua, and cabeza.

I appreciated the plate of cebollitas (grilled green onions) and grilled peppers that came with the food. And there was a station to grab as
Many radishes and lime wedges that you want! I don't often see Orange Bang in many places nowadays, so we were stoked to get some here.
