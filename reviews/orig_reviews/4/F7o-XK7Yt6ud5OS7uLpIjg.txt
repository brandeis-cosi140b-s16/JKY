I'm giving this 4 stars but really somewhere around 3.5 - 3.75, thus the upgrade. 

Went here during a business trip. $5 happy hour margaritas weren't bad. Coworker had the cascabel ribeye and I had the Camaraones Esconidos (shrimp stuffed chicken breast w/ chipotle wine sauce). I thought my meal was pretty good...loved the sauce but very disappointed there were only two shrimp for the "stuffed" portion.  My coworker said his ribeye was far from his expectations. The menu overall looked good. I'd go back again and have that same chicken dish or try something new.
