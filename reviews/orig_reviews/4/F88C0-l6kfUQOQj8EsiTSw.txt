I made reservations via their answering machine for a Tuesday evening 7pm.  No need, the place was empty, thus, the service was great!  We enjoyed the coconut shrimp and the yummy salads that accompanied the shrimp.  The hangar steak was cooked perfectly to order, and the rib-eye was just excellent!!!!  No left-overs.  We decided against dessert because we were the only diners at this point and the staff was leaving for the evening.  I would go back, and really want to try the brunch menu.
