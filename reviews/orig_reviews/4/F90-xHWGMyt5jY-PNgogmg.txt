Cleanliness: 4 stars
This establishment is clean but not spotless, the restrooms have a clean appearance but a small odor to it. The outdoor dining area doesn't have a trash can and people seem to just leave their waste on the tables.

Hospitality: 4 Stars
The employees were kind, and made eye contact while I placed my order. However, it appears they are understaffed or lacked leadership as most were quick to the point with customers but openly joking amongst one another at the expense of the customer. 

Food: 3 stars
Consistent with quality, and flavor. Only draw back is the food isn't as good for take out. The dishes seem to get cold fast and needed to be reheated. 

Overall: 4 stars
Be prepared to be patient in line, and double check your order. The food is worth some of the shenanigans that seem to be normal with this restaurant.
