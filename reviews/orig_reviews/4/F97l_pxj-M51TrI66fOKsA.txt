Juan's Flaming Fajitas is a surprising great dining experience that is only 8 miles from my apartment. Don't know how I missed it and or never heard about it till last night.

First pyromaniacs will love this place! The name "Flaming Fajitas"  is well deserved and quite frankly and understatement. When they bring your Fajitas out the server ignites the dish and the flames shoot 3 to 4 feet into the air! 

The food was top notch fresh and flavorful. The only negative experience of the entire night was in relationship to their cheese dish I ordered to go along with my chips. It had to be cut with a knife and fork and couldn't be spooned up by a nacho chip. It had great flavor but I won't order it again as it was to much effort for chips and dip.

The wait staff was great, drinks were never more than half empty, the complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip was similarly filled whenever they appeared low. We had one main waiter but he was getting help from everyone else on the staff and he was helping out the other waiters and their tables. It would appear they are a highly functional unit that wasn't worried about sharing their tables tips. Simply stated it was a true pleasure to dine here.

You could read that and guess it was a slow night but no, there was only one maybe two empty tables in the entire restaurant. 

If you live near or far you must come experience this dining experience its something you will not regret!
