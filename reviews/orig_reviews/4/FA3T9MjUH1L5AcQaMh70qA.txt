Haven't been to Red Rock in a while and was pleasantly surprised to find this place. We lucked out and it was still Happy Hour - we had shrimp, chicken, and carne asada tacos (these were our fav).  Also indulged in some chicken nachos and flan for dessert! However, can we talk about the MARGARITAS!!!! Strawberry, guava, blueberry, and pineapple...if I had it my way we would've ordered every drink on the menu. With some yummy spices on the glass-these were everything. 

We will for sure be back! Can't wait to explore more of the menu.
