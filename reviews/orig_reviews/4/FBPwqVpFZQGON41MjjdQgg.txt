can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?

let's pay our respect for the carne asada. 

what is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else. 

we wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada. 

the friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco. 

i thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here. 

my recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.

they are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods.
