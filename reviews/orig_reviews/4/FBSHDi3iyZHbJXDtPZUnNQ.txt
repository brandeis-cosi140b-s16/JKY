Great food and great service. My wife and I ate here last year and made sure to come back on this trip. 
We had dinner with our niece and her family. 
I ordered the Steak Ranchero and my wife ordered the nachos appetizer. My wife forgot jst how much food they give u. Even with an appetizer. She couldn't eat half of it. 
My Steak Ranchero was so good. Some one here knows how to do a steak. It was tender and juicy. As usual when we have eaten here in the past we were stuffed. 
If ur in the Las Vegas area. Get off the strip and eat here!
