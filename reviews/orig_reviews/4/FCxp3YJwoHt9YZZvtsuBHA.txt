We decided on Mexican food tonight and chose this place because of Yelp ratings and distance (only 10 minutes away). 

I thought I had typed in the address wrong in my GPS because it directed us to the "Sapphire Gentlemens' Club" (fancy term for a strip club). We passed it up and pulled into the next lot. I called the restaurant to confirm where they are. They said, "We're in the same location as "Sapphire's". Okee Dokee. I'm taking my wife and daughter to a STRIP CLUB? Uhhhh, no. But, sure enough, it was right there. NEXT to the club. I can't think of too many more awkward locations for a nice restaurant.

Food wasn't bad, better than El Torito, for sure. Flan was excellent. My wife loved it and she's a real flan lover.
