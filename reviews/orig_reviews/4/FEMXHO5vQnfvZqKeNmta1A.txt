recommended by my daughter-in-law as she lives in that area. Was great food! Great service. the beer was cold. when we went it was a bit slow, as it was between lunch and dinner. they have a lot of tequila's, over 100, so you can taste and test to find your favorite. as it was lunch, we passed on the tequila. will go back. (on negative thing, and i'm just being picky here, the plastic frame that held the daily specials on the table... ours was dirty, really needed a good wipe down)
