The food was wonderful, we ordered the homemade chips with guacamole and they were the best ever! The only problem we had was not with the food but with the noise, terribly loud. The wait staff uses carts and they are very noisy and since the floor is concrete and tile the noise just bounces off them. This is difficult for conversation, especially if anyone in your group has even a slight hearing problem.
