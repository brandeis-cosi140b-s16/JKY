4.5 stars for what it is and this is only my first time and i haven't tried their homemade empanadas or arepas .. got the dollar tacos on Taco Tuesday, beef and shredded chicken and they were great.. checked in for free tortilla chips but i would suggest to queso dip with them. Also got an Inca Cola from Peru and a Corona
