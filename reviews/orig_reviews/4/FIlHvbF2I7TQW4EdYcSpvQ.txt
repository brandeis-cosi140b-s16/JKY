Love this place! Came here the first time for my dad's birthday at the original location on East blvd. knocked one star off because the original location was way better. Not digging the shopping center feel. Loved the enchilada, fish and pork tacos, queso fundido and guac amazing. The burger was even delicious. I doubt you'll walk away unsatisfied. In the mood for Mexican check them out!
