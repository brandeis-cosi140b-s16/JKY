Came in for a quick late night bite. The restaurant has a beautiful modern yet Mexican influence type of ambiance. Very inviting! Started off with the El Pi√±a Diablo! Pineapple and chili infused tequila with fresh sour and pineapple. Spicy yet refreshing! Cocktails are also generous in size so not bad for the price! The bartender strongly agreed with my dinner choice of fish tacos. So glad that's what I ordered! The mahi mahi was fresh and light yet crispy and covered in a delicious slaw with avocado. Portion was quite large and came with an overly tasty side of rice and beans! So happy I stopped here on my last night in Scottsdale! Even if you aren't staying at the Fairmont it is definitely worth the visit!
