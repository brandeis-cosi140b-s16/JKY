NEVER, NEVER BUY A TAMALE FROM LOS COMPADRES.  NEVER.  They are all dough an no filling.  They are a disgrace to Mexican food.  I have had the same experience year after year. Tonight I gave them one more chance.  It was my FINAL tamale from this restaurant, never, never again.  NOW AS TO THE REST OF THE FOOD from Los Compadres is outstanding.  It is consistently good, and I will continue to eat food from their restaurant, just not their tamales.  How they can make such superb Mexican food and as the same time make such rotten tamales is beyond me.
