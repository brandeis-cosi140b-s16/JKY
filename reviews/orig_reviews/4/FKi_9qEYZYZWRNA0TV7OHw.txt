How about a special holiday update on this place.  As you can see they have redeemed their self, at least a little bit with my most recent visit.

I was craving a Gobblerito, and this being the closest location to where I live, I begrudgingly came here.  I am happy to report, I survived and I was left with a better taste in my mouth (now, was that pun intended?).

I am not sure if it was where we were seated this time (I requested the booth), the server (so much more attentive, she heard everything we said), or if it were the overall experience that made this time so much better.

We started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  I also ordered a draft.  What I thought was going to start a downhill slip started with this draft.  The one I ordered just happened to kick the keg halfway filling up the glass.  Our server, Caitlin was her name, assured me that they were checking to see if they had another keg, if they did not, she would be back to ask if I wanted anything else.  I was thinking to myself, "great, here we go again," however, she returned with a full glass of my draft, with that, we were over our little hiccup for the evening (another pun).

Everything came out perfect after that.  My Gobblerito was amazing.  Who can argue with Thanksgiving food being stuffed inside a burrito and topped with gravy?  Three good slices of turkey, a serving of stuffing, a serving of mashed potatoes with black beans and some corn stuffed oh so lovingly into a huge burrito.  Top it with a hot serving of gravy, a side of cranberry sauce stuff, and you have your Thanksgiving early.  

My friends, I must warn y'all, This is a limited time item on their menu.  As I write this, I believe you only are able to get it for the next two days.  So RUN, don't walk to your nearest Mad Mex and enjoy this delectable item while you can!
