For a brunch munch, Cantina Laredo delivers a tasty Mexican food punch! 

While in search of a place, the free Mimosas or Blood Marie attracted my friends' and my attention. As dubious as a lure sounds, the food was delicious! We ordered chorizo con huevos, carne asda y huevos, and huevos rancheros. Just like the menu suggested, we really thought we were just getting eggs and a bit of meat. To our surprise, the plentiful platter came with delicious sweet white bread, potatoes with melted cheese, and syrup-soaked sun-ripen fruit. Needless to say we were stuffed.

The sweet bread is a crowd-pleaser. If only I had my hands on that recipe. And another kicker? This place is a chain. We thought, "No way!" Too bad it is not in California, yet. The tasty food really knocked my taste buds out of my tongue!
