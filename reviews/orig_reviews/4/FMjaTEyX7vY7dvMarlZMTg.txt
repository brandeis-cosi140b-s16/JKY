Went there before Garth Brooks concert. I thought the food was excellent... loved the empanadas with delicious rice and beans and homemade tortilla chips. I would have given 5 stars but service was hurried... did not get acknowledged right away, obvious short-staffed and slow to get orders. They must know there was a huge sold out concert starting at 7pm that night right across the street, right? I would go there again despite slow service because the food was so yummy.
