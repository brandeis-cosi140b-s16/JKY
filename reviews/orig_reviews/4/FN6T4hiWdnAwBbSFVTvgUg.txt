After my 3rd visit, I figure I owe this place a review. I originally discovered this place one Sunday afternoon while in search of a bad-ass margarita. Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! The cocktail list, or rather, Margarita list is awesome. I usually don't care for new twists on classic cocktails, but these guys got it right. I suggest the "Firestarter" a vodka martini w/ fresh muddled Jalapenos, it's aptly named. And their newest addition, "the Ruslty El Camino" which is essentially a classic margarita w/ blood orange puree. Their tacos are awesome, even if you don't eat meat: check out their whitefish taco, or their calamari taco, they both rock. Bonus points: I took a vegan, and there were numerous options, all of which she enjoyed. It's hidden in South Park, so I've never had to wait for a table, and they play great music: lots of Wilco, Johnny Cash, and even a little Drive By Truckers. Great, now I'm hungry.
