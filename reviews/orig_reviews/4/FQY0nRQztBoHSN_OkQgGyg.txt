Great Mexican is here.

I like that they offer two complimentary salsas: spicy and regular.  The spicy was a little too peppery for my taste.

I liked their guacamole, but it could have used a bit more salt.

The chicken chimichanga was delish.  It wasn't too greasy.  The side of beans were creamy, yum!

It is a nice big restaurant, so the wait isn't too long.  The restaurant is nice and clean, but the bathrooms could use a little TLC.  It smelled like old fish.

Our server was prompt with our orders and answered all of our questions.  This food is great!
