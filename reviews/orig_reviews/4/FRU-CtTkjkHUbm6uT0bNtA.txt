This turned out to be such a delightful surprise/experience was not starving but had my heart set on small plates and a drink or two and this place delivered just that. We got a cozy spot right next to the fireplace and some dirttyyy martinis to start things out. The vibe here is very chill and laid back. I likey. We tried some shrimp, calamari, bruschetta, lettuce wraps and my boo went for the open faced burger. I LOVED the lettuce wraps. my style for sure. Everything was tasty and flavorful and hit the spot. 

Not crazy expensive either. that's always a +
