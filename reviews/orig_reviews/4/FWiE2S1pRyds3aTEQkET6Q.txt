So good! Chinese/Asian AND Mexican!?!? Great combo!

I stopped here twice in one weekend for the same dish. Everyone I was with was very satisfied as well. Both times I ordered the Dan Dan Mian and loved every minute of it. Two of the guys I was with ordered the Chilaquiles con Chorizo and said it may have been the best Chilaquiles they've ever had. That's saying a lot from a guy that has lived his whole life in San Diego.

I know that most of the places in the Cosmopolitan but this place is definitely affordable and worth it!
