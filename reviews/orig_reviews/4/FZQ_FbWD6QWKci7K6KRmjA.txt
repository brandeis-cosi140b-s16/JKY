The fish in the fish taco was grilled, not fried (which is usually how I prefer my fish tacos). And while it was well-cooked (meaning not dry), overall it was a bit too salty for me. But I certainly can't say it was lacking in flavor.

Now the carnitas taco was fantastic. It was delicious. Great texture, great flavor... just a great experience in general. They don't overcomplicate anything. It's the tortilla, the carnitas, and the usual onions, cilantro, and hot sauce. Just enjoy.

Mind you, we came here immediately after having eaten at another restaurant (the fourth restaurant out of five we hit that day), and even on a full stomach, this taco was still that good.
