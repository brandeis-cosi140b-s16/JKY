Thanks to all the Cats that reviewed this spot... Yeah it rocks. As the food hits your lips & the flavors saturate your mouth you'll realize that this place is a hidden gem. I live just a few blocks away and had no clue to what I was missing. Thanks Yelp & thanks to my Bartender Genessa, she did a great job.
