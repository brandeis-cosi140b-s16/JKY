Good burgers and fries - kinda like one step above In n Out.
I haven't tried the tacos or shakes, but I definitely will next time (salted carmel dulce de leche...were they reading my mind???). 
We went inside to order around 11:30 on a weekday, and it was medium busy. Our food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered.
Prices are ~$5.50 for a cheeseburger, $3 for fries, so it's on par with a 5 Guys or something similar. For the same price and the same quality, I'd much rather support a locally-owned business.
