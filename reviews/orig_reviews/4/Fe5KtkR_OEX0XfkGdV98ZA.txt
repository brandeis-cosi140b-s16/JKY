service = great. super attentive but not bothersome. all the staff were friendly. originally we were told it would be a 45 minutes wait (understandable for a friday night), but were called after maybe 20. it wouldn't have mattered if we had to wait the full length of time because the patio is cool and comfy and we were immediately served chips, salsa and waters.

drinks = fantastic! loved my blood orange marg, but i was lusting after my boyfriend's pineapple mojito. so. good.

food = excellent. we tried the veggie, crispy fish, shrimp, braised beef and carnitas tacos and all were great. we also got rice and beans for our sides and split an order of the mexican street corn as well. highlights were the crispy fish, braised beef and the street corn!

vibe = super hip and trendy. i liked the decor and the bathrooms had cool sink knobs (i'm weird and always judge restaurant bathrooms).
