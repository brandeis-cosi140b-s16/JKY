Not sure why this place is getting all these bad reviews! I've been here multiple times and the food has been consistent and my orders have come out pretty quick. When I come here I typically just get tacos, and while they're not very big, they're packed full with meat. I eat a lot and I usually feel full after 2 or 3 tacos. I've been trying different meats each time I come so I can find the one I like best. So far my favorite is Al Pastor (marinated pork). They are open 24 hrs, but I have only come for lunch so I can't say how the crowds are late at night. During lunch, and especially on the weekends, I've seen nearly all the tables full here. So again, I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place...
