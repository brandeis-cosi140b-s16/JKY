Stopped in at Cabo Wabo for a drink and a snack later in the afternoon this past Sunday. The hostess was at first a bit morose in informing us that it would be a five minute wait for a table, which for my friend and I was hardly depressing news! We were accordingly seated in minutes - at a corner patio table no less - and our server was a dear. Double thumbs up on the excellent chips and guac. The beef quesadilla was also good, albeit small...our server did warn us in advance that it wasn't a hearty plate. I'd be happy to return!
