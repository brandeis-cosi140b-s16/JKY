Been going here after meetings at school since it opened couple year ago and this place is still the business. Theres great food holla at the carne asada nahos boommb.. great beer/tequila selections $5 buckets of corona whaaat? great atmosphere the wooden benches are a nice touch. hot sauce is legit! it's a 2oz shot of homemade habanero sauce, handle with care! location is great right across the street from the Union and most of all theres great ownership. ron really takes pride in his small business and it definitely shows. I've also watched UFC fights, seen live bands play, open mic nights, comedy nights, hiphop nights, and theres parties also. Bring $10 MAX and you friend just had a great time.
