I love coming to this place! I live really close and when this place first opened I had to check it out because I was attracted by their whole set up. I usually come here to have a few drinks with some friends at the bar when we want to just sit and talk somewhere not to crowded.
Music is good and so is the food! All the times I been here it was great service and I'll definitely keep coming back
