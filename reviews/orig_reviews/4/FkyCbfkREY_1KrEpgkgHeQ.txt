Just stopped in for some late night street tacos. First time here, so my boyfriend and I decided to sample all three. I had the chicken taco & the veggie. I was excited by the amount of meat in the chicken taco, but the flavor was bizarre. It had a sweet, cinnamon flavor that I didn't like. The veggie was awesome! Hearty & spicy with quinoa, black beans and tons of flavor. My boyfriend tried the braised short rib taco and he loved it. It was very savory and packed with meat. I'm sure we will be back to satisfy those late night munchies. Oh, and the drive-thru only took 5 mins. Not bad.
