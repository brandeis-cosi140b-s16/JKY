It's hard to impress me with Mexican food outside of Texas but this place did just that. The place is well run by an excellent general manager named Rafael. The professional that served my table gave great suggestions on what to try (the shaved elotes was NICE!) and the energy of the place was strong. We found this place on our way to another restaurant and decided to take a detour. Glad we did.
