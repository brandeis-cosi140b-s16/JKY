This is becoming a must do on each trip.  Once again we ordered a quartet of adobada (spicy pork) tacos topped with crema, cilantro, pineapple and onion.  I requested a complimentary side order of grilled peppers and scallions plus we shared a pina colada flavored soft drink.  The $10 face value of our KSHP certificate covered our lunch.
