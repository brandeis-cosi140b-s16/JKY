The Barbacoa was awesome! Very tender...cooked in a banana leaf for hours...it was just falling apart and i could eat it with just my fork. The sides were good too...some flavored rice, and black beans. The signature margarita drink was very good, not too sweet. The Mexican flan was OK. I could have skipped that.
