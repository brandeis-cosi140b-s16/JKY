On a whim, we decided to try Baja Joe's. I was slightly skeptical as the shopping center it is in is old and houses a thrift store and some other oddities. However,  upon walking i was surprised to see how spacious the bar area and dining room were. The bar area had lots of tables ranging from high tops to big banquet tables. There was also a ton of flat screens and a darts game. 

We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted by  of the many bartenders. She was quite friendly and helped with my indecisiveness with my drink order. I got a Corona-Rita, a margarita with a baby corona in it. It was huge and well made; not overly sweet or too strong. For food, I got a 3 item combo so I could t one ry a variety of items. It had a grilled fish taco, shrimp taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. Both tacos were amazing; they were fresh and had a ton of flavor. The cheese enchilada was oozing with cheese and the red sauce was slight spicy and not sweet like canned enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were on point, which is indicative of a good Mexican restaurant in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered two beef tacos, which were braised in some type of sauce making the meat tender and delicious.

One of the owners was helping clear tables and asked how things were. I told him it was our first time and it was a good one. He was happy to hear and gave us a coupon to use for next time. Such great customer service. 

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise and I can see myself frequenting here often and you should to.
