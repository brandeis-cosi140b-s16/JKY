One of the hidden gems on the North side of Las Vegas. It's located near a cute area that looks like it's near a mini townsquare :) The food is awesome and the dips for the tortilla chips are amazing. The service was good but it took awhile for our water to be refilled and it took a while for our hot sauce to come to our table. We were already almost done with our meals by the time our server came to give us hot sauce. Other than that, we had a good experience.
