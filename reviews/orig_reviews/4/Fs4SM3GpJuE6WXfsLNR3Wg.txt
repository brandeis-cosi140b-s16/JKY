Excellent Burritos and tortillas.

I had a Chorizo/Egg/Potato/Bean and a Green Chile and they were both super-tasty.  $7.98 total.

The chorizo is different in a GOOD way than what I have had elsewhere in town.  The spices they use give it almost a "signature" taste.  A lot different than most I have had, possibly the tastiest.   It's easy to see why they sell the chorizo uncooked for people to take home - they know they have a winner on their hands.

The green chile is very good too, and very close to Rito's flavor, which I have always considered the best green chile burro in town.  Rito's burros are a little bigger than these though.

I'm going with a big-time thumbs up on Carolina's, a solid 4.5 stars.

Can't wait to go back.....:)

P.S.  UPDATE !!!
After going for breakfast here about 10 out of the last 11 weekends, I still LOVE this place.  I normally now eat the Chorizo Tostada for breakfast, and get one of the burritos to take home - any flavor is good.  HOWEVER, I tried one item today that was sub-par and I'd like to warn people about.  The Hard Taco was not good AT ALL.  First, it was one of those taco shells which is not crunchy, and not soft, but kinda.....stretchy?  The meat was shredded beef, and it was greasy with no apparent seasonings.  Quite unexpected from a place where SO many things are GREAT.  Anyway, stay away from THAT one item, but everything else I have tried is great.

P.S. UPDATE NUMBER 2:  
The best time to eat at Carolina's is on Saturday.  They have the "Menudo Fixins" put out for you to use:  Chopped cilantro, chopped green and white onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and lemon wedges.  You don't have to eat menudo to use these fixins, and I like to put them on my tostadas or burros and it really takes the flavors to another plateau.  A must-do.
