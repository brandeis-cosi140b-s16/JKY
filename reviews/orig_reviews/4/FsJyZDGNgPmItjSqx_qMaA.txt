Good start to our trip.

T&T was our first meal in Vegas after checking in to the Luxor.  Reviews were a little low, so we hadn't planned on eating here, but we wanted something quick and convenient and gave it a try.  
We started with an order of guacamole which seemed freshly made and was very good (large portion was more than my wife and I could finish with a meal).  The salsas that came with our chips was also good - chipotle and verde.
I ordered the combos tacos, which came with barbacoa, carnitas, and chicken.   They were very good and really had a lot of flavor (the chicken seemed bland next to the others).  My wife ordered a different variety of pork tacos which were very good also.
The only negative was that the beans and rice that came with our meals were a little dry and bland.

Overall, we enjoyed the experience and atmosphere.  I would recommend to anyone staying in the Luxor looking for an easy meal.
