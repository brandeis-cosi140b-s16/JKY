Stopped in for Happy Hour, it was an early one, I think their specials are from 4-5:30pm. We just wanted a little snack so we ordered the Papas con Queso...waffle fries smothered with a yummy red sauce, cheese and cream...and they were fantastic! Our little snack turned into a little more though with the complimentary chips and salsa trio they brought out, which we weren't expecting. Salsas were okay but the chips were really good. 
Total bill with the one beer my husband had was $10. Will definitely be back again!
