My husband and I had dinner here this past weekend for the first time. We had been wanting to try it, but hadn't gotten around to it. We are glad we finally took the time to have dinner here. It was really good.  The tacos were fabulous, the margaritas were good and the choices of salsa were great. The service is a little slow, so if you're in a hurry pick another time to visit this wonderful establishment. I definitely will be returning and bringing friends and family!
