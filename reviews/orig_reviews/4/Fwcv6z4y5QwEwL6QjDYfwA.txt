Finally a good mexican restaurant in Summerlin!  So happy that they didn't try and do what all the other failed mexican restaurants did around here by trying to be fancy with their weird dishes and offerings.  

The blue corn chicken enchiladas with green sauce is spot on calie√±te...great stuff!  Knew this place was gonna be good as soon as I dug into the salsa. The refried beans and the arroz is perfectly seasoned. Ordered tacos a la carte...disappointed with chef using pre-made taco shells...c 'mon man!  The fillings and salsa were yummy, so saved it...make the shells by hand...customers will appreciate it more.  

Going back for lunch this week!
