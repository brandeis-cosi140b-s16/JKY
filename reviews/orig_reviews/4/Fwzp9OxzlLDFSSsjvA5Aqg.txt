Wife and I went here for happy hour - I ordered a classic margarita and a maple whisky cocktail (the name of the latter drink is lost on me), she ordered a non-happy hour mojito, and we split a tres leches cake (which we ordered later into our time at the restaurant). Service was prompt - we were seated immediately, by friendly employees. The waiter was very attentive - was proactive about bringing us water after I had finished my first round of drinks - a very nice plus. Drinks were fine - nothing special, and on the weaker side, but still good. Waiter asked us multiple time whether we wanted to put in food, which, being from New York felt a little pushy, but it was also towards the end of the night, so it probably had to more to do with the place closing soon, than being pushy. Anyway, we ordered dessert towards closing, a tres leches cake, which was again, was good, but not necessarily the best tres leches cake ever. For the hour we were there between 10 to close at 11pm, it was nice to sit by the fake venetian canal, enjoy some solid drinks, talk and relax. It's a worthy place to relax in the late evening, especially if you aren't trying to get drunk.
