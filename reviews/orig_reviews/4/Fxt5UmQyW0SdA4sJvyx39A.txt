Went here on the suggestion from Georgie M, a fellow yelper..   Man was he right.. these Taco's and Quesadilla's are great !   The El Pastor Quesadilla I had was very tasty.. not overwhelming.. not your normal "mexican food".    fresh ingredients with limes and vegetables...  REAL "Street Style" Mexican Food...  not something smothered in cheese and a flag stuck in it.   Happy Hour to boot.  The store was nicely decorated and very clean.  open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared..  The quac and salsa was wonderful.   You want some real mexcian food at a great price and a cold pacifico to go with it.. here's your spot.   interesting location too.. easy to find.. right off the 101 in a little strip mall.  This is an amazing success story and their story is right on the wall..
