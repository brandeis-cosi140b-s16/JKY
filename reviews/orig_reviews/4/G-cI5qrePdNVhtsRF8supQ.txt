This Chipotle is like most others you go to. The staff welcomes you as you walk through the door, the helpings are plentiful and you will be full walking out the door. 

On this visit I got the burrito bowl. I could only eat half of it they put so much good food in there. Be carful about hitting the lunch rush as indoor seating is limited. There is a nice patio outside for the cooler Vegas days.

Don't forget the chips and guacamole while you are there, that's one of my favorite snacks.
