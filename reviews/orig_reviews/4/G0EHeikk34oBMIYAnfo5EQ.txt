When I think about what a taco palace should be, this is it. Huge, delicious selection of tacos, a salsa bar and a pretty decent craft brew list.

The tacos are served on two thin white corn tortillas and topped so high it's hard to eat  with a fork or spilling all over yourself. I just ordered two tacos (without the sides) and was plenty full. This was a great stop before heading to One Barrel Brewing, which is two doors down.
