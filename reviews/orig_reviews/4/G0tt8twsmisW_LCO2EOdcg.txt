UPDATE:

If you like food that will burn your mouf a little bit and make your face sweat, go with the Bombero burrito.

I went back the day after my 3-star review (see below) and had a carne asada Bombero to go.

Not for the Wimpy Of Mouf.

VERY.  SPICY.

And I'm not a heat wimp.  I'm the person in my circles known as the "he likes it HOT" guy.

Living in AZ since 1995, I've only been to three places in AZ which have dishes hot enough to burn me and make my face sweat:

1.  Los Dos Molinos.
2.  Arriba (the side order of Hatch chiles - dare you to try the whole thing at once).
3.  Now, the Bombero from Los Taquitos.

I hereby improve the ranking from 3 to 4 stars based solely on the heat and tastiness of the Bombero, so take that for what it's worth.
