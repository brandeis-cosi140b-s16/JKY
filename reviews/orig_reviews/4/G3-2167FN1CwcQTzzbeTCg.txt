We were in Phoenix on our way from the Grand canyon on our way to visit family in Tucson. We looked for restaurants using our car navi system.  We found this little place and we a little our of the way to try. We loved it. The food is very spicy, but love the heat.  The last time we were in Phoenix we wanted to eat there again but they were on vacation. We definitely hit this place next time we are in Phoenix  .
