My first experience at Old Town Tortilla Factory was nearly 11 years ago and this place is just as good as ever.  I hosted a large group dinner (120+ people) in May and we thoroughly enjoyed a buffet dinner sitting under the lights and stars of the beautiful patio.  The food was great - just the right amount of spice and flavor, the staff was efficient and friendly and the atmosphere was great.
