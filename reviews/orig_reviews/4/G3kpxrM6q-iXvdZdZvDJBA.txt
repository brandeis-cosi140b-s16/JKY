Healthy Mexican food- sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it?
With a name like Frijoles, I was expecting canned refried beans and other quintessentially unhealthy Mexican dishes here but was pleasantly surprised!

Interior of this former Pizza Hut is totally transformed with upscale seating and lighting fixtures and some Aztec decor, and piped-in music fits perfectly with the ambiance here. Wish they had to space to add in a patio!

Menu is simple: tacos, burritos, nachos, and various other dishes, pick your meats, plus additional sides (ELOTE!) and drinks (AGUAS FRESCAS!)

Initially came in for just a snack- got the lengua nachos, street corn, and a watermelon agua fresca. Both were delicious and fresh, and I really appreciated how the nachos were not drowned in cheese but remained relatively light with pinto beans, guac, and pico de gallo. Loved the corn! Prefer it chopped off the cob but flavors were spot on.

Owner came out to introduce himself and tell us about his new place. In addition to amazing aguas, he also does juices- gave us samples of the pineapple, the strawberry, chia, and spinach. 
My next visit, I'm going to try to convince him to start bottling and selling his juices for home consumption- they were delicious and all-natural with no additives, and the guy is really knowledgeable about juicing and nutrition.

This place isn't what you expect- in a GOOD way!
EDIT: Have since returned for many aguas frescas, tacos, and quesadillas. Some of the best fresh-Mex in Vegas. Consistently high quality, good portions and prices, always stellar service.
