Friendly staff.  Although I had only a couple beers and chips/salsa, I had a great time.  Very good to take a break from the Vegas heat during the day.  Evenings are fun when I've stopped in the past.  Will definitely stop by again!  Look for 2for1 drink coupons and other deals!  Great location too!
