Well, I've only been here once, but I was pleasantly surprised. The food and staff were excellent. We had a late breakfast at the bar and the food was excellent. They have pretty good margaritas too. They had some confusing 2 for 1 special on the margaritas and I thought we got screwed on it. When I questioned the bartender she offered to give us free drinks to make up for it, even though we misunderstood the special. How can you complain about free drinks?!?! Especially at a place that's a little pricey. The bartender even changed the TV channel, when someone complained, agreeing with them that the show was awful. Be warned: Mariachi bands play here. This place looks like a very trendy spot, but I found the bartenders to be down to earth. (A lot of the time they just want to talk to someone not trying to hit on them.) Anyway, it's a tiny place, thank God it replaced that shit-hole La Salsa. Anyway, give it a try, I was extremely pleased and will definitely visit again. It's a fun area to sit in as well, in the pyramid's upper level. Ole!
