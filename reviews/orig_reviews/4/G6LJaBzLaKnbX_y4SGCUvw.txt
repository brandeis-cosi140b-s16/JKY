I'm Vegan and my girlfriend isn't. We were able to order easily off of the menu AND absolutely L-O-V-E-D the tacos. The plantain chips were good and I was grateful they weren't already salted.

The beer and spirits menu was infinite. I must go back to try some. Great prices for the quality and flavor. The atmosphere is young, fun and LOUD so don't go here unless you're ok almost shouting at each other indoors.

I recommend #13 Tofu Nuez on the menu...DIVINE!
