It was very easy to find this place when you walk in downtown Tempe, the patio settings stands out and make this place looks really cozy at night. I love their outdoor and indoor bar, but it gets too crowded on weekend so be prepare if you want to go to this place on Friday and Saturday cause the bar is packed! The dinner table on the other hand is convenient if you just want to have a relax dining experience while watching a big screen projector TV and listen to the house music (it gets louder during night time). Their steak tacos and ribs are great! I believe it was one of the best steak tacos that I have eat in the valley (so far), and the ribs just delicate with the tempting BBQ sauce. What unique about this bar that was unforgettable for me is their hand soap bottle, they use ketchup bottle and it just makes me wondering what's with the ketchup bottle! Overall, if I need a place to chill out with romantic lighting atmosphere, this definitely gonna be one of the place that I keep in mind.
