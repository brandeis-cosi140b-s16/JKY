Wife and I had a craving for Mexican food for lunch today so we decided to try Frank & Fina's which we'd noticed on a couple of occasions while in the area. The restaurant is quite attractive, much better than you'd expect from the exterior.

We ordered a nachos to share and I ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos, both in soft corn tortillas.

The first thing that arrived were the chips and salsa - I see a lot of love for their salsa on Yelp, however I found it tasted almost exactly like "Diablo" style pasta sauce and every bite sent me flashing back to the last time I lazily poured half a jar of the stuff over a plate full of hastily prepared rigatoni. Chips were good and the salsa was clearly prepared with care, just not to my taste at all.

The nachos were quite light and pleasant and provided a nice grazing option while waiting for our meals.

When the tacos arrived I was pleased. The carnitas were delicious and crispy in parts and the asada was cooked to delicious perfection. About the only improvement I could suggest for these tacos would be some element to combat them being just a tiny bit dry, perhaps some guacamole or sour cream as standard. Luckily I had some left over with the nachos and this complimented them well.

Service was great throughout and overall I really enjoyed my meal here.
