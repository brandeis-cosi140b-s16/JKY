After months of the daily running route right past Gallo Blanco.....we made it to Gallo Blano Cafe a few weeks ago. 

Although it was crowded, and a 20 min wait, the hostess was a sweet young gal who checked on us a few times while we waited. Each time, apologizing for the wait. No worries, the Prickly Pear Margarita held me over.  

Loved the fact that we could order a combination of tacos (LOVE the shrimp and tuna), fresh guacamole and chips along with a few more drinks and leave with a bill less than $40!  We sat at the back "bar" which looked directly into the kitchen but it worked for us. 

Since this review has taken me a while to complete (ooops!), we have been back two more times. Each time, we rave the entire way home about how much we like GB.  Sad to hear they could no longer use the logo!
