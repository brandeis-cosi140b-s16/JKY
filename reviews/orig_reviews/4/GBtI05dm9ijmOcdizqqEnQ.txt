I just tried this place for lunch today and it was fantastic.  The guacamole was so fresh and chunky, the tostadas were crisp, the tacos were super flavorful, and the service was great.  I can't wait to go back at night when I can try one of the margaritas with their huge selection of tequila (seriously, it, like, takes up the whole back page of their menu).
