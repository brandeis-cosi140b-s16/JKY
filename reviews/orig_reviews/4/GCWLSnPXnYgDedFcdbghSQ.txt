I can't give five stars purely because I haven't physically been there, I've only had take out through work. So I can't say how the service is but the food is amazing!! It was very Chipotle style but with enchiladas. I love that you can do call ahead orders very practical for being in downtown phoenix next to a ton of business. I recommend checking it out, ASAP I loved it!!
