Location: Horrible location, but worth going there for the food.

Food: I think I've tried it all. Everything I've had there is amazing and worth trying.

Cleanliness: This is where I dock them a star. I've ate inside a few times, but it is pretty dirty.

Overall: Great people watching. You will see people show up in expensive cars, followed by construction workers. It is nice seeing all the people enjoying their food.

Note:
Get the black beans!
