I went on Taco Tuesday (also "industry" night) so the place was extremely busy.  I had a reservation so my party and I were seated right away.  The 3 of us squeezed into what is essentially a 2-top with a wrap-around banquette.  The seating in general is extremely tight and the noise level was ridiculous.  I'm was actually quite hoarse the next day.  The food was very good to excellent and the margaritas were done just right.  The servers (we were tag-teamed) were quite good and did make some worthy recommendations but they were definitely trying to rush us to free up the table.  Speaking of that tiny table,  your plate is extremely small and the serving dishes are long and thin.  Trying to fit everything on that table is like doing a jigsaw puzzle.  The interior design is not well though-out, to say the least.  If you don't come on taco tuesday/ industry night (50% off everything for stations employees), you will pay an arm and a leg for the food.  That food is authentic Mexican so don't expect tex mex. I almost took off a star for the aforementioned problems but, in the end, the food won out over the decibel level.  I would come back for lunch on any day other than tuesday. Dinner would require more food and therefore lots more spending so that's not something I would consider.  I cannot understand the multitude of bad reviews that criticize the food.  Obviously this is subjective but you can't condemn the food because you don't understand it.  The servers ask DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MENU?  To the confused diners: THAT would be the time to speak up!  If you don't like something, send it back.  Better yet, go to a tex mex chain restaurant and order a combo platter.
