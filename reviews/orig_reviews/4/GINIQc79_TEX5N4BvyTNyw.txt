Five hungry travelers, having spent the day in Sedona, embarked upon a journey in search of Mexican fare. Apple, the God of Technology, worked its magic and through the power of Yelp, we founds this place. 

We were imediately seated, surprising for a Saturday night and promptly received some tasty chips and salsa.  Our wonderful server, Jose, recommended the Boss Margarita, which 3 of us tried and agreed was "boss". My sister tried the black cherry sangria (served frozen), was like a cherry shake. 

We all really enjoyed our meals, my seafood relleno with just a bit of heat and sweet;  the fajitas were flavorful - quite a treat and the the chimmichunga was downright awesome. 

We mentioned to our server the Yelp coupon - the manager, James, stopped over to tell us this was a new promotion and shared the scoop on the renvoation. New tile, new ceiling and new artwork - Robert Shields (Shields and Young of 70's fame). 

When this weary traveler finds her way back to this area, this place is first on my list.
