Tex-Mex??? who called this tex-mex?  It is not.  It is Baja-style food with a Baja-style surrounding.  And the prices are awesome.  We looked around at other menus at restaurants on Mill and were amazed at the outlandish pricing on food...then we stumbled into Fuzzy's.  The two of us had a great meal and a large beer on tap for under $20...total!.  Hard to beat.  And the food was some of the best on Mill Ave.  I'm a fan and will continue to go back when in the neighborhood.
