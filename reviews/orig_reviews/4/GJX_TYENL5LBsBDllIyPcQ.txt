Good food.  The sopapillas are an excellent addiction, especially the cinnamon sugar ones, and are the reason for the four stars.  The mildest of the three levels of chili is mild enough even for pasty white boring me, yet still delicious and flavorful.  The hotest chilis satisfieds my coworkers with even the most burned-out of tastebuds.  Portions are plentiful and dinner under $10 is quite doable.
