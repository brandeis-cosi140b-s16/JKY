The food is pretty good.  They have a pretty good variety also.  It is better than just "bar food."  The staff is great!  Even better is our server every week, Megan.  She is fast, efficient, gets our drinks and expedites our food order which is generally quite large.  She makes sure there's one less thing for our meeting group to worry about.
