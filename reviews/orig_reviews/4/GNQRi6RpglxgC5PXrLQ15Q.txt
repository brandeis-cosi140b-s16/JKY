1st time here last night (finally). We dined on the "secret" outdoor back patio - thanks to my girls prior F&L experience (which is good, I would have never known it was back there). They have a nice outdoor bar area too. The ambiance was really cool, the menu is extensive, the food and drinks were about perfect.

Minus one star for slow service (I guess that's how it's done in Mexico anyway? take it slow... relax... or maybe I'm the one that should order a corona and slow down?).
