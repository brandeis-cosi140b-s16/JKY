Surprisingly good, although I wasn't expecting much from the overall reviews.  The margarita was good, but too sweet.  The rice tasted good, but was overcooked and slightly clumpy.  The refried beans and red beans were cooked well, and the baja carne beef chimichanga was great.  Service was fine, prices were reasonable (large entree and margarita = $22), and atmosphere in the outdoor seating was nice.  Tons of Mexican places out here I'd like to still try, but I wouldn't dismiss this place if I was in the area again.
