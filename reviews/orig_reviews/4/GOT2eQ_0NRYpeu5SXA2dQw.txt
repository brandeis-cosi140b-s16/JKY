Usually when the concept of the restaurant is fusion (especially of the unexpected sort), the idea works better than the blending within the Food itself. That is not the case here--China meets Mexico and they made beautiful food babies! 

These dishes were the most distinct to me: 

On my first sitting I ordered the carnitas tacos and the duck tongue taco. I found the ingredients to be unexpected and was curious of the result of such flavor combinations. On the count  of texture, taste, and quality, these completely succeeded and I offered the perfect teaser for us to delve into a more serious entree. 

Next came the pork and quail egg Sui Mai which completely blew me away!! The delicate unbroken yolk of the quail egg perfectly cooked on top of the soft pork Sui Mai generated the most winning flavor with the light soy sauce. 

This place was so creative on both decor and food. The carnitas and duck tongue taco, the quail egg Sui mai are a must try. I'm thoroughly impressed!
