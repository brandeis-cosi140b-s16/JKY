Oh the joy of walking thru Ranch Market... loved the produce section . lower prices , bigger bunches of cilantro , onions and other goodies...pineapples for 2lbs for .99 ? Yes please!  With my buddy Tom as my guide we perused and discussed  all foods  Hispanic.. we talked cremas, with me buying something close to a creme fraiche,  and a arroz conleche that might make stop by there every time I am near..that is some good rice pudding.  We also  looked over their large selections of  dried chiles  for my chili carne I am working on.   My husband  found yummy morsels of ceviche  to his liking and he also tried a  variety of streets tacos.   Loved this adventure in food and look forward to going back ..
