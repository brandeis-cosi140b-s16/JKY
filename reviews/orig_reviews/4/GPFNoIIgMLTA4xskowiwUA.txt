Maybe I just eat at odd times, but I never have a problem finding somewhere to sit here, even if Cowfish is packed.  
I love the thin chips they have.  Be careful with them in the salsa, but once the chip hits your mouth it just melts.  I mainly just go there for the chips.  If you like a firm crunchy chip this is not the place for you, but if you like an airthin chip that is easy on the teeth this is the place.

The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom never fails to satisfy and their chimichanga was pretty good as well.  

Wash it all down with a Shiner Bock or one of their signature drinks and you have a meal!
