Excellent fajitas!!! Recommendation for two people: get the fajitas for ONE. You will still have leftovers! We got a steak and chicken combination and it was delicious. My only complaint is the house margarita tasted like it came straight out of the bottle of premixed Jose Cuervo... I prefer something a little fresher. Other than that, the food and service were great.
