I had been watching this place since before they opened. I never saw any cars and thought it would not last the month. Then I noticed that the porch was full of people having lunch. The parking is in the back. I am glad I took a chance on it. America is a person and her Taco Shop is divine. It is a Mexican version of the Coronado Cafe. They have a limited menu around 10 entrees, but they are awesome. I had the Quesadilla De Carne Asada for $4.50, some chips and yummy Salsa, as well as some of the best Flan I have had and a Mexican Coke (the beverage). The counter help was attractive and efficient and I had food within minutes. I devoured it and could have eaten another Quesadilla, but I am a big eater. I liked the crowd too. Give it a shot before people find out about this place and you can't get a table.
