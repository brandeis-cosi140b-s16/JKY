I quickly became a fan of Cabo Fish Taco when I found out just how fresh their tacos were. This review doesn't need to be long because all I really need to tell you is go and try this food because you will simply see for yourself what I'm talking about.

But the real winner of this place is by far the lightly fried taco shells. I truly have never tasted anything like them before. They're not crunchy tacos and they're not soft tacos, they are something completely new. It's what keeps coming back for more each week.

And please do try their crab dip, the fried pitas it served with will also make you want more.
