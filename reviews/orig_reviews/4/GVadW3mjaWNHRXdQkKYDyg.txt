I'll start with my negative feedback.  The service was very slow and the guacamole for appetizer was really bad.  They used way too much cumin.  I basically felt like I was eating straight cumin.  However, the sangria is great (although quite strong).  My favorite item was the main course.  I ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought it was wonderful!  Perfectly cooked and a lot of great flavors.  It's a little pricey but the main entree was worth it.  My husband had the pork tenderloin and thought it was great.  Skip the guacamole but get the scallops and shrimp dish!
