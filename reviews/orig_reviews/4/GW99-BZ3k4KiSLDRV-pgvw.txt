This is not another 'beans and rice' Mexican food place.  Sure, they have both beans and rice, but the stars of the show in my book are the pork and seafood dishes.  I think my favorite is the Nuevo Chile Relleno, which is stuffed with pulled pork and surrounded by a red pepper sauce.  I think the horchata is great, and my wife absolutely loves the pork burrito with green sauce -- double beans, no rice.

I think they won the Best of Phoenix for Neighborhood Mexican Restaurant in 2011, and they do get pretty crowded just about every night.  The turnoff for the parking lot sneaks up on you, so you have to pay attention, especially at night when it is much more difficult to see.

They seem to spend a lot of time decorating the place for holidays (Christmas is the biggest, but Valentine's day was pretty impressive as well), so the ambiance is nice -- but it does get loud in the main dining area.

If you don't care about table service, the little building in the parking lot is a taqueria where you can just get the food and drink in an even more casual setting
