A large group of friends and I came here for some drinks on St Patty's Day. Considering the huge amount of people on Mill Ave, plus the huge amount of people at Fuzzy's, I was actually really impressed with being able to get a relatively clean table, and the service.

It wasn't perfect by any means, but their beers and drinks were green, delicious, the right price, and easy enough to get. I think inside there was table service, but we simply went up to the front or the bar when we needed our drinks; this kept things simple.

We did not eat, so I can't give an opinion on the food, but their pre-mixed margaritas and their green beers hit the spot! I'd definitely come back here to try it on a regular day.
