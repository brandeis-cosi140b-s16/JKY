I stopped in when I was traveling for business and have been back a few times when I am in the area.  This is a great restaurant for Tex-Mex food. The chips and salsa are addicting. The chips have the perfect amount of salt. The menu has a lot to choose from. The margaritas are good and the service ranges from okay to good depending on the crowd.

The food isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good, it's always good, everything on the menu is good. It's consistent, it's fresh, and the portions are more than you'll need. Chicken burrito is a bit dry but works with salsa. Shrimp tacos are very good, with a decent amount of shrimp. Steak quesadilla is very cheesy (white cheese) and the tortilla has the perfect slight crispness. Food is also quickly prepared.
