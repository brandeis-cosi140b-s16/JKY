I came here on a quick lunch date and was seated right away which is a plus. They have outdoor dining, not much but still enjoyable. 

Ordered chicken tacos and they were SO good. I'm a huge taco fan so I'm super critical the way I like them because I mostly compare them to the LA taco trucks. Which, these were almost identical.

Would def. recommend it for a quick bite to eat for lunch or dinner.
