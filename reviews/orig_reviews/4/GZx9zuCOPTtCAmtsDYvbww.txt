Always wanted to try this place, and finally stopped in...glad I did, because it definitely did not disappoint!!! The owner Chris, was there, and asked me if it was my first time there, and as it was, let me sample some of the meats. Love, love, love the kalua pork!!  Not salty or greasy....just right!!!!! I also love the options of having whole wheat tortillas and brown rice with or without seaweed. Took a couple of menus and passed them out to my coworkers....many of whom are from Hawaii. Only reason why I omitted a star was because on my second visit, I also ordered chips and guacamole, and for $4+, the little container of guacamole was disappointing, albeit delicious....but to have to scrape the bottom of the container after a few chips...other than that, the food is EXCELLENT!!!! They definitely do not skimp on the burrito!
