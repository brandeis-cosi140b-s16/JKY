Verde kind of fell off the radar for me, even after a couple great meals there, just because I don't crave Mexican often (and if I do--you can probably just find me at Chipotle. Sorry not sorry). But my friend and I wanted to try a new place for brunch after way too many visits to Meat & Potatoes and we realized we hadn't tried Verde's brunch yet!

Brunch reminded me how much I really like Verde! In fact, I think I like their brunch even better than their dinner! I like hashes because they often involve slow-cooked meat and poached eggs. But since I'm not a big potato fan, I find myself digging through a sea of potatoes for scraps of meat like some crazy brunch archeologist. However! I AM a sweet potato fan, so Verde's sweet potato-brisket hash was the perfect solution to my problem! The 5-minute eggs were nice for something a little different, although one of mine was just slightly overcooked. I saw some orders of the eggs benedict float by our table that were totally droolworthy.

My only thing about brunch is that I don't like how they don't have appetizers. I usually order an appetizer with brunch, and I don't think I'm alone, so this is kind of a missed opportunity.

For dinner I've always gotten the carne asada or the carne asada tacos when they have them and haven't been dissappointed.

The service here is friendly and laid-back, but honestly, a little TOO laid-back. It's always pretty slow. The bartenders, though, are great. And every drink I've had has been really tasty AND really strong. This is underrated as a drinking spot for sure, even if you're not a tequila person!
