Went there last Saturday night with my wife and daughter.  There was about a 20 minute wait.  The server brought the chips and salsa right away. The tomatillo salsa was very good. The service throughout the meal was excellent. The water glasses were constantly filled and the server came by about four times.  The hostess also stopped by. I shared the steak fajitas with my daughter and the meat was cooked just right and the vegetables were good too   My wife had the carnitas and was happy with her meal.  Overall, it was an enjoyable evening and we will return. Not to leave out that the value was good too.
