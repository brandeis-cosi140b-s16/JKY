Let's start with the chips and salsa. They give you normal crispy chips AND decadently fluffy tortilla chips with a really fresh salsa. Super duper tasty!

Now, I can't remember what I had the first few times I came here but I know I was blown away. However, the only thing that matters anymore are the spinach enchalads. They are served with a incredibly flavorful red sauce and then topped with another white sauce and get this - TOASTED ALMOND SLICES. Yes, toasted almond slices. These lil' babies add the most insane texture to the creaminess of the cheese and spinach filling. I would love to have a plate of these right now - at 8:03am. The rice and beans are also excellent.

I can't speak to the alcohol selection too well but I did have a non-alcoholic prickly pear margarita and it was rather scrumptious. I was assured the one with alcohol was just as tasty and you get a ridiculous sucker in the shape of a cactus.

My only complaint is the service can be hit or miss. Last time I went was father's day around 1 or 2 and the place wasn't very busy. Our server was a bit of an airhead (and rather squeaky but that's not their fault).
