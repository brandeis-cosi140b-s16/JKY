Well, I can finally say that I have tried the burgers. Pretty legit. I can see how they could be compared to In-n-Out, but they do not taste the same to me. Similar textures going on, but very different patties. Am I really dissecting the finer points of a hamburger right now? I need to just stop, drop, and eat a salad before things get out of control.
