Wonderful food!  Awesome food!  Out of this world great food. Service is spotty. Great guy that works weekdays, but otherwise the service is terrible doesn't matter which female it is. Getting food before drinks. Sometimes order food before drinks. Tonight the drink arrived 2 seconds before the meal, my taco was incorrect (I don't complain just go with it). Then they are all over us asking if all is ok. Then clean our table, working at pushing us out the door because they close in 15 min. 

Again great food, worth all my trips there (10+) but don't ever expect exceptional service unless you luck out and get the male server, he is good!
