Definitely a must if you are near South Mountain Park in Phoenix which we were.  Quant  atmosphere and decorated totally Mexican style.  Not the best neighborhood but that's what adds to the ambience of the place.  Very inexpensive and huge portions.  I ordered the  Chicken Relleno which you rarely see on a Mexican menu.  It was $5.50.  Filled up the whole plate with a delicious serving of moist white meat chicken in a  chile relleno topped with a yummy sauce loaded with sauteed onions, mild chilles and of course cheese poured all over with a small salad.  Hubby ordered a combo of tamales, chicken enchillada, chile rellenos.  Had to bring half home.  Equally yummy.  Our son had the chicken enchilldas and scarfed down his meal in seconds.  It will be one of our favorites when traveling up to Phoenix.
