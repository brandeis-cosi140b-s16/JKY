Wow, for an Americanized taco place in the midst of Vegas craziness to be decent, much less good? Four stars for sure.

They have the basic meats.. beef, chicken, pork.. with corn and flour tortillas. I like a little more variety of beef (like a certain PART of the beef) but hold onto your stomachs, it's pretty safe to say they don't carry my favorite part here =/

The meat was flavorful and not too tough, the veggies were fresh and the tortillas weren't too starchy, in fact, they were borderline home made status.

Drinks were good, and apparently they have Happy Hour? Niiiice.
