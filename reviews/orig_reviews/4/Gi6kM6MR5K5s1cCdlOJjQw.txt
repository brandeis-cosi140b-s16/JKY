After much prodding from a favorite client to try this place, my husband and I went on Saturday night.  We were seated right away and for being where it is,  it was pretty OK inside. Our waitress was very nice and attentive the whole meal. I had the king tacos ( client's recommendation) and they were Delicious, 3 soft tacos with really good chicken, I don't know what they marinate it in but moist,  flavorful and cooked to perfection, perfectly sauteed onions on top with just the right amount of cheese. I had the horchata and it was excellent. Husband had the Del Ray of course and it kinda grossed me out a bit but he enjoyed it, I had a bite and that was enough, it was huge so he took half home and enjoyed the rest for breakfast the next day, he also ordered a side of beans and they were really good and not your  typical refried beans,  they were a white bean with a little cheese on top, Yummy. he also had the vampiro to drink, it was beets and other veggies juiced and he loved it, it did look just like blood. all in all it was really good andwe will definitely go back.
