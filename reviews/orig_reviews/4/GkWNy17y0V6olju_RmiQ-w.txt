So I love this place. Great prices, great tacos, great guacamole, and a very strong margarita. This place is small but so worth the wait if there is one. I had the carne taco, shrimp taco, chicken taco all great and all tacos are $2-3. My girlfriend got the huevos rancheros. Dam the sauce on this dish was so good. She loved it and ate every bit. This place is inside the Claredon hotel and the mens restroom in the lobby has urinals that are two big red lips and teeth. Freakin hilarious. Everything that came out that kitchen looked so good. I think the most expensive thing was steak n eggs for $13. Also a great place for happy hour!
