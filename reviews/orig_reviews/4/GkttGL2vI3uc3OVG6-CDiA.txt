This place is just like Chipotle, except their food doesn't taste like crap.

You got your burritos, bowls, tacos and salads to choose from, and I find the quality of the food the serve to be pretty fresh. They got some hawaiian inspired food that you can put on your dish, and there's also coconut bark that is so delicious I would kill someone for it. Yeah, it's that good.

The only thing I would recommend is putting a bigger trashcan/tray/dish area in the lobby. It seemed like they wanted people to just leave the dishes there for them to clean up, but when it gets busy it's not really practical for the employees and they don't have time to go get them. There were quite a few laying around when I visited.
