One of those moments when you spent too much time checking out Yelp but still went... I am glad we did.
My two dear friends and I are in town for the pure fun of being together .  We found the service attentive but not smothering.
I had the lobster taco - fabulous... One of my pals had the enchiladas and the other the steak fajitas.  We were thrilled at the food.
I had the house sangria and our waters where often refilled.  Great service on refilling the tortilla bowl as well.
We sat next to the mechanical bull ring.  It was not in operation at the time.  I could easily see the place being crazy loud when people do saddle up.
Very enjoyable meal!
