Great 1.50 tacos for happy hour, they give you the chance to try their different kinds of meat. I really enjoyed the cochinito pibil, mojo shrimp, and carne asada tacos, I thought these were the best. The duck tacos were good if you like a sweet sauce with tacos. And the chorizo taco were good also if you enjoy chorizo.  Also tried the sangria and michelada with negro modelo which were excellent.  Lastly we had the crepes for dessert. While I'm not much of a desserts person, this was really tasty with the amount of cajeta (caramelized milk) and vanilla bean ice cream.
