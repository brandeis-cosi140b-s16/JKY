We walked into Vida Vida, seemed a bit low key. Glad we asked our server - through the door we found Vida, less casual and more comfortable restaurant. Appears this location has two parts.. The faster food, casual area and the more formal side.

Overall casual Mexican restaurant. Ordered the the Seared tuna over mixed greens with avocado, corn and assorted vegetables. The tuna was bright pink (I'll admit it kind of freaked me out a bit BUT) all in all it was delicious. Not the most Mexican Mexican dish around but defiantly beyond satisfying!

Perks: Always love me some free chips and salsa
Perks: Margs were good, not overly sweet
