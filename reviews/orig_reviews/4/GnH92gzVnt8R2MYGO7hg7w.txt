Nice Bar Area that sits just across from the gaming floor... darn near "on" the gaming floor so you can hear and see the action if you like.

We sat in a booth in the bar area.  It was cozy yet allowed us to people watch.  They serve a full menu in the bar area... so if you don't want to sit in the Dining area... grab a seat in the bar area.  It's just as nice.

We enjoyed a few fantastic Margaritas.  Not overly sweet... just the right balance of tequila, sweet, sour and tanginess.

Of course, we enjoyed the chips and salsa. Salsa is quite tasty... not too hot, not too sweet or tomato-y.

I ordered the Veggie Enchiladas for lunch.  YUM!  I'd totally get these again.  They were filling, but not heavy. 

It's a bit pricey for lunch... of course, it might be all the margaritas we had too.  It's in a high-end hotel/casino bar so what do you expect?  I'm not complaining... merely stating that it is not a cheap place.
