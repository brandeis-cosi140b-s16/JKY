Tonight I stopped by here to meet up with friends and ordered nachos and guacamole. These guys hand cooked their nachos so it takes a bit long before my food arrived but once I tried them, the wait time was worth it. I love the cheese covered nachos dipped in perfectly fresh guacamole. The only down side is that this is a very unhealthy item due to the frying of the nachos. Also, at ~$8 for nachos and guacamole and a diet Coke, that's kind of pricey I thought.
