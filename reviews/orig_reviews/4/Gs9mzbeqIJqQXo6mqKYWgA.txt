YAHOOOOOO!!!! Viva Mercado is back! We've been devout fans for YEARS and were so bummed when it closed. 

Of course we were hopeful that the menu, service and food quality we love hadn't changed. It hasn't. Fideo soup, bean dip and chips & awesome salsa came with a smile. Margaritas were jamming and our favorite items were just as delicious as before. I have to say, the new location is great- updated, clean and comfortable.

Thank you Viva Mercado- we are so glad you're back!
