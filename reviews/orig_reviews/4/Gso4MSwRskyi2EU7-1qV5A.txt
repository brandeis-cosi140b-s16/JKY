Great place small hip interior well made drinks.  You have to try the tasty pork belly taco, it was crazy good.  The meal includes chips and salsa but everything else is a la carte. Kind of like a steak place, when you order a taco you get only a taco no sides or anything else which depends on how you look at it as fine or annoyed that you get nothing but a single taco.  But by that same note you can custom build your meal a definite plus because you know all the rice and refried beans are just to fill you up so you can eat less of the good stuff.
