Way better than Blanco if you're looking for Americanized  Mexican food. The salsa isn't spicy enough that they bring out with the chips, but ask for the habanero instead if you like spicy food and they will gladly oblige. I have never had an issue with service. Always been prompt and polite. 

The tacos are great and the food is moderately priced. Nice ambiance too. Perfect spot for a date night or girls' night out.
