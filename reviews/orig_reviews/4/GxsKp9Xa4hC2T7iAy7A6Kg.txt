A Mexican friend  of ours recommended Arriba's. We usually order take out, the 2 times I ate at the restaurant, service was poor and food was not as good. 

Luckily, every time we order for take out the food has been very good. The chips and salsa are always fresh. My husband likes the chicken chimi platter and we had try the carne adobada pizza, plate and sampler platter. I like the way they seasoned the food, not too salty and you can taste the spices. Leftovers taste better (though maybe mushy) the next day.

So, service and food at the restaurant will be a 2, but since I always have a great take out experience, I'll give them 4 stars
