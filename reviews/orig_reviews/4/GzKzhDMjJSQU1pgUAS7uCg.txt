Mundo is a very good choice for pre-theater Smith Center dining.  The staff is used to accommodating Smith Center patrons, and they work to get you served and out on time.

On our most recent visit, we started with the guacamole.  It's very flavorful, and  a nice size portion for 2 or 3 people to share.  For entrees, we had the carnitas and the pork tenderloin.  Both were very good.  Portions here are healthy.  Be careful not to eat too many chips and salsa!
