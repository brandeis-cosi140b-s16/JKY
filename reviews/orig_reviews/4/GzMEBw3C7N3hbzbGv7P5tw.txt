this place is a local favorite for a reason. The menu is rather limited, but what they do they do very well. The house specialty is carne asada and you know it as soon as the car door opens. 

Get a soft taco or burrito, add the salsa, squeeze on the fresh lime and savor the simplicity of classic mexican flavors.
