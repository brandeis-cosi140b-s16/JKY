I was just actually impressed with this place. We came in and they got super busy, and all of the employees just kept their cool and kept with their fast and friendly service. Their burrito was delicious, my boyfriend get the tacos and looking at those made me drool.. I would definitely recommend it on any chill day you want some legit Mexican food.
