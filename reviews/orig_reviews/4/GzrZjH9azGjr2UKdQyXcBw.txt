Been here twice while traveling to AZ for work (live in CA). The ambiance is great and the food is pretty good too. I'd definitely get the corn as a side to any meal whether it be tacos or another entree.  I give it 4 stars because the food is pricey, but given its one of the better restaurants in the area I understand the price inflation.
