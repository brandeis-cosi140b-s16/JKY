Rokerij has amazing food whether for breakfast, dinner or happy hour! I'm a fan of their brunch which is served on sizzling metal plates to ensure your food is hot and fresh. The only bad thing is their prices can be a little spendy  and I hate having to valet for breakfast! Try their crab tostadas or steak toasts, amazing!!
