Brains!!! 

That's what sealed the deal for me as soon as we walked up and I saw the menu. I Immediately ordered six and I wasn't disappointed one bit. 

As with most other taco places I've been to, they had a salsa bar with all the fixings. I usually go to for limes, onions, and cilantro. So, I topped my brain tacos and dug in. They were rich, creamy, and delicious.

As for the place itself, it was clean, the staff was friendly, and packed with people! All a good sign in my book. I'm happy we made the decision to stop. If you're ever in Vegas, you should too!
