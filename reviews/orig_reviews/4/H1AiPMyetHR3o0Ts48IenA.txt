Hidden gem with delish food! I could've eaten just the chips & salsa and been happy. The menu was a little tricky with the family style/individual format but we figured it out. The BF had quesataco which was different but really good. I love mole so when I got the option to pour it over taquitos, I was like hell yeah. I'll definitely be back!
