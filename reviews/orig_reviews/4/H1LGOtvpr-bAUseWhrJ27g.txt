Met a colleague here for lunch the other day.  It was my first visit to Frank & Fina's.  I arrived early and was seated promptly by the hostess.  While I was browsing the menu, the owner Frank came out with Chips & Salsa and asked for my drink order suggesting a Margarita or Beer....hmmm, ok!  You don't have to ask me twice in a Mexican Restaurant if I want a Margi or Beer.  I ordered a Pacifico....what the hell, I don't have to go into an office and my afternoon was clear.

While I waited for my friend, I decided I'd order the Nachos.  He arrived a few minutes later saw my Pacifico and ordered one for himself....I love how contagious Beer in a Mexican Restaurant can be!  We ordered our lunch and I like how the waitress asked me if wanted Jalapenos on my Nachos....I asked her if they could cut it fresh and put a lot on top...she said yes.

We had a nice conversation while we waited for our food, which came out a short time after we ordered.  The place was packed for lunch and I expected the service to be much slower, but it wasn't.

The Nachos were very good.  The proportion of Cheese, Guacamole, and Sour Cream were just right.  The proportion of Salsa and Onions were good too, relative to the amount of Chips.  The portion was on the Appetizer menu and it could easily feed two or three.  It's not a huge pile of Nachos like you find in some restaurants. For $5.50, it's not bad.  The flavor of all the ingredients were very good too.  The only complaint I have is that the Chips are too thin....they broke easily with the slightest amount of pressure....which forced me to eat most of the Nachos with a Fork.  That's sacrilegious to some Nachos aficionados...LOL

We had another Pacifico and continued our conversation for a while after lunch.  It was a pleasant experience.  As a bonus, I ran into two friends I haven't seen in 8 yrs who were sitting a the table next to us.

Overall it was a good time.

Will I return?  Of course!
