Who knew you could get good tacos in Pittsburgh?    Tacos pescados were perfect.  The guacamole/chips are so good and fresh.  I reclaimed my membership to the clean plate club. 

Minus one star because happy hour pitcher of margaritas was pretty pricy at $16 for the ice to marg ratio.  I like the set up with the bar, another room of tables, then the outside patio is awesome.  The room with tables is pretty cramped and very dark.   I felt like Cantina should have be exploding with hipsters but there were a bunch of yinzers in there.  Maybe the hipsters are becoming yinzers to be even more ironic and different?   

The service was great!  We had a waitress who was capable of splitting a bill three ways with all of our different stuff (shared and not).  Those type of waitresses are a rare breed.

I'll be back here next time I'm in the burgh.
