Came here for dinner on Cinco de Mayo with some out of town guests.

The food was excellent.  Small menu with daily changing specials.  Very large tequila/bar menu.  Everything that we ordered was outstanding: very flavorful but not overly spicy.  Our server was very attentive and polite, explaining each of the specials and answering our questions.  Prices were reasonable.

My one complaint is that it was really loud inside.  I had to yell across the table to my guests and to be heard by the waiter.  Don't come here if you're expecting to have an actual conversation.  But if you want phenomenally executed Mexican food, definitely make a visit.
