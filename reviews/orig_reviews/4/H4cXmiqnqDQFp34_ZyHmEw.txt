Great place that lived-up to all of the hype.  A great place to eat and socialize.  The tacos were great.  We tried the 4 taco sampler and was not disappointed.  The hardest thing was deciding on which taco to have as the list contained 15 different ones.  They all tasted great.  You can't go wrong with the sampler with 4 different tacos and 2 sides.  A place, we plan on visiting again.
