We were huge fans of their old location (Charleston & Jones I think, in an old IHOP building) and followed them to Summerlin when they opened there. They have the best Mexican food in Vegas, hands down. I do miss the charm of the old and rustic building as this new place has been Summerlin'd. If you like the heat, ask them to bring out their Habanero sauce. It's very deceptive and looks like a cream based sauce. I have no idea what manner of witch created this sauce, but it's pretty deadly.
