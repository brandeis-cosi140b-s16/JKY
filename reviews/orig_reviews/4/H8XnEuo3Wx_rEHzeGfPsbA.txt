SO any food can be made nuevo sheek these days, just put a German style name next to the food, In this case taco haus.

As the name suggest tacos play a large role on the menu,  and there are many small street style tacos with wall street pricing. $3-5 each. There is a civicheria here too, (raw fish cured in citrus with a few garnishes)

We oped for a chiviche of tuna, it was fresh and decent however the grade of the tuna was lower than I expected.

Our veggie taco platter was huge and the real star of the meal and reason for the score. A large selection of grilled vegies and even kale on a platter served with many small tortillas for a great DIY taco party.
