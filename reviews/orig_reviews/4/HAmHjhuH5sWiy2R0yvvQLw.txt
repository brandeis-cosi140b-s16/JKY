This was my second visit to The Original Burrito Co. and it id not disappoint. I got the #40 which is a burrito with eggs, cilantro, shredded beef (or chicken) and rice. I also added guacamole because well, I love guacamole.

The portion size was huge and it came with a side of chips which I didn't end up eating. My boyfriend also ordered some Carne Asada fries which were nothing special. 

They have a lot of choices which I usually don't like but when it comes to burritos I don't mind. When we went the first time around 12pm there was literally no where to sit, it was jammed packed. Today we went around 1:45pm and not to many people were there.
