Finally got around to visiting this place and it was better than expected. Saturday night and the place was full - for good reason. Nice fresh blue point oysters on the half shell, steamed clams ( steamed in broth which was almost better than the clams!). Fish ceviche - tasty, fresh - actually got one to go. Tamale del Mar with pablanos - didn't overwhelm the seafood. All the sides - slaw, beans, rice weren't swimming in whatever sauce which made them stand out for their own taste. Definitely will revisit - have to try the tacos next time! Don't know why we didn't but all the other items looked great and were great.
