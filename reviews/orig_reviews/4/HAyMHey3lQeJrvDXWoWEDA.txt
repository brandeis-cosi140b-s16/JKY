Update V.3

After a couple more good experiences I felt like they deserve a better rating.  Came here a couple weeks ago with a large party and the waitress was very accommodating as our party grew a little bigger than expected.  No problems splitting the checks and she continued to serve us as we moved over to a reserved fire pit area.  This place is back in good graces just in time for Spring Training!
