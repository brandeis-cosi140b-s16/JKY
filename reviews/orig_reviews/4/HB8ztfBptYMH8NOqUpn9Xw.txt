I must state up front that I am a Carolina regular. I've eaten there well over 100 times over the years. So what keeps me coming back? Foremost, the prices are very reasonable.This is not Taco Bell. This is Arizona style border food, but at fast food prices. Try a simple beef taco in any one of the many combination plates to see the superiority. And the fresh flour tortillas are wonderful (hot, large & thin).  

So why only three stars (see update below)? The dining room can be a disaster at times. Want a clean table? It's up to you. Get behind a large carryout order, expect a long wait. Order when the kitchen staff is taking a break, expect a long wait. Or get lightening fast service. You never know. The hot sauce is flavorful and actually spicy hot, but it is watery and presented in metal pumps. All three pumps are often empty before staff comes out to refill them. Meanwhile, the pump area can become an unsanitary mess.

Perhaps the best approach to Carolina's is as a carryout restaurant. Or bring an extra friend who can save a table for your group while you order.  Enjoy the food, but pay a little extra elsewhere if you want some atmosphere.  Solid, traditional Mexican border fare, a refreshing change from ubiquitous Mexican grill chain restaurants.

09/23/2014 Update: They've been doing a little better keeping the hot sauce pump area and the tables clean. Still not ideal. And the speed of service is still wildly inconsistent. Bumping the rating up to four stars.
