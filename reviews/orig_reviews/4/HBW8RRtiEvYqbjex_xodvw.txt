Yum Yum! Great chips and salsa, phenomenal service. Soda is always nasty, no matter what I order. The food is great! Their green corn tamale takes the cake as best tamale, and with chicken over it it is delightful. Tostadas, taco salads, taquitoes, just about everything here has been delicious. Great enchiladas, etc. They have amazing refried beans, really some of the best. Very friendly atmosphere. We go here all the time. While their cheese crisps are by no means crispy, the cheese they use is amazing, and I often crave it. I have it with their salsa and its awesome. Even though Im normally fond of crispy cheese crisps, this is addictive!
Love La Fonda Del Sol cant wait to return!
