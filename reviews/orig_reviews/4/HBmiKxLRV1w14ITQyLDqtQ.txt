We have been wanting to try Mercadito for a loooong time and we were not disappointed~
    Located inside the Red Rock Casino so lots of free parking and ez access as you don't have to walk thru the casino.
    While the place isn't fancy it is casual and comfy.
    We ordered the tacos pastor (3 per order) & the shrimp  tacos. Both were FAB! They also have salsa sampler very nice and great chips servered hot. We also ordered the guacamole quite good but pretty dang "spicy" for my tastes. Also indulged in a margarita, yuuum very deserving of the awards the server mentioned they have been awarded 
    Our server, Vivian was pleasant alittle ditzy tho & the food runner was nice too! The manager came by our table, which was nice too.
    The food is tapas style so smaller portions, PERFECT for sharing.
