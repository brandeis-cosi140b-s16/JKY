Soil classic ameri Mexican sit down food, with a few good and quite veggie options.

The chips and salsa are quite standard and decent, The veggie enchiladas with mushrooms, zucchini and more are also great, large full of well sauteed veggies in a flaful sauce and smothered in the obligatory cheese. 

The real key to the rating here was the speed, at lunch one does not have the time to wait 20 min for food and 10 min to order. Here you can order with in a few min of sitting down munch of 10 chips and 6 min later your hot food will arrive.  This makes it a great place for a lunch meetup. 

There is plenty of seating but not much parking so carpool if possible
