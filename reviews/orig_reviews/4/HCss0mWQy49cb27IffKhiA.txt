I went to this establishment on a Friday evening with my husband and was actually very pleased with the attentive servers, good food, and pleasant atmosphere. My husband had a steak chimichanga which was delicious and I had blanco enchiladas which were also very good. We had a lot of fun watching passerby's as this establishement is part of a hotel and has a lot of traffic. My husband and I like to "people watch." We will definintely be going back!! The atmosphere was very fun and the food was delicious!! I hope they add tamales to the menu though. : )
