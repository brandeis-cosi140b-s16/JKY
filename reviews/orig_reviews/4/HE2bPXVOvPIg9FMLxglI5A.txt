Let me start by raving about the salsa bar!!!!  OMG!!!!  Pecan Salsa, strawberry salsa, YUM!  I had their La Condesa veggie taco...it was delicious.  And we got there around happy hour, so, the cervezas were only $2!  Everything about this place was great...food, drinks, prices, decor.  I'm giving them 4 starts because even though they only had one other couple there, the service was slow!  Speed it up...and you will earn 5 stars!!!  Please don't change the menu.  This is truly gourmet mexican food with a twist.  Gracias!!!!!
