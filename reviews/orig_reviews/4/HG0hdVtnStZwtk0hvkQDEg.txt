Awesome hole in the wall mixing Asian and Mexican flavors together. 

If you haven't been here before there is a counter where you can get samples of the meat dishes they have. Once you have an idea of what you want the staff writes up your ticket. You can do a small bowl of one entree with rice or go big with one entree, rice and beans. It gets better, you can pick between 4 rice options: plain, fried rice, jerk fried rice and pork fried rice.

We got the popular entree which is Jade Red Chicken with jerk fried rice. The Jade Red Chicken is crispy fried pieces of chicken with a sweet glaze sauce. Next up was their Emerald Ginger chicken with white rice and Hengrenade Jerk Chicken with pork friend rice.

Everything was super tasty and a place to go back to when we are visiting the desert.
