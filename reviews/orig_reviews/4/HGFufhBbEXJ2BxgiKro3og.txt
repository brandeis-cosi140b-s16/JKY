To be honest you don't expect much out of these pricy hotel, non "master chef" restaurants and the same applied here when we dropped in at 9PM for quick dinner. I'll admit I was wrong. The service was very friendly and timely; staff were nice and accommodating. The food was good and portions were fair for the price. 

Overall a positive experience that helped filling a gap in food needs on a Saturday
