OMG this place is simply amazing. Delicious gourmet shrimp & fish tacos and the best salsa bar in town. I've been here a dozen times and I've yet to sample all of them (mostly because the "salsa cilantro" is ridiculous). It gets a little crazy during lunch time. The only knock on this place is the side of rice amount (the amount of beans is good - not fan of beans though) you get when you spend the extra $1 and get the taco "plate." But you can always get a street taco for $1.25 MORE you would spend other wise on the "plate"... If you're not a fan of beans.
