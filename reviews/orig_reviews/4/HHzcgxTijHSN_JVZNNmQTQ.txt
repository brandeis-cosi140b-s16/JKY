Went here with some co-workers yesterday and really enjoyed it. This is their favorite restaurant near the office and neither has been in a long time so they took me for the first time.

Our server was nice and to the point, got us some drinks, chips, salsa and guac faster than you can blink. They make the guac table side which is always fun, but they may want to consider adding a touch of salt in the mix.

I had the beef tacos and the beef was really flavorful. It had some avocado and either onions and tomatoes or something like a pico de gallo since I think there were some jalapenos in the mix as well. Either way it was good and fresh.  The rice side was good too, nice and aldente unlike some other places that serve mush. The two others had the cilantro and pollo salad and the mango salad and both were impressed and full. These salads were huge.

We sat and talked for a while and our server didn't bug us at all so that was nice too. I will go back to this place with my co-workers for sure. Keep your eyes peeled for little birds in the joint too...somehow they got in. No idea what that does to the health code, but I'm not bothered by it.
