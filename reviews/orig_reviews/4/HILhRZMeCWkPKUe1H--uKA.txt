I love coming here when the weather is nice to sit up in the rooftop lounge area and enjoy the pretty view of Walnut Street.  The margs are pretty decent, although I vow to never try the yinzeritas... There's just something about beer and maragaritas that doesn't mix for me.

The quesadillas are great here, always crispy. The salsa options are delicious as well. I had a mango salsa in the summertime, and it was delicious. 

The service here can be a bit spotty, so I usually don't come here during the cold months when I can't sit in the rooftop bar area. But if you're looking for a good view in a good location, this is definitely a fun spot to try in the warmer months.
