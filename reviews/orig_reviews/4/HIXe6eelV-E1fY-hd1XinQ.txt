ADOBADA tacos there are the best! If you go to tacos el Gordo you must try these. 
Pretty interesting place. I have to say I am not a fan of how you order your food. Definitely reminds me of a food truck cuz u have to stand in a line to order ur food and you have to yell. I am 4 feet 10 and the counter is kinda high for me and with all the cooking and everyone in the restaurant talking and the loud Hispanic music they can't really hear your order if you speak like I do. I feel like I have to yell to be heard or else I get a lot of "que dijo?" 

Other than how u order the food the food is amazing. Highly recommend you try this taco shop :)
