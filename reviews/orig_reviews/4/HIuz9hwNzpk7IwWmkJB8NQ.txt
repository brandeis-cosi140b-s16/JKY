Okay, so all these bad reviews and I'm thinking, "do I really want to go to an expensive, non-Mexican Mexican restaurant with bad service?"  Well, it just so happens my relatives are staying at the Red Rock, and he wants to try it.  It looks cool, food looks good, and it's pretty busy inside.  $100 later, I'm pretty satisfied.  Really.

We ordered a carne and a camaron tacos, lobster tostadas, and both types of Ceviches along with the salsas.  Okay, didn't like them charging for the salsas, that was ridiculous.  But overall the food was really good!  The camaron and dorado ceviches were very different from each other, and could have used more lime.  Both tacos were great although they needed to take it easy on the sauce in camaron tacos.  The lobster tostadas were to die for.  Our server (don't recall his name) was very attentive and prompt (although orders were not exactly speedy), a decided departure from all the reviews I saw.

And that got me to thinking... I've seen more than a few reviews where they mention that it's not very Mexican.  So, you want to go to a trendy Mexican TAPAS restaurant and you want traditional Mexican?  What's the point of that?  I believe experimenting with traditional flavors and making something other than traditional out of it is part of the experience and enjoyment.  Was this Mexican?  Not really.  Was it good?  Absolutely.  Is it expensive?  Yes, but so is every other tapas restaurant in, well, outside of Spain.  If you want a good tamale go to El Cholo.  Good tacos?  Go to El Taurino.  Okay both are in L.A. but you get the point.  You're not here to get REAL Mexican food.  

Great tasting NON-Mexican food, great atmosphere, great service (at least to me), and we have a 4-star restaurant.  Despite the $100 setback.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Actually, despite the trendiness and fast pace of the place, I think it might actually be not bad for a solo dinner.  They have a bar and it's a casino, so I don't see why not.
