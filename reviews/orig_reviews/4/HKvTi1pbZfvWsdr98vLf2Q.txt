Sometimes when I start to write a review, the reviews of the people that have reviewed the place before me totally mesmerize me, and I feel more compelled to review the review than the restaurant!

I had this whole scathing paragraph all typed out, but when it comes down to it, really, you should just check out La Meztiza.  It's definitely authentic.  The chips are the best in town, but the salsa is not.  
I wish they had a slightly bigger menu, and it seems just a tad pricey for the portions.  The place is in a strip mall next to Pegasus Games, there shouldn't be any pretensions.

All this being said, I want some right now.
