Whether you're a local or tourist, you'll find Frank & Lupe's an enjoyable spot for New Mexican food conveniently located in Downtown Scottsdale.

I'm from New Mexico, so what I love most about the menu is that they serve sopapillas and stuffed sopapillas, both of which are hard to find beyond NM state lines. If you aren't afraid of a hearty meal, I highly recommend the Frank or Lupe enchilada plate.  The enchilada is crowned with egg - mmm!

Last night we had the special: chile relleno with poblano cream sauce.   It was massive, so between that and the complementary chips and salsa, my boyfriend and I had more than enough to eat.  Our server was friendly and efficient.

The small storefront facing Marshall Way has limited seating, but if you walk to the back of the parking lot you'll find another building and outdoor patio.  It's a great spot for sipping margaritas after a day of sight-seeing or having drinks and appetizers before a night on the town.  It can accommodate large groups as well.  In the winter they have heat lamps to make temps tolerable.

Opinions and styles of Mexican food vary widely in the Valley, but for me Frank & Lupe's is like a reliable old friend from home.
