I can honestly say that while we were in Vegas we were treated alright in most of the restaurants, like most tourists, but here was different.  We were greeted by the manager, who was so friendly, he chatted with me about my passion for cooking and that I used to follow food television back before foodnetwork times.  Anyhow, I digress... What I am getting to is that this place felt like a hometown joint!  They service was great the food was delicious, the mojito was crisp and refreshing, and the dessert was AMAZING!  This place puts a new and fun spin on traditional, but the flavors were on point, and the whole experience was a blast!
