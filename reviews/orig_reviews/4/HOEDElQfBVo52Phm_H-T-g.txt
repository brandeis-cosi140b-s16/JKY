This place has a great vibe and a great place to come if you're looking for some good eats on the strip. A great, relaxed place for a group. The beef short rib burrito is baaamb. Drinks are good too. You really can't go wrong, the price is eh but all in all a good place whilst on vacation or need a quick place to eat.
