Canteen is a pretty good bar, and one of my favorites on Mill.  The house shots and margaritas are reasonably priced and reasonably tasty, and if you want to spend a little more money, the selection of tequila is quite vast.  Last time I was there I used my check-in offer of a free house margarita which I found to feel a little more potent than it tasted.

The downside for me is the club scene that inevitably comes with the late hour.  College students swarm in, the middle seating gets cleared out for a dance floor, and the music gets louder.  I feel like an old lady complaining about it, but hey, I like to hear the conversations with my friends!  If I wanted a club and dancing, I probably wouldn't have come to Mill.

The decor is modern and interesting, and I always like the drunk people staring at the light fixtures hanging over the tables.  There's seating on the back patio and a small area that runs behind the bar, open to the outside.  Easy access to a bartender, fresh air, and a good view of the Mill Avenue people and their antics always makes for a good time.

Unfortunately, I have not tried any food yet.  I've heard nothing but good things though, so I'm still hoping to catch a Happy Hour for some tacos soon!
