I love the food here.  The salsa is some of the best I've ever had, dark in color with a little heat, it holds up well to the complimentary chips they serve.  I always seem to order the same thing every time, the Spooning Rellenos, beef tenderloin stuffed chile's and always Christmas style with red and green sauce. YUM!  They must have several different chefs, because every time I order this,  it's served just a little different.  I've had the 2 rellenos served one with green and one with red sauce; other times the red/green sauce poured on top of each relleno and other times 1/2 of each covered with a different sauce. Weird - but it still tastes great.

If you come here in during Spring Training, be prepared for a long wait, otherwise I've never had a problem.
