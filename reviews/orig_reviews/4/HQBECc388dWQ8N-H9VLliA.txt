A bunch of us came here for a late lunch. As I entered the restaurant, I was definitely taken aback by the decor, lighting and table setting. So palatial! 

While selecting drinks and food, we were served complimentary nachos and salsa. No hesitation will replenishing it, when we were running out.

After browsing through the menu, I ordered a Pina Margarita and Javier's Grilled Chicken salad. I wanted the scallops., unfortunately they were out of scallops that day.

I loved my drink and the food and though I wanted to try their desserts, there was no room in my stomach. Cordial service and great food. Highly recommend.
