I have not been back in awhile and it appears now that they are expanding the dining room. The prices are still the same as last year and this time I tried a burrito to go with green chile chicken. It took a bit long considering I was the only one ordering at 6pm, but the end result was pretty solid with a mostly decent burrito (they should put rice in it though). It was also a bit watery near the bottom. The green chile salsa and mild salsa were good renditions and the black beans were solid again. I had to get rid of one star because the creamy white rice which is their best dish was not creamy tonight. I would stick the the tacos and hope that the rice has a better night next time.
