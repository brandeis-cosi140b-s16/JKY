So M and I went to La Hacienda for restaurant week and loved it. We're big fans of mexican food so we were eager to have a date night just down the street. 

The ambiance has an old mexican villa feel to it. We started with cocktail and sadly they didn't have our preference in vodka, Stoli Orange, so we settled with Svedka Orange. It was on the sweet side but tolerable. I had beef empanadas for a starter, pork tenderloin for an entree, and pastel mexicano for dessert. Our server seemed a little nervous or inexperienced but was nice overall. We'll definitely go back and try the yummy things on the real menu. Just beware its on the pricey side.
