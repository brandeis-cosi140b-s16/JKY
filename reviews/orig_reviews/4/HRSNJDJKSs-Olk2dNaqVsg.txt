Very friendly service, delicious food, and cheap prices! What more can you ask for? We have taken every out-of-towner to this place to eat, and they all have loved the food, decor, and friendly staff. They are great about giving samples of about 6 different items from the menu, and they help fill out your order card as well. Everything tastes really fresh, and they have a ton of options. They're also great about substituting items as well. Definitely a must-visit!
