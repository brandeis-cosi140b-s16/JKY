This is another great spot for mexican food.

Food here is defiantely above average and the service is what Vegas used to be about.

In the past I have had Tamales, Enchiladas (Verde was tge best IMO), Chile Relleno and all were very good. Very wide array of tequilas for you to punish your liver with and they know how to break out a margarita.

All in all this is a great spot....but I cannot give it 5 stars because you can still sense that little bit of quality that gets left out in high volume joints.
