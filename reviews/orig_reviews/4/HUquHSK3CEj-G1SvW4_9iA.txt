A solid choice for Mexican food while in NYNY.

Probably not the absolute best Mexican food you've ever had, but definitely not the worst.  The service here was quick and attentive.

Overall, the food was pretty good and so was the service.  If you want a quick break from the tables and a decent bite to eat, you won't be disappointed.
