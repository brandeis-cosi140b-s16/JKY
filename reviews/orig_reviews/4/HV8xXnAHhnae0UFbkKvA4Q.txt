First of all, I love any place where I can drink sangria outside. That, combined with the fact that their outdoor space is super cute and their sangria is great, makes me pretty excited about this place. Coming at prime time on a Saturday night, I also expected that I would have to wait for a table, but we were able to sit right down. I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. I normally get the tacos, so last night I branched out a bit with the Tamales and the Tijuana Street Dog. Both were great! I also got to try the Chile Relleno, which I will probably order next time.

If the service had been a little better, I would have considered giving a 5-star rating. The service was fine - everyone was very friendly, but it was very slow, taking almost 15 minutes after ordering to get chips and salsa. This could have been a fluke, of course, so I will reconsider after coming back again.
