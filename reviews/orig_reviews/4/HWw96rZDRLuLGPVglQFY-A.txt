I love Chinese food.  I love Mexican food (or at least, Ameri-mex).   What better idea than to put these two together?  These guys are freakin geniuses.  I got jade chicken in a burrito, how cool is that?  

It would be 5 stars, but I, honestly, didn't think the food blew me away.  It was good, and it was inventive, but not mindblowing.  

One thing I did think was really cool was the little cinnamon flavored hockey puck you get for dessert.  It's not like the southern Snickerdoodles I've had before, but it's odd, which means it perfectly fits.
