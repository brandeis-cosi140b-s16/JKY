I love two hippies! The atmosphere is really chill and the food is always good. I always get the bean and cheese burrito minus the onions and its fantastic, it always falls apart at the end but great non the less. 
The staff have always been friendly to me and you can tell the boss appreciates his staff as well as his customers.
