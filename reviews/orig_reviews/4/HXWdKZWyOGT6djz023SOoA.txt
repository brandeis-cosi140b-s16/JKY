Came all the way from strip, paid $40 round trip to have this wonderful taco. It was definitely worth it.  Only reason why I gave it 4 stars was that it wasn't as good as the old location. The old location was the bomb, it was the best.
Don't get me wrong it is still excellent, just to give you a comparison , my visit was on Sunday morning around 2:00am, it was full house here but Taco Mexico few blocks away was empty, I mean zero customers.
