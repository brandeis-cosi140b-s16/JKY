Those of us that work in the downtown Phoenix area usually stick to places that are within walking distance when going out for lunch (we don't want to loose are good parking spot, right?!). However, a couple times a year, some lovely soul will decide to make a run to Carolina's and offer to get lunch, or breakfast, for a few people. 

This is where you can tell if you are in the cool crowd at work. We all know what it is like when you have to order and pick up food for 20 people = NOT FUN! If you get invited to join the "let's order from Carolina's" group, you know your haven't made anyone mad that day! 

I've only had the burritos and tacos but both have been delicious! The breakfast burritos are great.  If you let the tacos sit too long, they will get a little soggy/greasy, but in that really good way! =) Hot sauce is the perfect amount of spice, just about a medium I would say. 

The best part is the tortillas (corn or flour) that you can buy by the half or full dozen an take home to enjoy with your own creations. Warning: The flour tortillas are HUGE, yet soooooo good!!!! 

If someone at work mentions Carolina's, and I am lucky enough to be on the invite list, all previous lunch plans are in the trash and I am reaching for my Carolina's menu to scope out my selection!
