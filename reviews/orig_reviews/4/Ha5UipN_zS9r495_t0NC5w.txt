This is my second time to pinks, and I enjoyed this visit much more than the first. I sat at the bar without problems, and was given fast service. The el jeff tamale was awesome, the pork tamale a close second. Chips were pretty good too. They have tvs for you to enjoy watching the big game of the night. Will be back if I stay at the hard Rock again!
