Yes, this restaurant is in a strip mall near a discount brake shop and a super wide foot shoe store. Yes, the menu is confusing and placing your first order is the equivalent mental effort of high school calculus. Yes, it feels like an elementary school cafeteria with what looks like the remnants of a putting green in the corner. Yes, after you've eaten, you feel like you're well on your way to giving birth.

BUT ...

It's got a panda wearing a sombrero! How can you go wrong? The food is an epiphany in your mouth. The black beans alone are enough to keep me going back. In fact, I live in California now, but wouldn't dream of visiting AZ without going there. Plus, they give you a fresh baked cookie!

The perfect plate: Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken in a quesadilla, Black Beans, Chicken Fried Rice.

The perfect plate lyte: Jade Red, Black Beans and Plain Rice in a bowl.
