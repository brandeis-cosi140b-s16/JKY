This place is a dive, in the best sense of the word.  Truly basic interior, swamp cooler (you'll fall asleep if you sit at the table under the blower on a summer day) and pretty basic menu, but with treasures that rock - the only thing I've ever tried is the Al Pastor, which is the best I've ever had.  On gorditas, or in any other form, it is awesome.

Cash only, no soda fountain - bottled drinks only (but good selection of Mexican sodas and juices).  Occasionally they have some Horchata brewed, but not very often.
