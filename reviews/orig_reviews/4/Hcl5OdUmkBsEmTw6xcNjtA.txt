I've had good experiences here. I normally order the tostada and walk out happy. It also seems healthy (not sure if that's a fact). It's under $7 and is quite filling. They have daily specials as well--basically you pay full price but get a free drink. Tried the chile relleno once (it's a one day special, can't remember the day though) and it was very good, too.

Note: the prices have gone up a bit. The tostada is about $6.50+tax now.
