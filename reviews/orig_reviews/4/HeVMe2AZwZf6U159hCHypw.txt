This is actually my second time here, first time was in the summer, on the first time we came at like 8:25 and the door was locked..they close at 9 according to the sign, anyway..they saw us and immediately opened the door and invited us in..my 12year old just wanted some ellote after a soccer game and they were so friendly and accomadating..  Tonight we had carnita taquitos and some carne asada tacos, al pastor and chicken tacos.  All were good and tasted fresh and the meat was very tender and seasoned well.  This place is so close to my house so I think we will be frequenting it more often.
