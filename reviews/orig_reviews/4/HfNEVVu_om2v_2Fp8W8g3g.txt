Decent food, good service, great happy hour deals, ok margaritas.   The happy hour deal makes this place worthwhile.   It would be a five star rating if you could add one dollar shots to your drink during happy hour.   This restaurant is located right next to the Hard Rock Casino. What more do you need? Other then it to be happy hour every hour
