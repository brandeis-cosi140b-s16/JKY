All about expectations, go in with low ones.

The food isn't amazing, they use the same chicken regardless of the dish, and the drinks cost what you would pay on the strip.

That being said, it's the airport.  What would you expect?  Drinks aren't actually too bad and the staff is nice.

Once again, all about expectations.
