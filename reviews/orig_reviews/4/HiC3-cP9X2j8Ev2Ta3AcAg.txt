We love Javier's in Newport Beach at Crystal Cove, and this location at Aria is nice as well! The ambiance is reminiscent of Cabo, with the wooden art installations and gorgeous lighting. The menu is similar as the California location. Try the jalape√±o margarita and the 'El Pollo Chipotle' entree, they are my favorite!
