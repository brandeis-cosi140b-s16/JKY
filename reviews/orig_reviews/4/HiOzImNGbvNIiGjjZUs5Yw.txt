I love this place.  The food is great, the people are nice and it isn't terribly expensive. It's quick since you go to the window, order, then pick your food up and pick a table.  You don't have to bus your own table which is weird, but I usually do anyway.  Not sure if they like it, but I always seem to be there when they're picking up the trays and such, so I don't want to be that guy that leaves a mess in a perfectly clean area.

It's pretty much standard fare Sonoran Mexican food.  It's all good.  At first, I didn't like paying for chips, but you realize that it's not a sit down place like La Pinata or Mi Patio, so it comes with the territory.  Besides, the chips are great.  It's been a Lent standby since I don't like fish, I'll just get a bean and cheese burrito, some chips and a drink.  occasionally, I'll get a bean tostada, but it depends on how hungry I am.  

Their cheese crisps aren't my favorite, but when you think about the fact that "cheese crisp" contains "crisp," I can't fault them on that.

So, as always, I'll keep going there.  I'd like to get in there for breakfast sometime and give that a try.  I haven't thought of trying America's Taco Shop yet.

Some people complain about the ambiance, but I love it.  I don't need a bunch of loud people or TVs, though I've heard discussions where they were thinking about a TV since they thought they could pull in more of a sporting crowd, but the owners are pretty steadfast on it, and I'm fine with it.  There are plenty of places to go that HAVE TVs, so why not leave a few that don't.  You're there to eat.
