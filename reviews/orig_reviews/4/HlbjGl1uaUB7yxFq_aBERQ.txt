Had a pork and Carne asada taco. Pork was ok. Carne was amazing. Had a BBQ smoky flavor. $3 plus $1.50 to add cheese sour cream and avocado so kinda pricy for a taco but so good. I asked for lime and they cut me up some fresh ones on the spot. The shrimp cocktail looks really good and I will try it next time. This place looks like a hole in the wall and really is but good food.
