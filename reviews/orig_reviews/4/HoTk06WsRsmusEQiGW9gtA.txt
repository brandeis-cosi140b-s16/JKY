We finally made it to TeePee after hearing about it for years. 
The staff is friendly, and for as crowded as it was on a MLK holiday, the wait wasn't bad at all. I had a shrimp fajita burro, which was very big and stuffed with the usual onions and peppers, but this one was a little better than most places as everything had been spiced. A lot of flavor with just a hit a chilis, not enough to make your nose run, so perfect for me.
The level of noise was above average, but it was from people talking, not music or a tv.  Really had to yell across the table to be heard, but it seemed like everyone was having to.
The waiter kept an eye on us and kept our drinks full, and with so many patrons, I have to give him a thumbs up. We'll be back.
