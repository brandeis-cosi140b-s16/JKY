I came here a couple weeks ago and am finally getting around to reviewing some places I liked. A few friends from work came with me and we arrived about 5pm for diner. We made reservations and our table was set nicely upon arriving, no waiting is good. 

This was my first time here and it was a very good experience. The place is nice and comforting, paintings on the wall, colorful flags across the ceiling, and very clean. When we were walking to our table I noticed that they make their own tortillas in front of you, or at least in sight from where we were sitting. 

It was difficult deciding what to order, the food looked and smelt great. So we all order a drink gives and took a little more time to order. I have to point out that their bean dip is delicious! I like to feel out and try different items at a new place I haven't been before, so I went with a combination plate, which included 1 Chili Relleno, 2 Enchiladas, with rice and beans. I also added an El Pastor taco on the side. 

Once the food came out, everything looked very nice. I liked everything I had ordered, but the El Pastor taco was very memorable. The meat was very tender and juicy, fresh toppings, and nice in size. 

In conclusion, this place was very good! I had tried some of my coworkers food as well and definitely want to come back and order Good portions, great food, constant refills, and excellent service.
