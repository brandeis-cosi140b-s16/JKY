While the reviews of this restaurant are evenly distributed across the board from one to five, I would have to say that I was quite happy with experience. First they have a nice selection of craft brews including Devil Ale from Santan Brewing as well as other AZ brewers (unfortunately no HopKnot).  The complimentary bean dip as well as the salsa with chips were tasty and if you want more heat there is a small salsa bar with more options.  While not in my 'hood, if there is something I wanted to see at the nearby Harkins, I would definitely come back and check it out.
