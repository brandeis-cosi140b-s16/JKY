I've been here a few times now and I have one word for you, 2 Limit Margaritas!!! Okay, thats more than one word but you get the idea (: 

The free chips and salsa are really tasty and come in a variety of sweet potato, tortilla and seasoned crispy fluffy ones... mmm. 

The reason I gave 4 stars is because of the food. It's good but I felt it was missing something both times I ate there. 
I had the BBq burger and Portabello quesadilla which were a little bland and ordinary. 

If your lookin' for a good, strong margarita though, this is the place!
