Came here Friday night, it was packed with lots of good looking peeps.  No cover (NICE!) and we ordered a sampler appetizer and the food was pretty good.  The white sauce on the nachos were awesome and we had several drinks throughout the night.  It was lots of fun and the bill was not surprising for a bar like this.  I would definitely go back, the outdoor part was great for the weather we have here in November.  The atmosphere is great, cant remember much now that I had 2 shots and about 4 drinks before I had to get a ride home.
