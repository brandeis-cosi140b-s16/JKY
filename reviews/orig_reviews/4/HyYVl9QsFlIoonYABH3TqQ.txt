Living in chicago I know all about lettuce entertain you restaurants.  They usually have quality food served in a hip atmosphere.  The restaurant is located in a shopping center so you won't have all the craziness found near some of the hotels.  Outdoor seating is a plus.  My friend and I shared an order of fajitas and guacamole and it was more than enough.  Our waitress was very friends but sounded a little too scripted.  

Bottom line El Segundo can be a trusted spot on the strip for some decent mexican.
