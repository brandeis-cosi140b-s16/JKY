Jim W was in town and that was all the reason needed to party, well at least have dinner.  Heather C and Ryan C also were able to show up.  This was my first visit here.  I arrived last and there were chips, guacamole (thanks Ryan) and several salsas already on the table.  About half way through the second basket of chips we placed our orders.  Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!
