My boyfriend and I recently ate at Tee Pee as he knew I had been there before and I now live close!  It's known to be authentic and the food was definitelty tasty and served REALLY hot.  I really need to bring my Dad here, he wants it burns-your-mouth hot.  The server was super nice.  I would say the seating seems a little outdated, but no biggie.  On a Tuesday night I was surprised by the number of people sitting outside having a few beers, seems like a good spot to hang out if that's what you're looking for!
