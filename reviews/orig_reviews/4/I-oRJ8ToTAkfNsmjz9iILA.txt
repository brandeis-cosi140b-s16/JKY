A few months ago we visited this restaurant for dinner, weren't impressed, and I wrote a less than positive ( but accurate ) review.

Last night we decided to stop by again for cocktails and an appetizer. We sat at the bar - and left feeling completely satisfied. The only reason I'm not giving them a full 5 Stars is because we didn't order a full meal. But the guys behind the bar ( Julian & staff ) did a great job, we got our appetizer in a reasonable amount of time, the staff was friendly, our drink was good, and overall we left very pleased.
