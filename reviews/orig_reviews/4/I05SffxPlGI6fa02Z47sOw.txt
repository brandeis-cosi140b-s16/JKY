The ambience is dark and romantic, I say this as I was there with two of my girlfriends haha. It's definitely an upscale place. Pretty big too. Had the guacamole to start, they make it right at the table which is nice because you can adjust what you want in it and even how much. Very yummy. I had the chicken tacos and they were really good. It is kind of pricy, especially for what you get, but it is worth it!
