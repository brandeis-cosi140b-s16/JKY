My absolute favorite thing about this place is the menu. Every item is named after something movie related. Movie lines, characters, etc. I love it.

The location is a little confusing. It is on the back side of the building on 715 Providence. So if you park out front (where you'll see Toccare and Stagioni), walk around to the back of the building. You'll see the big patio and also a parking lot there. 

So, let's start with that big 'ole patio. I cannot wait until it warms up outside. It looks like a great place to hang out and to have drinks.

This is not one of those restaurants where you sit down and a server automatically brings you chips and salsa. If you want them, you have to order and pay for them. Instead of salsa, I order the Billy Ray Valentine. It's like cheese dip on steroids.... a queso with chorizo, corn relish and pico. I usually get two tacos and a side of the creamy white beans. Tacos range from $3.50-$4 and you can add a side for $2. So if you go the taco route, you'll spend about $10 for your meal. So far I've had: "I'll Have What She's Having" (grilled mahi-mahi), "Uncle Buck" (fried oysters) and "Fat Guy In A Little Coat" (grilled skirt steak). I've liked them all so far. 

I haven't had anything from the cocktail list yet. I'm excited to try their version of a spicy margarita. Last night, they had $5 white sangria on special. I'm not the biggest sangria person, but hey when in Rome right? Or should I say Mexico?

The staff have all been nice. Service has been a little hit or miss. I think they're still feeling things out since they are fairly new.
