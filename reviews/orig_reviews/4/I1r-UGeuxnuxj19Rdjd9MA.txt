The food is simply AMAZING. Some of the best pastor and chicken mole I've tasted. The margaritas as so good that its all I've ever had to drink there lol. I've heard the horchata is good. The place is small and the place is super small but that still won't stop me from going. I wish the staff members were more friendly or even attempted to greet you. When they see you they kind of look away and its awkward. The service is not fast at all, and you will be lucky if you get a full sentence out of the waiters, especially the lady. They are lucky the food is literally AMAZING!
