Pretty good. I came here mainly because of the good deals for UNLV students (free soda with student ID and the coupon book deals). This place really reminds me of a Hawaiian version of Chipotle. The first time I came they let me try the different kinds of meat. They're all delicious, but my personal favorite is the steak. I would recommend going here, especially if you're a student at UNLV with a coupon book.
