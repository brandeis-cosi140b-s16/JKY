I frequent the Flamingo and 215 location of Lindo's but this was my first time at the Henderson location.  My friend lives in Salt Lake where good Mexican food is non-existent, so when she asked for some Mexican cuisine, I took her here.

The guacamole was unbelievably good!  It's prepared tableside and it had a nice amount of cilantro and jalapenos.  I had so much guac that I could not even touch the amazing chicken dish our server suggested I get.  It went home with my friend.  Service was great and the view is out of this world! You can see across all of Las Vegas.  Portions are huge.  You've been warned!
