I was a little hesitant to check this place out, why? Because it is a Mexican restaurant named, 'Phat Phrank's'. That saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover' stands true, as I was able to get over the name and try this place out.

Everything I have had is absolutely yum to the max! My favs:

*Chips and Guacamole* the best! 
Cheese Enchiladas
Bean, Rice and Cheese Burrito
Bean Tostada

Phat Phrank's is super reasonable and they deliver with no minimum charge.
