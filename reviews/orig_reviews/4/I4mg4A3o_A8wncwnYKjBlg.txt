Short review for a short visit to the new Casa Reyna restaurant attached to the fantastic grocery store located upstairs/next door. 

We stopped in for some chips, salsa and tacos after a long drive to town and experiencing the Incline. We sat at the bar since it was in between lunch and dinner and no one was really there. The chips and 2 salsas (salsa roja and peanut/guajillo) were pretty awesome. The roja was spicy and fresh and the peanut/guajillo was sweet and savory at the same time and a nice change of pace. The chips were fantastic. Thin, super crispy, practically perfect and made from scratch in house. 

The tacos were solid but inconsistent. The corn tortillas were fresh and tasty and doubled up on each taco. Carnitas was easily the star of the show with plenty of seasoning and properly cooked with slight crisp and very tender meat. The lamb barbacoa was well cooked but didn't offer much in the way of flavor or salt beyond the meat itself. Definitely needed some spice in there. The least successful was the lengua which was unfortunately chewy and lacking the the luscious texture I love in great tongue. 

Pleasant interior feel, very clean and comfortable. Good overall experience and I'd highly recommend stopping in to give them a shot.
