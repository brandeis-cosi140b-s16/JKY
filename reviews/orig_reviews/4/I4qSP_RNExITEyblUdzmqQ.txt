The prices were a bit steep, but the portions are humongous. My sister and I split a torta. The tortas were absolutely good, and juicy. The salsa was smokey and added much flavor the the sandwich. The fresh juices were delicious and portions were amazing. A definite jewel in Phoenix. Oh, I wish you branch out towards Los Angeles. (:
