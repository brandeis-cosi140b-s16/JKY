Killer Tacos from Outer space! Not really Outer space. Just Pecos and Tropicana. The tacos are killer though.

I'm intrigued by Taco Taco because:

MUSIC: It's really loud and goes from Red Hot Chili Peppers to some hardcore Mexicana shit that brought back memories of a booze cruise in Cabo wih ten professional surfers, jungle juice bong and wrestling masks. GOOD TIMES.(Donkey were not present on the booze cruise.)

CASHIER: She is a darker version of Shakira, dresses really stylish and either wears a jewel or has a flippin piercing in her forehead. Whatever the case I think she looks like a gypsy and it's awesome!

SALSA BAR: Yes, this salsa bar wins and then wins again when the other salsa bars are checking their smart phones for tips on how to win. The salsa bar has over eight different salsas, carrot/onion mix, peppers, limes and other shit I know is there, but didn't reach for. It's always clean and well stocked.

FOOD: It's all about the tacos. I've only done the carne asada and it's pretty bomb. They don't destroy it by slopping on a fist full of guac. either like another taco shop on E. Charleston across from the old Macayo Vegas. Tacos are $2 a pop and full of meat. It's a deal. The burrito? Not so much. I swear it was $6 for the carne asada burrito and it had more rice and beans nonsense than meat. Stick with the tacos, add chips for $1.25 and head on over to the buffet of salsa. 

Overall Taco Taco is a solid taco option for people near this area. The staff is friendly and fast and the restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating and the tacos are the best in the neighborhood. Ideal spot for a quick lunch or a long romantic one with your special whorechatta or lil' bambinos.
