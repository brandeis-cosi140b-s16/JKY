12/07 Warm blue and white corn tortilla chips were served with a pair of salsas and a warm bean dip.  My wife ordered the blue corn chicken enchiladas and a soda.  I opted for the taco sampler again, this time receiving what I ordered, namely birria (goat), rock shrimp and carnitas (pulled pork).  My dish was very good though the birria was a little too strong flavored.  My wife's enchiladas made a disappearing act from her plate and I can only take her word for it that they were delicious.   In order to meet the $35 minimum purchase requirement on our restaurant.com (R.com) gift certificate we were forced to order a coffee flan.  Our bill exceeded the requirement by a mere 81 cents before tax and gratuity were added.  

09/07 This is an upscale Mexican restaurant in terms of both dcor and menu.  We were served a colorful basket of warm tortilla chips along with 3 salsas.  We shared a bowl of black bean and smoked cheddar soup that was finished with a spoonful of salsa fresca and cilantro.  Ms. Westie ordered the shrimp and crab stacked enchiladas with sweet corn and chili sauce and micro greens.  I opted for the taco sampler - birria de chivo (marinated goat, avocado puree, cilantro and onion), carnitas with nopales salsa and tomato purcee and fresh fish with Mexican slaw and salsa fresca.  The kitchen made a mistake preparing carne asada (grilled skirt steak) instead of the carnitas, not a problem since all 3 tacos were delicious.  When I brought the mistake to the waiter's attention, he offered to bring me an additional taco, but I was satiated and waived him off.
