The food is so good! but they have a TERRIBLE LINE SYSTEM!!! 

One of the best taco spots I have been to and I come from the land of taco spots.

The parking lot and area is pretty sketchy. Not one of Vegas prettiest places Inside looks exactly like King Taco but instead of spinning rotisserie chicken, they have spinning Adobada. 

Again the ordering line system is terrible. They have 3 different lines for different cuts of meat. So if you want multiple types of meat, you have to stand in different long ass lines. And some people literally order 10 tacos at a time. I feel bad for the Adobada carver who has to cut those orders! After you order, you go to the register and pay. I really wonder how many people get there food and just bounce without paying. 

Taco De Asada - $2 - Steak was seasoned perfectly and loaded with fresh veggies and guac. 

Taco De Adobada - $2 - Pork had a very light kick, not spicy, and loaded with the same veggies and guac. 

Tostada De Asada - $2 - Bascily the same as the taco but you get a crispy tortilla instead of a soft one. Next time I am going to just ask for the crispy shell on the side and get a taco.

Campechana Fries, half - $6 - Half carne and half Adobada, you get the best of both worlds! Fries were soft thin fries and loaded with cheese meat and guac. One of the best Mexican fries I have ever had. 

Grilled Peppers - Free and freaking legit. Grilled soft and tender and so good!

They hide the salsa at the register so make sure you ask for a bunch when you pay. Seems like they keep that under lock and key

Honestly one of the best meals I had in Vegas. So good and so cheap. Now I want to try the SD location.
