Yum. The enchilada-style tamales are oh so tasty. Probably some of the best red enchilada sauce I have ever had. Carne asada was fairly generic, though. 

The tamales with red enchilada sauce, a pitcher or margaritas (not wimpy and very tasty!!), and sopapillas are completely decadent and a good way to cut a long night short. :-)
