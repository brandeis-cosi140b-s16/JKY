La Hacienda is one of the dining options inside  the super classy Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. It provides a very unique flavor of modern mexican cuisine which is oh so fresh and delicious.It is surprisingly light compared to what one would expect from traditional mexican cuisine. Would highly recommend. 

A friend and I went for dinner during the weekend but were still surprised to see it was decently crowded. We didnt have reservations but were promptly seated. The complimentary chips and salsa were really good but the star was the fresh guacomole that is prepared at the table . It is one of the freshest and tastiest i have ever had. 
For the main course my friend ordered the tuna and I had the crab enchillada and both were great . The presnetation of the food was also good . 
For dessert we shared the tres leches with strawberry salsa which was so fresh and flavorful. 
Would definitely come again.
