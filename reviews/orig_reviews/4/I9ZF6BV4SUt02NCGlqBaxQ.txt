Pretty good option for dinner in the MGM. 

The table-side guacamole and salsa were delicious with the warm tortilla chips they served. We ordered the guacamole spicy but it definitely could have used a little more heat.

I also had one of their margaritas on the rocks which was delicious though my friends who ordered frozen margaritas said they could have been stronger. 

I ordered the chicken enchiladas which were really good but again they could have been a bit spicier.

Service was fine and the ambiance was nice. If you're looking for a tamer version of Mexican, this is a good place to go.
