After getting several refills on our yard margarita, my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner here one evening while on our Vegas vacation.

Let me first start with the margaritas... you get a full pitcher of your choice of margarita in a colored yard glass (plastic) which is easy, and fun, to carry around the Strip. We kept returning with our glass to get discounted refills. It was pretty awesome. The downside is they won't mix flavors for you. Also, after the 3rd one you start to crave other booze.

Now for dinner: Our waiter was very efficient. The chips and yummy salsa arrived on our table immediately after being seated. I ordered the Baracoa beef enchiladas - they were AMAZING! I got 3 enchiladas and a side of rice and beans. It was a lot of food, I was unable to finish my meal. The prices are comparable with other Mexican restaurants I have been to in Wisconsin. 

I loved how this resturant had a private feel, even though it was inside New York New York.  I would recommend stopping here if you are wandering around the strip and get a craving for Mexcian food :)
