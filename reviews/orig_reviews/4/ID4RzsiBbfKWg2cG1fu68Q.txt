Couldn't wait to get to this place--thank goodness I was not disappointed, I hate when that happens!!

Hubby and I went on a Saturday night, very early at 5:45, not what we wanted, but that's the only ressie time that was available via Open Table.  Anyhoo--we could have walked in until 7:00 and still gotten a seat.  Patio was open and it was a lovely night, perfect for some margaritas!  I had the hibiscus and he had the regular--both were served in rocks glasses, and although small, they were just right!

We ordered the trio of salsas and also had their verde salsa. My favorite was the habanero pepita--his was the smoked chipotle, both nice and spicy and went well with the margaritas!  

For dinner my hubby had the carne asada and I had the fish tacos.  While the tacos were tasty, they were just as good as anybody else's fish tacos--nothing really that special.  The black beans and rice that accompanied them were the same.  Hubby's carne asada  had a nice presentation when it came to the table, and the beef was done perfectly.  The star of the show, however, was the sweet potato gratin that came as a side with his order.  OMG--to die for--I could have eaten an entire 11x13 pan!!!  

Next time I go--I will go back--I will have the chips and three salsas, a margarita, and a plateful of sweet potato gratin!
