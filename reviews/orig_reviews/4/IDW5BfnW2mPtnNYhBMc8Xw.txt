The food here is great!  I agree with those that believe the food here is good.  I've eaten Mexican food throughout Phoenix and this is one of the best.  I live in Southern California, and I can't find anything that compares.  I love the salsa and bean dip with chips.  The combination meals are great.  Their chimichangas and burritos are fantastic.  What I also love is that the portions are large, so I always have a midnight snack or breakfast for the next day.  Arriba!
