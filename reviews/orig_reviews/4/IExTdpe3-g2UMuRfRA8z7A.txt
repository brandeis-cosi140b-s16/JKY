I love Gallo Blanco, so I was pretty excited about this new offering, and I wasn't disappointed.  I was there with a group of nine for happy hour/dinner.  I can't be effusive enough about how attentive the staff was, and how gracious they were about our many requests.  It seemed like every time the server approached the table, he left with another order.  We had the ceviche, guacamole, chicken paella, steak tacos, coconut pudding, and key lime pie.  Everything was amazing.  The wine menu was a little light, but someone (I think she was the manager) told us that they'd had a meeting with a wine distributor earlier in the day and would be expanding the wine menu in the coming weeks.

If you like Gallo Blaco, you'll like the additions to the menu offered by Otro Cafe.  The space itself is crisp and clean, although not particularly large.  I foresee long waits as word gets about this place.
