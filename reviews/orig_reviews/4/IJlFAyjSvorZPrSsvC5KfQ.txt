I have been eatng at Carolinas for many a year when they only had the 1 shop on Mohave.  When I saw they were opening up on Cactus & Cave Creek,  I was very happy.  I would just like to add a few thoughts to the many reviews.  The consensus of myself and 3 friends that have lived in the valley for over 50 years is: #1 arguebly the best beans around #2 they do have the best tortillas and yes they should be a bit chewy.  The alternative is dry so they crack and leak, no way. #3 they have no salsa, they have hot sauce.  For me, way too garlicky, so I bring it home and docter it up to my liking.  Tacos are good, red and green chili better than average. chips over cooked, but better than tostitos.  Enchildas, better than av.  So all in all, its the beans that keep me coming back.  A mexican food rest. needs 4 things to be 5 star, Hot sauce, chips, flour tortillas and good beans.  Carolinas slips a bit on the hot sauce and chips hence the 4 stars.
