Best flavorful food out of all Mexican fast casual restaurant chains.  My favorite two items are the tacos and the salad.  The tacos with grilled chicken rock!  I added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful. The taco salads are great also.  Lots of flavor.  Unlike other previous reviewers I do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant.  Read the website, take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed.  Staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but I don't consider this full service.  They have daily specials unlike chipotle or Qdoba and outdoor seating options.  Check out the drink options,  amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade.  Delicious
