Me and my family went to this location for the first time. We has been to Tacos El Gordo before but decided to go to this one. We ordered carne asada tacos and tacos al pastor along with a couple of sopes. Overall, it was good. The tortilla on the al pastor tacos was different though. It was yellow and slighter tougher. The carne asada torilla was much softer and tasted fresher. Overall, I would come to Tacos El Gordo again but not this specific location.
