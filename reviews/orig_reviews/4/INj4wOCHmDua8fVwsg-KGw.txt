I've been going to Chapala's for many, many years. I even remember when they were in their old location with the fountain and had a large golden rooster in the middle of the restaurant. Their new location has no fountain or large golden rooster, but the food  is still just as good as it's always been. 

Chapala's service is pretty good it just depends on which waiter or waitress you get. But if you get one of the good servers they will be quick to get you your drinks, chips and salsa and of course your order. I will say no matter how busy they are the food comes out fast and tasty. 

Some of my favorite things to order are the Taco Salad. It's huge and comes with all the yummy Mexican items you want. I love to get it with chicken. It's marinaded in a red sauce that mixes in with the salad. Yum!! When I was younger I'd love to get the special with the two Chicken Burritos enchilada style of course. My friend and I would order this eat one and take the rest home for when we had the munchies later. On my most recent visit I had the ala cart Pork Tamale in a red sauce. The masa was flavorful and soft and the red sauce had a great spice. Plus, it was covered in gooey cheese. Basically I haven't had a bad meal here.

Pro Tip: Mix the mild and spicy salsas together. Yum!
