What's the best place in the neighborhood if you want a burrito or some street tacos? The answer depends on what time it is. If it happens to be before 11PM, it's Taqueria Mi Casita - they just changed their hours as they used to close at 10PM most days. If you missed that window, there's still Los Favoritos on Chandler and Dobson, NE corner. And if you missed that window, you're stuck with 24/7 places like Filiberto's or Amado's. I like this place because you can see them make your burrito or tacos to order right in front of you. I tried most of their meats but I'm partial to their carnitas - it's tastier than their carne asada. You can add as much as you want of condiments and extras and they don't nickle and dime you for sour cream or guacamole like a lot of other places do. The guys there always greet me with "hey friend" and that's cool with me. Prices are pretty cheap and you definitely get some value - your buck does some banging! I sometimes also get their "Grandmother's Flan" if I'm craving some flan - there's is about as good as anyone else's. Used to come here for lunch a lot but I guess word got out and they always seem to be busy - there's not a whole lot of seating there. Lots of parking - Same mall as Tao Garden, Tokyo House, and Video Paradise.
