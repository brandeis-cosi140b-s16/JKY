At first my thoughts were "really? Another Mexican restaurant in downtown Gilbert??" But, this one is completely different than the others! I love the atmosphere!  Happy hour prices are great. We had the carnitas with green chile appetizer and it was amazing. My husband had some kind of brisket burrito which was huge and very tasty. I had tacos - they were just ok. I don't like that you have to ask for chips and salsa. Regular menu prices are a bit high I think.
