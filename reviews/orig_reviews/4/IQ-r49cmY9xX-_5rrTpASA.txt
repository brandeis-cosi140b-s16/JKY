Mi Patio catering was food at a recent party I went to in Phoenix. Mostly great Mexican food, with a hint of Greek food thrown in (I was told there was a family connection). Hence, delicious fajita filling AND guilt-inducing spanakopita (edit: more like spinach-filled egg rolls, to be precise). I prolly won't make it to Phoenix Friday tonight, but it'll be worth going!
