This high end Latin-American food restaurant was actually a last minute decision. I use to play in a youth orchestra that was hosted just next door in the old mission and didn't know this was now a restaurant. The ambiance is dim and romantic. Definitely has a Spanish feel. The patio is amazing, especially on a clear, starry, warm night. The patio is cozy with a large brick fireplace, comfortable chairs, and a secluded location a midst downtown Scottsdale. The menu is to die for! So many unique foods: Peruvian clam stew, swordfish, octopus, etc. My friend and I each got a drink- the capirinhia was ok. Nothing special. The cheese place was very tasty and had a lot of variety of flavors to mix, but there wasn't much to eat. My friend got the swordfish entree. Mmm! Very hearty fish with 2 sides. The flavoring and seasoning is what made the dish. I got the Creekside filet *the most expensive dish on the menu*. SO worth it! The filey mignon was cooked rare (though I asked for medium), but again the spices and seasoning were so unique and savory, I took my time enjoying each bite! It came with a side of white bean grits (also very tasty, but filling). If you want a great night out with a group or a romantic dinner for 2, go here. By the way, I believe his name is Johnathan, but he's a great server and honest about the menu selections.
