A fun, lively atmosphere, solid food, and good service make this one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. The top item to try is the one they're known for -- the flaming fajitas. It's a tableside show of high flames that kids will love. The beef and chicken fajitas for two is the way to go. Portion sizes were large enough that two of us had some left to take home. 

Their guacamole is plenty good as are their margaritas, which they have several to choose from. Try a two item combo if you can't decide what to get. I opted for a chicken tamale that had a masa texture that was somewhat thick and gummy, but the flavor was solid. The al pastor burrito was filled with chunks of smokey, deep flavored pork. To finish the meal we tried their churros -- unfortunately too oily.

This place doesn't try to redefine the cuisine, they just do a solid job of executing typical Mexican-American fare at decent prices in a great atmosphere.
