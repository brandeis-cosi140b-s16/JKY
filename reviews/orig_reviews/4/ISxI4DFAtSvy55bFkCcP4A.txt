I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who directed me to a table on the patio.  It was 76 degrees outside and the heater was blaring over the table.  I asked if I could be moved, which she did no problem.

The hostess gave a few suggestions since I had never been before.  I ordered the braised beef and avacado cheese crisp.  How tasty and unique!  Very nice blend of meat, avacado, cilantro, cheese and tomato.   A bit on the salty side, but the hot sauce accompanying it toned that down.

I absolutely LOVED the sangria, although at $8, it was a bit over-priced, but tasty nonetheless.  I ordered a second cuz I'm on holidays.  

If I lived here, Blanco probably wouldn't be a big deal.  But it is set just outside Borgata, a great shopping attraction.   I loved the patio, the staff were friendly, the food and drink very good.  

For someone escaping winter and wanting a patio, tex mex and a nice setting, this will do the trick.
