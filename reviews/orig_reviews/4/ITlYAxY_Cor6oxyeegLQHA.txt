Top atmosphere restaurant coupled with great food and service.

My husband and I ate at The Mission on a Wed. and even during the week reservations are needed. (Open Table)

We SHARED the:
Table Side Guacamole $12.00 (Requested Extra Spicy) -  Good but not amazing like other yelpers have described..... and it wasn't exactly table side because where we were seated on the patio wouldn't allow for the Guac. cart to come through.

Pork Shoulder (serves two) $32.00 - Amazing and not just because it's pork! The presentation of the tortillas was pleasant and the portion was more than enough for two, although we had to ask for seconds on the tortillas to finish off the great pork meat.

Drinks: Strawberry & Cinnamon Margarita - Good & Strong for a light weight like myself

My husband had some sort of Don Julio something or other.

The dessert was strange, Espresso Churros + milkshake $8.00. Wasn't a fan of the dessert but the meal overall was great.

The patio is romantic and they offer blankets if you get chilled in the evening air.

I highly recommend The Mission.
