Wife and I came during vacation and arrived about 10 minutes after opening. There were already 3 parties there at 11am. Promising.

Orders were taken at the cashier, then sat down with a number. The menu was a little confusing with all these caveats and pricing schemes, but at the end of the day, we got some tacos and we liked them.

*** FOOD ***
They allow you to create "meals", so we got two - one with 2 gourmet tacos and another 3 street tacos. 

Cochinita Pibil Street Taco (5/5)
Mouthwatering and delicious. Pork was super juicy and well worth it. You'll see this in many other reviews and there's a reason for that. 

Al Pastor Street Taco (2/5)
I have a habit of always trying my favorite meat everywhere even if the reviews suggest otherwise. Wasn't really a fan, flavor was a bit lacking. 

Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Gourmet Taco (4/5)

Cabo Shrimp Gourmet Taco (4/5)


*** DRINK ***
I have two categories of Mexican places. Places that serve horchatas and places that don't. (The latter contends with Taco Bell.) However, living on the east coast most of my life, I haven't seen anything other than a normal horchata... I had a pleasant surprise here.

Fruit & Pecan Horchata (5/5) 
Topped with strawberries, pecans, and a healthy dose of cinnamon, this had enough body (i.e., not watered down) to take on the sweetness delivered by the fruit and still taste like an horchata. It was novel and delicious. Highly recommended.

*** BOTTOM LINE ***
Check it out. It's worth it. Get an horchata. And one to go.
