We've lived basically down the street from La Pinata since 2003 and had never been. Tonight, that changed everything.

I found myself for the second time today in a restaurant with a penchant for cocks. Roosters, that is. It was crazy, especially when you consider I raised chickens for 4-H growing up. So, I know a thing or two about poultry.

But, enough about that. Back to the restaurant. I really was diging on the interior and all the swanky and low booths and the fowl covered walls.

The food lived up to expectations that we formed from other reviews. The portions are insanely huge. In a way where you want to ask your server, "Do I look like 3 people? How do you think I'll even eat half of this?!?!" But it's all good and some times I like my small stomach because I can relive tonight's experience tomorrow for lunch. Oh, happy day.

I didn't drink any alcohol during dinner (don't worry. I'm feeling fine. Not sick, not coming down with anything, won't be turning down booze, just wasn't in the mood. So quit looking at me like that. I'm drinking right now, if that makes anything better.) and I would have liked to have a lot more water, but our bill was reasonable when one consideres there were 2 margaritas and four beers drunk at the table.
