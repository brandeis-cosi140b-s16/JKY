Love this Mexican food for a dinner out on the weekends,
My husband LOVES hot and they have hot and I like it mild and they have that as well the green chilis are so good I cant even explain to you how good they are.

Real authentic food and not a bad price for good food.
We have five kids under eight and they all love it here lots of food for a small price. The girls favorite is they order a large home made pizza size tortilla with a ton of cheese on it it comes on a metal pizza pan thats how large it is

I think the only issue I do have is they charge for a second basket of chips for $2.95 but were not talking just plain chips and salsa they bring out a basket of chips with 
2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip which is HOT but so good you cant stop eating it..so have plenty of water on the table before you start LOL
