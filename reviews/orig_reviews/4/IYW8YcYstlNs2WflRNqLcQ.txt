I wasn't all that hungry when I walked by Blanco around 11am, but was intrigued enough by the option of a machaca burrito that I decided to give it a go. Machaca, as I typically have it, is a beef cooked in its delicious juices until it's plenty succulent. This didn't taste like any machaca I had had before, it had almost a chocolatey flavor to it. Not what I was expecting but not bad either. The cheese in the burrito added to the richness.

I'd gladly come back here again
