Great atmosphere, very nice crowd, like sitting at bar for dinner, always find a congenial person(s) to talk to. Food: not as good as authentic New Mexican food served in New Mexico, but that's my opinion. Much better than average AZ Mexican type fare, have had blue corn enchiladas, very tasty but needed much more "kick". I like my Mexican food spicy, someone who prefers mild would be totally satisfied. I just kept dumping hot sauce on my food. 
Habanero burger: just a big, juicy burger with a lot of spice and nice sides, salad and fries. A great burger, but would be inclined to order from the Mexican dishes menu. After all a burger is a burger. I don't think you come to Carlsbad Tavern for a burger, you come for New Mexico type food.

Dined here some years back, my recollection was that the chips and salsa were free at one time, but of course not now. Considering chips and salsas are inexpensive ingredients, I think they should be gratis. Far less well known Mexican restaurants put a platter of chips and salsa in front of you when you sit down to dine. 

 All in all, a very pleasant atmospheric place to dine, bartenders very friendly and helpful, laid pack place to relax. I would NOT call this comparable to true New Mexico cuisine. I have not tries Los Dos Molinos yet, have heard they are authentic , wish they had a Scottsdale branch.
