Never heard of this place until bf found it on Yelp. Definitely authentic New Mexican restaurant- menu reminded me of the times I've spent down there. 
  Bf got Breakfast Burrito with ham & bacon and green sauce but not wet (he avoids wet burritos when possible)- he really liked it and ate the whole thing.
  I got the Navajo Taco- love fry bread- with 2 sides (calabacitas- good, posole- stomach gave up before I got to it, so I'll be having it for lunch) & cinnamon sugar sopapilla- very light and fluffy and not too much sugar. The Navajo Taco came with a generous amount of meat and the green sauce was really good (albeit a little spicy for me). My favorite part was the fry bread even though I forgot to ask them to put it on top (I hate soggy bread), but it worked out because it was thick enough to not get too soggy.
