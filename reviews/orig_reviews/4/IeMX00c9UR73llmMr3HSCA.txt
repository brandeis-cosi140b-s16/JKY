The old menu and old recipes are back and so are we!!  We were so happy to hear that the food had returned to its former glory after the dark days of Mi Casa's ill-fated menu change. 

We were also very happy to walk in, be seated, and see Cameron walk up to us already knowing our order even after 6 months away.  There is a reason why we love him above all others.  He has a fantastic disposition, promptly refills drinks, is friendly to our kids, remembers our order and always has something nice to say every time we see him. Service with a smile?  Yes please!  

If you weren't a fan of the menu change, go back and give Mi Casa's another try, and ask for Cameron!
