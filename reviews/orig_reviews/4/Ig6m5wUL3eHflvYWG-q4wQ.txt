Came here for a late lunch, early dinner.  They are closed on Monday, which I dicovered last Monday.  Not too much parking space on  a busy day, but this day it was fine.
 The food is a bit different. Yes, it is Mexican Food ,but New Mexico , Mexican Food.  They are more famous i think, for the drinks they serve. Though i like the food it is good, I like the more traditional Mexican food. It is just a bit too hot for me.
Hey the older you get the harder it is to go spicey.  Service is good, and lots of people love it!
