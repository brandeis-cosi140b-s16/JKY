Myself and my sis drove down to this place which was very close to our hotel in Vegas.  It was little hard to find this place since the lights from the strip club beside cover up the place mostly. I liked the ambiance very much and the place isn't very crowded usually at 7ish. Liked the free chips they served along with 3 different varities of salsa as starters and used a coupon from yelp to claim a free margarita. The burrito was huge and served 2 people sufficiently. I am sure this place is one of the good places to eat mexican food while in Vegas.
