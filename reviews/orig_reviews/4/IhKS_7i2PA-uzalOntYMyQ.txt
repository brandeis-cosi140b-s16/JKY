Enjoyed a great dinner here outside on the patio. Started with complimentary guacamole thanks to Yelp check-in! Very tasty! The Pescado tacos were delicious - plantain crusted mahi mahi with a chipotle sauce, avocado and pickled red cabbage -yum! The Pancita al Pastor was amazing - glazed pork belly - moist and delicious - so good. Try the Pollito a la Yucateca - marinated smoked chicken with popcorn grits and an orange habanero glaze  - delicious. Portions were on the small side, but the food was different and delicious. Staff was very friendly and attentive.
