This place was a super fun stop for lunch while we were exploring Cave Creek!  My girlfriends that live in Buckeye had been here before, and wanted to take me and our other girlfriend while we were out visiting, and I'm soo happy they did!  What a cool, unique little spot!  The perfect place for lunch and margaritas on a hot Arizona afternoon!  

This is a huge restaurant, and when you walk in they have a nice little area with palm trees and a walkway that leads you to the main restaurant and their duck/turtle pond!  Its inside this little courtyard, and the seating is all around this neat pond area.  There were lots of mallards around, and also at least two different species of turtles sunning on rocks and swimming in the water!  Also they had a little station where you could buy feed for the animals, just put in a quarter and you get pellets to feed them!  When we did this, we saw there were also huge koi fish living in the water as well!  Very beautiful and large fish, really cool to see!  

Anyway, about the restaurant...we asked to sit at a table by the water, so we waited a bit, but decided to go to the bar and get margaritas...they were REALLY good!  My margarita was definitely top notch, and it was perfect to chill in this nice little room by the bar while we waited for our table.  Once our table was ready, we got chips and salsa, which were also very good...I really liked their salsa especially, it tasted like it might have been homemade?  I ordered their Plato Burro, fried, with chicken, and it was good.  Came with rice and beans, and did have a lot of chicken in it which was nice.  Typical Mexican food, but good!  Our server was also very sweet and friendly, and was quick with drinks and food as well! 

El Encanto definitely excels in atmosphere and the feel of the place is very special...my girlfriends and I had a wonderful time, with good food and drinks, and would definitely go back next time we are in the area!
