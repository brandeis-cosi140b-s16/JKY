Finally went to dinner here last night with my boyfriend and his mother. I had the chicken enchiladas which were wonderful!  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce on top was flavorful. My only complaint was that I would want a bit more sauce on top. Both my boyfriend and his mother had tacos. They had chicken, beef and pork. They thought they were fantastic and fresh. Overall,  a great dinner!
