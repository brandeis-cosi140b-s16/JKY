Stopped in for a late lunch today and everything was pretty spot on.  I tend to give most Mexican restaurants three stars because they're pretty much all the same and pretty average.  What I do look for is great service, great chips and salsa, and great chicken tortilla soup.  Today, all of those were met.  Our server was on top of it -- very helpful and friendly.  The red salsa was just ok, but the green salsa and bean dip were delicious and the chips were light, crispy, and warm.  I ordered two street tacos that were pretty plain with not much flavor, but I added some salsa and that did the trick.  The chicken tortilla soup wasn't the best I've ever had but was pretty darn good.  Overall, it was a pretty good lunch and I'm sure I'll be back soon!
