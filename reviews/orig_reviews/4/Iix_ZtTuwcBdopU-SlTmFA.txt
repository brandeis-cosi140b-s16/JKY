Well, it's been over a year since last time I ate here. Rito's isn't exactly close to work, but I decided to have the same thing. Green burro, enchilada style and it was just as good as I remembered it to be. This sauce has to be made from scratch, it taste like the home made sauce that mom would use when making the Christmas tamales. Wow! pure heaven.
