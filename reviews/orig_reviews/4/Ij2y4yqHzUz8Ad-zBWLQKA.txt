I was a little weary about coming here, because for some reason in my head I was thinking it was a Baja Fresh/Rubios type place, boy was I wrong.

Most importantly, I think they made me the freshest squeezed margarita I've ever had. I also ordered some food, the delicious Adobo Pulled Pork sandwich, and guess what, it came with fries AND onion rings! I hate having to choose. 

Other than our entire experience being positive, the only thing I'd say could use some help is maybe the decor. Kinda bland, the bar is the best part, we didn't hang out inside much since we sat on the patio, so maybe some more plants on the patio to block the view of the parking lot.
