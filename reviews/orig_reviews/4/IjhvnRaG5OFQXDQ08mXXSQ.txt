Quick, fast and cheap.. and decent food for the price, service and ambiance oopsI mean a no ambiance but hey they have the best tortillas in town and those hole in the wall places have the best food sometimes... In this case it was delish!  I don't mind that it was dirty!  LOL!  Had the Machacha Burro and it was all shredded beef but damn it was good for 3.50.  I can understand why the place is packed to the gills during lunch as I had been working near the airport and nothing too exciting around there without driving too much further during a short lunch break.  Friends ordered beef tacos and cheese enchaladas and said they were great!  Will visit again!
