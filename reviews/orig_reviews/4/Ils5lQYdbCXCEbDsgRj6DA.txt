I was pleasantly surprised with Yolos, I'd say it gets a 3.5, but I'll round up because I was not expecting to like it. 

My husband and I had just checked into our room at PH and were borderline hangry, so we needed some food in our bellies pronto. We downed the chips and salsa like it was our job until we could have a rational conversation again, and then ordered some drinks. I tried the jalapeno cucumber margarita, which was excellent, but my advice is to drink it fast because after sipping it for a while the jalapenos definitely infused the liquid and it got SUPER spicy. 

For my entree, I ordered the vegetable enchiladas with cilantro rice, and they were excellent, stuffed full of lots of grilled veggies. The rice was very flavorful as well. 

All in all, nothing spectacular, but a tasty, reasonably priced choice.
