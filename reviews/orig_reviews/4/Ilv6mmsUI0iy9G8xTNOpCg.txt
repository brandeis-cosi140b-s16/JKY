Just went here for lunch with the shop. I liked the provided chips and salsa. The chips were warm and seemed home-made. They gave us a warm green chili salsa, cold red salsa, warm bean dip with a meaty ham type flavor, and a white sour cream based cold dip. I love creamy dips so I mostly ate the white one. Our server helped us immediately, which is important when your entire shop is out to lunch (which for us was only 4 people). She brought us drinks and asked to take our order right away. We mostly ordered from the lunch special menu and my Chicken Quesadilla with green chiles was only like $6-7. After eating all those yummy chips I was only able to eat 3 out of 8 of the slices! I have a ton of leftovers.  As an added bonus, they give you a free sopapia at the end. It was fresh and so yummy. I would definitely go here more often if it wasn't so far from our shop.
