Tried this hidden gem for the first time tonight.  

The menu has something for everyone; gluten-free, vegetarian, and meat lovers!  The food is thoughtfully prepared and flavorful.  Paco hooked it up!

The service is fantastic! Amber was very attentive.

The restaurant shares the parking lot with Sapphire, so it was a little hard to find but don't let that deter you from trying this place.  Also, the restaurant has a great atmosphere and is family friendly.

I will definitely be back!
