I would have give it 5 stars if there weren't some issues with airheaded service and the outside patio type furniture with wire tables, so when i dropped a little sauce on the table it went through the table and onto my lap i.e. dress. EEEK. 
Lobster dip is to die for. The Sampler starter, which has lobster dip, huge delicious grilled shrimps and 4 delicious mini crab cakes is perfect and fairly size for the price. then the entree of the Lobster Tamale and Shrimp stuffed Anaheim pepper was perfectly delicious and robust. Really good table side Salsa too. YUM
