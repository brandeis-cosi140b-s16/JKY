Went with friends for lunch. Authentic tacos, fast service and very reasonably priced. 
Good selection, guacamole tasted great. All food is being made as you order it and it is going out the door pretty fast so very fresh. We ate outside under a covered area, however the air conditioner was not working so it was a little uncomfortable.
