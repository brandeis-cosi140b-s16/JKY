This is a unique place. Your first impression is "sketchy".  Type of place you would only go in with a recommendation or if you were local. I'm glad we got a recommendation because this was a good eat. I had the burrito norteno with green chilli; very good. Shark and shrimp tacos for the rest of the table and it all looked good with good comments. 

This is a small place with only ten tables and a small bar. The service is quick despite obvious take out orders and a full dining room. Salsa is homemade and presented in Tupperware on an ice bar, with a ton of different choices. 

Ambiance is interesting, true to its name. 


Tip o the hat - coke served in glass bottles 

Wage of the finger - find a better presentation for your awesome salsas.
