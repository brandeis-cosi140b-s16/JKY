My timing was perfect as My girlfriend and I stopped  by on a Sunday afternoon. We came in at 6 right before happy hour was over. We walked in and noticed there were a few different sections to order from. We decided to sit in the bar and just order the way we're used to ordering . I had a taco de carne asada, lengua and al pastor. She ordered a mexican style street corn. The bartender Eddie was very friendly and made the stop even more enjoyable! Now on to the food! The tacos were very tasty as was the corn according to my gf. The tacos came with everything and they were filling! I also enjoyed the salsa bar which contained multiple salsas, breaks,carrots and peppers. This place is pretty far from me but I would definitely come back!
