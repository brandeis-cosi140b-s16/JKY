Great small and authentic place!  Yeah, as others have said, maybe not the "best" neighborhood, but we had no issues.  The place is small, so plan to wait if you come in the busy time.  QUALITY food for sure and mainly seafood based but thankfully for me they have non-seafood items for folks like me who don't care for seafood.
Everyone at the table loved what we got and would certainly come back again!
