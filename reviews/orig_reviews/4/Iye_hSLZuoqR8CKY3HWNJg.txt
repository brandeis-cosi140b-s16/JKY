I'm in town visiting a friend of mine, and last night we dined here on here suggestion--so glad we did! 

The hostess let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait, but let us know we could grab a seat on the patio and order drinks and appetizers. (Or grab a seat at the bar - they're first come first serve. But it was pretty full.) 

I love the atmosphere here! Very "Art Deco" in my opinion.. Funky wallpaper, awesome lighting/glass work around the bar, headlights on the walls that lit up as it got dark! The staff was all very friendly and helpful, and brought candles to all the tables as the sun was setting outside. Not to mention the 3 or 4 extra large doors they had open, giving the whole place a very laid-back vibe. 

We opted for a spot on an outside couch, and were welcomed with chips and water. Before we had a chance to order anything, we were getting seated! (10-15 minutes) 

Our waitress was a doll, and recommended the blood orange margarita. It was strong (I love a strong drink) and was perfectly sweet. Definitely a winner. The chips were really good, they tasted fresh! The salsa was excellent as well, but too spicy for me to try more than a few times. 

I had 'The [Chicken] Enchiladas' and they were tasty! It's too smaller enchiladas that equal the size of what you'd except the size of one to be, served with half red sauce and half green sauce - very cool!

The enchilada itself was delicious, very flavorful and the meat was juicy. The red sauce was my favorite - full of flavor and a little bit of kick. The green sauce fell a little flat for me, I found it somewhat bland - which was a major bummer because green sauce is my jam! I appreciated that it wasn't smothered in cheese, like you usually see in American versions of Mexican food.  

I would be a regular if I lived in town. Great food, vibe, service, and prices!
