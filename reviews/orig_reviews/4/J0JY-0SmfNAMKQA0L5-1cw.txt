Doesn't seem like the reviews are too good on this place, but personally I really like it.  Before I used to just go to the one in the Miracle Mile Shop just for the margaritas-by-the-yard.  But a few years ago I actually went there to eat lunch.

I ended up splitting a salad with someone else & then eating my own entree.  What I do remember is LOVING the salad.  Now I am NOT a salad eater, but this salad stayed on my mind and I made sure the next time I went to Vegas I would go there again.

So now everytime I go to Vegas I make it a point to stop at one of the La Salsa Cantinas to eat my Chile-Lime Salad (I also have them add either the strips of steak or chicken on top).  I LOVE IT!  I CRAVE IT!!
