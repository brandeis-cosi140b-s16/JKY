The hubby and I have been waiting for this little Taco Shop to open up (hadn't heard of the other locations) and were there opening day.  Great relaxed environment, friendly staff (though it was the first day...so I'm sure they were on good behavior), fair prices ($5 for a burrito) and a ton of sauce selections.  Hubby loved the carne asada and raved about the tortilla...just enough chewy to soft ratio.  I enjoyed the bean burro and we're looking forward to future fun on their patio with friends.  Looks like they have a good happy hour deal and would be perfect for hangin' around a random Thursday night.
