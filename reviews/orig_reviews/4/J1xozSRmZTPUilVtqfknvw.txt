I really enjoy Faustos. Their taste is superior to Roberto's. It's not authentic Mexican people, as good as it might be, there is no cheddar cheese or french fries in authentic Mexican food. 

The carnitas tacos are really good but I recommend ordering them without tomato. By far my favorite is the Nevada Burrito and I would recommend everyone to try it. It is a carne asada burrito with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and the awesome kick are the french fries inside the burrito. 

The restaurant is a little cram and they are super popular so their flow is pretty constant. You are better off ordering ahead or ordering to go. The parking lot is a bit of a hassle especially during dinner time because of their close proximity to Panda Express and Subway. My biggest issue though is the rude staff unfortunately, my rating is based on taste and food quality. I really don't appreciate it when the cashier lady is talking about "poison" and "what's good for them" in Spanish, not cool in my book when you're ordering food.
