I was in Vegas last week and Leticia's was on my food list to try.  Here is my review on my experience:

Leticia's is a nice-looking restaurant.  The d√©cor is pleasing to the eye and they have patio dining.  I opted for the inside.  To start, they offer chips with a tomatillo sauce and a darker salsa which was really good.  They also offer a small dish of refried beans.  I ordered the Carnitas plate which comes with your choice of soup (they offered two) or a salad.  I got the salad with the house vinaigrette.  That vinaigrette was fabulous!  The Carnitas plate came with refried beans, rice, guac and pico de gallo.  The pork was fork tender and fragrant.  The corn tortillas were warm.  I totally enjoyed my meal.  The service was good, albeit intrusive.  I like attention to my table, but not so much where everyone was stopping by the table to ask how everything was.  The waiter stopped by, the busboy stopped by, the host stopped by.  I fully expected someone to walk in off the street to stop by and ask about my meal.  I don't know if they have gotten some bad reviews and are trying to rectify the problem.  All told, the experience was good and I am glad I went.  I took a carryout and headed back to my hotel.   I will definitely go to Leticia's Cocina my next trip.
