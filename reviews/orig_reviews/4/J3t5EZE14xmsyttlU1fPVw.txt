Great place for lunch dinner or large parties. Leonardo is one coolest bartenders lunch is the best to see him. Great service and very knowledgable.  Even better wine list can't even compare the prices to restaurants on the strip. The food is......well lets just say it's always good never had a bad meal there. The chicken enchilada, tuna tostada, and bone in ribeye are my favorites.
