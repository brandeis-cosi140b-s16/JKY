Made reservations for my daughter here for her 21st Bday while we were here in Vegas...she wanted Mexican food and based on all the reviews this place looked like a great pick. Drove in and the barely found a parking spot so for me was a good sign for also a good pick as well...dropped the ladies off at the front door and parked the car. 

After checking in with my wife things didn't look so positive...they didn't have our table ready which was very frustrating! I gave them hours notice which in my opinion is totally their fault. I will say the staff was  very friendly and very apologetic about the situation. The managers even came out and bought our whole group a round of drinks and brought the kids lemeonades. Finally after a 25 minute wait we did get seated, but again the manager came over and gave us free table side guacamole and again apologized.  At this point no one remembers the wait my daughters could care less and everyone was having a good time. Our waiter Richard made my daughter feel really special and did an awesome job with her birthday. The food here was really good and everyone really enjoyed the atmosphere...would love to come back and enjoy this place again on a trip to Vegas.
