I love this place. The patio is delightful and the food is spicy and delicious. My party of 4 shared some really good appetizers and then we ordered  chili rellenos, a crab stuffed chili dish and a variety plate with 3 different items. Everything was delicious!

The service is very good. We asked for some more of the red sauce and it was brought to us in a minute. Water glasses were refilled before they were empty.

They also make excellent burgers but do tend to overcook. If you want medium well, ask for medium rare. On another occasion we asked for medium well and got hockey pucks.

On your birthday you get a choice of a margarita or a flan. I got the flan and it was splendid. My companions ordered the key lime pie, bread pudding and a chocolate cake. Everything was yummy. 

It's a nicely decorated restaurant with excellent food and good service. I'll be back.
