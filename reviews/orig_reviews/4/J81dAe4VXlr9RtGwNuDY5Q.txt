YUM! I loved it here. 

I ordered the carne asada, lengua and tripas tacos.  Everything was so delicious. I also ordered one tostada and it was REAAAAAAAAAALLLY good because they put so much meat on that too. adn teh tostada was so crunchy and yummo

Tripe was REALLY good. I get mine extra crispy, which they fry it up and makes it taste 10 times better. ALSO the onions are so good... esp the green onion!

It was $2 per taco, but it really does fill you up because they pack on the meat! THey even put avocado/guac on top which is sooooooooooooo delish. 

One other downside is you can't put on your own onions,etc... they only have the beets & lime self serve.
