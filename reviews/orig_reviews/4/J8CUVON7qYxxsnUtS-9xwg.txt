This place is in the Luxor on the second floor.  When we got there the hostess was very friendly, since our whole party hadn't arrived she said we could be seated or wait at the bar.  We decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited.  The bar tender gave us a menu and then proceeded to the  other end of the bar.....where he stood till someone in our group finally walked over to call him.  He was to busy laughing and hanging out with the guys at the other end and totally forgot about us. 

After we finally got him to come take our order, I had the carnitas and black beans it was really good.

The whole time while we ate they had some really good music playing.
