To all those who say that los dos is not authentic mexican food, you are right.  It's new mexican food loud and proud putos.  Get delicious, spicy, enchiladas, machaca, chile rellenos and carne adovada served new mexican style.  The service here is somewhat sketch at times, but the margaritas are tasty and the salsas are delish and put a fire on your tongue that necessitates mas margarita which equals mas divertido.  My favorite thing that they serve, carne adovada tacos, is actually not on the menu at this location (i usually go to the downtown location), but the enchiladas, carne adovada, and salsas are legitima.
