I love it here! It reminds me of authentic little restaurants in Mexico. No frills, no fancy decor. The food and service is delightful. We started off with my favorite beer drink, a "michelada." The bartender was not in that evening but the waitress made us a  VERY tastey one. We started off with the chicken nachos. Yum! My sis in law and I shared the Parilla dinner. We didn't want the carnitas or chorizo and had them replace it with shrimp.y husband had the chicken salad and enjoyed it. They know how to season and cook their meat! I am definitely returning!
