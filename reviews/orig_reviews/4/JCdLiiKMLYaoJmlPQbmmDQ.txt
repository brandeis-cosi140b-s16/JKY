I refuse to write long reviews on chain restaurants so I'll just give you the skinny.

- Tortillas are freshly made right there in the store and have the perfect warm chew!

- Salsa will cost you extra but they do offer plenty of hot sauces for free.

- Burritos are huge, heck everything is huge even the salad.

- Don't upgrade to the grilled chicken as the standard meats taste just as good.

- Prices are a little stepper than Chipotle.

- Awesome drink bar! Unlimited refills on Auga Frescas! Plus flavor shot options so you can customize your drink.
