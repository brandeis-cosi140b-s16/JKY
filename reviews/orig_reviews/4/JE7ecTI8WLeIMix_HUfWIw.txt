The food is delicious! I had a bean and cheese burrito - wonderful option for vegetarians. We also had five different salsas which were all excellent. The flavors are amazing. The only negative thing about the experience was the customer service. The wait staff could have been more personable. It was happy hour but she didn't mention it at all. Aside from that, I recommend it!
