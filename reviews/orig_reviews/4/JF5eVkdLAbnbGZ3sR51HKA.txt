Everything was pretty damn good! I might have to say those were the absolute best fajitas I've ever had, and their presentation was pretty cool to boot. Two things I think could be improved, one: check on your tables a little more often (everyone was extremely friendly and very accommodating, I just would have liked to have my drink refilled w/out having to flag someone down) and second: the lights were very dim and the ceiling fans were going a little slow creating a very odd effect of making all of us dizzy; had to walk to several tables before finding something acceptable to dine at. Mind you I was pretty tired but I've never had that happen and I think it could have been avoided by either turning the lights up or even down a little bit more. Could have just been an odd occurrence but everyone in my party complained about it as well. Wish we had saved room to try the desserts because if the entrees are this amazing I bet the sweets are just as good! I would recommend this place to everyone...give it a shot!
