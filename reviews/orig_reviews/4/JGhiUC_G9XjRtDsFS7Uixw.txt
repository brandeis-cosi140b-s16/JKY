I carried out from here and took it back to my room.  The girl at the counter was really nice and took my order.  I had to wait a bit, but it was ok.  We had an order of guac and shrimp taco's.  They were really good and super filling.  One order was definitely enough to split between two people for a snack. 

For the pool crowd, I don't think you can come in here without "proper attire".  When I was waiting there were two girls trying to order some food in their bathing suits, but they weren't allowed in the restaurant, but they could stand at the door and order.
