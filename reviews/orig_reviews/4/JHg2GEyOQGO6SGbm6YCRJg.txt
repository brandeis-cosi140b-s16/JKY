Be sure to check in three times to get the free Corn (Plazerro?). I didn't know it was possible to make corn on the cob that delicious. 

$13 was a great deal for the "Bulldog" margarita on Thursdays. Perfect way to start the evening. It gets you half way there.

For lunch, I had a Chimichanga. It was one of the best I've had, and I'm from California, so I'm used to very good Mexican food. 

The staff was very friendly, and the service was well above average. Nice addition to Mandalay Bay.
