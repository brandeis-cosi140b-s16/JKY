I have been going to Los Compadres since the mid 1960's when we came for lunch in high school. I have not found a better cheese crisp anywhere and having lived in Phoenix for nearly 60 years, I've tried most of them. Be warned though - you have to tell them you don't want burned edges. They do that sometimes. We often do take out here because we live so close. if you're looking for a dining out experience the atmosphere is not that great. We don't mind it and have even had small parties here in the small semi-private room up front. It's our neighborhood spot. Maybe it's because they know us but the service has always been friendly. Sure they mess up our order sometimes but they always give us a credit for a replacement the next time we come in. And we are addicted to their salsa!
