yes, its next to a strip club! The food portions are huge! guacamole dip was massive. Ordered a bunch of tacos and tostadas that we didn't even finished. We ordered a pitcher of sangria, also did not finished. Our server was super sweet. We forgot to mention that we did not want cheese and he kindly got us another order. The chef came out an said hi too! All around nice.
