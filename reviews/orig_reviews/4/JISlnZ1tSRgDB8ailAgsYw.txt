Great value and great beer selection. An IBU (international bittering units) column on the beer menu is very helpful and makes choosing a beer even easier.

Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos were way above average. Chicken and fish tacos were above average. All tacos are larger than average. This is a relaxing spot with good lighting and friendly servers.

The exhibition kitchen is unexpected and nice - you can watch the cooks give every taco the attention it deserves.

Good number of big HDTV screens. A smart spot to watch games and/or grab a quick lunch.

And the *secret* Habanero salsa is great - ask for it if you need some extra heat - with a spice level somewhere between the secret habanero at Border Grill's (not as hot) and Javier's (hotter).
