Delicious tortas! Very popular spot here on Yelp.  Recently on Man vs Food. This place is definitely a gem.  Wish they served beer haha. Me and my friend ate for under $20(not including tip). Which is pretty decent considering it was a sit down place. This place is worth a day trip if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican sandwiches.
