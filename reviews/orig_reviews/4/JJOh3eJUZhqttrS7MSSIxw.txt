"99¢ Night Tacos on Monday"

How can you go wrong?  Okay, if you're a vegetarian then you're SOL; but I digress...  Pretty much every Monday my teenager and I have dinner at my parents place. While taking a walk, I asked Ma dukes "What the hell is this place?"  My dad's like, "Oh, girl, that's the Taco Palace.  Good stuff!"

Alrighty...  I'll be the judge of that.  My Mother & I came in and I said how much for a Taco; my Mother and the lady were like 99 cents.  I said, "come again?"

99¢ a taco, for ground beef?  Give me 16 of them; carry-out please...

Anywhoooo; my mother, father, daughter and I enjoyed four tacos each at my parents house for cheap.  Flavorful, (I mixed my roja & salsa verde together) and the staff was friendly.

All in all a cool experience.
