Dinner here on Friday, May 17 at around 7:30pm. The place was *packed* - and I mean, P-A-C-K-E-D. Barely any room to stand while waiting for a table; we somehow snagged two bar stools, which was completely lucky.

- Needs more waiting space. Between waiting patrons and the bustling staff, there are a lot of collisions and congestion in a critical area (the bar and host station).

- Need more bartenders. Those poor folks were jumping the entire time, and unfortunately, it took a long time to get drinks. The bartenders did an admirable job of acknowledging folks (a quick smile and a, "We'll be right with you," goes a long way, and is truly appreciated).

+ Awesome margaritas. 
+ Decent selection of bottled brews
+ Limited tap selection; happy to see collaboration brews on tap, though

+ Updated menu has some pleasant additions (brisket tacos!!!!)
+ Our server was fun, although a bit slow. I suspect it was because of how busy things were. Seemed like a nice guy, and was very enthusiastic and helpful regarding the menu.

+ GENEROUS food portions. I didn't think I'd ever struggle to put away three ala cart tacos, but boy howdy, was I *full* afterward. Wowsers. 
+ Quality seems to have greatly improved, in addition to portion sizes. Very pronounced flavor profiles - I was quite pleased

+ Good value, even if our server forgot to comp us on the chips/salsa (when you check-in with the Yelp app, you're awarded a free order of chips/salsa, but we still got charged the $2.95). Not a big deal, just a minor annoyance.
