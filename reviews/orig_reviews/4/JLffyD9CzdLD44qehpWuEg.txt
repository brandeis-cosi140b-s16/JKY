Nice change. 

I knew I would enjoy the food when they brought out fresh, unique, and spicy salsa. Yummy. 

I was not overly thrilled with the lobster queso appetizer, but it was all forgiven with dinner. I had the chimichilada. A mini chimi and shredded beef enchilada. The enchilada had an amaretto sauce with mushrooms that was delicious and one of a kind. Not a traditional sauce, but one you have to try. 

I want to try the rellenos next time. They looked great. We shared a seasonal pumpkin creme brulee.

Prices were reasonable. Service good. Dont go here if you are looking for standard/routine mexican fare (atmosphere is more like a pub than a mexican food joint)...but do go here for a delightful mexican experience and good mexican food.
