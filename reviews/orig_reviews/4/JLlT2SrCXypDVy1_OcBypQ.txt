Chino Bandito is the ultimate lovechild between Mexican and Chinese food...and tastes even better than the combo sounds. Kind of a hole in the wall, but in the best kind of way. 

Order at the counter using paper slips, and don't forget to stop by the sampling area...they'll let you taste everything before you order. One of the best parts...you can get anything on the menu in quesadilla form. The other best part is the fresh baked cookie you get with every meal.

Jerk fried rice, black beans, emerald chicken, and jade red chicken quesadillas are my go to.
