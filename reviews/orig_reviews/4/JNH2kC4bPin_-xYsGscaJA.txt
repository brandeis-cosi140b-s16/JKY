Servers were friendly.  The Del Sol Combination dinner I ordered was truly delicious. The tortilla chips were probably the best I have ever had! 

The place is cozy and casual with wall paintings and mirrors. It looks like Mexico and it is very much an authentic Mexican restaurant independently owned.

Even though the price seems to be a little (by a couple of dollars) on the higher side, I would definitely go there again!
