Someone recommend this place for my trip to Phoenix, so I thought I would give it a try. 

carne asada burrito
Fish tacos
Super Nachos

I'm kicking myself for not yelping this place first and checking out the famous items. Upon arriving the location I was totally overwhelmed by the menu, people and the bakery/market. I'm not use to seeing this back in Cali. I was somewhat in a trance and didn't realize what I was ordering until after I got my food. I wish I put more thought into it. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I wished I got something else. 
My only complaint was that my carne asada burrito was more tortilla and beans then meat.
