Love Love Love Los Dos. Love the atmosphere, Love the decor, Love the crap on the walls, Love the sign that says, Please control your kids (and friends). Love the food. Love the shrimp entrees, Love the veggie burro (enchilado style, of course - deep fried and drenched in cheese), Love the margaritas that are bigger than my head and Love Love Love the oh so soft and chewy sopapillas (with honey, of course).

The service, on the other hand, is a little more... complex.

One time when we were waiting for a table, when the guy called my name he called, "Last chance for Mark D". Last chance? So we jumped up and ran inside just before he gave our table away to someone else. I said WTF? He said, I called your name three times (He did so NOT call my name three times - we were sitting right in front of the door the entire time - there's no way). So I told him that. And we argued about it, went back and forth like.. did TOO, did NOT, did TOO, did NOT), until I spotted the other guy - the nice guy - standing behind him shaking his head (they've kind of got this good cop / bad cop thing going over there), and the nice guy was just shaking his head, as if to say, "Ah, don't worry about him, he's just in a bad mood." So we didn't, we sat down, ate some fabulous food, downed some rocking 'ritas and had a great time as always. 

Here's the thing I want you to take away from that story: Even though it does seem like there's always at least one employee "in a bad mood", and the service may not be exactly friendly, it is attentive. I've never had to wait very long for anything, or not gotten what I wanted, I just maybe didn't get it with a smile. And for me, for this place, that's fine. That's just the way it is there. I think it helps knowing that going in. In my opinion, the food and atmosphere more than make up for it. Hell, I keep going back and back and back and back...
