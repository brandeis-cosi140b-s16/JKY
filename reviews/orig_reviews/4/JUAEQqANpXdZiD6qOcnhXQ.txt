Wow..  this really is California style mex. I am so used to being disappointed by Mexican food in the south, that I wasn't really ready to try another "burrito" place, but I decided to give it a try for lunch one day and was very impressed.

I am from Southern California - born and raised - and had an Aunt and Grandma who made the best latin food in the world.. it's not easy to impress me and I am not fooled by "hipster street tacos" or "build a burritos". 

This is authentic style Mexican. I wish I could eat here more often, but unfortunately - there really isn't such a thing as low calorie latin food. Ha ha..

A great find in Charlotte for people seeking real Mex food.
