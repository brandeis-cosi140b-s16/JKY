I came here with my girl friends for happy hour on a tuesday late afternoon. They didn't have a Taco Tuesday special, but all the appetizers (save the shrimp cocktail) were half off until 7, as were the margaritas. We had amazing service, and the place wasn't terribly crowded, it was nice to not have to shout to hear each other or be packed into a patio like sardines. The food was good for mexican bar food, the drinks were middle of the road. Prices were really good, 3 of us had 2 drinks each and 4-5 appetizers for around $50. The waiters also came around for "last call" for happy hour orders, which I thought was pretty cool. I will definitely come back for happy hour.
