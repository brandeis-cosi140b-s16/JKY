My wife and I had an outstanding lunch at the new Gilbert location today. It was our first time there but certainly not our last. Our server was Michael and he was not only GOOD, he was a most personable young man.

We had:

Chips and Salsa - Great not too hot not too mild. Loved 'em. 

Barrio Guacamole - My wife makes a dynamite guacamole, this was ALMOST as good hers. Love the chunkiness and the Craisins.

Ceviche de Camaron - My first experience with ceviche was in Panama in 1973 and I loved it. It was a bit picante but sooo good their's was the opposite, it started off very mild but the picant grew till we finished it off. Loved it!

Our entrees were:

Pescado Veracruzano - Fantastico. Deliciosa. My wife loved it. The fish was nicely done and the sauce tasted like one that her mom used to make.

Camarones al Mojo de Ajo - Whoa! How good does it get? The sauce was wonderful. The chili was superb. Could have had just a bit more rice. I should have also ordered black beans but, oh well, my bad.

We are Gilbert residents and we'll be back.

Thanks to Chef Mata and his staff for a great meal.
