This was a nice surprise.  I had no idea what to expect so I came in with a blank slate.  The chips were good.  The salsa lacked flavor and bite.  Our server brought out a much hotter salsa upon request.  It had a much better bite and flavor.

As per usual I ordered cheese enchiladas.  They were tasty with a nice sauce on the top.  Everyone else in the party was also quite happy with their new meals.

Planet Hollywood is a fun casino to hang out in.  It is good to have an affordable food option.
