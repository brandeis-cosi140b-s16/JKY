Coming from Los Angeles, I am pretty up to speed on good Mexican food. After a night out at Charlies, we discovered this place that is basically attached to the bar (which is an awesome concept).

Originally, I did not order anything because I was not that hungry, but after having a bite of my friends chicken burrito, I immediately changed my mind.

Normally, burritos that you get from food trucks are a lot of beans and rice with some chunks of chicken mixed in. However, the burritos from this place are around 95% meat, which provides for a very filling and tasty meal.

Overall, I was very shocked at the great seasoning and flavorful taste of the food here and would definitely recommend it, drunk or otherwise.
