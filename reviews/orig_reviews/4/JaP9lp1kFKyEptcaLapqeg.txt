Chinese-Mexican-Jamaican fusion cuisine.....who knew?!?  Well, evidently a lot of people now, thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  We've been twice (we're only in Phoenix twice a year, or we'd probably be here once a week, at least!)

The BF had his fave, chile relleno.  It comes coated with crunchy Panko crumbs, which he loved.  This time I had the emerald chicken, with a sauce like a ginger-green onion pesto that rocked my taste buds.  I also had the jen-red pork; the meat was a little dry. (The jade-red chicken, which is similar, had more moist meat when I had that last time and seemed to fit the sauce better.)

We both had the black beans, which are highly flavored and have a hint of heat. They beat all other beans I've ever had anywhere else.  Their machaca is the same in that respect - uniquely flavored and heads above the rest (no egg in this version, in case you're looking for them.)

There are 4 rice choices (I am not a rice person, so I can't comment fairly here.)  There are also many more entree choices, including an all-vegetable dish.  I'm sure we'll get around to each and every one in subsequent visits!
