So happy that I found this place on Yelp. We were a little apprehensive at first, however the parking lot was packed. 
I had the asada burrito with a strawberry fresca. It was so good. The green salsa was to die for! It was the best that I have had.
My hubby had the chicken quesadilla, with fries. He enjoyed his meal as well.
The bathrooms were very clean, and well kept. 
We will definitely be going back here.
