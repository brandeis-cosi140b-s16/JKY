Holy nom nom! 

Yesterday I was working with Anthony, he is a friend of those who own Carlito's and he was talking the place up and how he often opens his own BBQ outside the stores sometimes and they do off-menu items from his grill. Well, he made us all really want Mexican food so we called in an order.

Tuesdays = $1 Tacos (ground beef) or $2 for carne asada upgrade

I decided to get a plate of the tacos. I was a little skeptical because whenever I hear $1 taco and ground beef in the same sentence I'm thinking greasy, runny, yucky meat with a pinch of lettuce. I was wrong. Carlito's does ground beef tacos RIGHT. The ground beef had an amazing taste and was not greasy at all. There was plenty of fresh shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes. And even though we had to send our friend to go get the food, it was still amazing after having to take a ride back to our place of work.

They also supplemented us with a bunch of tortilla chips, red salsa, salsa verde, AND guacamole!!! Okay, the guac was frigging amazing... AMAZING!!!! 

I can't wait to go to the actual store. I want to have the adovada burrito. And I will be going to try out their breakfast as well.

Wow, this place just blew me away. So fresh, fresh! Yummers!
