This is not your neighborhood Mexican taqueria or Chevy's. The food here is pretty darn good. They have tableside Guacamole-which we didn't get since they had this fancy display of salsas (mild, med, hot) and fresh chips. Then our server brought out a tray of seasoned salt for more flavoring if you like, totally unnecessary but nice to have I guess. We ordered the Diego Seafood Cocktail ceviche, Pork Carnitas taco, and Crispy Shrimp with Chipotle Aioli tacos. I, the alcoholic in the relationship, ordered a margarita with my lunch--which I can't remember the name but it was so good, one of the best I've ever had. Ask your server when you go there; I think it was the signature (pink) fruity something. The seafood ceviche was typical - you get Shrimp, scallops, avocado, salsa. It was good. Our server was happy to cancel our pork carnitas taco bc we were getting full from the salsa and ceviche and had dinner reservations at 7pm. We kept the crispy shrimp tacos -so glad we did bc it was delicious. The Aioli sauce was bomb. I've never been to Cancun or Mexico but I imagine the seafood tacos at the resorts to taste just like it. Although they were short staff on a Memorial Day weekend, our server had the most upbeat,  perkiest, will do whatever you want attitude. I watched as she ran from table to table talking orders, delivering drinks, making small talk with her CAN DO attitude the entire time. Much props for that! I enjoy my meal very much although service was a little slow.
