This is a really cute and quaint restaurant. As you drive in to the parking lot all the walls of the parking lot and the building is painted with Mexican forklore. Inside the restaurant they have a bar that offers many different types of tequila and a very knowledgeable bartender. The food was fresh delicious and had the perfect combinations of flavors. The guacamole  is to die for. They add pomegranates into the guacamole which gives it a a little sweetness with the spicy. I had the pork tacos and the park was absolutely wonderful. When I come to Phoenix again, I will definitely have to stop by here.
