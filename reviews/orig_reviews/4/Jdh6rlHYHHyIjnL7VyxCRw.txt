Initially this place was recommended to me by my cab driver, he said it was the best Mexican food he has ever had. I wasn't looking for anything too crazy just something fill my appetite . I had no crazy expectations for a Mexican restaurant on the strip. i was made a fan after my first bite. this humble little place packed a flavorful punch! the portions were big enough to share and the price was very reasonable. they even had their own hot sauce which i added to everything. all in all great food and friendly service.

I recommend: Asada fries & a Sope!
