I finally tried this place. I had no idea that it was on that show with that chubby guy who eats way too much. The owners are sure proud of this. I had the Torta Cubana which was delicious. The 2nd best Cuban sandwich I have ever eaten. The best one is at Cocina Express in Rocky Point but I digress. Parking lot is terrible and inside was packed. 

Enjoyable except for the two Chicago assholes sitting next to me who bitched the entire time about how everything in Chicago is better than Phoenix.
