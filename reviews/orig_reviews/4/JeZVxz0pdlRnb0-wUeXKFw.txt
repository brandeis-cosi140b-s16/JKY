Eh it was okay. Not my type of taco joint and Ive been to a lot even some all over MÃ©xico.  Tacos are made fresh in front of you and they are pretty quick. Didnt care for the Quesadilla preparation. Its like a tostada with melted cheese....never had it like before and ive had a lot of em. The lady behind me ordered the same and was surprised. It was good but not what i had in mind. To their credit they make the tortillas right in front of you.

FYI Robertos makes better Carne Asada fries and they are cheaper. 




Ill stick with Los Compitos and Tacos Gigantes.
