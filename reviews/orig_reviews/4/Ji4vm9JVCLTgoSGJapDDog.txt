First you should know what this place is.  It's basically like Chipotle or Qdoba or maybe Cafe Rio.  Burritos and tacos (I only saw soft tacos, but maybe they do hard also?).  You go in, tell them what you want, pick your meat and fillings, and you're done.

What makes this place better, I think, is that they have more than three meats.  It's not "carnitas, chicken, or beef".  Well, it is...but they have several variations of each.  This is what sets Most Wanted apart from Chipotle.  Different flavors and different heat levels.  They will give you samples to try also.  They also don't skimp on the ingredients.  The burrito was so full they could barely wrap the tortilla all the way around.  The disadvantage to that is that it comes open easily and is difficult to hold.  Keep it in the foil or it will fall apart on you, peeling the foil down as you go.  It was big enough I took half of it home.

Another thing I like is that it isn't a mega-chain like Chipotle.

All in all, a nice experience.  Good flavors, generous portions.

I don't live near here, but when in the area this place will be on my radar.
