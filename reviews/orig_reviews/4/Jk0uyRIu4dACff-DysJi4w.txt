This place is crazy packed every time I go. The last time I went was on thanksgiving day but I'm already planning another trip to vegas just for some more tacos. Fat much..? Its just so gooood! Don't judge me (: 4 stars because of the long, messy, unorganized lines. Keep in mind that there are signs indicating what you could order from the line you stand in. For example if you want asada you have to stand in that line, if you want al pastor go to that line and so on.
