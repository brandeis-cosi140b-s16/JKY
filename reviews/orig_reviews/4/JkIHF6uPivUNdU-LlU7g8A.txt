Bf and I came here for Restaurant Week. We sat outside in the patio so that we would have a pool view (suggested by one of the yelpers when I was reading the review). It was nice out and a little sticky (humidity was 35%) and they turned on their huge outside fan about an hour later.

I ordered:
- Tuna Crudo
- Duck Chilequiles
- Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata. 

The bf ordered:
- Mushroom Empanadas
- Gaucho Steak
- Whoopie Pie and Cinnamon Horchata

I will have to say that THE BEST DISH we had out of all of them was hands down the Gaucho Steak. OMG, It was the most softest steak I've ever had. That literally melted in my mouth. No chewing for a million years, it was just absolutely freakishly good!

My Duck Chilequiles I was not too impressed with. Barely 2oz of duck and majority of the plate was filled with tortilla chips drenched in like an enchilada type sauce. It did taste good with the meat that I did eat but not worth it because of so little meat. 

As far as the appetizers went, the tuna crudo is really good if you eat it with the tortilla chips they give you when you first sit down. Adds extra texture. It's also warmish, not cold which threw me off but still good. The empanadas weren't that bad. I'm not a mushroom kinda person either. 

The whoopie pie to me was alright. Bf liked it a lot as it was not sweet and he's had the cinnamon drink before whereas, I've never had it so to me it was eh. 

Service was really great up until we finished our 2nd course. Our waiter was no where to be found. The guy who took away our plates also took away the water pitcher and never brought a new one back and my glass was completely empty. It took probably 20+ min before we got our waiters attention to bring our last course and to pack one of them to go. 

Other then the slow service at the end, I would definitely come here again and DEFINITELY recommend the Gaucho Steak. That stuff is legit!
