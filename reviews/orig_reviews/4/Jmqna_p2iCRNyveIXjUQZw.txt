I'm not a huge fan of guac, but Gall Blanco showed me that there's delicious guac to be had. Nom nom. The other "oh my gosh" find was the corn. Who thought that someone would order corn on the cob as an appetizer? If I didnt before, I do now. Delicious!

Big thanks to Gallo Blanco for hosting the "kiteup"; aka get-together with about 50 Brightkite users. It was indeed warm inside, but with that many people crammed into a small space, it'd be hard to expect otherwise.
