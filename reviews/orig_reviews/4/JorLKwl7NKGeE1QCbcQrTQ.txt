My boyfriend and I had dinner here the other night and it was delicious! He had the ribeye tacos, and I had the sopes platter. We finished off with one of their super yummy tres leche cakes. The ingredients were all fresh, and everything was very tasty. The iced green tea was also very good. 

The dining area is very nice, everything looks clean and modern, they had a mix of different sized tables for large and small parties. Staff was super friendly and helpful, and happy to make recommendations for items to try.
