Had a very nice experience here. Try the blood orange Margarita, its outstanding.  Cool location, friendly attentive service, tasty food and fair prices. I tried the Guacamole (YUM), the fajitas & the Tres leches cake (DOUBLE YUM)
It is definitely not your typical mexican food, but that is what I liked about this place. Check it out if your in the neighborhood. And did I mention to try the blood orange Marg? Mmmmmmm!
