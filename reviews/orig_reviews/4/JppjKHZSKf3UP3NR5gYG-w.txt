This restaurant was appealing from the decor. It was modern with some Latin flair. Upon being seating i realized it was bigger then it looked. I got the Fajita special for two (just under 20$) But I made my BF try the Empanadas and they were perfect! Our waiter was excellent we had refills quickly and everything was timed just right! Definitely a place I'll continue to visit!
