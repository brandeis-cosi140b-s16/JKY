What's a 25+ year old to do in a city built around Sun Devil spirit and keg parties? Mill Ave is at the heart of Tempe, and it had begun to feel like I had outgrown it. Then La Bocca moved in and my friends and I had a delicious place to go with a great Happy Hour that made us feel like we could still call Mill home. After a few successful years the great minds behind La Bocca opened Canteen...a tequila bar that brings something fresh and new to Mill. 

The restaurant itself is MASSIVE, and the trendy decor adds a splash of color and class to the restaurant. In Arizona we count down the seconds until it is cool enough to enjoy a drink outside, and Canteen doesn't disappoint, with giant patios in the front and the back of the restaurant. Canteen has a great Happy Hour (we got three drinks, chips/guac and nine tacos for $30!!), and the food is delicious. Servers were nice and friendly as well. 

I'm not giving Canteen 5 stars (yet) because it is still new and we had a number of service snafus that I'm sure are just a few kinks that still need to be worked out. Nothing worth ruining our dinner over at all. Overall, I'd definitely recommend Canteen for some great food, fun atmosphere, and one of the best Happy Hours on Mill.
