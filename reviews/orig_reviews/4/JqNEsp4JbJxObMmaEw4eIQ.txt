First time here, friendly staff, great service and equally great food. The guacamole was awesome. The decor is very quaint and the the carne asada was good.  I would definitely recommend it, it was a great deal, especially with the coupon I found on restaurants.com. It's a little far from where I live in the southwest, but the friendly staff and good food make it well worth the drive.
