Love this place.  Everyone we bring with us really seems to enjoy it too.  Great value.  Great salsa.  Great food and service is always quick and friendly.  Would be nice to have a couple more types of salsa though.  We've had some chipotle and mango salsas at a couple of other places that I'm betting Juan Jaime's could do really well.
