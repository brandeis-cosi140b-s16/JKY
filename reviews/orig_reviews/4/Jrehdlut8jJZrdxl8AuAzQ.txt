Lunch gets pretty packed with the downtown government employee crowd, but there are generally tons of staff to help you get in, fed, and out.  I've went a couple times around 2pm and loved it.  If you're looking for mariachis, then bring an iPod.  If you want Roberto's style quick food, then go to Robertos.  This place has decently priced beers and food.  I'm a fan of kicking back a couple Modelo's with some chips, salsa, and cocktail de camarones.  But then again, if you're in a lunch rush, I don't think two or three beers is what you should be after.

Overall, good place to grab a bite/brew with some friends, although for a date, the Bar + Arts Bistro is probably better to head to.
