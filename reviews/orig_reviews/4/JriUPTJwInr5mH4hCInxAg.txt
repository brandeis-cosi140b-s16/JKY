Groupons should introduce you to a new place with a discount in order to get you to try a new (or favorite) place. That's why I found myself at the drive thru this morning. Two steak and egg breakfast burritos I was glad I took the opportunity to try them. Their burritos are bigger than McDs and not quite as huge as Filiberto's.  A good size, well wrapped in a flour tortilla with a generous amount of filling and at a fairly reasonable price. They are located next to Dutch Bros Coffee and you can find it a challenge to get near Brushfire at 930 in the morning!  The service was reasonably fast but, most of all, I was warmly greeted and the food was very satisfactory.  I am still out on the "secret sauce"-it had a little kick but not overbearing.  No doubt I will be back to try their lunch menu soon. I feel like this was a great deal and a worthwhile stop. McD's is right across the street in case you need something to wash the food down and are not a coffee drinker!!.
