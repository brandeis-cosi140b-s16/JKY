I've heard good things about this place, so I finally got around to checking it out. (Tip: As other people have noted, this place is cash only.)

Anyway, I just finished my meal from there and I'm so excited about it, I had to post to Yelp!

Since it was my first time there I got the combo, which includes two pieces of chicken (breast and leg), and a decent portion of carne asada. Both were amazing, but the star here is the restaurant's name-sake. The chicken was moist, tender, salty (in a good way) and just all-around flavorful... and the crunchy skin was delicious.

I ended up eating the chicken by itself and saved the soft, doughy, warm tortillas for the carne asada. It also came with a side of salsa, onions and pinto beans. The pinto beans were nothing to be shrugged off either, probably some of the best I've ever had.

I am now left stuffed and happy - and all for about 8 bucks. I think I could easily go back and probably just get the chicken sometime and be just as satisfied for even less money.... or the carne asada when I'm in the mood for that. Either way, I'll definitely be back.
