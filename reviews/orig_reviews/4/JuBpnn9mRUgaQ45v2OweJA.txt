The sopapillas were awesome! I tried their fish, shrimp, and pollo asado tacos, as well. The fish taco was ok. The chicken taco was a little dry and tough. But the shrimp taco hit the spot. Great cream sauce with a bit of a kick, too! It's local. It's tasty. It's decently priced. You should check it out.
