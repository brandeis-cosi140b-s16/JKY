I have tried Serrano's 2x now, since their opening. 1st time I had the Serrano's burrito, and this 2nd time the Cuban Sandwich.

The Serrano's burrito, (chicken), was quite good...the chicken had a char-grilled flavor, not just some chicken thrown in a tortilla. the other ingredients tasted fresh, and the burrito was off the grill hot. It came with sauce and cheese on top, so eating with a fork was needed....I do prefer hand held, so next time I will ask for nothing on top.
The burrito does come with rice & re-fried beans...I need to see if they will substitute black beans.
(again, my preference)

The Cuban sandwich was amazing good....for a "Mexican" restaurant. 
It was a perfect mix of hot pork, ham & meltded cheese with a chilled dill pickle & mustard. 
it comes wirh fries.

The restaurant it self is a old Taco Bell if I remember right. it does look nice inside, clean & inviting. The service at the counter was friendly & pleasent.

The salsa bar is great. a couple of differant "hot" choices, unlike others who only have 1 or no "hot" salsa to be had. it also has a habernero/onion mix which is amazing! if your not a fan of "spicey, hot" items...stay away :-)

Over-all, both of my visits were pleasent with tasty food.
