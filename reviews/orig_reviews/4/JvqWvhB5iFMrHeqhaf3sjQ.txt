My wife and I love the food especially the nachos yum....BUT I think they need to upgrade the tables....I'm a big guy and I could hardly fit in the booths and anywhere else I fit in fine....then they ask if you want a chair to sit on the edge and you feel like a fat a$$ haha.....so upgrade and I'll come back!!!
