Large plates!!! Fish tacos were amazing.... i got one of each of the original and the citrus slaw and likes the slaw MUCH better.  the brown rice was a little bland but just add a little salsa and it makes it much better.  the white beans are very yummy! the view is beautiful at night!  drinks are a little $$$ though.
