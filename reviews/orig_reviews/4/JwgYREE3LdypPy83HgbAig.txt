They are quite busy so I snuck in and grabbed a table in the bar. Chips are light and crunchy. Salsa was good. I need to tell you about the amazing pescado lunch. $9.99 and it was mahi mahi today. Grilled and topped with pico de gallo. Cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful. Also served with rice. The rice is good. Not mind blowing but have I mentioned the FISH?? Get here before you're starving if you want to enjoy the fabulous courtyard.
