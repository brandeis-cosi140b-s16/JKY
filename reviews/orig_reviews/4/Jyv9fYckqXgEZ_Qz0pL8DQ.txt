So I went here with bf since we were in the area and he loves Mexican food. . .

Anyhow, the chips and salsa were awesome!  When I say salsa. . .I mean they bring you a trio. . .a normal red salsa, bean dip and a green salsa that is NOT salsa verde.  The green salsa almost tasted like it had a little bit of avocado in it???  It was creamy but still thin with chunks of onions and cilantro running through it.  Would I go back for just the salsa trio that comes out with chips?  That would have to be a yes. . .I am not a fan of the bean dip. . .but OMG the green one was da bomb!!!  =)  And did I mention that the salsa trio and chips are FREE!  LOL  =D

Onto the entrees. . .

I had the nachos with beef. . .it was really really good. . .It came with sour cream, gucamole. . .well pretty much the fixings. . .and no pics cuz someone. . .mainly me. . .was starving!  The meat was tender and no it was not ground beef it was shredded meat.  The only bad thing were the beans and that was my bad since I forgot to ask for it with no beans.  

The bf had the enchilada and taco combination.  He said that it was really really good.  He barely talked to me. . .he was so busy eating. . .now you know that means that it has to be good!  LOL  ;)

Service was where I took off the 1 star.  We had to wait to get them to bring us our ticket. . .and then when we wanted to use credit card we had to go into the bar to pay as the bartender was the only one that knew how to use a credit card swiper. . .weird I know!

So yes I will definitely be back!!!  And the cool thing?  They are open 24/7. . .now I know where to go and eat when nothing is open late night!  LOL  =)
