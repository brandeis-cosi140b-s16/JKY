I love America's Taco Shop. The horchata is to die for! I especially love the large patio - it'd be perfect for a special event. The menu is simple and tasty. Authentic Mexican food from the area in Mexico where the family is from. America is the namesake of the concept, and she seems passionate about keeping authentic recipes available. 

Try the cochata - a coffee-flavored horchata. YUM! Love the chips and salsa too :)

Burritos are tasty - they're known for their carne asada so you can't go wrong there!
