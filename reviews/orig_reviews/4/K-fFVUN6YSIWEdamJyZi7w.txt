In a town "Old Town" Scottsdale, AZ, with a lot of Mex restaurants: they are very popular and that says it all. Food quality is very good. Service is fair to poor? Worth going to and then trying some others. There are two separate areas, the colorful bar where I ate, or the very informal restaurant. Then there is a private outside courtyard area next door.
