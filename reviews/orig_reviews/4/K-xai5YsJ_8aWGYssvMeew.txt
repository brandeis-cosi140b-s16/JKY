had a great dinner in this restaurant  my wife and a buddy had chicken salad,what an amazing presentation formed in a ring about 3 inches high filled with chopped chicken roasted corn chopped veggies and lettuce.Give that dish a 10 .Head chef came around the table to ask how everything was and to explain what was new and what he planned for the future.Top all that off with a couple of massive margaritas  for a great Mexican experience .
