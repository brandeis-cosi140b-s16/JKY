Such a fun place! Came here for a bday shindig but was way more captivated by the Chargers game. There were plenty of tvs which I very much appreciated. The staff was attentive wo being annoying. Drinks were cheap and crowd was not too shabb. This would be a fun spot for Sunday football as well. Not sure if you need to pay for the cabanas.. But it's a pretty cool concept. Would def come back
