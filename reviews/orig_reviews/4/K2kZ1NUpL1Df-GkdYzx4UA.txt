Great little spot in South Park, by the same owners as Big Daddy's. Has that same feel to it but with a Tex-Mex flare. The salsa is a bit different, in that they serve it warm as opposed to cold or room temp. It's different, but good. Had the Beef Brisket Taco's and they were amazing! Get them on the homemade soft tortillas. Yum.
