This place is crazy... they offer an AYCE small plates brunch... and I'm obviously also crazy because I did it. I think it's around $35.

Come with a big group for the obvious reason that you can share everything. You can literally order anything off the menu. Our server was very personable (told us his crazy Vegas stories) and helpful (he gave us small family style portions so we could try everything). My favorites were the corn tamale, breakfast fries, and steak and eggs. I didn't love the sweet dishes too much (might be just me though). I will admit that after a while everything started tasting similar. I think the running theme of the meal was eggs in every form possible.

A fun Mexican-themed alternative to your average brunch!
