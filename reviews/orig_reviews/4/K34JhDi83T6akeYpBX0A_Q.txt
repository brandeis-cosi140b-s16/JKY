This is the best place for mexican in Urbana. They give you a huge selection of sauces and many of their tortillas are homemade. My favorite sauce has to be the smoky creamy chipotle sauce. It's got just enough kick and that smoky flavor is awesome! They have some pretty tasty margaritas but I would probably get them on the rocks because I ordered mine frozen and it came out unpleasantly warm. Probably because it came from a warm blender, but the warm plastic glass they served it in didn't help. I ordered a nopales huarache and I'm pretty sure the nopales were canned because they were incredibly salty. Other than being too salty, the huarache was delicious! My favorite item so far is the fajitas quesadilla! It's got lots of tasty grilled vegetables and plenty of cheese all over!
