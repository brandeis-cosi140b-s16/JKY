Dropped in for lunch on a Sunday at noon.  Large restaurant with several rooms and a friendly efficient staff.  The restaurant is clean and brightly decorated and the restroom was more than adequate.  The wife ordered Torta norte√±a de res (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-reyes-de-la-torta-tempe#b5_syEe_0dULbFvnbUdd1w) and I had the Torta USA, very tasty and interesting mixed ingredient sandwiches, with different meats, cheese, grilled fresh pineapple, etc etc. Really packed full of fresh tastiness.  For dessert we had the flan which was just OK, a bit too dense but flavorful. If you want a Mexico City taste, this is the place.
