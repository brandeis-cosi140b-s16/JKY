Chuy's is a great place to gather with friends.  The place is cheerful and eclectic with family photos and funky art plastered on the pepto-pink walls.  The portions here are pretty big, but don't expect average Mexican restaurant prices.  This place is a step up from the run of the mill tex-mex, so the entrees are a little more than you might expect them to be.  That being said, they bring delicious chips & salsa to the table-- so you can easily share a meal.  

My favorite thing about this place is the nacho bar at Happy Hour.  From 4-7pm on weekdays you can stock up on unlimited nachos topping them with queso, meat, beans, etc. Come in and order a drink with friends and load up on nachos!

All in all, Chuy's is a great addition to South Park.  The central location and vast seating are perfect for an after-work get-together OR for a stiff drink while you are coming down from your shopping high.
