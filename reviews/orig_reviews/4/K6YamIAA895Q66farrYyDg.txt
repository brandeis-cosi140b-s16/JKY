Ok this is a nice place... The food was good, I like the flavor of the fajitas better at other places but the tortillas were good. The guacamole my daughter said wasn't as good as a few other places as too chunky for her.... I like how they had basic options like chicken fingers for kids meals though. The mole poblano got good reviews at the table and some shrimp and cheese dish was big stars. The salsa had a nice kick. 
The waiters were great.. Very attentive, and we were celebrating so they came and sang happy birthday (comic relief as maybe they sing that no matter the occasion as wasn't a birthday and they knew that lol) they put candles in the cupcakes they let us bring in and they offered to dance with the kids to the live music. 
They let you watch the tortillas being made and overall a positive fun experience....other places I would go depending on what wanted but if the group wanted to go there I wouldn't protest
