I've had mostly good and just a couple bad experiences here. I love the area, and the food is good. Can't beat dollar taco night either! The Barbacoa and Al Pastor is actually pretty good. Not as "americanized" as many other places. Decent margaritas, and my friends always seem happy with their food too. Definitely worth trying out. I LOVE true authentic Mexican food, and this place is a good medium between the chains and a little hole in the wall, with good food.
