I feel like this place doesn't get the traffic it deserves because of its location, way off the regular path in Mandalay Bay. Service was great and food was awesome. Loved my plantain empanadas and steak quesadilla, just wish there wasn't quite so much butter on the tortilla,  made it really heavy. This is a great choice if you're looking for tasty Mexican and some al fresco seating.
