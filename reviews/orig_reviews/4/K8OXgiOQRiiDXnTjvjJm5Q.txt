We have eaten here more than 2x a week since they opened. My husband is stuck on the Green Chili stew. He loves it! I on the other hand am all over the menu! So far everything has been great. 
Our Sopas were pretty flat the first night. Being from all over New Mexico I know how they serve them there...BIG and FLUFFY. The next time we were there they were bigger. 
The ambiance is fantastic! Salsa are TRUE!! brings back memories! 
The owner and his wife are very friendly! 
Our servers are always friendly, prompt and know the menu.
Great place for family, friends, you name it!
