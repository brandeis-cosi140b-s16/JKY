I just returned from Phoenix and Southern California for the Coachella music festival. Needless to say I was not thrilled to board an airplane with beautiful 80 degree sunny skies and return to midwest storms and freezing wind. Oh well. We had a great time in the warmth and at the festival - highlights included Mumford & Sons, Arcade Fire, Robyn and Lauren Hill. 


When I arrived in Phoenix Jed's father Dan was kind to pick me up from the airport and take me to a local Mexican restaurant for lunch. Only after I returned to Chicago did I realize the chef is a James Beard nominee. I probably could have guess though because the food was tremendous (and all the awards/press on the walls helped). 

It was a quick meal with a side salad and plate of tacos. I ordered the Tacos de Pescado (Halibut fish tacos with cabbage & avocado, Baja sauce for $14) and I noticed that half the restaurant did as well. The presentation was beautiful and the food tasted just as good. The fish was delicious and I loved the fresh combination of avocado, cabbage and sauce (a perfect compliment to the 90+ heat outside). My starter salad was also nice and had lots of fresh fruits and nuts with a nice vinaigrette dressing. 

I'm not surprised Jed was jealous that we made a pit stop at Barrio, the food was great and setting perfect (great southwest food in a rather run down strip mall). The value was great for the tacos, and the rest of menu looked the same. I look forward to my next trip back to Phoenix and the Shein Family residence (and hope a pit stop at Barrio is included).
