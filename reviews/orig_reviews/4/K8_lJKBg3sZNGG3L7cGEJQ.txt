My family went to Cantina Laredo on a whim. We had not heard good or bad about it. We had just seen a movie and were looking for a good meal. My husband had suggested a New Mexican Style restaurant down the road. I mentioned that we try Cantina Laredo while we were at the San Tan Village Mall. Wow, were we ever pleased. For starters, they provided a gluten free menu, that is very important for my family. The service we excellent, Stefan was on the ball. The salsa was the only thing we gave an okay to. It just didn't have the robust flavors like some of our other favorite places. They did however have a hot and mild choice. The meals were great. Plenty of food for every plate, the entrees looked extra gourmet, especially for the very reasonable price. The atmosphere was relaxed and modern. After the meal we had to try the apple pie. Do Not Miss Out On This. If you are on a diet, you have to cheat. They put this apple pie Ala mode on a hot skillet right at the table. The smell is very tempting. If someone else orders one, you will know. Looking back, the one thing I did not get to try that I wish I did is the "at the table prepared" guacamole. As a big avocado fan, I don't know how I missed that. But there is always next time. We will be back to Cantina Laredo.
