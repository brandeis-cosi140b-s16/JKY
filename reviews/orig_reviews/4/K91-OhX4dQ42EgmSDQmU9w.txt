I just returned from my first trip to Las Vegas, and on my first night there, I knew I wanted to check out China Poblano. (Having gone to school in DC, I'm familiar with Jose Andres and his great food.)

My friends' flight landed a while after mine, so I dined solo at the bar. The service was excellent, especially considering it was 8:30 on a Saturday night. 

The food was outstanding and came quickly (but without any sort of rush). I had the Arrachera con Salsa Molcajete - absolutely delicious - with a side of their freshly-made tortillas (to make my own fajitas, awesome suggestion by the server). Also had a sea salt margarita, very foamy but tasty enough.

I really enjoyed everything about this place...except the value for the money, which is why I'm leaving off a star. These are small plates meant to be shared, so your receipt can very easily tally up quickly.
