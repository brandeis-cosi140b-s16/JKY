Sat outside and enjoyed a nice lunch here.
It was very busy and service was still good.

The tacos and other items were very good but a bit pricey.
This probably is due to the location in the main Waterfront area.

The girls enjoyed several margaritas and they have an EXTENSIVE tequila menu.

The outdoor patio is dog-friendly and several people were there with dogs following a walk around the waterfront and shops. Overall, it was a nice, friendly atmosphere.
