In my last few weeks in Phoenix I tried to line up as many restaurants to try as possible, especially hoping to find some worthy Mexican food. I enjoyed my lunch at the Comedor and would gladly return.  The spot is huge; a re-purposed event ballroom I'm told. A group of four of us went one Sunday for lunch and though the space was pretty full of families, we were seated within 5 minutes. 

For lunch I ordered shrimp enchiladas which came four to a plate (corn tortillas) with rice and refried beans. Tasted great, the shrimp were cooked well, not rubbery, and the chile sauce was lightly spicy. One friend ordered the chicken mole, and I had a few bites and would highly recommend it. Admittedly the mole was not spicy enough for either of our tastes, but it was rich and complex, and the chicken was spectacular: so moist and tender, just swimming in the thick sauce. mmmmmmm! 

Reasonably priced, generous with seating, quick service and solid Mexican fare.
