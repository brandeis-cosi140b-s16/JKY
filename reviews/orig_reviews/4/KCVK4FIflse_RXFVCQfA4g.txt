Being a vegan I was worried about having to be in Vegas for a week for work. I packed a cooler filled with healthy food, but upon checking into my hotel i realized there was no microwave or fridge. Bummer. I ended up eating out all week and had probably my favorite meal here at Hussong's. I go to B.C., Mexico often but have never been to Hussong's down there. The food and atmosphere are Americanized but still quite good. The waiter was awesome. I asked about getting the vegetarian burrito on the menu made into tacos. He asked me if I was a vegetarian, and I said yes. Then he brings out a nice big separate menu that was all vegetarian. Cool! I went with the tacos made on pink corn tortillas (ordered without cheese or creme) and serve with rice and black beans. The beans and rice were really good, and the tacos delicious. Chips and salsa were great as well.
