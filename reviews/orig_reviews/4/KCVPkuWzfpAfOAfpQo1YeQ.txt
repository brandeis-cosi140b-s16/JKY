Yes, their Tamales are really good.

I knew that a place like this in Vegas had to be better than anything on the strip. It's always great to eat like the locals. I ordered their burrito with tamale dish and was more than satisfied at the end of my meal; that pork tamale was really delicious! The burrito was really fat and unfortunately filled with refried beans (I prefer black beans). What's nice too is that they serve crisp tortilla chips with tasty salsa while you order your meal.
