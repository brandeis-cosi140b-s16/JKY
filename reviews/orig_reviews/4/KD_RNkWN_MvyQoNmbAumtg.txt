i like the food here. it is consistent and the staff is always friendly. my first meal out after being away from AZ for 3 months and i was happy!
we wanted to sit outside, but the patio was a 15 minute wait, so we went back in and were seated right away. i ordered the shrimp enchiladas with verde sauce. they were filling, especially with a large portion of beans and rice on the side. the water glasses were kept full and my house margarita was very tasty, although maybe too small because i sucked it down in maybe 3 slurps of the straw. 

our dinner companions ordered the spicy shrimp dish, and although i didn't taste, both said it was "hot and spicy", a description i took in earnest as one of them was mexican. the chips basket was small and not refilled....which is fine i guess because i always get full munching on the chips before my meal, eat my whole meal, then feel uncomfortably bloated afterwards.....discipline be damned. 

one of my favorite go-to spots in scottsdale.
