I don't know why there aren't more Chinese-Mexican fusion places, maybe because the name conjures up some frightening images.  Vanquish those scary thoughts because this place is great!  My persona favorite is their Emerald Chicken Quesadilla.  And how can you go wrong when you get a snicker doodle cookies with your food?

Steer clear if you're looking for anything even slightly resembling "authentic" Chinese or Mexican, but if that's what you were expecting from a place called "Chino Bandito" with a Bandito Panda chowing down with a pair of chopsticks you shouldn't be allowed to choose where you eat anyway.
