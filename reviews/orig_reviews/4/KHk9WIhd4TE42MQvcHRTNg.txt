This place has been here for YEARS... my first time was at least in 2000.  1/4 grilled beef + extra flour tortilla is less than $6.  

I find the chicken dry and sometimes the steak might be over cooked... immediately move those slices into the salsa fresca and let them marinate, as you build your tortilla like tacos one by one.  So good!
