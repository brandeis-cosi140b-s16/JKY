I absolutely loved this place!! So I'm a bit surprised to see the lower rating reviews. 

I came here for dinner with the lover. We sat outside on the patio which is absolutely adorable. They have a waterfall to set the mood. Lol. I started with the blue agave margarita. This was delicious! It also comes with a shaker!! My entree I ordered the carne de fuego. The steak at their restaurant is just extremely tasteful. It was perfect. Our waitress also informed us that they have custom tortillas that change on a daily basis. The evening we came we tried a red pepper tortilla that also came with a jalepeno butter. Oh my gosh!!! 

I thought that everything was just absolutely delicious and perfect. From the drinks, to the food, to the excellent customer service, to the cute outdoor patio. The only negative for me was I wish they had a bigger menu.  I'll definitely be back for more!!
