The reviews do not disappoint!

My colleague and I came in on a Monday night and had a fabulous meal. To begin with the Margarita's are fabulous! My colleague had the Stacked Enchiladas which I took a bite of as well and they were divine. I had a hard time deciding and ended up with the Ocean Front which was also very good. To be honest we could have eaten here every day and not run out of choices. 

The staff was really friendly, the atmosphere casual and there was a nice outdoor patio as well. It was a bit windy the night we were there so we stayed inside. March is a great time of year to visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!

Enjoy!
