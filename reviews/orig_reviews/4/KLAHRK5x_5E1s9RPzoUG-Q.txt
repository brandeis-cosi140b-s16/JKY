4 out of 5 because I don't love the chips & salsa. A little bland for me. But.. Cabo is one of my faves in Charlotte. I love the fun loud atmosphere, you feel like you are in Cali. I always order the barbecue mahi mahi tacos. A little sweet a little savory, the texture of the fish is perfect & I love how the sauce brings it all together. So delicious. You have to try to jalape√±o mashed potatoes. They are awesome! Not too spicy, you just get little kicks in every bite. I love this place & always brig people here.
