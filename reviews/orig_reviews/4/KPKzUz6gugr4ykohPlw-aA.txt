Yo Rita seems to be the Taco kindred spirit to Tamari's fusion sushi. Both restaurants capitalize on creative, cross-cultural approaches to tapas-portioned food. I was impressed by both, but right now, I am a tad more smitten with Yo Rita because their tacos tasted fantastic!

At the server's recommendation of two tacos per person, my dinner companion and I ordered four to share. We got: the escolar, the pork shoulder, the duck confit, and the bahn mi. While the pork shoulder was very good (could have used a little less meat, a few more slices of granny smith apples), the other three were amazing. The escolar taco was like a giant tortilla wrapped sushi -- the fish was succulent and sweet against a supporting cast of bok choi, shiitaki, and aji amarillo. The bahn mi combined fatty pork belly with velvety chicken liver pate, then heated everything up with jalapeno and sweet chile sauce. The duck confit packs up juicy duck pieces with mushroom, bacon, and slices of brussle sprouts -- a hearty bite of Southern France in a to-go package.

Although I did not try any, the menu lists many vegetarian-friendly options.

Finally, about the service: we showed up on a Saturday evening around 7pm, so I came mentally prepared to wait 90+ minutes per other reviewers' comments. It really wasn't that bad though. The hostess took down my cell number, and we were free to roam about Carson. They called us back around 8pm and we were promptly seated and served. Although we finished eating within an hour, they did not seem to mind to have us leisurely hang out there for another 30 minutes. Maybe we were just lucky that the dragon lady the other reviewers mentioned was not present that night.
