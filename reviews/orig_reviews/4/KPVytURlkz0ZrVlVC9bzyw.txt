I've eaten at this Nacho Daddy's several times, both for business and personal lunches, always with good service and great tasting food.  Today I tried the club sandwich and was not disappointed.  Good sized portions of tasty ham and turkey with significant bacon on a freshly warmed bread roll.  A little bite from a combination of the Anaheim chili and Chipotle sause added that little extra kick you remember for a bit after the meal (in a good way).  

We were served by Megan, a recent Employee of the Month, and we could tell from her attention to detail that the honor was well deserved.  My girlfriend, the vegetarian, asked for, and was totally impressed with a "taco salad without the taco meat".  From a seat away, it looked really good and according to her, one of the best salads she's ever had.  I may try it next time with some real "taco type" meat to get the real deal.  In past visits I've had a variety of the traditional and way out nachos (thus the name) and cheeseburgers and have always been pleased with the food, service, location and pricing.  

This place is a no-brainer for a casual lunch during the week or on weekends.  Oh, and when I asked which of the dozen or so TV's had my favorite NASCAR race on it, the hostess wisely responded, that "any of our TV's can be programmed to whatever sport you want to watch".  Now, THAT'S THE SPIRIT!!!!  

(PS...The jalapeno muffins pre-meal might be the best kept secret, even for those of us with soft tastebuds.  Nice touch!)
