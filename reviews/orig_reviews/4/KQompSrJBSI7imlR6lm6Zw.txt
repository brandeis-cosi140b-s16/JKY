You must try the sweet corn tamale! That is a great way to start the meal. It is almost a desert it is so sweet. 

The place is is the corner of a strip mall but the scenery is more then just the parking lot. The chips and salsa, always the measuring stick of a good Mexican restaurant, were perfect. Thick chip/tortillas and spicy salsa. Mmmmmm. 

The food was delicious.  All our entrees had plenty of heat so order lots of water. The chicken enchiladas I ordered from the spicy menu delivered a good kick.  They were juicy, flavorful and now they are gone. My wife's salad was fresh. She ordered the spicy ranch dressing which came on the side. Good thing because it made her nose run it was so hot. 

 Great place to eat.
