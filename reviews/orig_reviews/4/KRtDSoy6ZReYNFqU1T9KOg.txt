I always find it reassuring when I pull up to a Mexican restaurant that there's a bunch of landscaping trucks parked and the guys are inside eating lunch :)  I thought Mixteca did a pretty good job with my carne asada tacos, rice and beans were not a complete afterthought, decent chips and salsa bar.  The staff was friendly (they actually SMILED).
I was about to get a little p.o.'d when my taco platter and small Diet Coke was more than nine dollars but rest assured the portions are by no means skimpy.  The decor was typical fresh-Mex beach type, I could certainly see myself enjoying a cerveza on the large patio when the sub-100 degree days resume!
