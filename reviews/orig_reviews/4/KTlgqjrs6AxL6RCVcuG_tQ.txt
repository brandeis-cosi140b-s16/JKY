Cilantros is a small and traditional Mexican restaurant. We were mostly impressed with Joe our server. He was so attentive and friendly which made us feel welcomed.
The food was also very good and the prices were even better. They have a salsa bar with unique salsas that you normally won't find in most places. The decor is very modest and casual. 

We ordered the alambres plate and la ranchera. They were both very good and tasty.  They also provided us with complementary chips and salsa. Wooohoo!
