Nom....nom...nom. Sooooo freakin tasty short-ribs of beef. I couldn't believe the sensation of taste that was going on in my mouth. It was better than sex and there was a side of guac! I had the rice bowl and it filled me up. ::closes eyes, relives moment:: I miss Las Vegas for this reason.....and this reason alone. 

The bf had tacos, which were super fresh and tasty too. 

This place needs to add horchata and authentic Mexican rice and it will be good to go.
