Great Mexican food!  I was a little nervous because I am pretty picky about my Mexican food -- but this was great!

The service was fantastic.  Their salsa was amazing -- one of he best I've ever had.  It kind of tasters like it had a few tomatillas thrown in too.  It tasted extremely fresh, like they just made it.

I will definitely go back next time I am in Las Vegas.
