I am SO happy we have Cabo Fish Taco here! 
I'm a regular!
My favorite is the signature 'Cabo FIsh Taco', which come 2 per entree.  Also, my side of choice is the 'jalape√±o mashers' or when in season, the fresh fruit.
I've also had the Tavarua Tuna Tacos & the BBQ Mahi Tacos & the grilled shrimp tacos. These are equally delicious!
The chips & corn salsa are yummy too; however, sometimes the chips are soggy, so be careful of that,
Margaritas, even the "el cheapo' are very refreshing...& like the name says, "cheap"! :D
