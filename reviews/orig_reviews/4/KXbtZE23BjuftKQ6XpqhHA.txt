We had a Groupon for tequila tasting at Cien Agaves and were looking forward to trying and doing something different. Unfortunately we didn't understand the tasting is only held one day a month so when we presented it on a Saturday night (not the night of tasting) our server needed to explain there was no tasting this night. She was very nice and had the manager come to our table to see what he could do. He explainied how the tasting works and that it wasn't available for our visit. We were disappointed but decided to stay. The manager offered some great suggestions from the menu and ended up giving us some credit for the situation. We will definitely go back for the great margaritas and hope to do the tequila tasting in the future. Great customer service; we will be telling our friends to check this place out.
