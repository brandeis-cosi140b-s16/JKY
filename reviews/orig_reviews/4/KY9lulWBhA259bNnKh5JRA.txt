Another great yelp discovery! 

Stopped by for lunch on a weekday in the end of August with family in tow from out of town and all starving. Cozy small shop. Ours was take-out. Busy there, but not so busy as to cause a wait for food as the prep was most efficient. Very personable and accommodating gentleman taking orders and preparing food in view tailored to the customer's liking.

Delicious breakfast burrito made just like one of our party requested. Enormous! Carne asada burrito with tasty, tender steak done right, too. Again, enormous! Ask and ye shall receive as far as most ingredients go. Cilantro, onions, mayo, etc., just say yes or no.

And did I mention "enormous"?

You'll definitely receive your money's worth for well-prepared, fresh, delicious food.

Will be back for sure and highly recommended to all.
