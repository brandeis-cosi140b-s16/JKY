Delicious. Right near my ob offices and I haven't had many pregnancy cravings but this place is becoming an addiction. It is so good! No wonder parking is hard and the line is almost always out the door.

It is spicy. Like almost anything you get will end up being spicy, even the pico has jalepenos. But it is really good. I want to try a salad next time, but the enchiladas just call my name. I have only tried the short rib and the pork, but both were good. I agree with the tips about to go containers. Both times I've done it it seems they over cook my food and it sticks to the container. Not burned or anything but just like 30 seconds too long and I have to scrape it off haha. Still good though, totally worth it.


Price wise it's a bit expensive but you get what you pay for here and it's worth it!!! Yum yum!
