Chips, beans, and salsa are great!!! So were the Cadillac Margaritas!!!!
I ordered the Mulitas, corn tortilla topped w/beans and cheese then your choice meat... I had chicken and carnitas... then topped with cabbage, queso fresco, guacamole, and sour cream. These were very tasty! I liked the carnitas a bit more than the chicken. I will def try the carne asada next time!
My husband had the Parrillada de Marescos.... Marinated Basa Fillet, Shrimp, Langostino, & Scallops over grilled onions & salsa quemala... the flavor of this dish was AMAZING!!!!
Food was really slow coming out, but they were really busy.
I ate so much of the chips, beans, and salsa (which again were great) that I couldn't hardly eat my dinner.
Left overs were still good the next day!
