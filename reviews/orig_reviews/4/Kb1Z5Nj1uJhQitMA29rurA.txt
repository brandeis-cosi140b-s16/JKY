Really good food is the only thing that was on my mind when leaving the Rancho. Ordered the Tia's Plato with chicken. The chicken was amazing. It was so tender and well flavored. The refried beans had a smokey flavor I will be craving long after my visit. The place was packed but the service did not drop off.
