I'm kinda loving this place.  My family is in Madison on vacation and we always travel with our lil' vegetarian so we are always on the lookout for vegetarian-friendly places.  After reading about Tex Tubb's and passing it earlier on in the day, we decided to give it a try.  We were so glad we did.  Lil' Vegetarian tried the black bean flautas.  They were quite good - crispy on the outside and then grilled, keeping the inside hot and creamy. The guacamole served with the flautas was a little on the too-citrusy side to enjoy.  I had Elisa's choice taco - probably one of the best vegetarian tacos I have ever eaten.  I never would have thought to deep fry an avocado, but really, it works.  Trust me.  My husband had the beef tacos and the fried catfish taco.  I had a taste of the fish taco.  It was crispy and topped with a crunchy cabbage slaw that was very good.

The salsa bar had four choices of salsa.  Nothing overly exciting but all of them were certainly tasty.

Two of us decided to add beans and rice for an additional $1.98.  It was different than your usual beans and rice.  The refried beans were far better than the black beans but both were tasty.  Next time, I'll skip the rice.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The beans were ample enough to fill me up anyway :)

We had a very nice server.  She was having trouble with two of her tables shortly after we got there but she remained calm, cool and level-headed.  When asked, she had a suggestion for a local custard shop for us to try, but that is another review.

Good service, tasty food - we'll be back.  Oh, another reviewer said the price was high, I disagree, three dinners, three drinks, $40 - not bad at all.
