Really enjoyed this place. We had an EXCELLENT server and goddamn if I didn't forget his name already (Aaron? Eric? Sorry, dude...) LOTS of different types of tequila and our server really knew his stuff. I'm not much of a tequila drinker (too many shots of Patron followed by an 18-hour bout of hugging porcelain many, many moons ago) but he pointed me toward a few types that either had a slightly sweet or non-existent aftertaste that went down smoothly, with no lime needed. Nice! Food was good too - mini tacos are tasty and come three to an order. You do have to pay for chips and salsa but the chips are to freaking DIE for, thin, warm, crispy, fresh, salty, PERFECT.
