I enjoyed this place quite a bit. I had three different types of tacos. I liked the carne asada best. The meat had a slightly Asian flavor due to the marinade that my wife didn't care for. My wife liked the veggie taco. This place has a cool funky vibe. Be prepared to wait there is always a ton of people.
