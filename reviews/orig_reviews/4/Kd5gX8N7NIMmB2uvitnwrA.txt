Met up with some friends here for dinner one evening. None of us had been there so it was a new experience for us all. We had a table inside, right outside the patio which is very cute. Two of us arrived before HH ended, so I got a margarita (horchata & fireball). Too much fireball for my taste but others may like it. I also ordered a taco to try but didn't get it and didn't want to make a fuss. We shared the spicy salsa flight. I really only enjoyed the ghost pepper salsa and their house salsa. For my entree I had the filadelphia in burrito form which was huge, filling, and very good. I took half home to eat the next day. We ended the meal by sharing the churro dessert which was good. All in all, I'd be back and recommend it to others.
