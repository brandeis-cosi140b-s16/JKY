Well Carolina's is just freaking yummy. It's so good. It's also so cheaply priced! The menu is varied, the take out is fast, and the staff is friendly. They have a salsa bar and varied soda machine.
I have to knock a star off for the inside "dining". It reminds me of a school cafeteria. A big room with old tables that remind me of card tables. They also play strange Christian songs when on hold for takeout. Be advised they are closed on Sundays.
Give a call and do some takeout. The food really is great and they certainly don't skimp on cheese and other ingredients.
