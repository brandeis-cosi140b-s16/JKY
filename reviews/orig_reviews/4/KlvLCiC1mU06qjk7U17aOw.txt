Delicious Mexican food! The decor is a bit less like the taquerias in California, but more similar to the Mexican chains in CA or Tex Mex chains on the east coast -- cheesy, homey atmosphere, with the familiar margarita glasses and heavy plates. The menu is comprehensive -- a lot of generic Mexican dishes you would expect, plus Michoacan specialties.

I got the carnitas, and man, was it good. It was not the deep fried kind, but rather, slow cooked and stewed, which made it really flavourful. The green sauce complemented it well, and the rice and beans were good as well. It was a really big plate though, plus I always fill up on chips because I love salsa, so share plates if you need to. I barely finished half of my plate!

Service was a bit slow, but overall not too bad. I just want to taste those carnitas again...
