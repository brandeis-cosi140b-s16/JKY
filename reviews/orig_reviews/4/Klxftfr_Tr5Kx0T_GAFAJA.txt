My husband and I really enjoyed our first visit to Blanco last night.

Service was great (he even packed us up some salsa and chips to go!) and the ambiance is nice.

We started with the Crab and Shrimp Ceviche (big chunks of seafood; nice and crisp) and the Shrimp and Corn Cheese Crisp (grilled sweet corn complemented the sharp cheese SO nicely! Yum)

Our main meals were Tacos (Machaca, great flavor! and Roasted Chicken, which was way too salty; only bad note of the night) and we barely finished everything. No room for dessert but we were feeling fat and happy.

Will definitely return!
