Brushfire is my "go-to taco drive thru place" i love their shrimp taco and their pork taco! Loaded with flavor and very fresh tasting. Doesnt taste like "fast food". I have always received my order in a timely manner and overall the customer service is great! I love their rewards system as well. I think they should open more locations!
