SOLID, better than a lot of the other "local Vegas" places you can go..   

You know it's going to be good when the owner is still active in the restaurant.   He was working the register and really wanted to serve clients right.   We talked a bit about Wahoos, his goal of having a restaurant in every state, not selling out (but that's okay... ), wanting to be private like In-N-Out..... anyhow about the food

I had the CARNITAS TORTA.   It was very well executed.   One of the best mexican-american tortas that I've ever had.    Loved that they used fresh ingredients like first generation mexican but tasted americanized in a very good way.   Reminds me to an mexican version of Jack Urban Eats (Sacramento) and a similar quality to Guisados (East LA).
