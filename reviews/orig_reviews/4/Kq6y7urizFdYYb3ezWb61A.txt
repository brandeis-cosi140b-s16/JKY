My girlfriend and I love to come here when I visit from California. This is my third time here and I really enjoy the atmosphere. The food is decent and the service is great if you are a fan of Americanized on the cheap side Mexican food then this is the place for you. It's our tradition to come here and I can't wait to come back.
