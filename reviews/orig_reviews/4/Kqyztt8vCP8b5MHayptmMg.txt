Mexican food was the last thing on my mind for my first dinner as a newbie NC transplant from San Diego, CA. SD has great Mexican food (no surprise as Mexico is 25 minutes to the south.)

Yet, once again I am saved by the Yelpers. I arrive NC exhausted from flights with delays. All I want is food. This was 5 min from my airport hotel. 

The chimichangas had moist, tender chicken with onions and peppers. The tortillas had a nice delicate crunch and savor under a generous helping of guacamole and sour cream. The refried beans were earthy. And the chips and salsa were as everyone says - great.

Nothing I like more than a local hole in the wall with yummy good. Great value too. Service was a bit indifferent for me - otherwise the food is 5 stars.
