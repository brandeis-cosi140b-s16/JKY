I really liked it. Their service was top notch, very attentive and courteous staff who can definitely handle chaos. Being the only 2 casual eateries not counting the hidden pizza place in otherwise expensive restaurant land Cosmopolitan, they are slammed all the time. I passed by everyday staying there and it was like a street mob scene. Regardless, they had hired a bunch of cool cats who handled the situation well which I really liked because feeding hunger after walking around all day is one serious business.

The food was superb. Very very fine for street food. I loved it. Of course it was also because I expected nothing at all* Bah! Jose Andres? Oh no, not another Jose Andres joint, Tacos? Dim Sum? Oh whatever. So thats how I went in. But blow me down, I was dead wrong. They executed very well for what was just mindless street food in an expensive hotel. I shared  their beef tongue taco (excellent, low fat) , har kow (nice twist), viva china taco (didn't like this one, too fried), Cochinita taco (good), lobster taco (not special enough), Roujiamo Sandwich (good enough) and that was about it. I really loved the quality of their meat cuts. 

Pricey? Yes, because tacos, dim sum etc. are not usually, thats the problem. But was it worth it? Yes again.

Atmosphere-- casual. So after all the partying and dressing up for great dinners, this is a welcome change. People are happy all around, not high and drunk like the other casual eateries because they don't serve up cheap fruit punch cocktails here. 

Just too cool for that.
