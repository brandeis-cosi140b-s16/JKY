Baja Bar & Grill has become my new favorite University restaurant. Located in the Smash Burger parking lot, Baja is just down the street from UNLV. The prices are definitely agreeable, particularly for the specials. A number 1 for example, includes 3 tacos of your choice with a drink for $5.50. The manager informed that Baja's specialty are fish tacos, but alas, I will never enjoy them because I'm a hardcore vegetarian.

I settled instead for 3 potato tacos, which were quite delectable by the way. I was pleased with the presentation but even more so by the taste. Baja's potato tacos are probably the most unique and creative tacos I've ever had. Everything from the corn tortilla to the last bit of cilantro was perfection. I even got to sample a fried oreo for dessert with the Yelp check-in. And of course it was delicious. 

The atmosphere at Baja screams University friendly. The manager is decked out in red clothes and Rebel gear and the restaurant is plastered with bottle caps spelling out UNLV in large letters. He's a friendly dude. 

I have to acknowledge some of the other Yelpers complaints - yes, the place needs a facelift and for some that's unacceptable. But if you like hole in the wall restaurants and are looking for some good food, you won't mind.
