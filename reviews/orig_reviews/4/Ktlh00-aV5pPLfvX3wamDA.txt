Viva Zapatas is located on East Craig in a more questionable area of Las Vegas. I had heard good things about this restaurant from friends and today we thought we should give it a try. 
The inside of the restaurant was a little too dark we thought but the overall atmosphere was very good and authentic. They had someone playing traditional Mexican music. 

At the beginning they brought us chips with salsa and beans. WOW that was tasty. Then as we were done with those, they brought us more, plus we both got a tasty tomato noodle soup, which we loved. 

The menu was well organized and we ordered 2 of their combination plates for $10 and $13. The food was good in quantity and quality. 
Also we tried the rum fried ice cream desert (I cannot remember the name). It was good, even though I was a little overwhelmed by the rum taste.
