Upon walking to into this establishment I wasn't expecting much. Very minimal decor, cafeteria style rows of tables and no "ambiance" if you will. They asked if I'd ever been there before and when I replied no they ushered me away from the cash register...a little skeptical until I was shown an assortment of menu items to try for FREE! nice touch! So after sampling everything I was shown how to fill out their order form, that was the reason I can't give five stars! It was very intricate and detailed and required too much thought for a starving person!! I ordered a bean cheese and carnitas burrito. Boring I know but after sampling all the amazing things they offered I wanted something I hadnt tried! The meat was tender and juicy not dry at all, the beans and cheese were perfect. Best part of the burrito was that the cheese wasnt that cheap oily cheese they use in most mexican joints! I was also offered my choice of chocolate or snickerdoodle cookie with my meal at NO CHARGE! score! I was dining with about nine other people and that was the first time all day we were all quiet!! I'd definitely return here on my next trip to Phoenix!
