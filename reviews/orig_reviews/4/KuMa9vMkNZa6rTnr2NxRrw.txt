Service was very good. They have awesome pork carnitas! Great flavor. I had the torta. Flavor was nice. My only complaint was it was a little on the small side, just a little:-) their salsa is also very good with the house chips. My friend got the chicken nachos and liked them. Portion for the nachos was HUGE! Very nice place and atmosphere. Check it out!
