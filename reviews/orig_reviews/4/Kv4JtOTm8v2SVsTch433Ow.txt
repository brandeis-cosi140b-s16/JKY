An update is long overdue.  Christina, Leo, and Jessica.  They are the best group of bartenders ever, in my years of going there.  All give you great service, and take care of all of their customers.  I am comfortable going to the bar for food and beverages any time, knowing that l literally have no worries... unlike previous times.  
Christina is the spicy one, bringing a nice flavor to the atmosphere.  Leo is the philosopher, who can discuss most topics with insightful contributions.  Jessica is the mom, who often  anticipates your needs before you articulate them. 

The food has been consistently good, and the only problems I've had were resolved to my satisfaction.  

See you in a few months, readers!
