We've been here 3 times in the past two days. Twice for breakfast and once for drinks. The breakfast is priced just right for those that don't want to pay an arm and leg to eat. The food was great and that's what brought us back. We stopped by for drinks one night and enjoyed the atmosphere. Two locations on the strip. One in the Miracle Mile Shops and the other further down the strip. Good food and good drinks while in Vegas.
