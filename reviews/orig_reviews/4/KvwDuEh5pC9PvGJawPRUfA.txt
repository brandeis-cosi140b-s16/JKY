The food was really good but their beans and rice side for a plate is ridiculously priced. The service was horrible! Waited forever get a table because it said please wait to be seated then to be told go pick out what table you want. Took almost 15 mins to get chips. And our waitress was rude and didn't check on us once until it was time to pay. She didn't ask if we wanted refills or a box for the 3$ beans and rice we got.
