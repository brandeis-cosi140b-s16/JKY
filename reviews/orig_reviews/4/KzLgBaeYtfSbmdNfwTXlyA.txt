Pros:
-Lots of good food.
-The food is good.
-There is a lot of it.
-The food is cheap.
-You can get lots of good, cheap food all hours of the night.

Con:
-Lines are long.

Seems to me like the pros outweigh the con! This place is best approached with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.

Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).

Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.

Â¡Buen apetito!
