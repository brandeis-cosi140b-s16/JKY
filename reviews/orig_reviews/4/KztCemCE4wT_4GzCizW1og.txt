Quick one. Great place, beautiful decor and vibe. There were two of us for late dinner. Jessie was really cute and a great server. Eli, one of the management crew, came over to chat and was very kind.  

This place is Asian fusion tapas. Probably a little less Mexican than they say. Innovate menu with smallish portions, but priced like it. Strong flavors ; they're not afraid to go sour. 

I had a couple of very thoughtfully put together cocktails. There's a big drink menu and they have the mixology figured out.
