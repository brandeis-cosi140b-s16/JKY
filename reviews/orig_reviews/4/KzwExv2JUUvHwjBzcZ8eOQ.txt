Okay... I like the chola-inspired low-rider bike motif... I HATED REHAB...and the old man liked it (and, we may finally break up after almost 3 years of non-committed bliss : ) )... I kid, I kid.  Needless to say, I was all giggly when the server told us that the meat-market was closed during Super Bowl (the only time he visits)... Yeah for me... too bad for him, and his buddies.  
Anyway.  If you enter Pink Taco from the inside, you may just feel like you are dinning at a Chevy's... if you go into this place from rehab, you will cringe a little.  That is all.
