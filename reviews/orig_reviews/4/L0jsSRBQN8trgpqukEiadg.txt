I'm perplexed by a number of the more recent reviews indicating problems with this establishment.  I had  wonderful experience at this place a couple of days ago.  The food was fantastic and the service was decent as well.  I would definitely go back.  I was also extremely impressed with the Thai Chicken Nachos.  Prices are reasonable too.
