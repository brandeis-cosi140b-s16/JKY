Second visit to pink taco and was just as good as the first. Food is fresh tasting and drinks are delicious! Actually the only good margarita I had all night! I get the skinny chica and it's very good!! Service was fast and friendly and when my friend didn't like her drink (strawberry margarita was more like a smoothie) our server quickly exchanged it no problem.
