I've been there twice, both with the Groupon for a meal, side, and margarita. I'd definitely pay full price here though.

They have GREAT specials- last time I had pulled pork. They also had amazing crab-stuffed peppers which my boyfriend loved. The sides are good too- the cactus nopales and grilled green onions had amazing flavor. The fried plantains were a little smushy. The have interesting entrees that aren't your typical Mexican restaurant food- I had salmon which was cooked perfectly and topped with fresh pineapple salsa.

The margaritas can be a little unreliable- the first time we came, they were overly sweet. The second time, we went early on a weeknight and they made them fresh, not from a prepared pitcher. The server said they use sweetened lime juice, not a mix. They were pretty tasty on my second visit.

Atmosphere wise, it's not great- it's in a strip mall on the west side. It's near the discount movie theater. Inside, it's booths and tables- definitely nothing fancy. But the food is much higher end than the surroundings!
