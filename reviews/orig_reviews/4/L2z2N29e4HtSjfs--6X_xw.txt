Great atmosphere for a night out with friends. Parking pretty difficult but there is a cash lot nearby if you can't score free street parking. Tacos are large and filling (2 were plenty). Jalape√±o mashed potatoes (which they don't have year around) were delicious but honestly all their other sides are just mediocre at best.
