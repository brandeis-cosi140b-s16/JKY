Maybe it's because I work in San Fernando, CA (population 90% Hispanic) that I'm just used to really good Mexican food, and it takes a lot to impress my tastebuds. I've heard a lot of hype about Roberto's food (A LOT), so I had high expectations trying it for the first time. 

We ordered a breakfast burrito and a chicken taco & chicken enchilada plate (#6). The best part of the burrito was the homemade tortilla. The rest was nothing extraordinary. The enchilada was good, with lots of meat, and a very tasty red sauce. The taco was okay, but I liked the fluffy shredded cheese they used. The beans were not great, and I love good beans. The rice was okay. The red chili was good (and reminds me a lot of the sauce at my favorite taco truck in LA). The green was okay.

The shop has a drive-thru which is appealing if I lived in Vegas. I'd definitely use that when I want to be fat and lazy. Inside the shop, you have to play Goldilock & the Three Bears, and try all of the tables to find one that isn't crooked. I like the posters on the wall of the story of Roberto's. It's nice to learn about the person behind the business.

This place has good food - don't get me wrong. My deal is though that Roberto's isn't anything you can't get anywhere in L.A. at local taco stands, authentic Mexican fast food places, or at any of the plethora of taco trucks in L.A. I just expected more from the hype!
