As a new resident to the Southwest, I was on a mission to find fry bread. I heard about this place and decided to visit. The location was very busy and doesn't have a lot of space which makes finding seating difficult. However, it didn't take long for a table to open up. 

I had the carne asada fry bread which was delicious. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It's a pretty heavy dish so come hungry and forget about counting calories. 

I really liked the free chips and salsa too.
