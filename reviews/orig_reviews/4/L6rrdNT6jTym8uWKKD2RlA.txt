Had such a good experience last week I jumped at the chance for a return visit last night for Julia's UYE. But now I'm thinking I may have jumped the gun giving them 5 stars right off the bat. Yes, the food was still delicious, the service was still friendly and attentive, the atmosphere still rocked (especially with the guitar guy - Love that guy!)... But it's the high prices I have a problem with. See, the food's good, but not that good, not good enough to warrant the high prices. Especially the special combo appetizer plate, a tiny little thing that ran $24.95, which we didn't discover until the bill came. And we apparently unintentionally ordered 4 of them. oops.

Thanks Julia, for a super fun UYE!!
