Good food with some ingenuity for a reasonable price! Service is really hit or miss here. Sometimes great! Sometimes meh. Bartenders are always good. Downside for dessert lovers, they don't serve it in an effort not to cannibalize their dessert cafe but really? Just serve stuff from there!!! 

It's a good standby after work...
