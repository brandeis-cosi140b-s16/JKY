Was seated immediately on Sunday evening. Our waitress, Kaley, was very pleasant and helpful as we were deciding what to order.  I decided to try the chicken enchiladas mole with charro beans. I really liked the flavor of my meal, but the enchiladas were not hot, they were cooked, just not warm. With that being said, I still ate them.  I also tried a couple of bites of my husband's fish and beef barbacoa tacos. Again, good flavors but the beef was a little chewy. Kaley responded pleasantly when we provided the feedback. We ordered flan for dessert, which was also good, a lot of caramel in a custard with a firm texture.  Overall, I would give them a second chance but would ask them to check the enchiladas if I ordered them again.
