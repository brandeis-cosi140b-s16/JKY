Went here with a group of six a few nights ago.  The food was as I had been told, absolutely delicious.  The girlfriend and I each ordered a different taco and then swapped when they arrived.  Our waiter didn't make us wait for anything, but he was definitely trying to turn the table over as soon as he could.  As soon as we say he was on us about ordering. Then as soon as we had finished our food he arrived with the checks.  No question about a second round of drinks or even dessert.  I wish I had caught his name, so I can know to avoid him next time.
