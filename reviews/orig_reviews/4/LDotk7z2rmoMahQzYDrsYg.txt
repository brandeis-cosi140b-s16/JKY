I go here 3 times during the year on one of my cheat days and what I like is that the food is always consistent. I order new things every time I go and never had a bad meal. The only reason that I gave them five stars is that the food does not blow me away. It's good but not great. What is great is the service. My drinks are never empty and it's service with a smile. I'm a big fried ice cream fan and they have the best in Vegas. Nice environment to take family out to dinner or guest from out of town to see the nice view of Vegas. In my opinion the best Mexican food in Vegas. If you know of a better one let me know so I can try it. Thanks
