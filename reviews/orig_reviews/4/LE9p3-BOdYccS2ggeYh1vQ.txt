I have seen good and bad reviews, and for those who are conflicted as to why there are such varying scores, I hope to clarify. The meat and other items are super fresh, under-seasoned and appear to be health conscious like Stephanie A. said. The service is fast and friendly (even more if you speak spanish) and the salsa bar is huge. Here is the main issue, they lack seasoning all around. I first thought this was an issue, but then I realized...Its about the SALSAS! They are amazing and provide a myriad of flavor that the tender fresh meat supports. If you want street fresh healthy food with SALSA as the star, go to Taco y Taco. If you want salty or more flavorful meats I would go elsewhere.
