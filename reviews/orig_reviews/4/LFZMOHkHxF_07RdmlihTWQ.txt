Favorite take out Mexican food in town. The bean and cheese burrito is my go-to order, and it never fails. The homemade beans are so delicious and the tortilla is thin and buttery making it a true authentic experience. The atmosphere is awesome because it is situated in an old house complete with a backyard with a fountain and a large tree, perfect for an impromtu photo shoot!  Also they serve Coke products, always a plus! Great service and hospitality too. A downside is their lack of complimentary chips and salsa.
