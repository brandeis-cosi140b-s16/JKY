Cabo Fish Taco is one of the most hoppin' restaurants in Charlotte and for good reason:  tasty fresh Cali-Mex (or Baja) food, cool ambience, fresh salsa, and its proximity to all the hightlife joints in NoDa.  However, the place is somewhat "tainted" by their reputation.  I've never been when it wasn't packed and the servers weren't rushing us to order.

Dont' get me wrong-I still highly recommend that people try Cabo.  Just try it out for lunch or whenever the gallery crawls in NoDa are not taking place.  I've had the taco salad with chicken and on another occasion, carne asada tacos-both of which were slammin'!  The carne asada tacos uses chunks of well seasoned meat-with onion, cilantro, and romaine lettuce.  I was exceedingly full after eating just two of them.  The salad screamed freshness as well; chunks of real chicken, romaine lettuce, and other fresh veggies and cheeses.  Mmm mmm!  

if you dare go on a weekend night, please be gracious to the wait staff.  They work pretty hard and brought our food in a timely fashion despite the crowds.  If I could offer any suggestions to Cabo, I would tell them hire more wait staff for the weekends.  The service doesn't quite match the quality of food.  Perhaps they could open up the upstairs for dining as well.  Overall, I'm pleased to have a restaurant like this in CLT.
