We happen to be in this part of town and decided to try Leticia's.  We almost didn't go in because parking looked ridiculous, but then we discovered a large parking lot in the back.   We were seated promptly and our waiter was very attentive.  We told him that we'd never eaten there before and he made some recommendations to us.  This was not your average Mexican place, and we had a hard time choosing from the menu.  I went with the 2 taco plate.....one with chicken tinga and one with pork carnitas.  Both were excellent and unlike anything I've ever had before.  The cilantro rice was delicious, also!  Hubby had a build-it-yourself burrito and he really enjoyed it.  We will definitly go back.
