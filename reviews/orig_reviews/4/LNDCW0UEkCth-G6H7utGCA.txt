One of my new favorite restaurants in my area.

Being vegetarian, I love the chinese vegetable quesadilla with their delicious hot sauce drizzled all over it. I normally get this with a refried bean burrito (combo), white rice and refried beans on the side. This is a ton of food. My girlfriend & I normally split this meal and are plenty full afterwards.

The finishing touch of a snickerdoodle cookie is fantastic. Love this place.
