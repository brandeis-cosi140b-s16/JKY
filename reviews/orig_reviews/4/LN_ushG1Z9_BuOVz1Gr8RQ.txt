If you dont go for sunday brunch then its just so/so and pricey.  As far as a sunday brunch goes its a slam dunk.  Food is good, solid variety, fresh salsas, and the all you can drink margaritas actually have some alcohol and taste good.  Dollar for dollar one of the best values, and best mexican all you can eat/drink buffett by far.
