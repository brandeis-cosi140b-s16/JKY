How sad we won't enjoy the company of Car G. at Secreto anymore. LOL Myself and several acquaintances regularly enjoy the food, the drinks and the reasonable prices. The carne adovada is excellent as were the grilled scallops I had there a month or so ago. My wife loves the fillet Mignon with asparagus spears.  Let Car G go cry somewhere else.
