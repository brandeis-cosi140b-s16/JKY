Every bite was delish from the chips and  salsa to the finger licking good chicken fajitas. The chicken was very flavorful and veggies tender but still crisp. Cooked to perfection!  Dave the Manager stopped by our table twice to chat with us. 

Can't wait to come back and try some other offerings here.
