Love Tacos and Tequila! Originally stumbled upon this place and glad we did. They have a awesome Mariachi  Brunch on Saturdays and Sundays from 11-3 and not to mention 2 for 1 Margaritas. It was so entertaining they sang all pop songs from Madonna to Britney to Michael  it was so much fun and cracked us up. The food is amazing! If there is one thing about living in Vegas is you are often asked for suggestions on the strip.  This is always one of my top five!
