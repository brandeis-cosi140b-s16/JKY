Nice friendly and laid back not-quite-a-dive bar. We went for the reverse happy hour and they have a nice selection of beers, wine, drinks. Kind of typical bar food but we were ok with that. We got the nachos with chicken which were really good. Service was very friendly and on point. Check it out if you're in town!
