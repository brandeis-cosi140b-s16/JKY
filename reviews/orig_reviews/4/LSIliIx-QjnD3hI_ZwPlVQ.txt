My wife and I were visiting Old Scottsdale and The Mission was on our short list of places to eat. We ordered the fresh guacamole and it was very good. For the main course I had the Pazole soup and my wife had the skirt steak tacos. The soup was out of this world. Smoked pork in a spicy tomato broth with hominy and avocado. The skirt steak tacos were nice with a charred ouside and tender on the outside. Top it off with a few margaritas with Grand Marnier!
