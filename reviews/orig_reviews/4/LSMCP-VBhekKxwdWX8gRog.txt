We were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess into a nice spacious booth among a beautiful hand painted wall, with the sounds of upbeat Mexican background music that wasn't too loud, all creating a relaxing ambiance.

Excellent service by a gentleman named Arturo at this authentic Mexican restaurant located off Tropicana, west of the 215.  

Complimentary tortilla chips that were accompanied with a bowl of refried beans and hot salsa that were very tasty, but we added a guacamole bowl that made it complete. 

Considering the name of this restaurant, we both tried the fajitas. See photos below. 

Cadillac Margharita for her and I had a Negro Modelo beer, both hit the spot with chicken fajitas for her and a combo platter for two of beef and pork for me. Absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection!

If you want to try really good Mexican food, this is the place! If you want excellent service, ask for Arturo!

We'll be back!
