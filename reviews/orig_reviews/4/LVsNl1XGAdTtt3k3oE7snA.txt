I've heard of the Magic Mushroom joint, but this came at me out of left field.  I decided to hit this shack with a work bud of mine (Groovy P.) to check it out.  The first thing I noticed (other than the wonderfully tacky decor) was the decent prices.  Tacos are $1.50 each (tax included).  I went with the Burro.  Honestly If they would have named the place Two Hippies and a Burro, I would have enjoyed myself more.  But Beachhouse is fine too, I guess.

The guy taking orders is the owner himself.  He owns the Magic Mushroom place down on Indian School too.  I think its refreshing to have the owner taking orders.  Owners know how to do it right!  He asked me my first name and scribbled it onto a brown bag. NOW I'm diggin this place!  He was calling regulars up with nicknames like Snowman Steve, and Sarge.  I wanna be a regular to find out what awesome alter-persona he labels me.  Knowing my luck, he'd name me Conehead Chris or Corporate Chris or something else I wouldn't like. I wanna be Snowball Steve!

The wait was long. 25 minutes long! Standing around staring at other people waiting. *Check watch* shuffle feet *Check watch*... Then I hear "CHRIS!!! PATIO PICKUP!"  Wtf?!?! Wheres the patio?

So I get my food and scarf it down.  Carne Asada... not spiced for a typical burrito... Cabbage??? To say the least, it was pretty damn good.  For $4, you can't go wrong!  Next time I'll just get 2 tacos...

I'll be back, Mr. Hippy...
