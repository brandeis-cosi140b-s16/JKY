Moved to Scottsdale yesterday. While our furniture is set to arrive next week, we decided to stay at Valley Ho for a few nights. Didn't want to go far from the hotel since we were super tired, having just driven down from San Francisco. Decided on the TF. 

Maybe it was the warm weather, outside seating, good margaritas, or maybe it was that I hadn't had those things in so long...SF just can't seem to get that combo right. Whatever the case, the place was good. 

House-made black bean tortillas with a chili butter to start...good stuff. This was followed by queso fundido (I have missed you) and chips and salsa fuega. California, by-and-large, can't get cheese dip right. Not sure why, or maybe I've just been eating at the wrong places over the last decade. Either way, this was great. Salsa fuega lived up to its name, too. Spicy and roasty. Chips were crispy, not greasy. 

Margarita was fantastic. No sour mix. Actual citrus. Always makes the difference. 

Entrees...red chix and cheese enchiladas and pork chili verde. Both were really good. Red sauce on enchiladas was no joke. Complex and good. Potatoes in the chili verde could've stood to be salted more, but there was salt on the table...problem solved. 

Service was what sealed the deal. 

Why only 4 stars? As I mentioned, I was tired and only just getting acclimated to the change in weather, scenery, and general niceness of AZ. I'll def go back in a month or so, and see if it was as good as I remember. Until then, this is my story..and I'm def sticking with it.
