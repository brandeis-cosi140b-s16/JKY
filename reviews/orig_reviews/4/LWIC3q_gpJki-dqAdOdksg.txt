I like my margaritas like I like my men...Strong.  Sabor Latin Street Grill delivered.  At first look, it seemed like just another burrito place, but it is so much more.   Every order is cooked fresh and it is more authentic than any other fast food burrito place.  The margarita was mix free so it didn't contain the syrupy sweetness that mix margaritas have.  

The salsa bar had 6 homemade salsas on it ranging from different degrees of spiciness.  

Only downside was the overuse of pepper.  It tended to overpower the food at times.  

Still if you are looking for authentic mexican street food with a higher quality than the chains, this is the place to go.
