Lol @ the previous reviewer's comment, "Walk to Terminal C instead". Bahaha!

That's pretty funny although I can't state that I had the same experience. Departed a Corporate event this past Friday and in between flights we all developed the "munchies". We decided to split an order of nachos which was surprisingly enough for 4.

Perhaps I've grown a bit too used to the "fake" Mexican food in California however this place didn't come up short. I'll digress again and state that perhaps my expectations weren't all that heightened in lieu of this being "airport food".

I was quite taken aback. Haha... Maybe I'll fly back in for another meal. 

Maybe....

Did I mention that my colleagues all became so inebriated on the booze served here that we all missed our flights??? Nothing better than being buzzed in an airport and having to wait standby for the next flight.
