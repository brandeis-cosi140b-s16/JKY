We had reservations for a party of eight after seeing a show at Cosmo. The love for food was strong with the servers of China Poblano, they were passionate and very educational about their concept. Everything was fresh and flavorful. 
I highly recommend anything with their amazing corn tortillas! And their mole was delicious, the chocolate pepper creaminess was melt in your mouth amazing. 
Go and try their small plates, take the advice of the staff.
