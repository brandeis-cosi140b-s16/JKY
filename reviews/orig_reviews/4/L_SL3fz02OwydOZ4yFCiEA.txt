There's a reason that there's 800+ reviews averaging 4 stars...it's quite a dining experience, especially sitting in the outside patio section trimmed with beautiful white lights. We had a group of 7 and our waitress was menu knowledgeable and provided great recommendations (including tequila!). The guacamole was out of this world...but the entree portions are a bit small...so don't come here super hungry...or be ready to drop quite a few pretty pennies
