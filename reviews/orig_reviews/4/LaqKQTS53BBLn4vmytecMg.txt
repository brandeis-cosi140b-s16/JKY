Love this place.
Mexican food, with a New Mexican flair (red chile, and green chile all over the place on the menu). Service is always good, the salsa has a great kick to it, and there is a salsa bar if you don't like the one brought to your table. Not a bad sauce on it.
This place has a fajita buffet for lunch, and it's good (not a big buffet guy myself, I like to eat off the menu). Never had a bad thing at this place.
The vibe is great, being inside The Palms, right across from the entrance to the Playboy Club. 
Highly, highly recommend. Very good for a chain.
