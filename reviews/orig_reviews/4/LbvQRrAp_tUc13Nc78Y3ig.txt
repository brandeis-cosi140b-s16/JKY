We had our table booked here for months before coming, as we ate here on NYE before heading to the Michael Jackson One show. We mainly booked in advance so that we could eat somewhere on NYE that had a good vegan selection for myself, with plenty of options for the others in my group.

The atmosphere was great, we had great service and the music was good. They had hired a Mariachi band that came around the tables and played tunes on request for tips. We got them to play Folsom Prison Blues by Johnny Cash! They created a great atmosphere and the tune was flawless! Really fun.

The food was great, I had the vegan burrito and everyone else ordered vegetarian/meat dishes. Everyone said their food was tasty and a good portion.

Overall, no complaints! My burrito could have been more 'saucier' but it wasn't essential.

If you're a vegan, or just after some good Mexican food while staying at the Mandalay Bay, head on over to Hussong's!
