The Carne Adobada is the best in town and I love the salad they provide before the meal.  I have tried many dishes at this place, Heidi Pasta great and I like the trio  that includes the enchilada and tamale but I am hooked on the adobada.  The only downfall is the wait,  sometime I am just too hungry.  A girls gotta eat!!
