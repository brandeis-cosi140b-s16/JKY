Great atmosphere - small restaurant with great local art on the walls (that constantly changes).  Fast service - once you get a table.  I almost always go during the week, because it's quieter and you get seated quickly.

The food is Southern Mexican, which means it has a more subtle spice, very flavorful, and isn't overloaded with cheese.  (Yay!)  Guacamole is delicious.  There isn't a lot I can eat (I'm a lactose intolerant pescatarian) and they took my favourite dish off the menu (the pescado veracruzano... it was truly amazing), but I go for experience.  I usually get the shrimp or fish tacos, which are great.  Sometimes I get the tilapia wrapped in a banana leaf, but it's a little pricey. 

Great restaurant for small groups.  I would come more often, but their menu hasn't changed much over the last 5 years and I wish it would.  Barrio has received well-deserved lavish praise for years and now it kind of feels like it's just coasting.  Definitely worth trying.
