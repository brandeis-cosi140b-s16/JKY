One of my favorite places when I went to ASU Poly. I drove by it daily 5x a week for a whole semester but never stopped. It was not until my last final I had some time to kill beforehand and I was starving at 9am. Think I got a ham breakfast burrito (ham, potatoes, cheese, onions, tomatoes). It was soo good I scarfed it down, which was a bad idea to stuff myself before my final. 

So I didn't return again until the following semester and dropped by almost weekly. These times I pretty just ordered the basic bean and cheese burrito. Just the sheer size for $2 was great, but again added my 
free (L, O, and T) and made it taste even better. I didn't mind the setting, free water, and parking because my filling lunch was less than $3 with tax. I liked the owners, the lady was always nice and remembered my order.
I do miss this place because my major did get switched to downtown and then graduated. If I didn't live 30 miles away I would definitely be a regular again.
