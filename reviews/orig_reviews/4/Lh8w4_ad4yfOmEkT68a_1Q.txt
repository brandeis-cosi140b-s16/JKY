Ohhhh Cafe Rio!!

My friend brought me here for my birthday lunch normally only eat chicken or turkey. So I have never been here before and I decided to go with the chicken bowl or I guess its the chicken salad. Upon entering it was really really busy so I took that as a good time there was a long line and whilst I waited i looked over the menu. What I loved is that they were making homemade tortillas!! I decided on the chicken salad , there are 2 types of chicken, the marinated one or the fire grilled chicken and I went to for the grilled chicken. I also had it with the beans and the rice. They also put 1 scoop of guacamole some tortilla strips Cojita cheese of course your romaine lettuce. It's served in a really big containers so it's actually kind of nice the only drawback about Cafe Rio is that is pretty expensive and if you get an extra cilantro dressing they charge 95 cents for it. 

I got to work and delved into my lunch, my first thought was that I was so excited because it was so delicious. The chicken was really tender the tortilla strips are really fresh and the dressing was a perfect addition to the salad. The tortilla that was homemade is seriously the best part, so delicious and tasted just like the ones my grandma made. The salad is big enough for lunch and for dinner so it's really actually kind of nice so I don't mind paying $10 for the salad itself if you go during lunch be sure to get there early or order online because there sometimes there is a long wait or no chairs available. Also don't forget to get your Cafe Rio card which I still haven't gotten and I'm gone twice. 

YAY!
