We love this place, its as close to Tex Mex as we have found in Phoenix. Absolutely recommend the appetizer dip trio and the fajitas. Atmosphere is awesome, especially on the patio (which is climate controlled but might still be too hot in the summer) or in the bar. The service has always been pretty good; water glasses refilled quickly as well as chips and salsa. If your looking for some decent Mexican food give it a shot. Its in a good area for going to dinner and then going out to the bar.
