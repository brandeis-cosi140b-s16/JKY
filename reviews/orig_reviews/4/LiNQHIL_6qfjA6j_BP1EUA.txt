Went here with some friends for some drinks & gub on a Saturday afternoon. I like the layout of the place - and we were even able to watch some college football which was a nice bonus.

For food we ordered some tacos - chicken, beef & duck carnitas. DELICIOUS! In fact we had to order more because the hubs at mine and I wasn't about to miss out on any of the goodness.

Also, they DO sell boxes of wine for $30... so of course we ordered one. Other than the horrific hangover the next day, it was definitely a great time. I haven't been at night, seeing as how I'm old and can barely stay awake past 10pm, but I've heard from friends that it's a good time. Maybe one crazy night I'll stay out late enough to give it a shot...
