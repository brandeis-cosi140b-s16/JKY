My friends who live in Chicago RAVE about Mercadito. My friend who lives in Summerlin raved about this location. So, naturally, when I was coming into town for New Years, we decided to have dinner here! The NYE Sharing Menu after a certain time was 40 dollars per person for a ridiculous amount of food (and even later, you had the option of reserving a table for more money per person which included food, an open bar, and a midnight toast). We opted for the 40 dollar sharing menu. This included 2 guacs or salsas, 2 small plates, 4 tacos, 2 sides, and a dessert. 

We tried the following:
* Habanero Salsa - I was nervous from the name that it would be too spicy for me but it was delicious with the perfect amount of a kick to it! I wish I could have had a bowl of it! 
* Traditional Guac - actually tasty! All too often, I get to mexican restaurants where I have to add salt and salsa to their "guac" because it's just smashed avocado, but Mercadito's guac was extremely tasty and perfectly seasoned!
* Flautas - probably my least favorite item that we tried, but was still pretty good, just not as flavorful as everything else we tried.
* Nachos - probably one of my FAVORITE items that we tried!! So delicious, a generous portion and the perfect amount of every toppings!
* Tacos - we tried the Hongos, Pollo, Cameron, and Carne tacos - I don't really eat much meat, but tried all of them and my faves were the hongos and pollo! We figured we would pick 4 tacos and get one of each to share- but we got 8 total tacos... needless to say this was a ridiculously large meal and we were ridiculously full ;) 
* arroz y frijoles - black beans and rice. Kind of on the plainer side, but still subtly tasty! 
* roasted poblano cauliflower - SPICY and super tasty!! Highly recommend if you're a cauliflower fan!

We ordered a few margaritas as well. Their marge are great and you have the option of adding smoke, adding heat, or adding fruit. I added heat to one of my margs and it definitely gave it a kick - pretty good, just not something I usually expect in a marg, so my second one was without heat. Overall, the margs were strong and delicious! 

The service was on point for the most part! It took a while for someone to come and grab our order but once he did, he was super attentive and everything came out pretty fast (almost too fast considering how much food we had!! ;) )

Loved the food and drinks and can't wait to check out the one in Chicago next time I'm there!
