I must like it because I've gone back several times - they grill the chicken and beef for their tacos and burritos over a wood fire, which gives it great flavor and they have a nice selection of house made salsas, going from mild to spicy, to go with the food. They have always been busy when  I  have been there and seem to be a favorite of people in the area - for an authentic taste of local Latin American cuisine it is definitely worth checking out.
