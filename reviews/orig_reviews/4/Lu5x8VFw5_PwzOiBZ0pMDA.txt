AWESOME...AWESOME...AWESOME!  HUGE portions!  Great prices...pretty darn good (not perfect, but good) service. I would go back in a second!  Gave us a free ride (paid them a "donation") back to our hotel about 10 min away.

My only complaint:  the stupid music players.  OK...it is someone's birthday..play them a song and sing and move on.  We were there with another couple and could not even talk for literally almost 20 minutes because these guys kept on playing and singing in the main room right beside us.  This is NOT for a social dinner.  I honestly, seriously...honestly almost asked them to shut up and let us eat/talk.
