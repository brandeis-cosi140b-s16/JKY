I'm a huge fan of the Sunday Brunch at Cantina Laredo.  They have crab cakes benedict for $13.99 and it comes with a complimentary bloody mary or mimosa.  It's a really good deal and delicious!  The chips and salsa are super fresh and if you save some room for dessert you have to try the Mexican apple pie which is very yummy! 

I think the reason that I like the benedict here is because they make a special chipotle hollaindaise and it adds enough of a kick of heat to it to really accentuate the other flavors.  I haven't tried any of the other brunch items because I'm addicted to the benedict, but I have been with people who have ordered them and they have all enjoyed their meals.  :)
