Some of the better authentic Mexican food I've had since moving to Phoenix.  It doesn't compare to some of the amazing Mexican I've had in Tucson, but for Scottsdale, it was pretty good.  It's a dive, 100% a dive, but the best Mexican places are.  The carne asada was good as well as the tortillas.  They had horchata, which was also very good, if a little on the sweet side.  My friend had the chicken, which received rave reviews.  I will be back when I'm craving some good authentic non-frou frou Mexican food.
