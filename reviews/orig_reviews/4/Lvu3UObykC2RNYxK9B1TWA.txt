Thought it doesn't look great on the outside, Huaraches Moroleon is cozy and charming inside, with friendly staff and authentic smells and tastes. I ordered a huarache, carry-out, which I have never tried before. It was a corn-based shell containing steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and pineapple (!), if memory serves me correctly. The sweetness of pineapple in this fried concoction added a really nice touch. Some places place too much meat on the food, others have too many toppings, or use too much oil. The huarache was a bit on the greasy side, but overall it was balanced. The sauces they provided, too, tasted homemade, and I didn't remember how unique they were until I saw some of the other reviews here. 

I was quite pleased with the meal, and would definitely stop by again.
