In the land of over priced, non authentic , all show no substance food, this place was a gem. Walking down the strip not wanting to pay $20 for a simple breakfast we came across this place. They had a $4.99 breakfast meal and other options that did not break the bank. It was so good that we went back twice for breakfast. The food was good, authentic home style food. The first day I had chilaquiles and two eggs over easy and they were great. I felt like I was eating a home, second day I had the huevos rancheros and again they were phenomenal . I am glad we stopped by for the breakfast it gave us a break from the over priced meals in Las Vegas.
