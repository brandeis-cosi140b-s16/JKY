What's not to like about the Bandido?  You've got two of the best hunger cures fused unpretentiously under one roof. At the lil Mexican Panda you get a pretty huge meal topped off with a stellar free cookie for a joke of a price - plus the "in the know" feeling you get when you finally figure out how to order here.  It can be daunting for a first timer. 

There are some misses here, because chinese doesn't always fuse well with Mexican, but there are some tried and true classics (I wont repeat the exhaustive list of favorites that other Yelpers have already posted). 

Chino Bandido is truly original and highly addicting.  Definitely worth a visit.
