Mulitas de adobada are the best. Adobada is pork meat marinated. You can order tacos, sopes, french fries, french fries with meat on them, quesadillas and a few other stuff. There can be a very big crowd at times. I fined if it is less crowded during the day and during the week. The tacos are street style tacos very much like they sale in Mexico.ENJOY
