Nothing super fancy, just really really good. Simple menu of fresh-made creatively-topped burgers, tacos, fries, chips and milkshakes. Service is very friendly and fast-casual speed (order at the counter, they bring it to you in 5-10 minutes). Very affordable. Location/ambiance is nothing to speak of, but it's clean. We love this place.
