Okay, okay, I didn't get it and now I do. After our first experience, my husband returned and had the torta. He claims it is the BEST sandwich he has ever had--this is a big deal for my DH because he loves a great burger, but he LOVES these tortas. So I decided I had to try this place again, and I am so glad I did. We have ordered tortas to-go several times, and they are great every time.
