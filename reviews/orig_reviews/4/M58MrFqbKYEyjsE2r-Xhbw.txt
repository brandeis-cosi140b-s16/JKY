Nice place. Food was outstanding. Salsas were great. 
My Naco Torta unique, delicious.
Mexican paella nice take. 
5 Star but for one service problem.
Two of us faced the front door. As the sun set a very strong sun hit us face on. ABSOLUTELY NO EFFORT was made to block the sun. 
Service people seemed amused but what was needed was something to block the window for about 20 min until the sun set.
Has To be a recurring problem?

Still will return for the excellent menu, but now know what seats to avoid in the early evening.
