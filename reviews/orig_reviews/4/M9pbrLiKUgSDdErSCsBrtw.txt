Was craving some tacos and saw the reviews here so decided to give it a try. Place is a total dive, but in a charming way. Got the chicken mole tacos and they were outstandingly good. Also got a La Condesa Taco w/ chicken and thought it was just okay. I asked to make them really spicy and they definitely had a bit of a kick to it. The tacos are huge so I was full. The salsa bar is pretty interesting and has a diverse selection of salsas (try the peanut one, it's very good). Service was friendly and the prices are really fair.
