So I see a lot of people saying that this place had bland food, but I ordered the Camarones a la Mexicana (Grilled shrimp covered in a delicious, medium-hot chipotle pepper sauce. 14.99). The shrimp was EXCELLENT. It had tons of flavor.The rice was okay, it wasn't nasty and it wasn't the best. The guacamole was most likely fresh and pretty tasty. Their salsa was good and the chips were GREAT. I also ordered a side a beans ( which I think should MOST DEFINITELY come with the meal) and they were actually pretty decent, I liked them. I also asked if the restaurant had horchata (if you don't know what that is please get hip) and that horchata was comforting! In Los Angeles it's easy to walk into a Mexican restaurant in get horchata, but in Pittsburgh... Nahhhh. So I was super excited when the man made me some horchata (with no ice... God bless his soul). But this restaurant is definitely good, and it is a huge upgrade from Gran Agave at the Waterfront.
