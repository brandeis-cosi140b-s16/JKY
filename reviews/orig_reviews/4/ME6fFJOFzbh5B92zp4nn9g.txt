Once you get over the fact that this place is a hole in the wall dive (which is a positive in my book), prepare to be impressed.

We've lived in the Valley almost 8 years and never gotten around to eating here. Now that we have, we'll definitely be back. The free samples of their most popular dishes was helpful since I'm not crazy about spicy food. I had the Emerald chicken with fried rice. The sauce over the chicken was awesome. My only issue was that there were way too many green onions in the fried rice, but that's a minor thing. Next time I'll just get plain rice. Hubby had the Red chicken and a few other things I don't remember, and said they were good. And of course, the snickerdoodles were totally a random thing but delicious.

Even better, this place is CHEAP!
