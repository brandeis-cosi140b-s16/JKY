I am NOT an expert on Mexican food but here is what I love about this Cantina:  really homey dining area (with a pope table for parties!!), great deck to enjoy your food while overlooking East Blvd, fantastic quac and great portion sizes.

The quacamole here is second only to Loco Lime.  Always fresh and plentiful.  They make it right at your table and to fit your palate.  Excellent accompaniment to a Dos Equis lager.

I have had the steak fajitas, soft shell tacos, chopped salad...all excellent and reasonably priced!  The valet is the best option for parking since it gets jammed there on summer nights.  Love you Cantina!  :-D
