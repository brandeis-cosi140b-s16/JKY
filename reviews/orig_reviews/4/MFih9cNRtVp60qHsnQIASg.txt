Was here last night for a Yelp event.  

Reason for the missing star - The handicapped stall in the ladies room on the patio - Its door latch/lock is broken.  Couldn't keep the stall door closed.  

Being almost 30 weeks pregnant and maneuvering in a regular stall - Not fun.  

Other than that - I've always loved this tucked away location!!  :)
