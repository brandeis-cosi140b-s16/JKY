I finally got a real meal at Carlito's (after visiting for some margaritas, chips n salsa and legumbres many months ago -- all of these things were very good).  I confirmed which items were vegan with the owner via e-mail (most stuff - beans, veg, rice, sopapillas, chile sauces).  So basically you have a great variety of vegetarian choices and a good variety of vegan options here.  And the meat looks pretty good from what I've observed but not tried.

Ok, so let's keep in mind that this is NEW Mexican food.  Not Mexican.  Not tex-mex.  It's not supposed to taste exactly like Mexican food.  And it doesn't! It definitely has it's own character.

I got a burrito w/ beans, rice, calabacitas, and green chile sauce.  It was gigantic! Pretty tasty too.  But the real star of the day was the sopapilla.  OMFG, how has this not been a part of my life?! Light, pillowy pockets of dough that are toothsome yet melt in your mouth as you chew.  I'm in love!!  If nothing else, do yourself a huge favor and go try a sopapilla.  If you don't like it, call me and I will come finish it for you.
