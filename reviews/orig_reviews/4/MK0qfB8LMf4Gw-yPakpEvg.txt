Lovely location on the Canal.  Classic margaritas are tangy with fresh lime juice, some of the best I've had. Queso Fundido comes with freshly made tortillas. A bit heavy on the fresh cilantro, but that may just be me. Hubby loved the mushroom enchiladas, I somewhat enjoyed the shrimp burrito. Shell was drier than I'm accustomed to in a burrito, but the filling was good. The cilantro lime rice was fresh and well-cooked.
