Mmmm. Enchiladas have always been one of my favorite foods, and there's a Phoenix eatery solely devoted to cheese-filled tortilla bites of heaven: Gadzooks.

For those of us who always dreamed of an enchilada bar, Gadzooks makes those reveries come true. The spot serves up just about any type of enchilada you'd like, as well as quesadillas, soup, tacos and salad. The tortillas are freshly made, and the combinations are endless.

Fillings include chicken, pork, potato, bison, mushroom, short ribs and two types of cheese ($6.50-$6.75 for two tacos or two enchiladas), and then you get to douse your order in salsa, sauce, slaw and more. You can order three, but two were plenty for me, and I left with a full, happy stomach.

The joint is order at-the-counter with a patio, and it's a really great alternative to Chipotle if you're looking for some new fast Mexican food. They also serve sangria, margaritas and beer.
