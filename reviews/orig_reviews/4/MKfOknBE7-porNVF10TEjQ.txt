My date and I started in the basement which was super cozy. While waiting, we were distracted by the amazing aroma of food surrounding us from other tables. Once we sat down, we could NOT make a decision about what to order--everything looked so good. Our server was very helpful in aiding us with picking appropriate sized plates (we were starving and nervous we wouldn't have enough haha). We left with a to go box and no room for dessert! Loved it. Can't wait to go back. GREAT date night spot. But we prepared to wait and have a drink, this place is busy for good reason.
