My friend goes here all the time and brought me with her once - now we go all the time together! Great atmosphere, awesome good that really tastes like legitimate Mexican food, the way it SHOULD taste. It may not be gourmet, but it's still good and very high quality for the price!

I always get a #9: 2 chicken tacos with rice and beans. So good! But I definitely need to try their other menu options, too. I've heard the burritos and enchiladas are great.
Oh, and the horchata is amazing. Drink it.
