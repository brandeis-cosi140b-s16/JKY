Some Burros is pretty darn good. I usually keep it simple with a carne asada or machaca burro. My friend and I ventured outside of the usual burrito/enchillada and tried to Mexican Pizza. It was pretty friggen bomb. AND it's cheap too! I would recommend ordering ahead because it takes a while and the guy servers can be a little creepy. Other than that this place is pretty good.
