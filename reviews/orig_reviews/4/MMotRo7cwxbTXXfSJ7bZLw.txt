The Border Grill is a Santa Monica favorite of mine, so I was happy to get to have a tried and true dish while we were in Vegas last time.

His plate:

Kobe beef tacos, grilled pineapple salsa, guacamole, handmade flour tortilla, black beans

Her plate:

Grilled Skirt Steak (ordered rare), charred corn relish, black beans, handmade flour tortilla

The salsa selection provided is always great - usually a bright verde, a smoky chipotle, and a fresh, light pico de gallo. I had previously marveled at the freshness and flavor in each, and ordered all of Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Fenniger's books so I could make these at home. I'm happy to report that their salsa recipes are easy to make and very close in flavor to the restaurant's. (Look for some recipes on the blog soon!)

The steak here is some of the best I've ever had - and from the two times I've had it before in Santa Monica, I can also report how impressively consistent it is. Great marinade on tender, high quality steak is always a winning combination.

D liked his tacos, though isn't as in love with this restaurant as I am.

An important note, for the Vegas patrons who live on points and rewards - they may be located within Mandalay Bay, but this restaurant is actually independent - you do not earn nor can you use reward points here. Not that it should discourage you from going at all, just good to know!
