A small hole-in-the wall type joint that is putting out some flavorful food! This place is hidden in a shopping center that you would easily pass by. Luckily, they have good reviews here on Yelp.   

Service is very good. Berto is personable and knows the menu very well. 

The food was yummy! Chips and salsa were delicious (I feel this is always a good indicator how the food will taste at a Mexican restaurant). I ordered the Aguachiles and wow was it good. Limey, salty and spicy! I also had a michelada and must say it was one of the best I've ever had. Finished off the meal with a horchata (best I've had before-- home-made) and the fried ice cream was very good, too!

I will be backkkkk
