Consistent service... Very friendly staff. A great place to catch a cerveza, margarita and watch a game... Or a full on meal. The enchiladas are my favorite... Chips & salsa very good... Margaritas I get with patron... That's a plus:-) pretty standard fare... Could use a bit of unique to the menu... But I still love Manuels:-)
