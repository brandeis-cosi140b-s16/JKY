The Hot Salsa is very Hot, the mild Salsa is very Mild, Both were VERY Good!  They give you some Lime Wedges - In my Bowl I mixed a three parts Mild Salsa with one part Hot and a squeeze of Lime Juice!

My Girlfriend had a Chicken Chimichanga... I'm not sure I have ever tasted one of these and I know I do not want one again... She said it was very good!  My Soft Pulled Pork Taco was very Good and the Hard Ground Beef Taco was good!

Our Server was GREAT!  She knew we would not like certain things and would like others! 

Mr. Union County Physique World told me there is Mexican Food and there is Mexican Food, this would be the later!  Mr. Hoy Approved!
