The food here is surprisingly decent although pricey (of course).  I seem to always be able to score a nice table right next to the canal and it's cheesy but I like it.  The margaritas are good (and pricey) and the service is friendly and efficient.  The last time I was here, I had a coupon for 15% off the entire bill and I definitely appreciated that.

I ordered three fish tacos and they came with rice and beans and extra tortillas.  The tacos were very good and the rice was cilantro rice and tasty (don't be put off by the green tint).  The beans were good, too.  We also had chips and guacamole which was very big and quite good.  I was definitely full when I left here.

When staying at the Venetian, this is a convenient and good option that is less expensive than some of the other options at the Venetian.  I think it makes a very nice lunch or casual dinner destination.
