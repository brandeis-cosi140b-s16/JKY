This place is our breakfast spot when staying at Planet Hollywood. For 4 dollars you get 2 eggs, bacon (or ham or sausage), potatos, and tortillas (before 11 am). Our server was really nice and the food tasted good enough. The coffee however, was pretty terrible. Totally watered down. I also had dinner here before. I had the shrimp fajitas and they were pretty good. If you stick with the basic you'll be fine. Easy and quick place to eat.
