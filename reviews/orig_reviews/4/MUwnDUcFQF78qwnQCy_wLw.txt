This is a classic spot to take out of town guests who want to get off the Strip and see how the locals live.    This place has it all:  small, noisy bistro with great prices and a rocking Southwestern cuisine.  We've been four or five times and although the wife experiments with the menu, I cannot get past that Green Chile Steak Sopapilla, which is one of my favorite dishes of this decade.  Go in and just order it.
