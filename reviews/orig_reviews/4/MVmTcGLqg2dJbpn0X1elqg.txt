Updating my review here, as I just grabbed some takeout from Nacho Daddy (due to unforeseen circumstances with the children). I spoke with Angie, and she helped me out right away. 

Ordered the burger nachos. I really like these particular nachos, and so do the kids. Angie brought them out herself promptly, and in a pizza box, so no spillage (hooray for nachos in pizza boxes! Genius!) she was very helpful, and even provided us with utensils and salsa for our needing to leave promptly.

Angie, you are an asset to this establishment. The nachos were wonderful, and I will be back because of your awesome customer service. Nacho Daddy will be on my list of frequent places to grab a bite. Thank you! 

(My daughter even asked if we could go back and see "Ms. Angie" every time we go out to eat).
