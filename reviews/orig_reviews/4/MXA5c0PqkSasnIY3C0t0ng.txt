I had a lot of good meals during my recent trip to Vegas, but Diego just might top the list. It's an upscale Mexican restaurant with hip, colorful decor and fun atmosphere. We tried the summer tasting menu which consisted of a margarita or sangria, soup or salad and your choice of entree. They were pretty busy so the kitchen was backed up when we went, but the waiter was honest and apologetic about it and we had a strong margarita and chips/assorted salsa to keep us company. 

The salad sounded pretty good but I went with the tortilla soup. It was pretty delicious, the kind of thing I wish I had a whole pot of in my fridge so that I could eat it for days! For my entree I chose the chilean seabass which looked absolutely gorgeous and tasted even better. It just might be the best piece of fish I ever had. It was just buttery and creamy and fabulous. 

It was a very satisfying meal - comfort food taken up a notch - and with the $32 a person tasting menu it was a pretty good value as well. Being Vegas, they gave me a to go cup for my ginormous margarita. Highly recommended!
