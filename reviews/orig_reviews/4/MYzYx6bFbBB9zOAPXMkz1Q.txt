**** Alert! Alert! ---- Mexican Ninjas Invade Choice Gas Station !!!! *****************

A Mexican ninja who goes by the name of Carlos is a one man show a la Magic, a la Lebron.  He takes the orders, preps/cleans when no one is there, chops, cooks, rolls, serves - the one man ninja does it all with SPEED, EFFICIENCY, and CONSISTENCY!

I never seen a cook work so fast and deliver stellar, authentic, home cooken Mexican fast food.   We walked up to the counter and didn't see the bell by the register so stood for a few minutes while Carlos was in the back being his ninja master self.  He arrived back and showed us the bell - now we know...hah

We asked him what's good......the asada, burritos, fajitas to which he replied, "everything....everything fresh"   I asked a follow up question and was cut off with the same reply.   Carlos wasn't going to budge and after ordering a chile verde and asada combination plate, and a fresh order of tortilla chips and salsa i know why.......Everything here is the sh1t!   

What I like most about this set up is that you can watch how it all unfolds.  Nothing is hidden.  You'll see all his tricks if you can keep up.   Order with confidence and you'll be granted a quick, fast, homemade meal that's better than any fast food mexican in vegas and rivals most sit down restaurants.
