We received a gift card and went back to try Joyride again.  We have been back 3 times since my first review.  We obviously love the tacos, because we keep coming back.  Definitely go on Tuesday or during happy hour for $2 tacos!

The service is still hit or miss, sometimes it is good, sometimes you have to ask for things multiple times.  You never know how its gonna be.

We try something new every time we go....the beans...huge disappointment, don't waste your money!  The cheese y mas is very good!!  Not worth the normal price of $9.00 (outrageous), but we will get it again during happy hour for $4.00.
