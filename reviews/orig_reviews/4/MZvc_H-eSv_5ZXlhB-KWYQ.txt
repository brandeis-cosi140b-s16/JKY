I had Enchiladas Rancheros, and my wife had the Rio's Specialty Burrito.  Mine said it was supposed to come with rice and beans, but it had only beans, as did my wife's plate.  Huge chunks of beef and chicken breast in my enchiladas and in my wife's burrito.  Very tasty.  Excellent chips and salsa, and plenty of both.  Excellent house margaritas (blended and on-the-rocks).

Other than getting no rice, it was a place we'd return to (and probably will).
