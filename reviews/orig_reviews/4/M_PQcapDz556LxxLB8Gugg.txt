My wife and I went here for dinner, and overall mixed but positive results.

The good:  Corn & Flour chips plus salsa were terrific - crisp, warm, and great salsa.
Courtney's Burrito - laced with Inferno sauce that is actually spicy!  Generally what they advertise as hot/spicy is pretty mild, but this definitely packed a kick. Not overpowering, but genuinely hot.
Honey Flan - light, creamy, maybe a bit too much whipped topping, but not overly sugary or chemical tasting.

The not as good: My wife's fundido.  I forget which it was she ordered, but it was basically a chimichanga with a creamy jalapeno sauce on top.  It wasn't bad, the chimi was crispy, it was just pretty bland.  It could use something else in there to provide a contrast to the cream, something tangy to cut through it.

Cost of the two entrees and dessert was close to $40, no drinks.

Close to full on a Saturday around 5:30, probably busier as the night goes on.
