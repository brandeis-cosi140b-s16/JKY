It was my first visit here, and I was solo, so naturally I took a seat at the bar so as not to take up an entire table or booth.  The bartender/waitress was super nice and the salad I ordered was amazing (chicken, avocado, something delicious in a ranch cesar type dressing)!  I was only drinking an Arnold Palmer since I had to drive but I was not rushed from the bar and that was much appreciated.  There was also a great singer with his guitar (not too loud and complementary to the atmosphere).  There seemed to be many happy hour specials on drinks and I hope to partake on my next visit into town.
