I love Mexican food and love this place! =) 

This was my first time visiting the restaurant after discussing where to eat, our fiend finally suggested this one and so we went..It was quite a drive from the east side of town but we were not disappointed. The place looks very inviting that it reminded me of the movie Mask of Zorro and A Walk in the Clouds where they have those mansions with yellow paint with wall murals and nice potteries, it made me smile right away. It just feels homey. Service is fast and good, a basket full of chips and small bowl of salsa were immediately served as you sit down. Our server that night was very helpful, accommodating and very nice. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada dinner which is not your usual enchilada from other places. This one is served with rice and beans and the enchilada is done like a pancake, never had this before but it was sooo good! I ended bringing the rest of it home. The hubbie was craving for a some sort of bean dip so we got a side of the bean sauce they have..And boy! This was more than yummie!! Really delicious!! We finished the whole platter!! heehee Pricing is also very affordable with the big serving you get. 
This place is worth the drive! =)
