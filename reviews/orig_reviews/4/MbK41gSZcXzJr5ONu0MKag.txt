good, quick, & easy place to stop if you've in/out privileges for a club. esp if you need more food to keep you awake/allow you to drink more

got 3 x carne asada and 3 x adobaba tacos. hecka good!! felt like i was in sf or san jose. i think the alibabas were better than the carne asadas

a plus: didn't feel any gassiness or stomach upset-ness later at the club like i sometimes do from taquerias, phew

free chips & salsa would be cool, but i guess i don't really need the extra cals anyway

I'LL COME AGAIN
