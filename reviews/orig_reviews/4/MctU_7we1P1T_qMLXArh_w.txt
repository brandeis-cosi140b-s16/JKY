This was our first visit to Nacho Daddy. Kim our waitress was excellent in her suggestions! I ordered the spicy shrimp nacho and my wife got the buffalo chicken nachos. Both were great and Kim was excellent and kept checking on us. The buffalo chicken had too much sause for my wifes desire but Kim informed her to order the sauce on the side next time as each order can be customized to to your liking. We will definitely return.
