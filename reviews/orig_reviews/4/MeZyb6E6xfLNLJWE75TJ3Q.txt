Excellent service, surprisingly cool interior for a casino floor restaurant. Food was excellent but different. Went here for my Birthday craving nachos and got some very unexpected takes on what I ordered. Delicious, don't get me wrong. The salsa/dips were fantastic. Super friendly staff. Definitely check it out.
