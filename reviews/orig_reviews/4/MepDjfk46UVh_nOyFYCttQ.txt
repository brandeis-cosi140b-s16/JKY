It was a pleasure bringing my hungry ass to Yayo taco for lunch last week, as I discovered some jam packed, delicious TACOS. Okay! Where to start?! First, I feel I should highlight this amazing deal: 4 TACOS, 2 SIDES, AND A DRINK FOR $5!! Thats right, FIVE DOLLARS. Thats what I'm talkin about!

I love that the menu has variety and that they are creative with the food- very basic ingredients- yet creative and colorful. My fave was the shrimp tacos, I did not unfortunately, like the Pescado- the texture was oddly off and no flavor. I took a peak at what some of the other customers were eating and I noticed insanely huge proportions and inappropriate facial expressions that screamed SATISFACTION ;)

Basic tacos are  $1.75 and Specialty Tacos are $2.25. You'll have a basic selection of burritos, quesadillas, ensaladas, and even "hamburgers" but you're stupid if you go to a Mexican restaurant to eat a hamburger- so try one of their tasty Tortas! :)

This place is a hole in the wall, but once inside, you have a spacious seating arrangement, limited bar section, and music. The decorations are fun and it almost feels like one of those places you walk into while your walking on the beach board walk. AND staff was friendly :)
