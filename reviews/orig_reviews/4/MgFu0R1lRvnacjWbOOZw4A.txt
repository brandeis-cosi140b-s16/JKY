WOW! This is a great place to go, this is another place that I will visit over and over again. Very authentic, reasonably priced, great service and great atmosphere. 

One of us had the asada taco's which were great, the other had the quesadilla which was also excellent, very filling though with the mexican style cheese. Both were cooked to perfection.
