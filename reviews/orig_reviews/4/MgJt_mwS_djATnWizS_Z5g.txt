Let me start by saying my family eats a lot of Mexican food. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxing. Our waiter,Abraham, was a very good waiter and very attentive. They give you chips with 3 dips when you sit down. The chips and the bean dip are excellent the guacamole and salsa are OK. The burritos are really good! Actually all the food we orders was very good. My wife, Bobbi, said the cheese enchiladas were excellent! The steak meals are amazing! Every time we visit Vegas we will be eating here and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
