I went there around lunch time the other day on the recommendation of a friend.  I had the standard burger with carmelized onion and the short rib taco.  The burger was outstanding, the blend and ratio of chuck/brisket/short rib is spot on.  I opened the wrapper for the taco and there was a huge chunk of meat, quite a lot of protein for a $3 taco.  The flavors were great, but it was a little dry.  Perhaps if they were to shred the meat and mix it with the basting juices?  Overall a great little local joint.  I knocked them down from 5 to 4 stars because of the service.  While the entire staff was very friendly and personable there didn't seem to be much organization resulting in very long wait times inside the restaurant.  It took about ten minutes to get my food after I ordered, when I walked outside the cars in the drive through didn't seem to move much.  I'll definitely go back, but perhaps just not at noon on a Monday.
