If you've read my reviews, than you know I am a huge critic when it comes to Mexican food. So of course when I heard the name "Border Grill" I rolled my eyes and expected to have the worst dinner of my life...

Surprise, Surprise! I was WRONG. 

Yes I said it, for once I was wrong. The food was actually very satisfying. Great flavors, nothing dry or overcooked. A little different than what I am used to in terms of cooking style but nonetheless a very good meal. Customer service was also excellent. Loved our waiter. And even though they were out of the drink I wanted to try (the berry paloma) the other drink I tried was very good.

So, overall not the best in Vegas but definitely not the worst...
