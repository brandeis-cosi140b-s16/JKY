Delicious and a beautiful dining experience!  Located right on the Casino floor, I picked Javier's as the "date night" spot for mine and my fiance's trip to Vegas for his birthday.  Dimly lit and intimate, this restaurant lives up to the hype.  And of course, they have a killer margarita menu full of all kinds of exotic flavors.

Here's what we ordered:
We each had a margarita including one that was laced with jalepenos.  The margaritas are both power packed and unique.  They take some time to create but they are worth the wait.
We started with the ceviche de camaron and of course the complimentary chips and salsa.  The table salsa is delectable and we gobbled it in a hurry with our drinks.  The ceviche is super rich in flavor and chunky.  Very tasty.  The serving size is enough to feed 2-3 people comfortably without being overstuffed.
For dinner, I ordered the Pollo a la Chipotle.  Warning - if you've loaded up on the chips/salsa and anything else to eat before this, you will feel SUPER full.  This entree is delicious but it's seriously filling and rich in flavor.  The sauce is incredibly creamy and there is tons of it to lather the chicken in.

I passed on dessert because I was super full but I wouldn't doubt that it would be tasty!  Bring someone special here, you can enjoy a lovely candlelit dinner and some good eats while you're at it.  Sit near the door/windows and also people watch at the casino.

And of course, the service is exceptional.  You will love the treatment.
