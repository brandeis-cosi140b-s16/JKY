This sister restaurant of Gallo Blanco didn't have to work hard to earn a warm spot as now one of my "go-to" places for breakfast, It wasn't too busy on Saturday morning, which was very surprising to the hubs and I. I guess we were early birds getting there a little after 8 because the place started to have people trickle in within the hour we were there.

To no one's surprise, I ordered the Chiliquiles Rojas. To this day, I still crave the Chiliquiles Verdes from Gallo Blanco, so I was just dying to find out how different or similar the taste would be. To tell you the truth, I couldn't really tell much difference, because I really loved the Chiliquiles Rojas. It definitely had some spice to it, but not the type that you can't handle. It's just packed with the right about of flavor and punch. 

The Huevos Rancheros had a similar sauce but different enough that if you wanted to try both, they'd almost complement each other in a way. This one had no meat though. I personally like having protein, so I ordered my Chiliquiles with chicken. 

We also ordered a side of Quesadilla Synchronizada, which is actually just a cheese quesadilla with Oaxacan cheese. 

Funny enough, even though I took Spanish for so many years, I am embarrassed to say that I asked what the Verderas Crudas was. My particular menu did not say the translation directly beneath. The waitress just looked at me questioningly and politely answered, "Those are fresh vegetables." Ah, but of course! Of course, I wouldn't know what veggies in Spanish was. I am a meatatarian. Veggies only get in my way! None of that green stuff for me! Perhaps it was just the scrumptious Bloody Mary taking hold of me and made me forget, but regardless, we enjoyed our brief time eating here. (Yes, I mean brief as in, we were hungry and ate quickly and the service was efficient and great!)
