I stopped in here for a late lunch when it started pouring outside and I needed to take cover! My waitress, Jen, was really helpful in describing menu items and directing me towards the right choice. She brought out warm chips and salsa right away and continued to check on me/refill my drink throughout my time here. 

I ordered the house salad with seared salmon, which came out to less than $15. The salad size was perfect and the salmon was great. I was pleasantly surprised by this meal and would definitely stop in next time I'm in Charlotte.
