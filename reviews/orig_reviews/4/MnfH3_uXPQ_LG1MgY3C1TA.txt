Best GUACAMOLE EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. They make it right in front of you! You can add or take away anything you'd like! Their salsa needs a little work, but the guac is worth the trip. On Sundays, they have a buffet that has TONS of food really cheap! My husband says Lindo has the BEST fish tacos ANYWHERE (and we've been to a few places...) If you're lucky enough to hit a night when the "1 man mariachi" is there, he's great!
