The Los Sombreros 10 Course Tasting Menu ($50. for TWO) is PHENOMENAL and is something you shouldn't miss out on if you are thinking of trying flavors of Central Mexico as the special will end sometime call or check website. I was told they are extending the special past August to promote the new menu and new restaurant they are opening.

You get. Chips and two Fresh Salsas.

Two cups Pozole Soup
Two Hibiscus Taquitos
Fig & Panela Cheese Salad
Shrimp & Papaya Salad
Salmon with Mango Salsa
Trout with Almonds in Lemon Butter & Capers
Chile Rellenos with Beef Picadillo
Pechuga Rellena (Stuffed Chicken Breast in Chipotle Tomato Sauce)
Pork Loin with Tamarind Mole
House Made Piloncillo Ice Cream

Everything had delicious flavors.

I never had Hibiscus Taquitos before and they were a stand out. A little sweet and cheesy and tangy they were delicious.

The Chile Relleno stuffed with Beef were very unlike any other I had before being much lighter and MUCH tastier than any other I ever had. I liked that they weren't a fried battered kind like you get at most places and only had just the right touch of cheese on them.

The four entrees were all delicious but a few were over cooked but very ACCEPTABLE and that is the only reason I didn't up this place to five stars but I was five stars happy.

The house made Ice cream was very fresh tasting and the most creamy ice cream I remember trying in a while.

This place is far above average and is very good but it's a small place and many tables inside are high tops.



4.5 Stars
