I've never had New Mexico fare, but I have to say it is delicious. I tried a pork Tamale (red sauce), a chicken Tamale (green sauce) and a Navajo Taco - all were wonderful. That great heat flavor, without being overpowered, was soooo good.

This is a great family owned, personable place to enjoy a casual, family friendly meal.

The next time I'm around this side of Vegas, I'm returning for another meal!
