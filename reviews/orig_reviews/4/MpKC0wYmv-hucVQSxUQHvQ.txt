My family & I fully ENJOYED this place. After a "VEGAS" weekend starting on Thursday & doing family things, toys place was cozy, comforting & almost peaceful. The background Latin music was soothing & not in my ear.  The food was GREAT!!! We will definitely be visiting again when we revisit Vegas as couple.  Menudo small was just right size & delicious, Huevos Rancheros was good, & beef tamale was good. "Champurrado chocolate was the bomb,"  my kids words.
