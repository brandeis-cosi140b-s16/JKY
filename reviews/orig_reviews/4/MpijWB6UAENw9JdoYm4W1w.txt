I absolutely love the ambiance and decor at Abuelo's! Being Hispanic, it truly reminds me of childhood memories and it feels wonderful to be in such a place. I know some people have been disappointed but each time I've been there, the food has been great and the service is also good! 

I'm not giving them 5 stars because while the food is good it's not absolutely authentic and mouth-watering. If you are looking for a nice place to take the family or your date, I would definitely recommend Abuelos! **Also their happy hour is awesome! $5 fajitas! $2 Coronas! $3 layered dip! Can't be beat!**
