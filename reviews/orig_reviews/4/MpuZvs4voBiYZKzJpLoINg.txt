First time in, a little smokey but hey what's smoke when your getting great eats.
Excellent fish tacos I would have no problem saying one of THE best fish tacos in Phoenix. The carne asada burro was ok, meat was average in terms tenderness, good cuts and a little seasoned/salty but a cool cerveza would of complimented it nicely. 
I will be coming back! The locals gave me the stink eye but that's just because I found out about one of Phoenix's best kept secrets.
