Grabbed lunch here was quickly seated the waitress was very nice and helpful to my coworker and I who are first timers to charlotte. I highly recommend the guacamole they have side dishes for two bucks if you don't want to spend nine on the big bowl. Their chicken taco with cilantro was awesome, wasn't big into their side dish red rice it slaw but the taco and guacamole more then made up for it. Reasonably pieced too for seven bucks. Will be returning here when I am on my next business trip
