It's Chino Bandido you can't really go wrong. While I am of the opinion that the food is just a little better at the original Phoenix location.. it's still good here in Chandler. I took a star off for location, which is a bit hard to get to and staff. I've been to this location 3 or 4 times and every time, even when not busy the staff isn't very welcoming or inviting. Each time I've brought new customers with me, and it's been up to me to explain the menu, tasting, etc.. it always seems as though the staff has something better to do. The last time being the worst, we went in 40 mins before closing, placed our orders which took much longer than usual, and right about the time our food should have been coming out, we instead are told they're out of something we ordered.. which is fine, that happens.. I own a restaurant so I get it, but I'm not sure how that took over 20 minutes to figure out? So deduction of a star from me for this otherwise great place.
