This place has some great gourmet style Mexican food and the margaritas are great.  We sat in the bar and our bartender was our server and he was great.  That guy reminded me of Tom Cruise by appearance so I am sure the ladies would love him too.  The only thing I can say bad about the place is you do have to pay a high price to eat here but if you don't mind that, it is worth it.
