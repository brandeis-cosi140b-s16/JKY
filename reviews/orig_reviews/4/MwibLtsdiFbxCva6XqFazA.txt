This place is good for dining at if you're with a group, but it sucks to wait for a table if you're with a group. There is no good waiting area, so I always feel like I'm in the way (because I am) if I don't get seated immediately. I stood directly outside the door once while waiting for a table. I was told it would be 15-20 minutes, so at the 15 minute mark, I went back inside to find that the waitress had JUST given away my table away to a couple who JUST walked in. She said she called my name :-t Many places will call your name outside, especially if their waiting area is small or nonexistent, and I was standing within view of the hostess stand. 

Regardless, Taco Tub holds a special place in my heart. I lovingly call this place Taco Tub because when I first moved here, I couldn't remember the full name of this restaurant. My friends and I come here for dinner regularly, and we ALWAYS get queso and Palace Margaritas (happy hour specials all day on T/Th! $5 for the Palace Margarita and $20 for a pitcher, among other things).

I'm not done talking about the queso. It's the first thing you should order when you get here. It might make it harder (or impossible) for you to finish your dinner, but that's okay because THEY HAVE THE BEST QUESO. They have a salsa bar, too, but the queso is where it's at.

I urge you to try their black bean and corn flautas and their chile rellenos. These are my two favorite dishes. Their refried beans are excellent. I do not recommend the Frito burrito, and I can't say I loved their enchiladas. However, they have a wide variety of tacos! Favorites include blackened tilapia and backyard BBQ. I've been eyeing their nachos for a while, too, so I think I need to try these soon.

PLEASE GET QUESO AND MARGARITAS AT TACO TUB. You won't regret it :)
