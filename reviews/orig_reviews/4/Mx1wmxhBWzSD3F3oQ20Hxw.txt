super-legit establishment.  slightly pricey but worth it & a great place for a date. got the Gulf Shrimp.  at first I was disappointed at the portion.  the 6 shrimp(which were delicious) , but all the corn & chorizo was tasty too & filled me up.  tasty chips & salsa.  very nice & attentive service.  authentic
