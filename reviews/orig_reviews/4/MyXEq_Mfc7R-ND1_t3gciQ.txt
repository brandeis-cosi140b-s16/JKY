Holy guacamole!  We have anticipating the opening of Chef Jose Garces Mexican restaurant, and were not disappointed. 

Let's start with the food: A-

Chips and Guacamole: A+    Clearly made fresh and seasoned perfectly.  

Salsa: B-     I mean we ate it but it was pico style and nothing special

Vegetarian mushroom dish (Name?): A+    Mushrooms, truffle oil and cheese on top of a delicious homemade corn flatbread... highlight of the night! 

Arroz Con Crema: A+   Creamy rice with poblano peppers, it tasted like a savory rice pudding, A-Maz-Ing

Tres Leches: B   The cake itself was a little dry, which is very surprising because it was supposed to be a moist cake, the only reason this dessert gets a B is because the coconut sorbet was heavenly!

Hottie, also ordered shrimp and chorizo tacos, brisket, and pulled pork tacos.  He appeared to really enjoy these, but being a vegetarian, I didn't taste them.   

Drinks: A

House Margarita: A+   Perfect flavor, not too sweet or sour.  

Jeff Margarita: B-   Hottie ordered this and it was not nearly as good as the house Margarita. Clearly not worth the extra $4

Milagro Tequila Flight: A   But really was not necessary ; )

Service:  A-
Overall we had very good service; they were very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  What really through us off was the servers were wearing T-shirts, which was strange because even the bussers were wearing long sleeve collard black shirts.  It really looked unprofessional (Not their fault of course).  

Ambiance: C+
I'm sorry but I didn't like the design inside, it was a mess.  The tables were a combination of picnic and princess glitter.  The whole place was confusing, busy and distracting.  They really missed the mark on this one. Although they have a great patio, which is where we will choose to sit once it warms up a bit.  

Overall, we had a great meal, and we'll be back. We are actually looking forward to trying them out for brunch soon.
