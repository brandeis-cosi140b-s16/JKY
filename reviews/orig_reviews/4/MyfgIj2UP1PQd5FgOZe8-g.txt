We had a large (20 or so) group go to Mi Amigo's before a Rattler's game. They knew we were coming and assigned us a very competent server. There were probably 12 different checks and some moving around of people and Laura handled it all perfectly.

Three of us at my table tried items off the $2.50 Happy Hour menu. The beef taco and cheese enchilada were a sweet deal at $5. Really nice flavor on the enchilada sauce. The folks who ordered the guacamole (prepared at your table) also enjoyed their food.

Finally, $2.95 for a bottle of Dos Equis Amber is a good deal but $2.95 for the big glass is a great deal!
