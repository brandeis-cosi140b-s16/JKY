This place is sexy...... woh.
This is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area, not the regular dining area. Is there a regular dining area? huh... don't remember seeing it.

Anyway, the "small plates" menu is divine like jesus. I'm not kidding. The Beef Tenderloin Toasts were as much of a religious experience as I'll allow myself to have. The Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa *blush* caused me to mush mouth the words "ohhhh muhhh gawww" while I was still chewing my food. I don't do that. Ever. It's just nasty. The Blue Crab Tostadas were light and refreshing, the perfect compliment to the rich tenderloin. The wine... let's just say I like me some wine. 

The only complaint I have is that the bartender needed a trim. Seriously... his hipster do was getting in his line of vision and anytime we needed anything I had to flash him to get his attention. Okay, not really but you get the point. 

In closing: This place will make you forget what you were fighting about. Trust me on that. :)
