After wanting to try this out for years,  I was finally rewarded.  The night before we went to havasupai we wanted something quick and easy; this is what my husband brought home.  He purchased the 4 street taco combo and a chicken burrito as well. This is honestly the best Americanized "mexican food" I've had in awhile. The only thing i would change would be to take the sour cream out of the burrito. Otherwise,  Kudos. I'll be back for sure.
