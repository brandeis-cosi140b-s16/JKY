I'm a newbie to the Mesa area, and I've been on the hunt for places to go during my lunch hour. Once my co-workers introduced me to Mango's  I was hooked. This is a perfect place for lunch in downtown Mesa. The service is super friendly and fast, so it's easy for me to get in and out if I'm busy. Their menu is yummy and authentic. I always leave here feeling satisfied and each dish is very reasonably priced. As a result, this spot has become a regular in my lunch destination rotation.

The tacos, tostadas and burittos are some of the highlights on Mango's menu. I can't even begin to pick a favorite because eveytime I try something new I'm happily surprised! They have tons of options, too. I'm dangerously addicted to their endless chips and salsa, and their guacamole is delicious. So, if your find yourself in Mesa and you're looking for food, you simply can't go wrong here. Mango's is great!
