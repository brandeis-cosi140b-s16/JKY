Although it's extremely loud the place is really cool and has tasty food and drinks. I really like the decor and the feel of the inside and the marketing. They have happy hour from 3-7 every day with $2 tacos and 3$ Dos XX as well as $5 specialty margaritas. Tons of TV's and a nice patio in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The bartender was great and very quick. All of the tacos I tried were very good. I will go back and try more items again. P.S. LOVE the fake mustaches they provide free of charge. Mucho funo.
