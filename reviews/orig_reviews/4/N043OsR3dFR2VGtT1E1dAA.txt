I came into Mi Casa with my Husband last week and we chose to sit near the bar to watch the game. The bartender walked by the table numerous times to talk to other guests, I didn't catch his name, but Talia came over and greeted us with a friendly hello and a smile. She is VERY pretty and upsold us some on great Cadillac margaritas! 

The busser Robert brought chips fresh and hot. He then offered waters which my husband was very pleased with. Talia came back to the table and offered appetizers which we declined. I ordered the "Rancho Del Sur" and Talia talked my husband into the seafood enchiladas which were to die for.  We really enjoyed the service and the food. Talia and Robert were such dolls and made the experience worthwhile. We will try to return to Silverton on a weekly basis. THANK YOU
