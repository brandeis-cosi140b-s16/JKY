This is a very cool spot. I thought the atmosphere was very nice. It had a very authentic Mexican appeal with the furnishings, etc. 

The drinks were 'OK' priced..the pre-meal complimentary salsa and chips were fantastic. I asked if they were fat and calorie free..and the waitress assured me that they were not...but the salsa was very fresh.

The tacos I ordered were good...seemed a bit dry, but I'm not sure exactly how juicy fish can be...it was my first time enjoying fish in a taco..so it was a good experience.
