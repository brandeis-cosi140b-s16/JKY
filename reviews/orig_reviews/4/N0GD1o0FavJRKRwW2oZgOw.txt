I had the Pollo Asado tacos and two South American beers. The tacos were very flavorful and were good sized. Came in an order of two and that was enough food for me! The beer selection is very spread out, their selections are from all over the world and full of stuff you don't usually see, but they do have some regional favorites.

Overall, it was a good dining experience and I will go back. 4 stars rather than 5 because my first taco had a small bone in it, not a huge mistake by any means.
