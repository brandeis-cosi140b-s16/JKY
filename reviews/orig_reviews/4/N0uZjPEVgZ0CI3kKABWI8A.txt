Have been dining on and off at the Carlsbat (bat motiv) for decades (back on Scottsdale Rd a long time ago).  Those who give bad reviews just don't get the Tavern.  It has the best Verde Chile Stew I have ever had.  Breakfast eggs benedict amazing.  Habenera Burger not for everyone, but if you can stand the heat, grab one.  The bloody mary bar is fabulous.  Lots of things to explore on the menu, in a laid back casual, not pretentious way.  Highly recommended over and over.  So nice to have a local, not a chain, restaurant with a totally different menu.
