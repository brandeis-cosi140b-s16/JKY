Admittedly I don't have much to base my review on. I have only visited Chayo via a Yelp Elite event. During that night I was treated to samples of the food and drinks they have to offef. One sample plate had seared ahi tuna and some braised short rib. The tuna was amazing and is a treat I will not soon forget. I don't know what the sauce was on it but damn was it good. I was also intrigued and almost giddy at the pork rinds (chicharones) with guacamole topped with pomagranate seeds. I love all three seperately and together they are magic. The final food standout to me was the flan. It was thick and rich the way a good flan should be. The churros were a close second. I believe I told somebody they were better than the churros at Disneyland and that is saying something. One final thought I have of Chayo is the mechnical bull. With the guy controlling it last night I think watching people on the bull was likely more fun than riding. Chayo is a cool place for a lot of reasons. See for yourself.
