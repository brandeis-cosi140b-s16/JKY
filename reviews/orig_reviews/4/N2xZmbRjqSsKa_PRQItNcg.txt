The Carne Asada vampiros are my favorite, but the bean burrito, Terry's Way (of course, of course) is such a delicious treat! On the weekends, you can order the ceviche, which I recommend. I like that they have Coca Cola with sugar, and the corchata - a coffee/horchata combo - is one of my favorite mid-day perk-me-ups! I like the carne asada, but the chicken tends to be over cooked for my preference. The al pastor is really flavorful, but I really can't under emphasize their yummy beans!
