I enjoyed my Chicken Fundido.  It don't care for celerey that was in it, but other than that it was good.  I also liked the beans and rice that came with it.  My picky friend who never eats beans said he thought they were good.

The salsa was a little heavy on the onions for my taste and quite mild, but mixing it with the hotter sauce made it better.

The waiter took good care of us and I have nothing to complain about there. The chips were still hot when they got to our table.  I don't see that every day. 

I will go back there again.
