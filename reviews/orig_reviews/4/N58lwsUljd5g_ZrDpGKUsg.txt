Nice place to hang out with a margarita on a weekend afternoon. Great food and atmosphere, with mountain views and quietness. They even let us bring our dog to dine on the outdoor patio. Order the calamari for an appetizer -- I've never seen it prepared so well. 

My only gripe was that they didn't offer happy hour prices outside... only at the bar, where nobody was.
