Regardless of what my wife says Pepe's Tacos is a great spot. Pepe's Tacos is possibly the most authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I know that is pretty strong praise given the number of Mexican food establishments in town, but when compared to the food I get in Mexico, Pepe's is closest.   

   My personal favorite item on the menu is the Carne Asada. The asada is always perfectly seasoned, quite tender and juicy.  Whether it's on their super nachos in a super burrito or their tacos, it is the best in town. The carnitas is also a great choice on the tacos or burritos as is the birria (goat). On Tuesday thru Thursday Pepe's has a lunch special that is worth checking out. Four double wrapped tacos and a soda for $5.99. It's one of my regular haunts at lunchtime for sure.   

  You don't have to look any further than the neighborhood where Pepe's is to realize that a crappy Mexican restaurant isn't going to last very long. Pepe's is the real deal for authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas no matter what my wife says!!
