Jamar is saving this account their dumbass manager. Their manager has horrible customer service he is an ass and I can't believe he has a good job. This place is beautiful but come on- ure in the industry and u gotta talk to ppl and not lie about seating. Jamar is the man- a great server. The free samples of marg are tasty. Hands down the Margs are the best I've had for a while. The salsa is delish!!!!! The tacos and chips and salsa are great. This is coming from a huge Mexican food  fan ( born and raised in Cali) and good is delish!
