I had the Short-Rib Enchiladas and my wife had the Beef Tacos. The meat was seasoned very well and the meat was tender. Both of our plates came with beans and rice, which were both flavored nicely. The Drinks are very potent so beware. We are from New Mexico and we know flavor, so Cabo Wabo Cantina food passes our taste test. Servers are attentive and gracious. Will definitely return next time we are back in Vegas.
