Holy Crap - I'm not in the dark anymore!!!! 
Finally today, we made an effort to drive to the "very much out of our way" Komex.

Right away they give you chips,guacamole and salsa.

The Bulgogi fried rice was awesome and topped with the chunky hot sauce that is offered on each table was awesomer - (not an actual word, I know!!)

The BF had the fusion tacos with bulgogi - I thought it was yummy. He said it was alright but he was more excited by the house made chunky hot sauce on the table. 

My daughter had hmmm...take a guess????   = FRENCH FRIES!!!

Nothing special there other than the fact that they offer bulgogi fries.

I do not like the inside - it feels yucky and hot. 

The BF thought Komex was OK but I  would love to come back and try other stuff -  

Komex is tasty,different and affordable!!!!!
