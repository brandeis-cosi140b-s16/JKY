This is the best Mexican restaurant in Urbana, for sure. Sorry Maize, but you have no soul. The salsas are what makes this place special. The first is an orange-colored creamy chipotle salsa, the second is a green creamy salsa made with tomatillos and avocado, and the last one is a light, smokey flavored dark red salsa. Carne asada or the barbacoa are great on tacos or sopes. The al pastor is a little too greasy. If you go here please get anything but a burrito: burritos are NOT Mexican. You're missing out if you go for a burrito here. And get your tacos with cilantro and onion. None of that lettuce cheese tomato.
