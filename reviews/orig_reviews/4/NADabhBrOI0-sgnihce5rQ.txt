My husband and I spent 24 hours in Phoenix recently, and stumbled into this place after unsuccessfully finding a different restaurant we'd been circling the block looking for.  "Let's just find something quick like tacos!" we said, and swerved into the parking lot as soon as we saw the unassuming "Urban Taco" sign.  We were pleasantly surprised with the warm, modern decor (well decorated but not too pretentious), the interesting menu choices, and the delicious food.  We each got tacos (veggie, shrimp, carnitas, beef) and they were all good.  We had told the waitress we were in a hurry, and the food came out quickly. We tried a local Shake chocolate stout, which was delicious, and the bartender came over to chat with us about it.  We both agreed that if an Urban Taco opened in San Francisco, we'd eat here all the time!
