I've been coming here since it opened. The prices have increased but the food remains as good as ever. Especially if you opt for one of the New Mexico inspired dishes. They are generous with the chips and always have two salsas and a delightfully spicy bean dip. I've always enjoyed the Chili Colorado, White Sands chimi and the Rio Grande Enchiladas. Recently as I've gone to lighter entrees, I've ordered the Roswell Chicken Tacos. Although I've had less than stellar service in the past, lately it's been fine.
