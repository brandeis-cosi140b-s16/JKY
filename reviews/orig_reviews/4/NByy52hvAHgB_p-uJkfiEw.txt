Mi casa es su casa!  Literally!  This little house in phenix was converted into a taco shop. Talk about home cooking!
I really enjoyed my visit. food was good, and so was the service. I had tacos de carne asada and a Mexican coke. Yes there's a difference. (Coke review coming soon) plenty of parking in the back (yard). Make sure to stop by and pay them a visit. I like it so much I think I'm moving in.
Keys please!
