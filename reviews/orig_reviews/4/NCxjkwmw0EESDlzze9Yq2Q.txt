I went here for lunch today.  The place looks just like you would expect and was packed.  I was in a hurry so I ordered my torta to go.  It was like $10 for the torta and a can of soda and it was ready in about 5 minutes.

I have eaten a lot of very random and very no-so-good-for-you food in my day but this torta may take the lead.  As I started to chow down on my  Torta Del Rey 3 things went through my mind:

#1 - wtf am I eating
#2 - my wife is going to kill me for setting my diet back 2 years and clogging my arteries even more
#3 - how the fu*k am I supposed to eat this thing without getting it all over my shirt and pants.

I am a torta virgin and I think this might have been my first legit torta experience.  I have never in all my life seen a sandwich with so much sh*t piled on.  I took one bite like a normal sandwich then I gave up for fear of making a complete mess of myself.  I stuck to the fork and knife method which worked much better.

Anyway, the taste of the torta is just ok because there really isn't much flavor going on.  To be honest I was expecting an explosion of flavors from all the stuff on the torta but it was just eh.  The hot sauces (both red and green) were great and added to the flavor.  

I would go back but would probably not have the torta.  The rest of their menu looks pretty good and authentic but after tasting their flagship cuisine; I'm not expecting greatness.

I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the uniqueness (at least to me) and authenticity of the food.
