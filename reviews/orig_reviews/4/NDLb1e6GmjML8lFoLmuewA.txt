Burgers were great! The marshmallow milk shake was yummy. French toast fries were yummy. My mom got a side of gravy & said it was terrible. She said she wants to teach them how to make gravy (she's from Mississippi so she knows gravy). The  ketchup they had sitting on the table was sour & had gone bad. Very friendly service. I would 100% go back again.
