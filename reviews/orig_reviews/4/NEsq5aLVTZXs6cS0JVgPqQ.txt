This review is for the nightclub.

Diablo's is part of the Monte Carlo so if you stay at Monte Carlo you avoid the cover fees and skip the lines. Its a fun place to get the night started and get you in the mood to dance. We ended up at Diablo's both nights we were in Vegas the music is all over the place but mainly hip hop which I love so it was worth it to me. The drinks are expensive but its Vegas so oh well! I was disappointed because I never got to go to the rooftop it was always closed at night ...it would have been fun dancing away up there either way great place to start or end the night!
