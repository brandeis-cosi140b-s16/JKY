First time here! The host was very welcoming.

Our server, Bethany,  was very nice. She attended to all of our needs quick and accurately.

The atmosphere was perfect. It had Mexican music that made you wanna dance and outside patio seating! 

I ordered shrimp fajitas, borracho beans, and Spanish rice. My meal was very satisfying and flavorful. It will never measure up to my mother's cooking, and that's the reason for four stars but overall great service!
