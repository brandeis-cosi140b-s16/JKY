The patio is super cute and doesn't fee like you're in the middle of Scottsdale. Cavern's chicken salad is good and so are the prickley pear margaritas. Good place for lunch, just be aware it's New Mexico style Mexican food and they have a tendency to put American cheese where it doesn't belong. When in doubt no cheese.
