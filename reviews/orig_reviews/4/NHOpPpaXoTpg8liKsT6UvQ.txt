Stopped by here after walking the strip on a Sunday night and eating Secret Pizza.

Typical looking taqueria/taco stand. They have a to-go window.
 
My girlfriend and I ordered tacos of the following variety: grilled fish, al pastor, carnitas, and barbacoa. The quantity of meat was good and most of them were pretty good. The carnitas was probably my favorite between the meat tacos. You choose your taco dressings but they don't have a salsa bar (boo).

Overall, decent taste and price and definitely a good late-night, street food stop on the Strip.

Note: When we went, they did not freshly cut the al pastor off the spit (unlike Tacos El Gordo). They gave us pre-sliced al pastor.
