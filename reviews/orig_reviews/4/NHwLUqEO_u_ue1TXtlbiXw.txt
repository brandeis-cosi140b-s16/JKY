This place is nice if you're not wanting authentic Mexican food. I was kind of hoping for some sloppy refried bean and cheese type of deal covered with red sauce.... Something I now know I can't find here. Originally I was disappointed seeing that this place offered more upscale, dare I say it- Americanized Mexican food. I ended up being pleasantly surprised. 

The restaurant is very clean, and our server Jackie was very speedy and friendly. 

I ordered the spinach enchiladas and my boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas, both were not traditional Mexican food by any means, but were both were pretty good. Once again, not the type of food we were hoping for, but not bad at all.

Jackie recommended the red house sangria to me, and I'm so glad she did, it was DELICIOUS! Definitely the highlight of the meal. This girl knows her sangrias, I would recommend her as a waitress if you plan on stopping in!
