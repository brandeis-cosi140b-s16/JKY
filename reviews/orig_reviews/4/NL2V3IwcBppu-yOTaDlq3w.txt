When we walked into the small storefront, there was one couple seated at a small wrap around bar and six employees standing. We were quickly attended to, asked if we would like to sit in the back room and were led, through the abuela-populated kitchen, into a much bigger room that opened out to the back.

I had Yelped and asked around for good Mexican food in Madison. This spot made the top three list and it's clear why. Straight-up, no bull Mexican! Tacos, sopes, burritos, dinner plates. Great flavors, salsas and grandma's in the kitchen! After a trio of tacos, a pair of sopes and a Negra Modelo, I knew that even if the next two spots on the list sucked, there is one place in town where this fan would be muy contento.
