The service here was great! Our waiter was very attentive. and was able to get us in and out with apps in under an hour! The food was pretty basic american mexican, but still tasted good. Not much spice. I really enjoyed the crab tostados. The enchiladas were predictable, but I did order enchiladas so I guess that is what I was looking for.  The portion sizes were very generous. and The rice was delicious!
