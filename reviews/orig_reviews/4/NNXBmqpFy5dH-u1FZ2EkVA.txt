Great staff. Super friendly. 100% authentic Mexican food. Not fancy but sooo good! Don't be scared when you pull up and it's connected to a days inn! Their fajitas and mojitos are yummy and their table side guacamole is a must. Ask for Nery, he's a great server! Sit on the patio if the weather allows! This place is consistent and reasonable.
