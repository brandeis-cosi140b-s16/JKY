Went to Bakersfield for the first time last night.  It was awesome!!
We started with the guacamole which was very good
Then between my girlfriend and I we ordered six different tacos so that we didn't have any of the same thing
She only ate two of hers... More for me!!
So I ended up stuffing my face and eating four tacos: Mole, short rib, Pork belly and the steak taco
My only complaint about the taco was the steak taco had a lot of stuff on it and could barely be contained in the tortilla so it was a little difficult to eat but still delicious!

Otherwise all was good!!

The parking situation is difficult
We ended up having to park across the street in the jersey mikes lot
Is there a designated lot for Bakersfield?!
