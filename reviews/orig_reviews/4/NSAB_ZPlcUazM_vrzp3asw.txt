A Hawaiian Styled Chipotle?? How could I not try the place out?  I bought the $10 for $20 Groupon and took a friend to try it out.  Now with $20 for two people we could go for all the extras without feeling guilty.  The staff was super nice and genuinely seemed like their wanted their customers to have the best experience possible.  Another nice bonus was that there is free wifi (the pass code is posted on top of the door)

Now for the food:

I ordered the Kalua Pig Bowl with a bit of the charred pineapple verde salsa and the mango & roasted corn salsa. I loved thought the Kalua Pig was seasoned really well and it went well with both salsa.  They offer several toppings to spice up your dish that include sour cream, romaine lettuce, cheese, jalape√±os, cilantro (which I LOVE), cabbage, and guacamole with pink Hawaiian salt (for a little extra).  Yes, I got the guacamole and it was wonderful and I feel like I have to get it next time I go back as well.  

Also, since we had a little bit extra on our Groupon we also sprang for the Coconut Bark on recommendation from one of the workers.  Now don't get me wrong, I like something sweet every now and then, but this was way past my sweet limit.  I'll be skipping this in the future, but if you REALLY LIKE SWEET than this might be the perfect dessert for you.

I'm excited to go back in the future to try out their other meats and combinations.  I totally recommend this place and really you can't go wrong with Hawaiian Food or Chipotle like bowls/burritos!!


*FYI* there are no trash cans so don't wander around trying to find one like I did.  The servers bush everything and even packed my leftovers for me.
