Nope, not a dancing burrito but "The Burrito Fatory"  will leave you dancing out of the establishment. This place stands out on South Blvd where there is a surplus of Tex-Mex and California style food establishments. This is a usual quick lunch spot for me. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and they have a massive burrito which will rival any Moe's or Qudoba burrito. Unlike chain restaurants The Burrito Factory actually sells fish and tofu, plus different types of tortillas. The salsa bar here is 2nd to none in Charlotte, The downfall about The Burrito Factory is that their chips are harder than what I'm sure anyone is use to, though they may pile them up with whatever you order they should really work on that recipe. 
The Manager/Owner is very cool and hip to what's going on. Overall if your looking for a Big Ass Burrito at a great price and your on the South side of Charlotte you have to stop by The Burrito Factory.
