Some of the BEST carne asada tacos in town!!!! The only reason they do not get five stars is that if you decide you want to go on a weekday afterwork the meat tends to be a little dry.  But you can always put enough lime and salsa on it when it tastes this good and they are generous w/ sides.  Other than that the service is impeccable and if you can speak a little Spanish it goes a long way!  The guys behind the counter are contstantlysmiling, singing cleaning counters checking, stirring food.  Great vibe for people who aren't too uptight about there dining (.  HELLO YOU WANT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN YOU GOT IT!
