Went here for dinner on a Monday night.  It was PACKED!  I would think that weeknights would be slow for some restaurants, but that was not the case here.

When my friend suggested it, it took me 5 seconds to find it on my phone and when I drove up it seemed like a small, run-of-the mill restaurant that offers Mexican fare.  My experience started as soon as I found a place to park [parking lot was a little small for the strip mall this place is associated with].  Opening the door, I was engulfed with heavenly scents of whatever was cooking in the kitchen.  Now I take it the crowd and the aromas wafting from this place just from the parking lot was a great sign.

Out wait was quite long, but it was well worth it.  The hosts did not forget about us... but I totally could see that the larger groups were getting "priority" since they can bring in more $$ with them.  No harm done... everyone gets to eat and the restaurant makes a killing.

The chips were offered with 2 salsas... One mild and another with a good kick to the sinuses.  Of course both were really good and you can tell, they were made fresh.

I had the enchiladas supreme.... which were very good.  I have to admit I am a sucker for enchiladas, but my friend swears by their carnitas.  They looked very good.   My meal also came with rice, shredded lettuce, 2 slices of tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream.  Good stuff.

Overall a great place.  Can't wait to go back and try more of their offerings
