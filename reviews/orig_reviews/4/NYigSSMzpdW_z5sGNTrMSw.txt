There was a day a couple weeks ago that suddenly, I woke up and wanted to explore east Mesa and Apache Junction.  Why?  I have no idea.  But I am glad I found Rudy's.  Based on the yelp reviews I tried the carne asada burrito which was stuffed full of tender meat and rice, beans, and lettuce.  And also I am very susceptible to ads painted on windows, so I tried an order of the beef taquitos.  The taquitos were light and crispy on the outside and full of tender beef.  So tender I had to tell myself to "Chew your food, you savage."  

The young woman working at the front counter was friendly and happy to answer a couple of questions I had.  I look forward to hitting this joint again, either before or after some hiking at Lost Dutchman State Park.
