I went this passed weekend with some friends (12 of us) and didn't think about the fact it was Saturday night. So we got there at 8:00p and were told it was a 90 minute wait. 

Realizing every place would have a wait we decided to stick around. We were seated in 25 minutes (party of 12, on a Sat night) 

The service was good, and the food was really good. I would recommend the 'beer battered white fish' hands down the best thing there. I asked for their 3 'best dishes' and the beer battered white fish was awesome!

It was a little loud in there so it made it hard to talk with folks at the table and it was kind of dark, we needed to use our phones to read the menus... Small price to pay for great fish tacos.
