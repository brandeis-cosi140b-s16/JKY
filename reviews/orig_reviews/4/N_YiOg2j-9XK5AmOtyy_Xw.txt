I have been to Vida twice while working in Charlotte. It is a co-workers favorite restaurant. The service is fantastic!  The staff is friendly and fast. Also fantastic are the drinks!!!  They are tasty and strong; just the way I like it!  The food is good. I wouldn't say it is out of this world, but good. I always start with guacamole followed by a chicken burrito. Vida is in a great location and easily accessible from the uptown hotels. I also appreciate the fact that both times I didn't feel rushed. I sat with co-workers, both visits, for hours drinking and talking and never felt like the staff wanted to turn the table even though they were busy. Thanks, Vida!  I will be back.
