This place looks small on the outside, but it's bigger on the inside because they have funky things outside. They have long containers that are a yard long, they were made for drinking, but I prefer having horchata instead inside the containers. They have some burritos like carne asada & other one, but the one that caught my eye was the Grande burrito. Of course, I ordered it to try it out & found out it wasn't really Grande as I expected, it was more of a normal burrito, not Grande at all. I'm giving this place a four because while waiting for my food, the waiter that served me & my friend, he was making jokes which were defiantly funny, plus they have breakfast specials
