Dang! I should have tried this place sooner. It's a small spot kind of tucked away in a shopping complex but they a have a big bright sign and you can't miss it. It's pretty tiny inside but they have a good amount of seating and a nice little bar area up front.

The food was excellent! I've been seeing all the picture of those smothered burritos and had to have one. I went with the pork verde then added rice and beans. The pork itself was super tender, I loved the green sauce and their burritos are huge! My wife and son shared the chicken fajitas which they loved. They give you a lot of toppings for the fajita's and I believe the tortillas are homemade...awesome on both dishes. On the smothered burrito, the green sauce starts to soak in the tortilla making it really soft and chewy...sooooo good!

Biggest downer of this place for me...the chips. They have really good salsas and an excellent guacamole but the chips fell short in a big way. I don't know what the seasoning is on them but it lacks any salt and it's really plain. Add a little salt and they're better but still kinda disappointing. Otherwise I really liked Carlito's and will definitely be going back. Can't beat excellent food with cold beers for a cheap price!
