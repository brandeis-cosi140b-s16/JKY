Great Carne Asada.  Pretty rad that they have Hatch Green Chilis from New Mexico, and an entire portion of their menu dedicated to New Mexican food, as well as regular Mexican food.  Also, they brew their own beer, which makes any restaurant/bar more legit.  TVs with sports, booze, and good food.  Definitely cannot complain.
