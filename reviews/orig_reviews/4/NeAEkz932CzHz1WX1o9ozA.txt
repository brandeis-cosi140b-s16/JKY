The new digs look pretty nice and are somewhat of an improvement over the old spot.  When I say 'somewhat', what I'm alluding to is that there is often a certain charm that remains in the details of any original establishment. 

In this case, the little patio area with the fountain is no more.  But on the whole, it's a step up.

Chorizo, chorizo, chorizo.  Somebody in the talk forum started a thread about chorizo and another yelper mentioned The Original Burrito Co as having the goods.  I had to find out.

The verdict: it's good and I like it.  

Their chorizo is about what you expect when you close your eyes and conceptualize what chorizo is supposed to taste like.  It has a subtle spiciness but is not too vinegary or salty.  When folded into eggs dashed with papas everything works together in a complimentary cloud of Sonoran awesomeness rolled into a tortilla.  

I had '#14:The combination - chorizo con huevos y papas'.  No regrets.

Two salsas are available in the salsa bar, a red and green, along with sliced, pickled jalapenos.  I like the fact that they give you a small bag of chips with your order.

I'm definitely coming back to try their red and green chile as they boast both of these entrees to be made with a New Mexican flair.  That could be a critical turning point in my criteria but I'll remain the optimist and base my return on the delicious breakfast burro I got here.
