Mexican style food in Phoenix is both varied and plentiful, so any restaurant that can lure me in to being a regular is doing something right. 

La Condesa is a hip little taco shop on 16th street, close enough for me to walk to. The decor is a trendy/traditional mash up that works well. Honestly, the food is good enough that I'd probably buy it from a guy in an alley. 

I've sampled several different varieties of meat based products as well as the beans. Everything has been well prepared and fresh. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil in particular is drool-worthy. It's mildly sweet and super tender. Adding a little of the chipotle salsa really sets it off. 

Ah, the salsa. There are some truly interesting varieties, from tamarind to pecan. The pecan salsa was a great surprise, with a nice amount of heat. It really sits well with the carne asada. 

My only negative comment involves the parking situation. The parking lot is situated in such a way that in order to leave you have to back out onto 16th street. If a big ass SUV with tinted windows happens to park next to you (which always seems to happen) then pulling out can be...invigorating. 

La Condesa now has a well earned spot of honor in my restaurant rotation.
