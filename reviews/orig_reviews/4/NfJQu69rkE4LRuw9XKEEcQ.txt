I liked this place... reasons.
 The cashier had a dry sense of humor.
You can fill up on a couple of bucks.
The food seems fresh.
When you ask for hot sauce, they hand you a 2 oz cup a of a homemade habenaro sauce. it's hella hot!
for the beer drinkers, they seemed to have had a rather large collection to choose from.
The wood tables. i don't know. they give the place character.
good job yayo!
