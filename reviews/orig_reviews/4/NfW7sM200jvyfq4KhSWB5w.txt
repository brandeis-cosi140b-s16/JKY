Ive been to Carolinas many times in the past decade. I use to always stop by and pick up a dozen tortillas because they are hands down the best tortilla that ive had. Other than tortillas, i usually get their tamales. However the last time I was in AZ, i stopped by and decided to try something new. I gave the green chili burrito a chance and i was hooked. I had to go back again the next day for some more goodness. They are kind of small so i decided to try a red chili burrito too. The red was good, but the green was the best. I left full, happy, and satisfied. Cant wait till im back in AZ again for some good mexican food!
