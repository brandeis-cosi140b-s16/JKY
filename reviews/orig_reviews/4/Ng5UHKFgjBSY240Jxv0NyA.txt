Mad Mex is a solid three to four stars and I'm settling with four because the things that take an experience down a notch are largely out of their control. 

Happy Hours here are a great deal. Their tap selection usually showcases an exceptional range and variety and their mixed drinks stand up to comparison with much more cocktail-oriented bars. The staff here is friendly and accommodating even when they are completely slammed [which is when I encounter a more three star experience ]. 

Wait times -- which are largely out of their control -- can be excessive on weekends so if you're coming here on a Friday happy hour, get here early and prepare for a crowd. If crowds are your thing, then this is your place. 

Food is consistently well prepared and inventive [although the menu doesn't change often]. Their Sunday brunch which I just tried for the first time recently is a highlight. 

All in all, not a bad place to unwind after the week, meet friends for a Sunday Funday, or grab lunch during the work week.
