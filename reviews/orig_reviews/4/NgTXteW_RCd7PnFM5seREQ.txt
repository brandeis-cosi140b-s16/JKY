Great Mexican food! Ones of the best in town. First come first serve basis. No reservations but the wait is worth it! No matter how you like you're Mexican food they do it well! So good for dinner! Great friendly service and most are bi lingual! I haven't had any trouble with heavy accents or hard understandings!
