I found myself here for my friends wedding reception. There is plenty of parking, we didn't get to order what we wanted but the selection they had was a really good choice, chicken tamales- they were soft and tasty 4/5, beef enchiladas- good mole 4/5, beans and rice both good 4/5, that is all I ate. Oh and margaritas!!!!! 4/5 as well. I really feel the food was good but the reason for me to go back would be because of the staff they were really nice and attentive anything we needed they were right there.  They talked with us a little bit in between filling our glasses and taking away plates. I really appreciate when staff is friendly. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll swing by for a quick meal
