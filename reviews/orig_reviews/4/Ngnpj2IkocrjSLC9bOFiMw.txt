The newest member of the Upward Projects family!  They have a pretty good selection to chose from ranging from cute little tacos to big burritos. All of their food is fresh. If you order 3 tacos you get a side free, the tacos range about $3 to $4 so your looking at about $9 to $12 for a taco platter. I ordered two chickens tacos and a fish taco with a side of rice. All were really good. Like their brothers, Winsor & Federal Pizza, if you visit before 6pm for happy hour (everyday) you can get a pitcher of beer (a good selection including local) for $5. The service was really friendly, and the brownie that topped off my meal was delicious. The seating is comfortable with a great outside area complete with fire place for those very small winters.
