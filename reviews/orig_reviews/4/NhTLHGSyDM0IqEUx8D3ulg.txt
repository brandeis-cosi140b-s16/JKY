Viva Zapatas was an excellent experience and meal. We dined in for lunch on Wednesday and had a small 10 minute wait for a table. The restaurant was indeed busy but the service was fast and friendly. They have a four tiered lunch menu that offers inexpensive and smaller meals for less than $10 such as a taco salad, two tacos (beef or chicken), and two enchiladas plates that comes with rice and beans. Service was quick and we received our lunch meals in less than 10 minutes. The inside was very clean and with a outstanding and authentic cantina decor. Overall, this was an excellent experience with quick and friendly service. We will certainly be back.
