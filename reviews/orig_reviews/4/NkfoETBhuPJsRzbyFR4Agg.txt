Consider this place DISCOVERED (i.e., busy)!! I came here because of the reviews and I love tacos. When I arrived the line was 20 feet out the door (Monday at noon). I decided to wait it out because I was psyched for tacos de asada. 10 minutes later I hadn't moved. But, I was free today and the folks around me in line were fun. An hour and 10 minutes later, I got my food. All I can say is, it was worth the wait! The tacos de asada were delicious!! They grill the carne asada right there over charcoal. I've never seen kitchen staff working so fast and having so much fun. I love an open kitchen and it helped pass the time. First time I've ever seen someone throw the ingredients for a taco in the air and catch them.. For EACH TACO!  Just FYI (in case you don't speak Spanish), there are two lines... one if you are ordering tacos de asada and another line for everything else. The line for everything else seemed to move faster. If I can make time, I might go back and try the adobada.  Great find, I just wish it wasn't quite so "discovered".
