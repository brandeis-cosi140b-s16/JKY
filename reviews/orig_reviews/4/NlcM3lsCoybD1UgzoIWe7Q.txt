I was in Phoenix for a business trip trying to find a place to eat one night I decided to do some research.  Since I was in the SW I thought about Mexican. So I found in several articles and sites as well as Yelp that Rositas had the best Chile Verde. So I  got done with work early one night so I made my way to Rositas. It has an interesting parking lot, not really near anything, more of a neighborhood or lunch place. I order the mixed plate (half red, half green chile) rice, beans, chips and salsa, and a drink for $10!!!  The red chile and the rice was very good...the green chile the best I ever had!!! Very clean, very good service.  I enjoyed it so much a few nights ago I managed to squeeze it in before I caught my flight back home...this time, all green chile dinner!!!  Attention all Phoenix visitors, its conveniently close to the airport car rental facility!!
