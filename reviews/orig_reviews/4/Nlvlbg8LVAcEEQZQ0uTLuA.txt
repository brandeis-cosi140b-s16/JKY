But really a 3.5. 
Chicken tamales all day
I'm telling you... Chicken tamales
We tried the beef and pork but seemed overcooked
Beef chimichanga... Just okay
Meat again seemed chewey 

The tortilla maker on display was a nice touch
The corn tortilla on the carne asada taco was obviously fresh and worked well with the other ingredients. 

Margaritas...
Bomb
We tried mango on the rocks and a strawberry banana blended both were delicious 

Service was terrific. 
Francisco was very friendly and knowledgeable 
Will be back at the cantina for more tamales and margaritas
