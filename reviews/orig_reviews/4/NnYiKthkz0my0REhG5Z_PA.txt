This location lacks the character of the original location but it's a nice option for North Scottsdale dining! Although it's located in a strip mall on the freeway, once you step inside, it feels like a family-friendly restaurant with a little bit of Mexican flare. There's plenty of seating making this a good option if you want to have a big party. 

The food is decent and your generic restaurant Mexican food. Holy large portions though! I ordered the carne asada tacos and it came with a salad, then two very large flour tortillas, two large pieces (probably 3-4 inches long each) of carne asada beef and heaping beans and rice. All of it was very delicious but had I know the size of the portion, I would have definitely shared. You also get chips and two types of salsa with your meal. 

In summary, this is a pretty basic Mexican meal experience, but in a good way. I think it's nice that North Scottsdale has this option and I can only imagine that the bar area can get pretty crowded on the weekends.
