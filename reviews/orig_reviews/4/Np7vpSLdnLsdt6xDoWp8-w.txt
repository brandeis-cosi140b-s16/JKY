There is absolutely no resisting a bowl full of warm, crispy tortilla chips and fresh homemade salsa when you sit down at this spot.  No. Resisting.  Trust me, I've tried.  IMPOSSIBLE.  And the guac that they make at the table? Insanity.  I'm all about fresh ingredients, and it doesn't get much fresher than that.

The drinks are yum-tastic also (can't go wrong with a marg at a place like this).

Lunch selections are great, and the service has always been fantastic there!  Everything I've ever had on the menu has been of superb quality and very very very very very very verrrrrry tasty.

...that is, if I can actually fit any lunch or dinner into my stomach after eating all of the chips. FREE REFILLS, FTW!

The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of parking.  Be prepared to walk there if you get there during busy lunch or dinner hours.  And don't park at Starbucks, you WILL get towed.
