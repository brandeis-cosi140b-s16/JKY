Ummm... Some of the best Mex I've had East of the Miss.  The corn tortillas per the namesake, are over the top good.  My fish and ribeye tacos were bursting with their simple, "look at the quality" ingredients.  The guac was in a word sick-- a pile of goodness that I'll be thinking about the next time I get the munchies!   Friendly counter service And speedy cook times too.  Relo to a place with more elbow room and it's a 5 star one handed jam from the baseline!
