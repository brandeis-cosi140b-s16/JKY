We would have given it the full 5 stars if it weren't for the weak and flavorless margaritas we got.  This place has a "tequila bar" and as my husband and I are huge margarita experts (we think so, lol),  we ordered the Enchanted margaritas which stated that it had two shots of tequila in it and to be prepared.  Not even a hint of tequila flavor at all.  The food however, was really flavorful and satisfying.  We opted to order ala cart as we wanted to sample before committing to a large entree plate each.  We loved the chicken enchilada in green sauce, the blue corn tamale, and had both the black and pinto beans.  Yum!  And honestly plenty enough.  The chips and three different types of salsa were good too.  We will definitely be returning but will opt for a beer instead of a margarita for sure!
