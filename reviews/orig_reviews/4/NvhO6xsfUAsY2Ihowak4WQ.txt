I've been going to Carolinas for years! Perfect if your in the mood for a filling high calorie splurge! The guacamole tostada, not on the menu, is delicious. Don't forget to pick up 1/2 dozen handmade tortillas. Often you can see them being made right there. This location used to an Asian restaurant and the markings of the old decor are still visible. Not much to offer n the way of atmosphere, but I have always found it clean. You have to order chips, which are fresh, but I think a bit overpriced. Call in your order 10 to 20 minutes ahead to avoid the sometimes long wait. Go directly to the cash register on the north side of the building to pick up your order.
