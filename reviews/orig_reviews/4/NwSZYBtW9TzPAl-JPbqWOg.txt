In the Summerlin area, Bocca Park is a convenient and great location to shop and dine out. It is always nice to have a new restaurant locate here. This was our first time eating at a Wahoos. We were expecting it to be just your typical fast food type of restaurant but was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is a step up from that.  It has a nice bright lay out with lots of seating. The decor is Southern California beach theme. It has a bar in the middle with an open wall to outside seating. It has a real "vacation" type feel to the place.
You do order at the counter  but your food is brought out to you at your table. My wife and I had the Cajun Fish Tacos and our daughter had the Cajun Shrimp Taco. The menu only offers the corn tortellia which none of us really like. But if you ask for flour tortilla when you order they do have it. They say the wahoo fish is caught out of the ocean and delivered fresh to the store daily. Our serving size was plenty big enough and all three agreed the tacos were very good. Being able to feed a family of 3 for under $20 in this town is pretty good!
The only draw back is they have some excellent outdoor seating but it is considered part of the bar area and anyone under 21 is not allowed to sit out there. It is hard to find a place to take families these days that is a fun place that offers a good economical meal. This place is certainly a great place for families. Too bad they limit the best seating area to adults only.
