I was starving after a day of traveling and after traversing every gate in the airport, I settled on this place with my usual amount of heavy skepticism.  I mean really, airport food?  Ugh.  Well this time I made a good decision because I was actually impressed.

The service was friendly, although not the fastest because one of the people behind the scenes misplaced my food for a couple of minutes.  But the counter person realized this pretty quickly and went to find my shrimp tacos as soon as she saw that I was still hanging around.

Four shrimp tacos and a bottled water for $16 seems about right for airport food, and this food was good!  I even liked the seasoned fries, and I rarely like seasoned fries.

I'm going to keep this one on my list since I actually seem to hit the Phoenix airport a couple times a year.
