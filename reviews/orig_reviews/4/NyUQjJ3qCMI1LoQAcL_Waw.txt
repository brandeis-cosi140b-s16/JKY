Our server Roberto was excellent and Savanna the host was darling! Myself and 12 others dinned in at this location a couple weeks ago. There was an hour wait inside, however outside was immediate seating. Bearing the heat, my family and I decided to sit outside. Roberto was very attentive and the nachos chingones were out of this world! My wife ordered the barrio pollo and raved about the combination of flavors! Savanna was consistently refilling our waters (when it's 115 degrees out, plenty of refills are needed)  and taking our dirty plates away. It seemed as if Roberto was busy with other tables however Savanna was there to help when needed. Overall experience was great! We will be back again!
