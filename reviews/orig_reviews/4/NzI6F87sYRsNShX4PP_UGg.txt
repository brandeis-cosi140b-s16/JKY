After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was nervous about going. We made sure to make a reservation online and to be prepared in case we had to wait. However, it only took a couple of minutes until we were seated and our server was really nice. 

We got the chips with the two other types of salsas and they were excellent. Then, I got the Carne Asada and my boyfriend got the chicken enchilada. They were both awesome! This is not at the same level as Mad Mex, I'm not sure how you could compare the two, this is much better. It didn't seem totally Mexican but it wasn't Tex Mex, either. It didn't really matter to me after eating two bites of the mashed plaintains and steak. All quandaries were put on hold while I enjoyed the food! 

I used to live down the street so I was really happy to see a new restaurant (especially Mexican) move into the neighborhood. I know some people are upset about gentrification but I think that the restaurant is a great addition to the area. After living down the street for a year, I began to hope that something within a couple of blocks would move in...you can only eat at The Quiet Storm so many times. 

We were both happy with the food and our server and I'm really happy that a new restaurant has moved into the area!

We will definitely go back at some point-- it was more expensive than we would usually spend on dinner so it won't be an every weekend kind of restaurant but we will definitely return. If you're looking for a fun new restaurant, definitely check this place out. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Verde!

Sincerely,

Two Happy Pittsburghers
