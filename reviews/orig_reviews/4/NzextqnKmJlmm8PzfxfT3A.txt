This place is down to earth. Staff real friendly. I recommend the extra 10 minute wait to sit outside. My boys watched a large water bird of some sort swoop down and catch a fish in its mouth right in front of our table. It was pretty awesome. The fajitas are the best I have tasted locally in a long while and the portion size enough for two adults.
