If Chipotle is in your normal rotation, do yourself a favor and try Braddah's. 

Same idea as Chipotle: pick your taco/burrito/bowl, pick your meat, pick your toppings. But the meats here are kalua pig, huli huli chicken, and pulehu steak (or grilled fish) -- in each case that's a hawaiian marinated meat, and you get more tropical fruit salsas than your usual pico de gallo and hot chili salsa.

Really, really good food both here and at the UNLV location. 

And the people at both spots have been incredibly friendly. Highly recommend.
