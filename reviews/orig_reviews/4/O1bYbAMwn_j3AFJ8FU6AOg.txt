I'm pretty sad I don't live as close to here as I used to. I'm sure my waistline is happy, though! 
America's has delicious bean burritos! The beans are creamy, cheese perfect and wrapped up in a very fresh tortilla. I hear the Carne is really good (But I obviously haven't tried it). Salsa is okay. I like a little more spice, but I guess at the temp it is I am able to load more on a chip without breaking out into a giant sweat. 
We usually did takeout, but the inside is cute. It's incredibly tiny as well, so I recommend the patio if you eat here unless you like people waiting for to-go orders standing like sardines pressed against you while you are trying to eat. 
The menu is small and limited. They serve beer. The prices are good. 
Give it a try! It's not the kind of place you go on a date to or plan an evening for, but for lunch or a quick dinner on a busy day it's perfect!
