I really enjoyed my dinner at Barrio Queen. The guacamole, as everyone says, is to-die-for. And the chips it's served with are excellent as well. I had a hard time deciding what to get after that because everything looked good, but I went with a chicken quesadilla, which was good but I wasn't terribly fond of the chicken. My husband had their famous pork dish where you make your own pork tacos. He wasn't a fan of the chipotle mashed potatoes that came with it but I really liked them. I would sum up both the food and the decor this way: it's called "Barrio" for a reason - it has a local, authentic neighborhood feel. Everything is colorful and unique.
I knocked off a star for the service. We came around 4:30pm, well before the dinner rush. It turns out that their service majorly lacks at this time of day - after we were seated it was several minutes before our drink order was asked, and we had to flag our waitress down to order after that. Also, we ordered the large size of guacamole, which on the menu is said to be "made table-side". Ours came pre-mixed with toppings already on it, so I just assumed that table-side service was not actually something that they did.  Well, turns out that once the restaurant became more full, they were mixing table-side guacamoles all over the place. I felt a little cheated out of the experience. This disappointed me but I would definitely come back here and try again.
