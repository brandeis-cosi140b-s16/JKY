Well my first time on the new chino on the east side! First impressions was its cleaner, bigger, and a lot less people so ordering was simple.  Hds my favorite, jade chicken in a quesadilla . The. Red jerk chicken plain with jerked fried rice. Awesome as usual, but seemed a little too greasy for me...I've been to the original Chino several times and never that greasy so I'm taking it that it was just the cook. I still gave it 4 stars..I have the original as 5!..but I'll come back here again to see if the greasiness went down. Overall a good east side restaurant. Too bad there isn't one by the Arrowhead area...but then again I'm spoiled! The original location on 19th will always hold my best reviews!
