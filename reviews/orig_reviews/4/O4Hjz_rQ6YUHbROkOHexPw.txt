One of my favorite places to eat on Mill. My friends and I go here all the time.

I mean, it's not gourmet or anything, so don't expect more than you're paying for, but for being as cheap as it is, it's great. Fun, lively atmosphere, and the workers are very friendly. I usually get the chicken tacos or the vegetarian salad (you can get salsa as a dressing, which I like!). Chips and salsa/cheese are also good. I don't get the garlic sauce or cheese (or feta) on anything because I don't like it, but that's just me.

Again, don't expect anything fancy, but it's a nice place.
