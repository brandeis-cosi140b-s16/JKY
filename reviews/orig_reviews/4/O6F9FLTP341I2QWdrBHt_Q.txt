We have been going here for years and love the food..  They have the best spooning chili rellenos anywhere!!

There are a few things that management needs to know...

The chips always taste stale, especially the blonde ones..  its really bad!  The salsa is pretty good but the chips yulk!!!

The service we have grown accustom to, usually slow and inconsistent, but the other night took the cake.

Our Server Allison was a complete hot mess!  Besides outward signs of unhappy irritable, angry, she was violent to members of our party and looked just as scary with two miss-placed pony tails on her head.  One of which was protruding from the center of her forehead and had only a few unhappy, angry hairs sticking out.  She was so lame that she yelled at us, caused a scene and treated us like crap for the first hour we were there..  i was the last person in our party to get there and sat there for 25 minutes waiting for a drink order to be taken...  not for the drink, for Allison to actually acknowledge me as a guest and to ask if i needed a drink..  geez!  Finally I took matters in my own hands when she decided it was convenient for her to take our order.  I told her she better show us some love because we come there often and do not plan to stay away, we also like to spend money and tip well if given the chance.  We did too.. our check was over $200 that night and she got a $50 spot even thought she really did not earn it.  

Allison, please get your sh*t together..  we will be coming back soon!
