I am giving Border Grill 4 stars because I paid $25 for a $75 dollar meal thanks to Restaurant.com. Border Grill is waaaaaaay overpriced, but when you take 50 bucks off the bill it starts looking like a deal. So lets focus on the flavor shall we? I had a delicious Mango Margarita to start. I ordered the Kobe Beef Tacos and hubby ordered the short ribs. I have to tell you I LOVED eating off of Hubby's plate. I ordered tacos because HELLO we are at a Mexican place, but the short ribs were DIVINE! I can't wait to return and order a plate for myself. The tacos were very good, but nothing in comparison. We ended up sharing both and enjoying the company around us. The staff was very attentive and always offering more alcohol or appetizers to the point of almost annoying, but still better than the alternative.
