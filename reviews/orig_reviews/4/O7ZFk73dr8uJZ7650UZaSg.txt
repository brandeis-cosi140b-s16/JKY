This place looks awful
Food is greasy and makes me feel heavy.

So why the decent rating? the food you do get tastes awesome.
Price did go up this year, and the portion is variable.

Star taken off since some days I order and my bowl is full and sometimes it's 3/5ths full.  I often get pick-up so all the food gets mushed up together and it's very clear when portions are not the same.

I love the food and will be returning.
