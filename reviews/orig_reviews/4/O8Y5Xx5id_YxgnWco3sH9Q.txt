Excellent food over time is not as easy as it seems. Nando's always delivers tasty food along with great service. Highly recommend a visit if your in the mood for Mexican. 

Keep in mind when you order a combo, that you can customize any choice - for me a cheese enchilada and a taco becomes a chicken enchilada and a shredded beef taco.
