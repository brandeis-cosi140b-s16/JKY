Nice place, check, good mojitos, check, check, good service, triple check.  Aaaand they play live music after 11pm and have room to dance on Fridays.  Lechon Asado, mmm, yummy.  Fried yucca (manioc/casava) with mojo, even yummier.  Paella, very good.  Great time, great looking restaurant.  I'm a happy camper.
