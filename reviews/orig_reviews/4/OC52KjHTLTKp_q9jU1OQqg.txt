I really like the nighttime madness that goes down on a Friday or Saturday night. Yet I'm always happy to roll out on a Sunday for some great arizona style Mexican food. Its nice to be able to enjoy the sun on the patio while scarfing down some tasty tacos. Sometimes the wait time is a little long due to the understaffing
