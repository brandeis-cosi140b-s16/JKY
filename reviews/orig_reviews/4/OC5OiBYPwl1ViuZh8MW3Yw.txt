Mmm, I think I could eat here everyday!  So far, tried the torta, sliders and kimchi fried rice. All yummy! 
Found a bone sliver in my bulgogi once, but won't that that ruin it for me. 
Go early or prepare to wait!
Staff is more busy than friendly, but once you sit down and order, your food comes out pretty quick - and did I mention yummy?
I'd give this place one more star if the place could accommodate all the people who eat here and they had enough help who didn't seem uptight all the time. 
It's stressful wondering if you'll have to wait (& how long) for a seat every time you come here.
