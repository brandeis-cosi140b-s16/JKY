In early September, we ate at this location twice for breakfast.  I always love a good deal and they had good deals for breakfast. They had an awesome breakfast special.  For $3.99, you got 2 eggs; potatoes; your choice of ham, sausage or bacon; and either flour or corn tortillas.  It was an awesome, filling breakfast.  They had bloody mary's for only $.99.  It wasn't the best I ever had, but it was spicy which I like.  The service was excellent.  We had the same server both times and she was really personable and took good care of us.  It was also nice that she remembered us.  I would highly recommend trying them out.  I will definitely be back!
