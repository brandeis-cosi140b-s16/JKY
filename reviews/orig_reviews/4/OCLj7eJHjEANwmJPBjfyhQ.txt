I'd say the food was 3 stars, but the service bumps it up to 4 stars.  We had lunch at El Torito on a Thursday after reading about it (and passing it on Boulder Highway) for a few years.  I finally bought the Groupon (which is available frequently), and was glad I did.

I found the joint to be very clean.  We were seated immediately and drink orders were immediately taken.  Additionally, the chips (warm) and the salsa (thin, but flavorful and had a little heat) were brought out very quickly.  To eat, my wife had the cheese enchiladas.  I don't know how to describe these other than simple but REALLY good.  Cheesy, great sauce.  They were simple but good, I don't know how else to say it.  I'd definitely order these again.

I had the chicken chimichanga.  I was not as pleased with my dish, thus the 3 stars for the food.  It was dry in the interior of the chimichanga.  I did love the rice and beans, perhaps the best Mexican/Spanish rice I've had a Mexican restaurant like this.

My son had the cheese quesadilla (which they call a cheese crisp) and French fries.  He liked both, but didn't finish either, which is par for the course since he's 3.  They were very understanding of us having a small child, they brought him an extra set of silverware and watered down his apple juice, as we requested.  

I'll definitely return, it's an old school place with simple, but good food.  I will say I like won't get the chicken chimichanga again, I think I'll definitely get some enchiladas next time.
