I've been here 3.5 years and this is the best Mexican food I've found in Vegas.  I'm still looking for the PERFECT place, but this is pretty damn good.  A friend of mine, who is Mexican, said this is his favorite place and his wife won't eat anywhere else, so we met another friend there for lunch.  Our friend enjoyed his taquitos a great deal.  I loved the salsa!!  Very tasty and spicy enough.  The chips are homemade and a little thick for me, but they were great.  My cheese enchiladas were over the moon!  I think they would be better if they had some onions in them, but that could be just me.  A SOLID 4-star experience. Great staff, tasty chow.  Just go!
