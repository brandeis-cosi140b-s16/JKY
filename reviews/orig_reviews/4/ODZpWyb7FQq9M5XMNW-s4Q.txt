I'm out in the field alot for my job....so you can guess that if I am anywhere near a Someburros I will stop for the Vegi burrito.  Fresh avocado, pinto beans, onions (which I really can't eat, but will), fresh pico....wrapped in a fresh tortilla with salsa is oh so yummy!  So anytime I think, oh goodness, I've got to drive to Tempe or Gilbert, I think, hey I can stop at Someburros for my Vegi burro...it suddenly brings a smile to my face :-)
