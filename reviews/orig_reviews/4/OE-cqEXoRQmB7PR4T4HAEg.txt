My husband and I have been to Carlsbad many times, and I'm always happy.  The spice level is still really inconsistent though.  If I ever order green chile stew again, I will ask for a sample first.  The last time it was so hot, I could not eat it.  Do you realize how hot something has to be for me to waste it?  

But we did recently go for Sunday brunch for the first time, and it was good!  I had eggs benedict with jalape√±o hollandaise.  The eggs were properly poached and the hollandaise was spicy, but not too much so.  As a side note, whoever was in charge of those potatoes had an accident with the salt shaker.  Waaayyy too salty.

Oh, and most importantly, they have bloody mary's for $3.25.  Yes, $3.25.  Mimosas, too.  I know the current trend is bottomless, but I usually only order one or two anyway, or my whole day is shot because I'm stuck on the sofa in a drunken, overstuffed stupor.  Beautiful patio weather right now, too!
