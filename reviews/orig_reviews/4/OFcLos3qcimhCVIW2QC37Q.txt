I was expecting to walk into a little fast food dive.  To my surprise, this place is an actual full service restaurant.  It's still kind of a dive, but I was pretty shocked to have a hostess seat me, a waitress serve me, and a bar with a random waterfall-like display for food at the prices that I saw online.  A pleasant treat almost as good as the food.

My only disappointment about my meal is I ordered the the tiny torta.  I had the ranchera del pollo; chicken, guacamole, chipotle mayo and cheese.  Very good, and perfect for its price at $7.25, but when I saw waitresses carrying the ridiculously stacked tortas, I have to admit I was hoping mine would be at least close to those.  But I should have known from the short description and cheap price that I was going to get the tinny-tiny sandwich.  My brother ordered a Del Rey.  This awesome monstrosity of a sandwich is stacked with just about every breakfast item you can imagine.  He usually eats healthy, but he enjoyed every bite he was able to take of it (although this was was one of the big ones and he could only manage half).

One thing kind of bugs me for some odd reason.  Potato chips as a side seems kind of random.  I know that tortas are sandwiches, but why isn't a mexican place serving tortilla chips?  Just wondering.
