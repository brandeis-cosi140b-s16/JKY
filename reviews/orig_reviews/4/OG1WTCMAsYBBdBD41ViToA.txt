Went on a random trip to downtown Phoenix and decided to eat lunch at this place.  Be careful of the chips & salsa appetizer- they're bound to get you hooked before the actual meal comes out! I got the salmon flautas which had a fruit salsa topping.  It was greasy and not too flavorful, but the salsa balanced out the greasiness.  My friend had the bbq burger and the black fish tacos, and they enjoyed their dishes as well.  It's not outstanding, but a nice place to eat at with a nice view.  They also gave a peppermint white chocolate tamale dessert for free at the end of my meal! Only thing I didn't like were the birds outside sitting on the tables and pecking at crumbs on the floor!
