Upon walking into the Spotted Donkey one is welcomed by the warm,  upscale decor. The hostess asked it we would prefer the dining room or lounge, and since we didn't have a preference we were seated in the lounge. The chairs were large and pillowy; perfect for a cozy feast of Mexican fare. 

Chips and salsa did not grace the meal, but they were on the appetizer menu for around $6, as was guac for $9.50. I think the waiter would have been more attentive had we ordered drinks; the service was provided on circumstance (I say this because there were older couples and a table of women in their 20s who were showered with attention--I felt neglected before our food even came out).

The food:  OUTSTANDING. I had the chicken fajitas--the sauce (oh my!) was uniquely delicious and addicting; I found myself scraping the cast iron skillet with every scrap of tortilla I had left. Fajitas were accompanied by fresh guacamole, salsa, sour cream and warm flour tortillas. My friend had the steak tacos. They were the perfect size, had just the right amount of cabbage for crunch and the beef had a nice smoky taste. The salsa and guac really pushed the flavors to perfection. 

All around a pleasant dining experience. I'm coming back for their late night happy hour menu!
