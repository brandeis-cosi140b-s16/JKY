I was here this past saturday for a rugby tournament after social.   Surprisingly, I had a lot of fun!  I am not sure if it was due to the good company I had around me... or the many drinks. 

The atmosphere was probably the best part.  There is a 'Mexican' theme  and they have some entertaining signs all over :)  I loved that they had 3 different bars.  I kept going to the one inside because it had the best service!   Most of the bar is outside.  I love having fresh air and not being cramped inside a stinky bar.  

I was really only drinking beer all night and I think it was like $3 or $4 domestics.  To me that is reasonable for a bar.   I noticed some good drink special signs for nights other than Friday and Saturday.  

I would def come back here again!
