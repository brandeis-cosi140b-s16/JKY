New Taco shops seem to be opening at a fast clip and America's stands out as one of the best. We absolutely love the quesadilla and the  tacos. The corn is also a must have. 

If you go with two people, don't miss their meal for two deal that includes two drinks. 

We can't wait until their 7th Ave store opens in January. Hopefully the quality will stay the same.
