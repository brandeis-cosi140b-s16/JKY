My favorite thing at Americas Taco Shop is the vampiro. It's like a meaty tostada and is muy bueno! The tortas here are also great; the bread is super soft and the carne asada is amazing. When I heard people talking about the corn on the cob I decided I had to try it. I was a little scared to try it since it had mayo all over it. I had nothing to be scared of- it was grilled deliciously with mayo, cojita cheese, chili and other spices. I do agree with other reviewers that the prices are a little high (really $2 for a can of coke?) but the food and the charm of America's Taco Shop will bring me back for lunch.
