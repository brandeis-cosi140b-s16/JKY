If you are looking for good authentic Mexican food, this is the spot. My family has been coming here for years. It's one of those places my long time separated parents can even agree on! 

For starters, the chips and salsa are really very good. This time the bean salsa was a little runny but it is usually really thick and spicy! (TWSS) The other salsa is good too. But the bean dip takes the cake. 

This last time I had the menudo. You can tell it is fresh and not made from a can like some places. YUM! and they bring you this lazy susan full of menudo fixins! The large is really very extremely large. I suggest that unless you are a glutton for punishment or a growing boy, order the small. It's just enough. My favourite dish here is the Vallarta fish tacos... So fresh and delish! I usually order a fish taco a la carte no matter what I am eating. It's my favourite thing here. The fish is really light and flaky and fresh. The salads here are really yummy too! My mommy and I sometimes split the chicken and avocado salad and some tacos. Oh and the arroz con pollo and Alfredo's combo (carne and shrimp in this jalepeno sauce), my brother always orders one or the other and I always steal a nibble or two... just fantastic! My pops love the chorizo and eggs from here. It's never greasy or fatty. Really high quality chorizo. 

I don't know what it is about Mexican restaurants. They want to clear your plate before you finish you food! LOL Seems like it happens to us a lot here. We always have to say "oh, I'm not done with that" lol. 

On the positive, I am pretty sure they refill your horchata for free. At least I have never noticed a charge for it.
