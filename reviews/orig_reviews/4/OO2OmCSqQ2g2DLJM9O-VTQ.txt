The locals of the area took us here to The Mission, right in the cute downtown area of Scottsdale. It's very trendy Mexican food - lights are dim, music is playing loudly, and everyone is super dressed up and ready to have a good time. We ordered
- Pork Belly: decent. The coolest thing about this dish though, is the fact that the tortilla was served on this giant brick of clear salt - super cool.
- Salsa: SPICY and tasty
- Guacamole: THE BEST GUAC I HAVE EVER HAD! It was made right next to the table after you order it. It has pumpkin seeds, and I don't know what kind of crack, but i could not stop eating it.

And for entree, I had
- Hangar Steak with house margarita, which were just okay. Apparently the steak taco is supposed to be very good, maybe i should have ordered that instead.

This place is seriously super trendy filled with dressed up people. Nice for a great evening out.
