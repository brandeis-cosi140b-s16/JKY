I'm typically don't crave Mexican food, but when I do there are many options in the Phoenix area. I read some other Yelp reviews and this place was very close to home so I grabbed my friend, Donatella and checked it out. I had a hard asada taco and a fish taco. The asada was okay, but the fish taco was delicious. I will come back for a Taco Tuesday meal! I shared an asada quesadilla which was okay- the salsas that they offered were fantastic; the green had a nice kick and the hotter, smokey salsa made the asada items even better. Donatella had shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas. According to Donatella, we are coming back so it must be good.
