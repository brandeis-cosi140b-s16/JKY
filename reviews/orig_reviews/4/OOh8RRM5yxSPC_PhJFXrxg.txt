The first time we ate here i was super excited after seeing this restaurant on Man Vs. Food.  It was very easy to find although there is limited parking.  We were seated right away.  I ordered the Nortena Torta which was filled with Japapenos! Yum.  It was everything i was expecting.  You have your choice of a salad or chips.  My husband ordered the Del Rey which was enormous!  He really liked it as well.  I had a Coca Cola from Mexico out of a bottle which reminded me of eating in Mexico City with my family, although there are no refills.  The waitresses  are very attentive.  

The second time we came in we had a great experience as well, but did not really like their Arnold Palmer because it seems that the iced tea is not brewed but a powder drink.  So we sent it back and ordered water instead which they made no big deal out of.  They offer so many different plates and choices. I can't wait to try something new every time i come in.  I can't wait to bring my family here when they come visit.
