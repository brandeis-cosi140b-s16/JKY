Oh, good lord, what to say about this place? This was my second time here; first visit was a few years ago but I couldn't remember much about it other than what a kooky fusion of ethnic food they have.

I noticed more on my second visit... the slightly, shall we say, humble digs just make it all the more quirky, but really don't take away from the food, which is the most important thing IMO. The place was packed at 1:00 on a Saturday. I got the veggie tostada with rice and split a black-bean tostada with my sister (I guess they only have black bean tostadas on the weekends) and it was a guilty little pleasure. There were lots of crying kids, the floor was dirty and the place was packed, so you can see what the real draw is for this place. 

I wish we had a place like it back home in Minneapolis. There is Chino Latino in Uptown Minneapolis, but it definitely lacks the uber-quirky, low-rent charm of this place, and really needs a Mexican panda statue in the entrance. :)
