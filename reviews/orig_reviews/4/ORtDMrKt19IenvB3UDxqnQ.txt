Pretty damn cool place, foods a little like a chevy's, but way better in quality and atmostphere.  

Prompted me to go to the kick off party when they opened in Scottsdale a few years ago, because I enjoyed my first visit in the LV one so much.

I am a huge fan of all the salsas, and the fish taco's.  I could totally eat this for several meals on a trip to vegas - my next trip, this will so be my pre-rehab lunch!
