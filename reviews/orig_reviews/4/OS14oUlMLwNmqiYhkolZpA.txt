I was very surprised to walk in at lunch time to see that it was not very busy at all. Usually, that's a bad sign, so I was a little worried, but I decided to try it out anyway. 
Got the standard chips, salsa and bean dip right away, which was nice, because we (family of 5) were all starving.
Service was fast and friendly.
Food was great. I liked everyone else's dishes better than mine, though. I had tacos- one with shredded pork and one with chicken. The shells seemed just a tiny bit stale, but the filling was good. Because everyone else's dishes tasted great, I'm thinking my "slightly" stale tasting tortillas were just a fluke and I will try the tacos again anyway.
There was a salsa bar with a nice variety of salsa and guacamole. Nice to see the guacamole didn't have an extra charge like most restaurants. While the salsa bar was clean and sanitary, I think it needs an upgrade. The bowls were set up on ice on a table and just looked sort of plain. I think they should upgrade to an actual small refrigerated salad bar and it would look much more appealing. Still, it didn't stop me from going back to it twice for salsa refills.
Overall, I would recommend it. We had a nice dining experience.
