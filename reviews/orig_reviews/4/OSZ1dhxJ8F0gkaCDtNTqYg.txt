My go to taco place in Charlotte! Came here on a beautiful Saturday around 1 and service was quick. The 4 of us were in and out within 30 min. 

Make sure you check in to get the free chips which come out warm and get a side of guac, fresh and very tasty. Beware if you have extra guac and take it home it will go brown the next day bc it's so fresh!

Definitely get the tacos authenticos with steak and fish. The steak is well seasoned and cooked so its not too chewy and not too tough. The fish has a nice crispy layer on the outside and great flavor as well. 

The salsa bar covers a range of spice tolerences, even satisfying my mom who's spice tolerence is off the charts!
