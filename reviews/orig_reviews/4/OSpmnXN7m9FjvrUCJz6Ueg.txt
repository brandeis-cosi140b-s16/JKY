You eat the Tamales here.  You order 1 per person and you order another if you aren't full (you may be after 1).  They cost about $4 each.  They make three different kinds, the sauces vary from one type of tamale to another, I prefer the one with the dark brown mole sauce (I forget if that was the chicken or the cheese tamale) . . . I don't know a thing about anything else on the menu.  I only eat tamales here.
