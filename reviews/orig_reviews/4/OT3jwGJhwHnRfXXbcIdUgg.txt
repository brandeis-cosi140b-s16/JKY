I saw a bad review which really surprises me. I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular. I don't know any bartenders' names or anything. But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here. The crowd always seems chill. The patio is nice. I like the red lighting. Good for street watching too. Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy! Tequilas-great selection. I believe Herradura is one of my faves. I say, can't go wrong with this spot. If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!
