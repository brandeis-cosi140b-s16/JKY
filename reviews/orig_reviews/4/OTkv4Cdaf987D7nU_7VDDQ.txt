We went here last week while in Vegas and you cant miss this place.. the outside has the owners face on the front sign.  

We sat down and the waiter took our drink orders and some how he wasnt all there because he was bouncing around like a fish out of water. Guess he was just there for drinks.  He gave my iced tea to my friend, and went to get me another one.. yeah.. I know.  

Waitress came over to order our food and used some little electronic device (pretty cool).  I dont know.. for some reason I got the impression she was a little.. pissy?  She seemed impatient.  Maybe that's just me.

We get the food and guess what.. it was actually pretty good.  I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans.  Pretty simple, but i like simple things. My girlfriend ordered a lemon drop martini with her cheese crisp and hated it I guess.  Cheese crisp was good though.

We had the honor of having some Mariachi guys play for us.  They were awesome!  For that along, Im bumping my original 3 stars to 4 stars.
