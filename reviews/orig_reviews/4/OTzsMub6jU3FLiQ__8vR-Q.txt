This is a place where we end up coming when we cannot think of anywhere else... Carlos was our server this time and he took good care of us. Hubby recently found the jalape√±o fajitas and they are tasty and spicy, I had the carnitas fajitas, which are a really good meat meal, but very far from what I consider 'carnitas'.
