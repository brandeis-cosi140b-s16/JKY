This place is one of the things I miss most about living in North Carolina.
I will start out by saying that I am not a big fan of seafood, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. Their Bbq Mahi Tacos are my favorite item on the menu. I've ordered that dish quite a few times and it's never anything less than fantastic. The texture and flavor of the mahi is just perfect and they are very generous with the portion. The dish comes with two tacos, but so much falls out of each taco you almost need a third tortilla to make an extra taco with.
I must also suggest the wasabi tuna burritos. There is just something about that wasabi sauce... and the large chunks of tuna, just....delish.
The only things that I'd like to see added to the menu are corn tortillas. Flour tortillas are good, and theirs aren't bad, but when it comes to fish tacos I tend to prefer corn.
The music volume also tends to be a little on the loud side. When you're already hard of hearing it makes conversation with the other people in your group a bit of a challenge. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing. It's truly a unique restaurant in a trendy setting in Charlotte's art district. When I head back to Charlotte this summer for a visit, this place is on my to-do list.
