Been here twice now and has been a good experience both times. First I tried the carne asada torta with bacon added and a side of fries, yesterday tried the carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and chips. Their carne is delicious, perfectly seasoned and good quality. The guacamole was great. Their chips are really thick and crunchy with salt but are also great. I would skip the fries and go for the chips, though.  
Also got coffee both times and it comes in a little single serve French press you press yourself so you can let it brew as long as you want, which is awesome. I wish there were refills!
Decent prices with good service and a nice atmosphere. Recommended.
