Lots of good authentic Mexican here. Good for gluten-free people because the chips are made of corn and there are good options that don't involve flour tortillas.   Our server was knowledgeable and responsive.  Our group had great meals and the margaritas were great. If you're in the mood for Mexican, this is a place to check out.
