Never in my many visits to Fiesta Burrito...and there have been a lot of them...have I been disappointed.  

Never has the food tasted like it was made a week ago.

Never have I had to spit anything out, hoping it had, at least, originated from the cow.

Never have I had cause, or been afraid to check the restaurant inspections naughty list.

I am a fan.
