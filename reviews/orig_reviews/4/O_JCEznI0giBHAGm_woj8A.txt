As a native of Los Angeles, I grew up eating lots of Mexican food. Three Amigos, hands down, is the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte (and I have tried most all of them in the past 23+ years here). The atmosphere is rustic and comfortable. The servers are attentive. At the Central Ave. location ask for Margarita (the server they named the drink after). The cervezas are C-O-L-D COLD. My favorite selection is the Enchiladas Poblanas. It is smothered in what has to be the BEST mol√© sauce I have ever tasted. I eat there most every week. It's THAT good.
