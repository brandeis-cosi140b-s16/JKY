What do I love about Cien Agaves?  What don't I love about Cien Agaves?!  Consistently, some of the best margaritas I've ever had.  The option for corn tortillas, instead of flour, on my tacos.  The perfect black beans...seriously, how do they get them to taste so good?   Service is usually good, I'd say 90% of the time it's great.  

What can I really complain about?  Well, the floor is a little difficult to navigate in heels; it always seems slippery for some reason. (I'm actually surprised I haven't fallen down  yet.)  And the bathrooms.....they have black fixtures.  I know it's weird, but black bathroom fixtures give me the heebies.  Neither one is enough to keep me from returning on a regular basis.  

I've been hesitant to write this review, only because I don't want to see you all there taking up my space and making me wait for a table.  I'm an impatient girl when it comes to my tequila.  ;)
