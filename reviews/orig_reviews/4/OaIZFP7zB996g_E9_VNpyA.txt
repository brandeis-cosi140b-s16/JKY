So this is the thing, my hubby is a vegetarian. We recently found out that Carolina's puts lard in EVERYTHING. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Every single item on their menu contains lard....bummer! Especially because they've been selling us "vegetarian bean burritos" for the last year. I guess they don't consider lard to be an animal product?

So for all of you vegetarians out there who eat tortillas or otherwise vegetarian items, beware!

Looks like I'll be making solo trips to Carolina's from now on. Wah wah.
