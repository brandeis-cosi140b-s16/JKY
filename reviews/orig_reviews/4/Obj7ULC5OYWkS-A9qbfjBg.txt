Decided to come here after work for an early dinner with Dad.  I'd seen the Diners Drive Ins and Dives segment on their main location in Ahwatukee, read some of the Yelp reviews, and checked out their menu beforehand.  What I wanted was good Mexican food fast and cheap.  Mission accomplished.

Their newest location in central Phoenix is in what I believe used to be part of the space that Coffee Plantation occupied back in the day.  Its in a pretty hidden part of a crowded strip mall on the northwest corner of 16th St & Glendale.  Parking was a chore, but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  I had expected a pretty bare bones Mexican taco stand feel (similar to Tacos Atoyac) when I walked inside, but the place is surprisingly modern.  Much more like a Chipotle than a Tacos Atoyac.

We both got the Carne Asada Burrito meal.  I know their staples are the street tacos, but I was in the mood for something a little more hearty.  The burrito didn't disappoint and came with a side of beans and rice.  Plus two drinks, the total tab was just $18.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes, though its certainly comfortable enough if you want to hang around for awhile, and the outdoor patio is a nice touch.  Staff was friendly too.

Not sure the food was as good as Tacos Atoyac (just a few miles west of here), but then again Tacos Atoyac is way divyer than this place.  For the more affluent north central crowd, Los Taquitos fits in very well with the neighborhood.  Its affordable, comfortable, and fast.  Just be sure to pack your patience when looking for a parking spot around here.
