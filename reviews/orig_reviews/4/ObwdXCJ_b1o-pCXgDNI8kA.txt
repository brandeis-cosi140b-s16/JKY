Great homemade tortillas (nice and thick)
The service is good
The food is good.

Losing a star because they're priced a little high, but if you go family-style and share the whole-pound fajita plate(s) it eases the sticker shock a smidge. 

Also, try the pork fajitas, they're much better than the chicken.
