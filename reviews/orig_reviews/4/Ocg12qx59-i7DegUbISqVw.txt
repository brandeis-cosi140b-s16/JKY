So after living in Tempe for 5 years, I finally decided to drop in and check the place out. Total dive restaurant, but usually I have found, the dive restaurants usually have some of the best food. I have come here for breakfast now many times, their burritos are huge and flavorful. My only gripe is they use french fries for the potatoes in the burritos. If they made their own home fries in the burrito, I would dub them the perfect breakfast burrito. I have yet to try the lunch/dinner entrees, maybe one day!
