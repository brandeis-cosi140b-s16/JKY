Had the 3 Street taco plate, Al Pastor, Carne Asada & Cochinita Pibil. Delicious! Wife had the La Santisima veggie taco plate. Very hardy for veggie only. The salsa bar selection was awesome, all very tasty. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable on the dishes. Used a Groupon for this introductory visit. Will so be coming back.
