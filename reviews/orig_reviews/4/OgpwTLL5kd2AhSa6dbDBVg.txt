We have heard about the place for quiet some time now and we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere when you walk in is very nice and friendly with a modern ambient. The service was fast and friendly as well. Coming to the food I really liked my plate which was on the special menu (Lomo de Cerdo - pork sirloin wrapped in bacon with sweet potato puree). It was nicely cooked and presented and the portion was just enough! The margarita I ordered was also great. In general, it was a nice place that I could be going back.
