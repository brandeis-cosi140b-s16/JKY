This was a good Mexican place.  Good Mexican seafood.  I used to come here often until they closed down this location.  

The seafood tacos are good.  My parents (from Illinois) had to go here when they came to visit me in Arizona.  They made some good seafood enchiladas also.  Too bad this place closed down.
