Service was great, always there to fill up an empty glass and checked on us several times.  The patio area has a nice ambiance even during the day.  Awesome blue corn enchiladas! Margaritas were yummy :)  The green salsa is amazing! I usually go for red, but this time the New Mexico flare caught my attention!
We used the check-in offer for the free chips and salsa without any issues. The servers were patient with us...we were so busy chatting away, that we took forever to finally order.  I didn't notice any smell that other reviewers mentioned. I also felt that it was a nice change from the high end chains you usually find these days. Chill place with good food and decent pricing!  My jalapeno margarita was only $4.50 - a special of the day!
