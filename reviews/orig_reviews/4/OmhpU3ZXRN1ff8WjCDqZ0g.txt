Chino Bandido would be legendary if it were walking distance to ASU or any major university. It is everything that a great college restaurant should be cheap, unique, quick, kinda dirty and it has sense of humor about itself. That being said it's not a college establishment rather its buried in the northern suburbs of Phoenix (there is a Chandler location as well) in a boring intersection that outside of Chino Bandido has nothing of interest. 

But the food is good especially when considering the price. The jade chicken is a good safe pick for first timers but i think the jerk chicken is the best, however it has some kick. I also like the pollo diablo but heed the warning it is very spicy. The carnitas was ok but if i got it again it would be in a burrito as it seems shredded beyond being served in a bowl. 
As for the ordering system it seems unnecessarily efficient (assuming the customers can figure it out). I've never noticed a line out the door that would put the system to good use but it hardly takes anything away from the place other than it is difficult to ask the employees what is good or what the hell 'B' means. If it is your first time look for another customer to help you out or go to the website, it explains the process.
