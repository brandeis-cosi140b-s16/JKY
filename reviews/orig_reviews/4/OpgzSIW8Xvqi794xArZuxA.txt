Salsa bars just make everything better. If my roommate would let me, I would put one in our living room. Who wouldn't want to live with a salsa bar?!

Sabor is not big. It's not fancy. So what is it? Pretty damn tasty street food. Add to that- coolers stocked with great local beers.

I really like the flavor of the steak here. I usually get it in the form of tacos authenticos. I'm a sucker for the corn (cob form covered in mayo, parmesan cheese and chili powder) and chips & queso. What goes great with chips and queso? #allofthesalsas I'm a huge fan of the taco salads, but I will want you it's more like a burrito bowl than a salad. And it's a bowl you can eat. 

Check the boards for specials. The only thing I've had here that I didn't enjoy was a margarita. I would recommend this as a place for grub and not to drink. Get a Mexican Coke instead.

It does sometimes take a little longer to get your food. It's the nature of a place like this. Make sure to check in on Yelp. Hint hint: check in offer.
