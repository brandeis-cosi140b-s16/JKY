Years ago this was my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant, and not much has changed. 

The hostess was very sweet and helpful when I arrived. I was waiting for a friend, and she was very accommodating. 
Chips, salsa and been dip were brought out quickly. Salsa and bean dip are pretty good. I was mixing them together. I've had better table salsa, but I've also had much worse. 
I ordered the fish tacos, and they were yummy. I went with fried fish, rather than the grilled, and they were very flavorful. I really liked that the sauce was served on the side... I love extra sauce and they gave me plenty. 

I also ordered a beer, Tecate, with a salted glass.  
FYI for Tecate lovers they have both cans and bottles. 
The waiter was excellent to me, but a little salty to my friend (luckily I'm the one writing the review) 
Overall excellent food, great beer (ask for a salted rim-so good), service evens out to pretty good... Mostly because my friend didn't mind the extra salt being thrown his way. I'm so glad this Las Vegas staple is so going strong.
