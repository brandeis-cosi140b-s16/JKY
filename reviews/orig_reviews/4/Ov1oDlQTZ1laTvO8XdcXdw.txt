YUM! Went here with my sister and papa right before I caught a flight because my sister said these tacos were to die for. She absolutely loves the cactus taco. I stuck with chicken tacos and they were flavorful and light. I appreciate the use of cabbage instead of lettuce, it added a nice flavor. I tend to enjoy Mexican sauces and dripping from my taco (so much flavor!), but this was a pleasant change.
