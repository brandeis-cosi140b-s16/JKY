Went in on a Tuesday evening. Place was pretty empty but that left plenty of parking so I wasn't deterred. Service was also pretty slow for it being empty. The older woman - owner? - who was waiting on some tables took awhile to get to us, though we were greeted at the door.
Prices were a little higher than I expected (I was thinking a smaller Manuel's but the prices were a few dollars more than what I typically get there) but my chimi covered in fresh guacamole, sour cream and cheese was delicious. It also had a side of beans covered in cheddar and they were really good. Split a basket of chips with my friend and while the chips were great, I wasn't too keen on the salsa - it was a little more watery and more like pico de gallo than I typically like. I got a water with lemon that was good, it didn't seem like tap. 
Overall, I typical Mexican local restraunt experience. Great food but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for it.
