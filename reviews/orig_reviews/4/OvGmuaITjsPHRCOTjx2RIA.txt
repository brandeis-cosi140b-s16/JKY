There are many Mexican restaurants you could go to in Phoenix.  Most of them are very similar with the menu and flavors.  I put this one above most.  The food is good, the menu has everything you would expect to find and a few you might not.  But the atmosphere and service put this place high on my list.  I really enjoy the mix of chips you get.  Some fluffy some crisp.  Yum,,,
