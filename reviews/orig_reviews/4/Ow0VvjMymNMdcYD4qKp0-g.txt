Our hosts for the weekend took us here for lunch and I'm so glad they did. GREAT food!

We were all starving so before our hostess could seat our party of 4, we had two orders of chips and guacamole and a round of top shelf margaritas ordered. The drinks were delivered right away and the chips and guacamole shortly followed. Chips and guacamole hit the spot and so did the margarita!

We all ended up ordering the same item; chicken enchiladas that came with spanish rice and black beans.  A pretty standard and typical item on a mexican restaurants menu but I have to say, it was very tasty and was prepared well.  The chicken was not dry at all. We all over indulged in chips and guac so finishing our entrees would be next to impossible. We had lots of leftovers, for sure. 

We came on a Saturday afternoon right during the lunch rush hour but it wasn't busy at all. This allowed for our meals and drinks to come out rather quickly. We were in and out in an hour. Pretty quick lunch, I'll say...
