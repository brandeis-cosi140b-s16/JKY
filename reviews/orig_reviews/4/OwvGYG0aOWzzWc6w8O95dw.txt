As long time friends & fans of Barrio Cafe, my husband and I were anxious to determine whether the downer reviews of BQ were for real...It's hard to believe that Silvana would allow her name and work to be compromised. Alas, after our visit today at lunch, we were very relieved to enjoy a very nice meal that represented Silvana well. We ordered three wonderful tacos (fish, chicken y chorizo, and shrimp), chile verde, a mole tamale (the mole was AWESOME) and some very tasty guacamole. My husband is a chile verde connoisseur (which means he eats it a LOT) and said the flavors were rich and complex, and better than traditional chile verde. The black beans that came with his chile verde were *clearly* made from scratch, with an unmistakably homemade flavor.  I have yet to determine if we are salt deprived or if restaurants in general err on the side of less salt -- it is a matter of personal taste -- and with a couple of dashes of salt, the flavors of our meal delighted us. 

For full disclosure, we did not have any alcoholic beverages (loved the water with thick, juicy lemon slices...mmm!)  and found that the price of lunch was very reasonable, considering our "full" factor when we were finished. My husband and I had been to this location when it was a French bistro (which I really did not like, mostly because of the ambience/layout of the restaurant) but Silvana has done a fantastic job of creating a fun, stylish, and festive atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again!

PS As for the naysayers like Jordan -- who I believe sat behind us at lunch (the guy bitching about the size of the tacos before he even ordered one?) -- sometimes people just bring their unhappiness with them wherever they go...If you want a "big" taco for $2, Taco Bell awaits you...
