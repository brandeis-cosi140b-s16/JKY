Had dinner with my wife. Parking was easy. The staff welcomed us and we were shown to a booth. I had the super burrito and my wife had a taco/enchilada plate. We added two grande margaritas, but they weren't really very large. We were served quickly. The food was good, hot and filling. The staff attentive and  friendly. Most everyone working thanked us for coming in - which was a nice touch.
