The tortillas alone could make this place. 

I went at 12:30pm - got food and a table right away. I got the bean and cheese burrito with a side of guacamole. Everything was excellent and fresh. But the highlight, as mentioned, were the tortillas. They appeared to be homemade. And they were incredible.

The menu is limited, but also cheap. So I don't really see room for complaints there. The house the restaurant lives in is cute and cozy feeling.

I liked this place even more when I learned that America was the name of the owner and not some cheesy restaurant title.
