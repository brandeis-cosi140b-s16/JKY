This was my first visit. We were seated immediately.

They automatically served complimentary chips with beans and a very thin salsa. My personal preference is salsa with big tomato chunks but the liquid salsa had a good flavor. I ordered the chicken enchilada, it was good and decently priced. 

The decor is very cute. I would recommend this restaurant for a date however, it was open mic night and I found it to be  a little painful on the ears.
