LOVED IT!  One of the best meals we had while visiting the area (and we ate out prolly 10 times).  Hubby loves mexican and can be a picky eater  , he wanted to return in the same week.  I loved it and was thrilled we landed for dinner during Happy hour (half priced Margaritas and apps).  If we lived nearby we would at least hit happy hour once a week!
Tasty and authentic food.  Yes the salsa was watered-down but it's flavor was amazing! Atmosphere was fun, eclectic and lovely to be outdoors!
