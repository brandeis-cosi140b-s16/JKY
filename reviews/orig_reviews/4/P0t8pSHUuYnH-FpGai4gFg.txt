I found this restaurant using Yelp!  Wow, a great choice.  Even if you don't like frijoles, you gotta try theirs!  Incredible!  I had enchiladas and they were great.  Portions are very large so I suggest not ordering a whole lot to start with - you can always order more.  Be prepared to wait - it is about the most popular restaurant I have visited in a very long time (you know its good when the Police and Fire Departments eat there).  Oh, also try the buttered flour tortilla - yum!
