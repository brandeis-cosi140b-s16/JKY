I would of given it 5 Stars but when I called to place a reservation on 6.23.15 the Gentlemen that answered said he had nothing available at the time I requested which was 7:30pm, but when we walked up to the hostess desk 3 mins after that Phone call they sat us down immediately, confused as to why he said a 7:30pm wasn't available.

Besides that, let's go with the ambience, the food, & most importantly the service.

1- Ambience was great, just a little dark, which means no good lighting for food pictures lol
2- Food: Chips & Salsa are great!! The 3 Plates we ordered were also great-(3 Taco Plate & the Enchilada+Taco+Chile Rellano Plate) only thing was that I wish my plate had more beans. It was like a spoonful :(
3- Service: Really good!! Our waters were never empty nor our salsa & chips. 
Our food came out extremely fast & our server was on point!! 

I definitely would recommend this place!!
