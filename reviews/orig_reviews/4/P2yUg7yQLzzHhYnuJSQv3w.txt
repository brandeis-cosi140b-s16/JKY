First time at barrios was a hit! Only because I can't figure out how to do half a star. My hubby had the cochinita pibil which is pulled pork with achiote Tojo & sour orange with salsa. I had the halibut special cooked in white wine with olives, capers & tomatoes & grilled zucchini. The fish & meat were perfect! Service was efficient and friendly. Chill vibe and we loved the art work!!!!! Would go back tomorrow!!!!
