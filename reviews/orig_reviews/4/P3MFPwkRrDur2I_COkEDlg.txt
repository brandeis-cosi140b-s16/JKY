One of the best places to eat Mexican food in the area.  Really do enjoy this place, but beware ... it's hot ... well at least for this white boy.   My favorite are the combo plates.  Every time I go I try to get something different just to see, but one of my favorites is the stuffed Relleno .... but pretty much anything I have had here is amazing.  I also like how you get lots of different salsa's, bean dips etc with the chips.  These guys do it right!
