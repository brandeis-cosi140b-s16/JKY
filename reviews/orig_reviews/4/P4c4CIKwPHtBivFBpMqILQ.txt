Great place for grabbing a taco in the center of old town. Cool art on the walls, not very expensive and figgen bangin tacos. I've had about 5 different ones and was not dissapointed in any- including the seafood ones which the majority were. Impressive, since we are no where near an ocean and the fish was grilled. I hear the margaritas are weak, which may or may not be a good thing depending. Would totally recommend it, especially since its next to one of my favorite bars, Patty's pub.
