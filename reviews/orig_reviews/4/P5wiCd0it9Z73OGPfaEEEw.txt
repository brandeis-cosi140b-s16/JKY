To me, the Sandbar at Desert Ridge is like a beloved, worn-out pair of shoes that stink to high heaven, that you would never dream of tossing out. It is uber chill and you don't have to rock out 6" red bottoms to feel like royalty here. Go ahead - wear your flip flops and wife beater - you won't be judged/snubbed - I promise.

Love their HH selections and tacos. And who wouldn't love some sand and tiny splash pool in the middle of the Sonoran desert? I know I do.

Does it get kinda grimy and overcrowded? Absolutely. Do you sometimes get inconsistent quotes on drink specials from various staff at times? Sure. But with all the bad comes the good, right?

I feel comfortable here. It is one of my "safe places".
