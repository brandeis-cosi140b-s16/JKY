Yum! Chipotle!

One just opened up on the corner of West Sahara and Fort Apache, where the old Blockbuster used to sit. Today is opening day and how can I resist a visit? I swing by around 8:30 after work to find a line around 10 people deep. There are a few tables being used by patrons but mostly people are ordering to go. The inside looks like every other Chipotle. Granted it was super clean since today was the grand opening.

I ordered the Chicken burrito ($5.85) and a Barbacoa Burrito ($6.10) for a friend. The line process did take a little bit since the employees were new. Give them a week or two to get a feel for it and then the lines will probably fly faster. 

The food is pretty consistent to every other Chipotle. What can you say? Its a chain restaurant! I'm definitely still a fan of Roberto's but I can see myself dropping by here once in a while.
