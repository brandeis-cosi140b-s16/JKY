Wow, not such friendly reviews.  Maybe I can help.  It's true, the mexican food you receive here is not what many are used to in that its not as spicy and the menu is limited.  However, if you want to try the REAL mexican food instead of the Americanized, "cookie cutter" versions that surround the rest of the town, Restaurant Mexico is the ticket!  It's a mom and pop joint with friendly service and wonderful hospitality.  True, the restaurant is lacking in decor, but it is clean and gives it a small town restaurant feel.  The food is on the lighter side and doesnt leave you feeling bloated when you leave which is great in the hot Phoenix sun!  I recommend the cheese enchilada combo with the green sauce...delicious!  The cheese is light and the texture is wonderful.  It's the first time when eating an enchilada that I actually slowed down and savored every bite!  Yummy!
