Absolutely LOVE this bar! The ambiance is beautiful - I love the long walk down the stone steps (careful ladies in high heels), the fireplace and comfy seating. My only complaint is that it is REALLY small - not the place to go with a large group.  The bartenders are phenomenal as is the food. Check it out for a romantic date night - you won't be disappointed.
