Found this place on yelp while in an unfamiliar area. Had apps and Margs, they were so pretty we took pictures of them!  Only reason it's not a 5 star is I am not certain the Margs even had alcohol in them. Had 2 ( and they are big!) and walked out without the slightest effect. 

Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is clean and food was great!
