Have been here a couple times and did not know it was the same people with the restaurant in Ahwatukee that was on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. 

This location is very nice and contemporary compared to the original location. 

This could do very well in North Scottsdale with the decor if it was located somewhere else.

The burritos are very good but if you come here you must have the street tacos and the carne asada in particular. 

The Carna Asada is awesome in the burrito or tacos and you can't go wrong, but would recommend trying other items.

I like the fact that you order at the counter and that they call your name. Makes it very informal and casual. 

I will definitely come back to this location over and over.  

All i can say is great food and very nicely decorated location.
