Food here is really, unexpectedly good BUT the portions are tiny and can be pretty pricey.    I don't think I'd eat here again just because spending $6-7 for one taco (no matter how good it is) just irks my practical side.  On the other hand if someone else was footing the bill I'd try everything here :).
