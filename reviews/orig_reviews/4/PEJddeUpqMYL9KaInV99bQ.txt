I like Rositas. They are affordable, and the food is always consistent. 

The lunch specials are awesome, I recommend burritos enchilada style. The chips were a little stale, but that's par for the course for most Mexican restaurants.  

The waitress we had this past visit was amazing. She was engaging, but not intrusive. Our drinks were always full, and she even offered "To Go" drinks... 

My mother and I were catching up after a while, a she didn't chase us out of the booth, and even continue to offer refills on our iced Tea after we closed out the tab. 

One of these days, my husband and I should split something, so we have room for desert because I saw a plate of fried Ice cream walk by, and it looked delicious.
