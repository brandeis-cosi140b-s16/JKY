Moved up north from downtown Phoenix and was bummed that we wouldn't get our Saturday morning burritos from Carolina's in downtown Phoenix.  One day searched for Mexican food on yelp, and saw Carolina's on Cactus - could this be, could this be the same one?  Ordered our chorizo burritos, just as tasty as the one in downtown.  Tacos - much greasier here than downtown :(  Enchilada sauce - almost the same, but not exactly, Tortillas - just as good.  Overall, it satisfies our breakfast burrito fix, but is is not exactly the same as the one downtown.
