Mexican food fast!  And affordable!  And they actually have jamaica!  

I had the chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce and a side of rice. 

The portions were a little smaller than I'm used to seeing but the serving size was just enough to satisfy without over stuffing.  The price seems right for a dish this size. 

The chicken had a nice seasoned flavor and the tortillas were good too. 

The rice was a little dry and had that "not so fresh" kind of texture but was good none the less.

The salsas were good as well and had a little spicy heat and did taste fresh. 

I'd give a solid three stars for this place but the fact they actually had jamaica made all the difference for me!
