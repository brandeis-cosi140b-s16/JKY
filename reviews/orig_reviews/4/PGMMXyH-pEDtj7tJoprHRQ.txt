You can never have enough fresh tasty Mexican places around.. even in north Scottsdale. Let me tell you, this place is very tasty! Everything is made right there in the open kitchen and if you sit at the bar you can see how fresh it all is. 

The Mr and I were hungry so we ordered way to much food. We had no idea that the portions were so large. Started with the Parrillada Tampiquena for 2.. a huge sizzling platter of meaty goodness! Steak, chicken, carnitas and chorizo.. served with tortillas, rice, beans.. well you get the picture.. a mother load of food for 12.99.. this is enough for 2 healthy eaters. Me and the Mr being healthy eaters we continued to over gorge ourselves.. steak quesadilla and a carnitas burrito.. both were large and stuffed with tasty meat! 

If you love some thick juicy meat like I do, this place is a perfect fit!!
