Whenever I travel I love checking out cheap and good places where real locals love to eat. Having asked a few of my friends for suggestions the #1 recommendations was Komex.  

Parking: I'm guessing during the day time this parking lot gets packed but luckily Komex has its own strip mall parking Thumbs up

Atmosphere:
Being from Hawaii the place is alright. Kinda old school looking. Otherwise its not much to look at. Basically what I would expect out of a Hawaii Plate lunch restaurant

Service:
All I can say is the service was fast, food came quick and everything worked out great

Cost:
In Vegas standards this place can be really cheap or somewhat on the pricer side. Either way I think for a complete meal your looking to spend at least $6 per person.  I had a half order Kalbi nachos and 1 taco and I was pretty good and that was about $7

Food:
Seeing all the Yelp reviews I had to try the bulgogi Nachos and a pork taco.  Both items were definetly worth the money.  The Pork taco had a tad bit of spicy but was tasty and not to faty.  The BUlgogi half or nachos was pretty good and loaded with meat, cheese, salsa and other toppings.  The Bulgogi had a nice flavor and you know it had to be marinated for hours.  I do have a feeling that the nachos were zapped in the microwave oven though.

Overall:
If your looking for cheap and easy then this is the place. I waiting for my next trip to Vegas so I can try the highly recommended fried rice.
