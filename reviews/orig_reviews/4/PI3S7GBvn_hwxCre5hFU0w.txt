good food. Guac was great. service was friendly. will go back but likely won't get the chicken mole dish again, as chicken was a little over cooked. Fish platter type dish was great though. Had lobster appetizer that was great. parking was easier than I thought. Got there early, around 430 or 5 on a sunday so it wasn't crowded, but got that way by the time we left. Churro dessert was to die for and would go back for JUST that.
