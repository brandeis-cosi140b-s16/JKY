After trying Cafe Rio a few times. I now prefer this place over Chipotle! (They are very similar) What makes Cafe Rio stand out amongst it's competition is their sweet Barbacoa (shredded pork) it's just packed with flavor and just plain addicting! It's great in the salad or burrito. Try out the enchilda style (sauce and cheese baked on top of the burrito) when you get a burrito for a dollar more. 

I've tried the steak tacos as well. Not too bad but nothing to write home about. The prices are affordable and food portions are large. All the ingredients are always fresh and prepared right in front of you. 

Try out the house dressing on anything you order. As for drinks, they have a ton of selection, but since this is a Mexican restaurant, I suggest the Horchata! This location is busier than the other cafe Rios but a lot nicer inside. Be ready for a long line...
