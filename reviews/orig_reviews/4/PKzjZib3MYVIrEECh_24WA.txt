I was craving street tacos for lunch and Los Taquitos did not disappoint.  I ordered the pollo street taco dinner.  The tortillas are homemade, the chicken was marinated and cooked perfectly.  I also enjoyed the tasty beans and rice.  I would prefer to have someone take my order instead of standing in line, but otherwise had good experience.
