Busy Sunday brunch, went with another family after church.  Overall everything was good.  Server was on the chip, salsa, and drink refill!!!  Wait time was a little long but it was Sunday brunch so no complaints there.  Minus one star because food was "okay" but not 5 star worthy.  It wasn't hot and kind of dry/hard.  I ordered the pollo con queso which I've had before and it was better.
