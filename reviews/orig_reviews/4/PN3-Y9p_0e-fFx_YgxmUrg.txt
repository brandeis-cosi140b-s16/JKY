We were really pleased that we stumbled on to this place. It happened to be happy hour & the prices were very good. For dinner we had a ahi, shrimp, and grilled fish tacos & a chipotle chicken quesadilla. The habenero margarita was delicious and not as hot as I expected. Loved  the up beat atmosphere. We will definitely be back.
