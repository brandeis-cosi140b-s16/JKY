The atmosphere and staff are really great here. It's rather cozy without feeling cramped, although I've never been here while it's been crowded. The food here is quite good as far as Chandler goes, but you could get better and more at the same price elsewhere if you were willing to drive a little. Although I don't see why the cash only policy would actually deter someone from going, it is rather surprising for a place as nice as this. The salsa bar is very well stocked, and is probably the best reason to eat here. I've never drank here, but the bar always looks nice and moderately busy, if a bit small.
