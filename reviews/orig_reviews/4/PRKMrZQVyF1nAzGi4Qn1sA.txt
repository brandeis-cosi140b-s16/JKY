The food is really good here, but kinda confusing on how to order.  There's really no order to the lines here, you kind of just get in a line and hopefully get what you want.  Other than that, I got the beef cheek, tongue, and carne asada.  Pretty good for a late night snack.  Best part of the experience is watching people coming from the club wasted trying to get their taco fix.  Recommend for a late night cheap eats on the strip.
