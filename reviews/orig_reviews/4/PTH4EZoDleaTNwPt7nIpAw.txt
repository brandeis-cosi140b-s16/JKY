I really like Joyride.  I like the enchiladas with half green half red sauce, I like the hip colorful casual vibe, and I most definitely like the margaritas - oh the margaritas.  I just don't know if I actually like the tacos...I've never tried them.

Therein lies my only complaint with Joyride (and gourmet taco places in general).  The tacos just never seem like they are worth the price (unless you are here on a Taco Tuesday night or I suppose have self control and don't need 5-6 tacos like me...)

The free chips and salsa are a nice touch and the service is usually outstanding.  Like I said, the food is delicious! I promise I'll try the tacos eventually...
