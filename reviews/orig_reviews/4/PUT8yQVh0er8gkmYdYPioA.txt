The food here is above average to good. The mini chimis are good, the chicken is better than the beef. Most of the food is pretty good, nothing healthy about it keep in mind. It's a cool Mexican-American ambiance. 

What makes this 4 stars then you ask? This is one of the best happy hours in Phoenix. 1/2 price their tasty and large appetizers and $2 (used be $1) Margaritas. Food is three-four stars, but their happy hour bumps them up to a solid four stars.
