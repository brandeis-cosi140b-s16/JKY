One of the absolute best Mexican restaurants that I've been to in the U.S. Simply amazing. Very small and quaint atmosphere. The prices were awesome and very affordable. I enjoyed the authentic Mexican beer and their beans and burritos were one of a kind. As soon as you step out of the restaurant you have an awesome view of camelback mountain.
