Since moving to PHX from KC I've been craving some good fajita's and had yet to find any...until we went to this place last night. I'd done a quick google search and this place kept coming up. Yes, we had to drive awhile to get there but it was totally worth it. As other's have said, its a little dark in the parking lot and the interior leaves a lot to be desired but that's where the bad ended and the good started. 

We were immediately greeted by a friendly young girl and sat right away. Our server Anthony arrived promptly and took our drink order as we looked over the menu. We opted to get the full pound (half shrimp and half chicken) to share and save us a few bucks. 

The chips and salsa were really good with the salsa having a bit of a bite to it. Then the main attraction arrived. Holy cow! I've never had tortillas like this! They were fresh off the grill and had this wonderful buttery smell. After filling mine with chicken and all the toppings, I was in fajita heaven! These were the best I've ever had. My bf raved about the shrimp as well. We proceeded to eat way more than we should have but when something is that good, its hard not to. The guacamole side I ordered was good but I have had better so I might skip the $3 upcharge for it next time, but there will most definitely be a next time. SOON.

Throughout our meal, Anthony provided outstanding service in my book. Kept my diet coke full throughout and just filled it up, rather than asking, interrupting conversation as some waiters do.  He had perfected the unobtrusive service that I love, where they just take care of you and let you eat. Full drinks and constant tortillas as he anticipated our needs without us asking. Its rare to find that!

We will definitely be back!
