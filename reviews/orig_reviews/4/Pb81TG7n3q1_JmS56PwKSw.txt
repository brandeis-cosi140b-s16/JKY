My husband and I were in Scottsdale over a long weekend and through Yelp and the help of our hotel manager we chose The Mission for dinner.  It's a beautiful little restaurant with an outdoor seating option as well as ample seating inside.  There are little crystal chandeliers that cast a warm glow and the wall around the kitchen is made from salt  blocks that seem to glow from the lights inside.  
The food was fantastic!  We ordered the table side guacamole and the kid that made it for us had some excellent suggestions on what to order for dinner. The guac was delicious along with the homemade tortilla chips we ate it on.   We ended up going with the pork shoulder (it's for 2 people) and that was also marvelous.  The pork fell apart as soon as your fork touched it and it's served with tiny tortillas on a salt block and garnishes like sauce, cheese and diced red onion.  
The only thing that didn't make this place a five star option was our actual waitress.  She  didn't seem to interested in making suggestions for dinner and didn't say a thing about the fact that I did not touch my Sophia Loren ( a really STRONG drink) I had ordered.  Also the managers were darting around but seemed to busy to talk to the patrons.  However, it would not deter us from going back there again.  It was absolutely delicious!
