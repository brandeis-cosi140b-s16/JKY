This is one of those great little finds off the beaten path. The inside is fun and quirky. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The menu has Spanish and South American dishes as well as Mexican. The food was well presented and delicious. We had the hanger steak, chicken enchilada, the special with steak, chicken and chorizo. For dessert, chocolate tres leches and bread pudding. We didn't have a bad dish. I can't wait to get back and try some of the other options.
