We had the opportunity to try Frank & Fina's today! Delish!

We went there around 1pm on a Saturday, no wait. There were other patrons there but it wasn't overly crowded. As soon as we were seated chips and salsa were placed on the table.

We ordered:
-Riesling
-Empenadas
-#4 combination (1 crispy beef taco, 1 enchilada, rice & beans)
-Chicken mole enchiladas

It tasted very authentic and the pricing was moderate for standard fare Mexican food. The beef in the crispy taco, while flavorful, was slightly dry.

Service was very good, multiple waiters helped us and everyone was friendly.

I will definitely be back when a Mexican food craving hits.
