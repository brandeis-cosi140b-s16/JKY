Although I can never have more than one mojito because they always seem to run out of rum or mint, the food is absolutely amazing.  My favorite are the carne asada tacos.  Ive been living in the valley for almost five years and I finally found my go to Mexican restaurant when I want a fix.   The outdoor patio is definitely the place to sit.. And they do get packed!
