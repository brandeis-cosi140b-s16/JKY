I recently listed a home just down the street from America's Taco Shop.  It looked interesting from the outside and I was starving so I popped in.  Now I'm hooked!  Anytime I need to show this home or meet the owner I try to do it around lunch time so I can dial in the Carne Asada tacos and chicken tacos.  I can't wait until it starts to cool down so I can sit on the patio.  Limited seating on the inside but the food is worth having to wait for a seat!
