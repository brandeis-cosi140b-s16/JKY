I was impressed especially since it's only 3 stars. The only reason we gave this place a chance is because the San Gennaro feast was cancelled due to rain (LAME!). Anyway, this became our choice of eats. They serve complimentary chips and 3 types of salsa. One salsa was tomatillo, one spicy, one mild. The mild was good but I wondered if it can from a can, rather than fresh. The other 2 seemed fresher. We ordered the queso fonduto for an appetizer. WOW! Very good. A bit spicy but very tasty. I really enjoyed that. I got the veggie fajitas for 1 (2 wraps) and my friend got the cheese enchiladas. The fajita presentation was beautiful. Sliced yellow squash, zucchini (both with nice grill marks), tomatoes and corn served over peppers and onions. It had a spicy sauce, not a lot at all, just a touch for flavor and color. So good. Came with the usual sides; rice and beans, guac, pico and sour cream. The cheese enchiladas were VERY good too. I usually dont like enchiladas because I dont like the sauce they drown it in. Since my friend wanted to try both the red and green, the sauces were on the side. Sweeeet! The service was great. Friendly waiter, hostess always making sure we had water. Food portions were quite large in my opinion. $10 for my veggie fajitas and I didnt finish it. $10 for the enchiladas, which my friend didn't finish and $7 for the fonduito. Not bad AT ALL. We were both majorly stuffed and she got to take home some leftovers! Good food, good service and pretty damn good prices = Happy Vanessa & Molly!
