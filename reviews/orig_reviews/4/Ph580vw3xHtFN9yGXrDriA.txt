Good place to pick up some fresh Mexican food. We ordered a barbacoa burrito, steak quesadilla, and chicken quesadilla.  As far as the burrito is concerned, I would say it's slightly smaller than a Chipotle burrito, but better tasting. Overall everything tasted good and was fresh. I would definitely return here again.
