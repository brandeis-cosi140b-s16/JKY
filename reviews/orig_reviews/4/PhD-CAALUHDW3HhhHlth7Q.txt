Garduno's is home to one of the best Sunday brunch values in Las Vegas, and one of my favorite dishes in this city.

First the brunch. Every Sunday they serve an all-you-can-eat margarita brunch buffet for about $18. The margaritas are about what you'd expect, given the "bottomless" part - cheap and sugary - which is not to say they skimp on the tequila. You can get brunch-crocked very easily here.

The brunch includes made-to-order fajitas and a small assortment of dishes like enchiladas, ribs, chilaquiles, tamales, and more - it's not a full cross-section of the menu but it's more than enough to satisfy. The dessert selection is surprisingly robust too. Be sure to grab some flan.

Now, on to the dish that's an obsession of mine: the chile rojo. Rich, spicy red Hatch chile and melted cheese smother a huge bowl of flank steak. Add in diced tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and tortilla strips, scoop it all up in soft, warm, fresh flour tortillas and go to town. This is usually good for two meals for me.

The chips and dips served here are quality too. The bean dip is phenomenal (ProTip: you won't want to eat refried beans after this) and the avocado, jalapeno, arbol, mango and mesa salsas are all worth a taste. At the end of the meal, ask your server for a basket of sopapillas, tear off an end, squeeze some honey inside and drift into heaven.

Some of the more traditional dishes that I've eaten here have been unremarkable - the tacos, chiles rellenos and fajitas are all just OK.

Garduno's isn't a restaurant that gets everything right, but it is one that does a few things very, very well.
