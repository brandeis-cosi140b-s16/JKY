Love, love, love Braddah's. I feel like whenever I suggest this location, I always tell friends it's  like a better version of Chipotle (if you can imagine.) I usually get the bowl with seaweed rice and fish, and basically all the other toppings.

My only problem with this location is that every time I've visited, they've always run out of something. The first time it was different kinds of meats and toppings (and I did not want to wait 20 minutes for them to be ready, so I just went without.) This last time we visited, the soda machine was not working...but the cashier still sold us a small drink. Luckily, another employee was kind enough to suggest giving us a bottled drink, which worked out well. 

I feel like this location has it down pat with the food, but they definitely have room for improvement preparedness wise.
