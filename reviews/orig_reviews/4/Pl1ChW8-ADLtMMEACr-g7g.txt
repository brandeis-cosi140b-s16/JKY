Brought my brother here for his bday! 

I been here twice total and both times the food was really good. We arrived about close to 10 pm and the place was very busy but we were seated quickly. There were a lot of celebrations going on this night, many bdays and a wedding. The staff did a good job of maintaining a good atmosphere by playing music, singing songs, and being very interactive with all customers. 

A lot of choices looked very good but I settled with a plate of Chicken Fajitas with flour tortillas. The food was good, nothing I can complain about or really hype. I finished my plate and my drink never went below half way, good service all around.
