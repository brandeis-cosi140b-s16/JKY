great guacamole, awesome chips, awesome sauce (not just an expression--i mean, literally!) and decent tacos. i ordered the fish tacos and the al pastor. both were excellent and pretty filling despite their size. this is a fun place to go with friends or on a date with the hubs. 

my only complaint is that it is a pain trying to find parking off east blvd, and i'm used to to the authentic cheap mexican taco. so $3+ per taco is a splurge for me. i guess it's worth it, because of the atmosphere. maybe...
