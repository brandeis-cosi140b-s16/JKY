We've come her a few times and usually enjoy what we order, especially if you like spicy foods.  My boyfriend ordered the Habenero burger which he really enjoyed I ordered the skewers, very healthy and a good choice if you are debating. I have also had the tacos, they were spicy but pretty tasty. The service is usually pretty good and attentive. They usually are helpful with suggestions if you are debating on what to order. If you check in on yelp, you get chips and salsa. The chips have a great flavor. I will be back, I like this place.
