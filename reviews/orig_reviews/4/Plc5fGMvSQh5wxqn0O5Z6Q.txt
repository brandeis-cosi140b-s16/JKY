Restaurant quality tacos on the cheap! I ordered the shrimp taco and a chicken taco and they were both great. You can definitely appreciate the fresh ingredients. You can either do the drive thru option or order up at the window and eat outside. I did not really know what to expect but I will definitely be returning! 
-I would highly recommend  this restaurant if you are looking for a fast,cheap,not greasy taco! 
ps try the Horchatta!
