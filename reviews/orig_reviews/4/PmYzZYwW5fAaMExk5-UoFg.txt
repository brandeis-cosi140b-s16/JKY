I had a co-worker tell me that I should try this place out. He went and picked up the food to go. He ordered a carne asada burrito and a side of rice and beans for me. The rice was different but very good. I loved every bite that I ate and that was take out! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's hard for me to order take out from a restaraunt when they are using styrofoam. I will check it out again and see if they have changed to recycable "to go" boxes.
