FINALLY! I found good carry-out mexican food in Madison. I usually go to La Hacienda out of old college day habits of seeking cheap cheap cheap mexican food. Lately, I've been seeking something better like I got used to while living in San Diego...Guadalajara was pretty close. I went to Francisco's first, but they were closed on Sundays (they did have a sign in the window "$10 margarita pitchers" so I have a feeling my straw and I will eventually try it out).

I got a burrito which was outstanding and only $6. My only complaints were that the cheese was melted on the exterior (making it hard to eat w/o a fork and knife), it was zapped in the microwave (unnecessary if the cheese was placed inside), and the lady was trying to be skimpy on the salsa (I wanted to try it all). 

Everyone was speaking Spanish, it was extremely quick, the staff was very friendly, all the other food going out looked great, the place seemed clean despite its quirky late night drunken Cabo taco shop appearance and the salsa was really good in my opinion. 

I can't wait to go back!
