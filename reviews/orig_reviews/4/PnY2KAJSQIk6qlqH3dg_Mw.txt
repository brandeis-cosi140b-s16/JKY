Food: These both got a little messy to eat so ask for extra napkins!

- Taco asada - beef, cabbage, guacamole, salsa, and hot sauce over a mini flour tortilla ($1). Tasty and dirt cheap! 4/5

- Quesadilla Pollo - chicken and cheese with cabbage, guacamole, salsa and hot sauce sandwiched between 2 mini flour tortillas ($2). Also, tasty and cheap! 4/5

Service: Fast and friendly. This food truck spot opens at 7:30, we got here at 7:38 and all the table were taken. We had to wait for people to leave so we can quickly grab their table. I'll definitely come back. A tasty meal for $4, I also ordered bottled water ($1). 3/5
