I was on my one-year anniversary date. We ordered the ceviche de pescado and the steak and lobster dinner. Let me tell you. They serve this salsa with a side of perfect chips. PERFECT CHIPS. The salsa is spicy, just a warning, but the best ever. The ceviche is lemony goodness. Simple and so delicious. Now the star of the show was the steak and lobster. Order it medium rare. It is so tender, you can literally cut it with a fork. It is served over a garlic buttery sauce and it is just amazing. The lobster is smothered in poblano peppers and onions. It is an amazing mexican twist on an American classic. GO.
