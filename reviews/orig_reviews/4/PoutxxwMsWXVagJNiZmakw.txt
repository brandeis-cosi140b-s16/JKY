I really wish I was more hungry when I ate here.  The food is not the "traditional" Mexican food I am used to.  The margaritas are okay.  I don't think they are anything special.  I only tried the Lowrider Margarita.  The next time I am in town I will try the other ones.

My friend and I shared the Kuali de Camaron which consisted of roasted jalape√±o with cheese, chile, an avocado slice and shrimp.  The food was very flavorful, but not spicy.  I was expecting a little kick, but there wasn't any.

My friend had the Chiles en Nogada which contained a roasted poblano pepper with chicken, apple pear, dried apricots and and pecans, almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds.  On the side was chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies.  This is the chef's signature dish, and it was a very flavorful dish.  I took a couple bites and wished I had enough room in my stomach to have a plate of my own.

The waitress was very nice and checked on us several times.  I LOVE the Chicano art both inside the restaurant and outside.
