Have always liked this location, probably because it is never crowded and the tacos are also really good and cheap. You can score 2 tacos for three bucks here, either on corn (which are smaller) or flour (which have more meat). The staff is pretty cool here as well and one guy made us this great shot with fireball and Kahlua called a Cinnamon toast and we got a 2 for 1 deal. They also have plenty of TV's inside and a few outside bars on the patio. Pretty relaxed crowd and the only time I ever saw it packed was on New Year's. Chips and salsa are 1 buck, but that is probably going to normal soon in most places.

UPDATE: Tried a $10 Chicken Burro to go and this is a Great deal. The thing is loaded with chicken, beans and rice and it comes with more rice and beans and some quality guacamole. It was great to mop up the alcohol and also would be great anytime. They also raffle off a jersey on Monday night of both teams. It was my night.
