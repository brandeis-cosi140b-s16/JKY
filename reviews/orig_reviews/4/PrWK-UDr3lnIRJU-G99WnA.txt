One our favorites and I can't believe I forgot to review this place for this long. We eat at Chino Bandido every time we're in the area and my entire family loves it.

I always get the Jade Chicken and switch up the other item along with jerk fried rice and refried beans. Always fresh and delicious. Only complaint is the menu is a bit confusing the first couple of times you fill it out but once you have it down it makes sense.

Highly recommended, try it and you'll love it.

Hint: if it is your first time they have a sample station and just ask to try the items before you order.
