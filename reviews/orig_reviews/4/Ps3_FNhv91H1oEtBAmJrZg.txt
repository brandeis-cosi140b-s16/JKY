Went here for a date night with my husband. We sat on the patio. It was nice and the food was very good! We each ordered a bunch of the different tacos and also some sides of rice and beans. I had a margarita that was amazing! The service could have been better though - Our server only came by to check on us once and we had to wait for 5-10 mins when we were done eating for her to come with our bill. Not sure if that was because it was a busy Friday night. Overall a great experience though.
