Located in Old Town Scottsdale, this place has the best guac! We had the table side guacamole. One of the servers pulled a side table with all the ingredients to make guacamole right in front of us. He placed the avocado into a bowl, then tossed in salt, onions, garlic, tomatoes, cilantro, serrano peppers, jalapenos, cheese, and pumpkin seed. It was fresh and delicious.  I'm definitely going to try to make this at home. 

We had the crispy pork & cola lime as an appetizer. We split the pork shoulder tacos between the two of us. The corn tortilla were fried, giving it a nice texture. I love how they put all the tortillas on a salt block.  

We made a reservation for patio dining. I love their patio - definitely dine outside if it's available. They have a huge fan that keeps it comfortably cool, especially in this hot AZ weather. Great food along with candles, wine glasses, and music in the background made my dining experience amazing!
