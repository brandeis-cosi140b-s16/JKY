A coworker and I stopped in here for lunch today after hearing about it from a friend. The parking situation was pretty rough but after circling the block once or twice we got a spot. Right off the bat I noticed the authentic vibe of the place and the menu was super unique. Of course I got the enchiladas as did most of the patrons as far as I could tell. They let you customize the ingredients from the stuffing to the cheeses to the salsas and toppings. They also bake the enchilada right there in front of you once they make it. I ended up getting the spinach mushroom stuffing and it was absolutely delicious. I really want to give a five star but the prices and parking bring it down to four...for now. I will definitely be back.
