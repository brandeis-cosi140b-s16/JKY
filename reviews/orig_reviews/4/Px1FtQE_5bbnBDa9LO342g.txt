if you love and remember Don Jose's, you'll like this place.

the food is average and they do charge extra for chips and salsa (which is good and spicy!), but there's something about this place that keeps us coming back. 

i finally tried the bean burro last night, and it is the reason for my Don Jose's reference. i have been searching for beans like that for years and i FOUND THEM HERE!!!!!!!!!! 

in short, i've tried several things on the menu, the bean burro is by far my favorite with the joanne special a close second.
