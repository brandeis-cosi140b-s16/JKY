Seriously... Get a taco plate. That lamb taco is freaky good, and that coffee braised beef is to die for. Finish off that with the guilds main dish, the street corn. For real, that can't be a "side dish" it's the main role of the meal here. So dang good. 

4 well deserved stars. I would give it 5, but I don't like odd numbers.
