I was here twice on our trip and both times the service was really great!  Really nice, friendly servers and reasonable prices.

I thought the tequila choices could have been better, as well as a list at the tables would have been nice, especially since this is supposed to be a tequila bar!

I never saw a 'tequila goddess' - so maybe that has been discontinued?

The lounge is right on the casino floor, which can be good after a few shots of tequila, - you can interact with people walking by or people watch!
