Solid.  It all comes down to the word "solid".  

The carne asada burrito, standard amongst *berto's purists (*insert your own prefix here...Fili, Rigo, Ernie &...whatev)?  Solid.

The rice and beans, often times overlooked drivel at such an establishment?  Solid.

The carne asada fries, a delicacy not even on the menu (a pile of fries topped with a mound of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, cheese and pico de gallo...I think I just jizzed in my pants)?  Surprisingly solid.  Not quite Riva's in Tempe-solid, but solid none the less.

The business end of the food, about a day later, normally watery and of the Tijuana-Two Step variety?  Not this time pal.  SOLID. (Ok, that was gross.  I apologize in advance for both making a poop joke and actually waiting this long to deliver the SOLID punchline)

Anyone complaining about bathrooms, garbage cans or service obviously has no idea what  they're doing in a dive burrito joint on Chandler Blvd.  You go, you order, you get your burrito and get the hell out.  If you have to eat there, your luck really sucks because this is the kind of food that is best when ordered to-go.  

Do you think the lady behind the counter is there to smile at you?  Will it improve your food?  Would you rather her be all business, take your order, get it done fast and quick and hot out the door, or would you rather have her chit-chat with everyone in line at lunch time in a business area when you've only got 20 minutes left on lunch and Johnny Junkforbrains is up front asking her about her fine horchata-mixing skills?  Yeah.  Me either.

So basically, go get a solid burrito and shut up.
