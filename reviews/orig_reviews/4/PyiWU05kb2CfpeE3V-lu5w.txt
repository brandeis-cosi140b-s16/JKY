It was my first time at this place.  Love the food; had the Al Pastor Taco & Bean & Cheese Burrito for 5 bucks; it filled me up.  But, the reason I went was a review in New Times talking about America's corn; I got the last one of the night....YAY - it was wonderful!!!  It wasn't grilled like Gallo Blanco; but it was great!!!  Will definately be back!!!
