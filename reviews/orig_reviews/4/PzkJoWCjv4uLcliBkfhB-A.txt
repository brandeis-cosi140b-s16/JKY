So, we have been spoiled with Mexican food in AZ especially with Spotted Donkey in Cave Creek.  El Zocalo is a close second though.  The food is good, the wait staff is always helpful, the outdoor seating is super neat, and the range of beer, tequila, and wine is amazing.  There really is something here for everyone and my wife loved their fajita (her favorite Mexican food that she tries everywhere) so if they can please her, they can please you.  The only reason for not getting five stars is when we ate there last night (my fourth time) the waiter added enchilada sauce to my chimichanga and there was an extra charge for it that he didn't mention.  Now, if this were a five star place, it wouldn't bother me because spending an extra $3 when you're spending a couple hundred isn't a big deal.  This isn't that place though.  Go to El Zocalo, you'll like it then head over to San Tan for a few beers after dinner OR to Wimpys for a malt.
