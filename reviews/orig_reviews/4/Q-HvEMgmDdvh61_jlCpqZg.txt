Used to eat at the Craycroft location in Tucson back in the day.  Driivng around Gilbert I spot THIS location and prevail upon Spousal Unit to try it - completely against our Policy of "Locally owned/operated Only"!!!

Chips fresh, salsa trio fresh & tasty... BUT........mi amigos, this is AZ how can you NOT have a hot salsa available?  

Handcrafted margarita to order Great!  Service outstanding, she was a true professional.  Fajitas Great. Shrimp Diablo (has some other name on their menu that I cannot recall) was really good.....BUT.....NOT "spicy hot" as expected.

Overall solid performance except for the disappointing tourist level Spice Index - if I"m not crying and sweating halfway thru the meal you didn't go all the way!
