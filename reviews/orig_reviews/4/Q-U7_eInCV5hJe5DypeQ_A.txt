Meal began with housemade stone ground corn chips mixed in with multi-color flour tortilla chips, nicely paired with a fresh mild salsa.  A hotter salsa was available so we tried it, but it seemed to be a "medium" at best but nonetheless very flavorable.

Portobello mushroom & carmelized onion quesadilla was rather good, as were the vegetable fajitas.  Draft pour of Modelo Especial rounded out the meal nicely.

Our service right at the opening hour was impeccable with plenty of attention, including a kind visit from the manager to insure that everything was just right.   Place has a modern feel that is just a few notches short of being pretentious so it strikes a nice balance somewhere between casual & formal.

Our only negative was the queso fundido which was served in a room temp plate.  The cheese had already congealed into an oval disk that moved as one entity when I tried to make a scoop at it with my corn chip.  Fundido should be served hot enough that it is still gooey, and ideally in some sort of heat preserving skillet or similar.  They really need to change that appetizer.
