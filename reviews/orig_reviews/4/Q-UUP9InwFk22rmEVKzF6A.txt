Cool casual place that is clean, newer, and upscale for a quick lunch.  I love their carne asada tacos and that is pretty much why I go here.  They are seasoned heavily just like I love them with corn tortillas.  You order up at the counter and pick up your food but it looks like a service style restaurant because it is so upscale.  There is a bar and I am sure it gets busy in the evening but I live no where close to this so I wouldn't know.  Great little stop.
