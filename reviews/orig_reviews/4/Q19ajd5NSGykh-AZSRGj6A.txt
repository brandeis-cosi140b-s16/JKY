This place is a sleeper. It's mixed in along with a cluster of other clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale but has a very unique vibe. Lotsa tequila, which can be a very good or very bad thing, as we all know, but reasonable prices and a good inside/outside mix. People seem to always congregate inside near the bar or outside at the tables, never so much in what looks to be the dining area. 

The bathrooms are pretty gnarls barkley, but with that much booze and Corona floating around that's bound to happen. Food is so/so, but the staff is always friendly and quick to help out.
