Went for lunch three weeks after the restaurant opened. Was very impressed with the service. Very attentive staff, food came out quickly, everything was good. 

For drinks had the skinny b (cucumber and basil something or other) and the house margarita. Both were good, but the margarita was better. I could see the bar has a good selection of tequila. They should add a tequila flight tasting to the menu to showcase them. 

Had the pineapple salsa and the habanero salsa with my complimentary chips and salsa. LOVED the habanero. Great flavor and heat. Liked the pineapple, but not as much as the habanero. 

Also had the mole and ahi tacos. Really enjoyed the mole tacos. The ahi ones came in a lettuce wrap but I wish I had gotten a tortilla instead. The lettuce had a hard time holding all of the wonderful filling which was a shame because the ahi was perfect and the toppings were really well conceived. 

 I'd compare it most closely to z tejas, but with the added bonus of being local. Also, more uniqueness and variety. I'll definitely go back.
