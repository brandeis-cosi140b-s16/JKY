Cool little place tucked away in an old strip mall.  The "bar" top consisted of three high wood table shaped in a "U".  Neat idea!  The best part....you can actually get a flight of salsa!!  They have eight salsas to choose from and you can get a flight of 3 or 5.  The southwestern had some flavor, but not spicy.  The habanero was spicy but still had flavor.  The Chipotle was bomb!  We also split a taco plate with black beans and rice.  The tacos were huge!  The rice was excellent as well.  The service was great too.  We will be back.
