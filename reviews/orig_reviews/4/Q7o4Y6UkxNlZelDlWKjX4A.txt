I had a wonderful experience here with my dad, we were returning from one of his random excursions from the Red Rock Canyon, on one of our random trips to Las Vegas.  Our overall experience was a delightful one.  How we came upon it was by chance, we spent most of the day climbing (read: getting lost) around the canyon, and driving the roads surrounding the Red Rock, mind you, on a pratically empty tank of gas.

I related to my father the concern of entirely running out of gas and having to make our way back to civilization on foot.  A prospect he wasn't worried with, being that he had survived escaping from the Khmer Rouge, running from Cambodia down to Thailand, by himself, with a bag of rice and three gernades (his words, not mine!).  That story will be for another time when I yelp about some of the riverside restaurants in Cambodia's countryside.

So back to the review.  I forget what we had, it was Mexican, there was fish, tacos, and tortillas-like things that we devoured being that we were starving (read: I was starving).  All I can fully remember was the sweet, sinful, and down right obscenely delicious FRIED ICE CREAM.  Yes, FRIED ICE CREAM.  Not fried ice cream, oh no, all capital letters is all I can do to relate how it was all of the above.  I think I cried a little when I finished it...knowing I could not bring any home with me because it would be soggy and melted by the time we had to leave.  Soggy like my dreams of becoming a millionare off of penny slots.  At least, I was able to taste a bit of the dream in a delicious dessert...all fried ice cream...I think I'm gonna go cry now...
