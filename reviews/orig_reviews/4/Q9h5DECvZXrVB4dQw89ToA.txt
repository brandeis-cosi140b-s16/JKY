Went for lunch mid-week with a good friend. We thought the open patio/dining would be great for a sunny day snack., drink and 'catching-up',
Food was good, the tacos(we had an assortment of all)were delicious,had flour & corn tortillas- tasty! Salsas were also fab. Only downside to the experience was the sudden appearance of flies when the food arrived- & we were inside the restaurant.- being an open-air setting, it was understandable, just annoying.
Be sure to notice that the sink for the restroom is a communal one, you pass by it before you get to the restroom doors!
