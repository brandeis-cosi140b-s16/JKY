This place is darling and so darn yummy. That is HUGE coming from me because I am normally not a mexican food fan. 

The staff is super friendly and very welcoming. They have plenty of options on the menu sure to please meat lovers, vegetarians, and I'm sure even vegans. Their beans don't have lard in them and all the ingredients are fresh. I enjoyed myself some chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. The salsa that comes with the chips is UNREAL. That sealed the deal for me. Killer salsa= one way to my heart.

My burrito was the perfect size, the tortilla had the best flavor and texture, and it wasn't overly packed with cheese. One reason I can't stand eating burritos is the normally ridiculous amount of cheese included that makes me feel like 1-oil is seeping out of my every pore and 2- my arteries clogging from the greasiness. This burrito killed it! I'm kind of still thinking about it.

I can't wait to go back to try a veggie burrito and possibly a skinny margarita.
