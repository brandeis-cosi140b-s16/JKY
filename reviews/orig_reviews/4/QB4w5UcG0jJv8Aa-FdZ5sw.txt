If you start your order by asking for your machaca cooked to medium, egg whites only-scrambled softly, on a gluten free tortilla, half red and half green sauce but only on the side, you're not only in the wrong restaurant you're in the wrong neighborhood! This isn't the Biltmore B!+@#3$; this is Carolina's, take or leave it! 
I've been eating the burritos from here for years, thanks to my work. When you need to feed a hungry crew of construction guys, this is the place to order from! 
I finally made it over to Carolina's for the first time about a week ago. The parking lot was packed, big dog included, (waiting for his share no doubt) the line long filled with suit wearing business men, utility workers, even the Maricopa County posse knows where to go for good food. You won't wait long, the 20 plus employees make this joint roll like clockwork. Watching them roll out  dozens of tortillas, (probably thousands per day)is amazing. These tortillas are enormous and melt in your mouth like butter. They sell them at only $5.25/dozen $3.25/half, definitely worth every dime!
You can't beat the burritos, great flavor and cheap at around $4. My favorite is the Machaca w/egg and the chorizo; add a little jalapenos for kick, top it with their delicious salsa and you've got a fiesta in your mouth!

Step out of your neighborhood and come to Carolina's!
