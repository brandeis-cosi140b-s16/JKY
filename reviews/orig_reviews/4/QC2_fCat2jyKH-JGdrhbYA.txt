For a lifeling Vegas resident (ok, ok, Henderson) it sure took me a long time to get to Lindo Michoacan, and by the time I went it was all the rage.  While I didn't think it was everything it was pumped up to be, it was still very good.

Their chips and salsa (truly the measure of any Mexican or Tex-Mex place) are dynomite.  Their entrees are big and tasty, and the margaritas are also big and tasty.  Service is always quick and friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.

There's nothing truly OUTSTANDING about Lindo, but it's good food that's consistently good with service you can count on.  What more can you ask for?
