The food here was shockingly awesome given its appearance!  

We went here randomly because another restaurant was closed.  It does not look like much.  Sketchy parking lot - complete with a pile of vomit by the ramp!  The inside is cramped.  We ate in a room that looked like it had been something else originally, with way too many tables crammed in.

I ordered a pina colada, and stupidly chose the large size.  Large is a ridiculous understatement!  This thing was the size of a fish bowl or something.  Not one of those stupid beta fish bowls either.  The large drinks mean business!!  It was pretty good too.

Everything we ate was really, really good.  I had the burrito and my friend had a taco salad.  Everything was great, including the salsa, but the taco shell was AMAZING.  So perfectly cooked and tasty.  It's weird to get this excited over a taco shell, but it's totally warranted.  So good!!  I would definitely go out of my way to get something with this amazing shell in the future.
