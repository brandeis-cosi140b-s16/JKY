So much food!! I felt stuffed after eating here. This was one of the top Mexican places, off the Basis of being restaurant style mexican food.

Great portions, service is okay, food is delicious, but not to the type that I like. I love/prefer Mexican street food, so yeah. This wasn't my absolute favorite for Mexican food. I would go again though. Don't get me wrong
