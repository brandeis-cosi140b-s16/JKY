An absolute gem in the middle of nowhere Illinois. Ok not so middle of nowhere if your a University of illinois fan. Had a fantastic roasted chicken with homemade mole. Also had the pupusa appetizer which was amazing. If you find yourself in Champaign Illinois and not wanting chain restaurant crap, you really should give this little gem a try.
