Having spent quite a bit of time eating in Mexico, the menu at Macayo's is definitely Americanized... but that does not make it bad.  The food is pretty good, and the margaritas are to die for... fun casual atmosphere... people do bring families, so it can get distracting with crying children in the next booth..
