Cafe Rio was super busy and the staff are so cheerful.  I got the tostada and it was huge. It was the biggest tostada I have ever had.  The only thing that was difficult to get used to was the lettuce on top sometimes made me feel like I was eatting dandelions, but I'm sure thats the Taco Bell eater in me coming out. LOL. They even have a frequent eater card where you can earn free meals.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants fast but great mexican.
