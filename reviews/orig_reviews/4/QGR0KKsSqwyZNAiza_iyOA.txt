So far, so good. They are a brand new location, but they fit my basic requirements: the food is good, and well-priced. Service was speedy and courteous - almost too courteous, since we were asked if we were doing okay maybe seven times or so. Parking close to this place can be a pain (typical of Mill Ave), but it's a nice and casual spot to unwind for a laid-back lunch. Conveniently right next to a light-rail stop.

It's a typical sports bar meets casual mexican food place. Lots of television screens showing sports games and CNN, a good-sized bar, what looks to be a decent spot for a live DJ (maybe for special events or weekends?), and fun and tacky airbrush decor on the walls of a mexican oasis. I have no opinion on the drinks (since we didn't try any), but once the food arrived (fairly quickly), everything we tried was good. Service was friendly, and the noise level was great at the time we went (mid-day). We found out that they have a punch card, to get a free lunch after you go through five or so. Sounds good to me.

Obviously still a new location that's working out some kinks, but it's off to a good start.
