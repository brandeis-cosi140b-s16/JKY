Never coming here before, I was surprised that this place is basically like a fast food Mexican restaurant. It even has a drive thru. But lots of people have told me how good it was so I tried it anyway. I ordered their street taco special which is basically like two small carne or pollo asada tacos with beans and rice for $5.50. It was a great deal and really filling for the price! There are bottomless chips for dine in customers although the chips were slightly stale because they were sitting out for people to refill themselves. They had a salsa/condiment bar and I sampled all the different kinds they offered. They were all fresh and tasty! Overall, great quick spot for Mexican food in the area. Definitely will be back soon!
