4.5 stars: TACOS! Came here as an alternative to Tacos El Gordo and the line went much faster - went on a Saturday night around 8 and had my food in front of me in seven minutes. Highly recommend getting a vampiro - it was my first time having one and the crispy shells are so satisfying - and also a sleeper hit was the fish tacos, which is light and fresh grilled whitefish.

The al pastor is the real star and you should hit up that line repeatedly and often. I also had the buche, which wasn't as tender as I've had before and also quite salty, and the suadero (always pleased to get brisket) tacos. I wish they had horchata or an agua de fresco on site but the grapefruit Jarritos went down easy, and you can get craft beers! Nice atmosphere, a little sterile than I'm used to for tacos, but that's not a bad thing as you really do feel like you can linger and get some more tacos without worrying about parking or crowds.
