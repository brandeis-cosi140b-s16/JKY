Compared to the similarly set up Caramba's, this place almost rocked my world. The price, the vibe, the food-all of the above.

I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average. 

This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town.
