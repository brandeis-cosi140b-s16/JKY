I was really looking for a spicy meal and wasn't disappointed with their triple meat breakfast burrito smothered in green chile. Cleared my sinuses better than Vicks vapor rub. The burrito was enough for me to eat 3/4 there and take the last bit home for a little appetizer to my dinner that night. Considering they have a Sunday buy one get one breakfast burrito deal my roomie and I paid 9 dollars and thought it was a pretty great deal. The flavors were on point. I am only giving four stars because the guy who took our order seemed a little upset at the world. 

9$ for two huge delicious breakfast burritos, wish the service was a little better but hey I went for the food so I'll save the convos for my therapist.
