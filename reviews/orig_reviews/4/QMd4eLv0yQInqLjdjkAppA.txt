Recently had a late lunch at El Segundo Sol. Being a native Californian now living in NY, I was impressed with the freshness and the flavors of  everything I tried. From the chips with three salsa's (I'm still craving the delicious green salsa) to the awesome Baja fish tacos and the super fresh ceviche ( the market fish of the day was a yummy Tuna), 
Also enjoyed a bright pink Prickly Pear Margarita which was worth the teasing from my lunch mate.  Definitely coming back on my next trip.
