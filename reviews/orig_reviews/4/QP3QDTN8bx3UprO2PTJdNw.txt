K.O. turned me on to this place as she knows I love korean food and mexican food.

I had the Pork Belly Chimichanga with pork belly. This was melt in your mouth good.  The outside was crispy and flakey just how a chimichanga should be. the inside was seasoned well and there was no shortage of meat. The top of the chimichanga was drenched in a delicious sauce along with melted shredded cheese, some lettuce and pico de gallo.

I highly recommend the chimichanga here. Only thing that sucks is that the oil eventually hardens the bottom of the chimichanga crust and makes it difficult to cut.
