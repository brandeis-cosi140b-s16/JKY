I didn't know that this restaurant existed until I saw a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), and I'm sure glad I gave it a try.  I would have never thought that one of the better mexican spots in the valley would be this far north?  No wait and live music at 7:00 on a Friday night also made for an enjoyable night.

The restaurant itself doesn't scream mexican in anyway.  There is a stage and couches to the right of the bar.  The band that was playing on this particular night played a modern jazz style of music, giving Hacienda's more of an upscale lounge ambiance.

We were seated immediately, and chips and salsa were placed on the table in seconds.  Already a good start!  I ordered Irene's Anaheim Green Chile Chicken Enchiladas.  Very good.  The plate is covered in a mushroom sauce that a lot of people may like better than I did.  I personally would have preferred a traditional red or green enchilada sauce, but I'll give Hacienda's credit for doing something unique.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Who doesn't love good fajitas?  Not only was this a good meal, but it could easily feed at least two.  If you order it, you're going to need to take it home, maybe with an extra tortilla or two.

We were seated by the kitchen and watched countless fried ice creams being brought to the tables.  Wow, did they look good.  Somehow, we decided to skip out on desert, but we certainly will have to give it a try next time.
