So far this is my favorite Mexican place in Az! I moved here four years ago and wanted a good Mexican place. One of my new friends I made here in AZ took me to El Zocalo for dinner one night and I'm SO glad she did! It's delicious! Now I live walking distance from El Zocalo and can get my Mexican food fix whenever I want.
