I am a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican Food.  My good buddy Paul talked me into coming to this place.  When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: "Don't worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold."  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!
