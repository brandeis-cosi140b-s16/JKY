This is my favorite chipotle location however I find when I do the orders to pick up my stuff is frequently made incorrectly. It's happened probably 5 times now and the first two times when I called to tell them they were super nice and told me I could get it again tomorrow correctly for free. So I think they are really awesome over all just have caution ordering pick up. Usually they forget an ingredient all together or they forgot the side of beans or hot sauce. Or forget the dressing for salad etc. so just order in line so you can see and ask them for everything.
