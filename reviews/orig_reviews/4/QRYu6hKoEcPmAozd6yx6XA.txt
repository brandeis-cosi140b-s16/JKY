Well My husband wanted to try this place since a friend told him these were the best tacos in town.  uh huh.... 

So he tried the buche, and tripas (eewww really???!!!) tacos and I had the Carne Asada and al Pastor Tacos. ... 

Carne asada tacos were nothing to go crazy for... meh. 
Al Pastor tacos, were amazing!  the meat was soft and with all the fixin's (salsa, guacamole...etc) it was like heaven.  :-) 

My husband LOVED the buche and the other stuff he ate, again disgusting! but hell he loved it so I guess this place gets only 4 stars for me.... The Asada tacos were not mind blowing like we were told.  :-)
