Food was okay, not real authentic Mexican food.... But it's a really cute place, we even went back later in the evening for drinks after having lunch there! Our server Christina was very attentive, very outgoing personality, I like that she keeps it real . Unlike the girl who took our picture as a promotion ( so she says) , she had them printed and customized in cardboard frames for us to purchase , 1 for $20 or 2 for $30, when I declined to purchase , she gave me the stink eye and asked why. I'm already spending money here on overpriced mediocre food and drinks, don't harass me about a damn photo... Please take a seat and learn a thing or two from Christina!!!
