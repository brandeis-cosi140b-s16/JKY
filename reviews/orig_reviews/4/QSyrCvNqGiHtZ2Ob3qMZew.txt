Went on the Sunday before Labor Day.  It was still very busy so our party of 4 waited at the bar about 1/2 hour.  The service at the bar was slow, but once we were seated, our server was great and very responsive with excellent recommendations for both drinks and food.
I read some reviews that it was too expensive, but I felt that for the brand and for the food we were served, the pricing was within my expectations.
