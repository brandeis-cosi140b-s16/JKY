Food, service and ambience was wonderful but two things prevent me from giving it 5 stars. I am a water drinker and even with three lemons the taste was horrible. Also bought $30 worth of "double take coupons for $15, but they don't let you use them on the same visit, something not explained even in the fine print. 
But all that aside, the steak and the sauces, chips and salsa and pico were great. All 6 of us were very happy with our meals.
