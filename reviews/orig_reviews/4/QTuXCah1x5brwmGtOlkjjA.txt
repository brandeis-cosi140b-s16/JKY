The food continues to be delicious here and the atmosphere continues to shine, but they just can't seem to make up their mind when it comes to timing out the food delivery. The first time I went to Spotted Donkey, I was on a date with my bf and they brought our food out within 5 minutes of ordering it. It was so rushed that we were in and out within 40 minutes. Today I went in for lunch and although we were on a bit of a time crunch, I thought this would be the perfect choice since it was such quick service the time before. Boy was I wrong. It took over 40 minutes for our food to come out which would be ok, but considering the time of day and amount of people, it was a little lengthy to wait. Granted, we took a little time before we ordered but I think that our order might have been forgotten in the kitchen. Our poor waitress was less than thrilled when she realized how long it took. But based on my two visits, I've come to realize that I can't really gauge how long my visit will be because I've had such dramatically different wait times. Too bad the timer elves couldn't have flipped these wait times either because the bf and I would have loved to enjoy a bit more time before our food came out and today we would have loved to have the food arrive a little bit more speedily.

I'm only taking one star off because the food is extremely delicious. I had the carne asada tacos and they were so delicious I finished every bite! Also, if you want a guacamole but you don't want the huge tableside one, you can order a small version and it's $5 as opposed to the $10 tableside order. I'm hoping this wait time was just a fluke and maybe third time will be the charm!
