I just had a strawberry daiquri from the slushie bar across the restaurant it was really good, I asked for light on the alcohol and it was perfect for me cuz I don't really like it to begin with, so I liked the face that they mix in the alcohol afterwards, rather that already mixed in like some of the other slushie bars.
