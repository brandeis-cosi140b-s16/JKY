I wasn't sure about the restaurant at first because it was very laid back but I was open to trying to the food.  But from the moment the chips and dip were serviced I was mesmerized.  My group and I ordered crab dip with pita chips...... Aaaawwwww, they are to die for, I wanted to pack up that dish and take it home.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and advised us properly  based upon what we had a taste for.  This place wooed me, I will definitely return whenver I'm in Charlotte.
