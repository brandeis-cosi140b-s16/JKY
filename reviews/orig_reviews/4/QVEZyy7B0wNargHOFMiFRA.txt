As I read these reviews, I can only imagine that there must be some correlation between the quality of food, and which night each chef works...we went on "half priced tapas Monday", and the only thing that wasnt great, was the saffron chicken(very bland and mushy)...but since it was half priced we must've ordered 13 different tapas and all the rest were spectacular... I recommend the potatoes, steak, scallop, hell even the escargot was pretty good..
