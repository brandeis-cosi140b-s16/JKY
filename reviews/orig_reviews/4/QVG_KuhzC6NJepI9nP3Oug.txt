If half star ratings were possible, I would give this a 3.5, but I'm rounding up.
The pros:
Food was good. I had the ahi tacos which were perfectly seared on the outside with a tasty blackening seasoning and rare inside.  It came with calabacitas and delicious black beans.  The kids menu includes a "build your own taco" with basically a bento of taco fixin's.  Brilliant!  
Service was great.  The waiter was personable, helpful, and brought the 3 yr old's food out first.  So helpful!
Nice Patio.

The cons: 
This place is loud.  I mean really loud inside.  
The furnishings.  Well, rustic is the best description.
 
Great for big groups.
Big variety on the menu.
