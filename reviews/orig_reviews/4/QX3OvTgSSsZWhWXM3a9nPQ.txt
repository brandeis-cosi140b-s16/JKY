Great Ambiance.  Excellent service.  Take out of town guests here to create a lasting impression.

4 of us shared all the taco varieties.  When our tacos arrived, they were about 3" in diameter.  I'll admit that I had an internal check-didn't look like a lot of food there.   But once we started eating, those thoughts vanished.  Delicious, and there was plenty of food for all to share.  And anyway...here's a concept-leaving a spanish restaurant without being totally gorged on sides of refried beans and rice and melted cheese. 

Of particular note, Pork shoulder tacos for 2.  Tasty and tender.

Be ready to spend a little dough, and take the time to enjoy the ambiance and cuisine.
