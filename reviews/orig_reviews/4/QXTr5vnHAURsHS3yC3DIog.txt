Picked this based on menu and it was s sit down restaurant...
 Server was rather brusque but warmed up and was very nice...
 Might have gotten burger but was told it takes 25 minutes. Starts with raw meat and good burger they said. Got chicmichanga instead and chopped taco salad with pork. Salad out quickly but had to wait on the other. Arrived huge,hot and delish!
Enjoyed this lunch very much. And the variety of
 Mexican music added to the ambiance... could have been a tad lower though...
 Would definitely eat here again...
