So we bought a big tray of beans tostada shekels and rice for a party we had. Everyone loved the beans and rice. The only thing I thought the price was kind of expensive for one tray of beans 75 tostada shells and one tray of rice everything was $137.00.  I know these are reAlly good beans but making this myself would have cost me way under $20 for the beans and rice.
