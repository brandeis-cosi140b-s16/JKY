i've been to tons of mexican restaurants in az.  this is good, authentic food. the portions are large. the sauces are different and tasty. they have good lunch specials ranging anywhere from $5.50-$7.00. the place is very small. you could be waiting a while if it's busy. it's cramped. if you're looking more for a fancy place or large place, this isn't it. because it's so small, and when i went today it was packed, the service was very slow. but if you're looking for really good food, pedro's has it.
