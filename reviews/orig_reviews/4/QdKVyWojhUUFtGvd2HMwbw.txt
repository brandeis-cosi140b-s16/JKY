This place I believe is a chain off the famous original diner located in south phoenix.  The food tastes exactly the same as the original.  I highly recommend trying this place out at least once especially if you like Mexican food.  My favorite is the cheese  quesada, folowed by the taco and burrito.  I think it's best known for the burrito.  The environment is setup like your typical fast food joint and you don't have to worry about dressing up since its very casual.
