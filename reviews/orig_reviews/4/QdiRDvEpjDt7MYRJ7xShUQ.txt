Hidden Gem.. Scary Exterior (especially IF you aren't from the area). So we found this place on Yelp.. drove around a few times and then when we found it, we couldn't believe this place was actually where we were thinking about having dinner. The area is less than inviting and at night it feels destitute.

We decide to take a chance and the interior is warm and bright. Patrons are enjoying themselves and we are greeted with big smiles by the waitress.

We were seated and served this pretty tasty ceviche tosta on the house. We also ordered a separate order of ceviche, that wasn't as good and took forever to come out. But skipping on to the entrees, people were pleasantly surprised.. ranging from my vegan co-worker to my meat head only co-worker. I had the fish in red sauce with rice and beans which was awesome. My vegan friend had the enchiladas with green sauce which was also tasty. I did hear the drinks were not that tasty.. so be wary of the margaritas.

Good food, reasonable price. I'd give it a 2nd go.
