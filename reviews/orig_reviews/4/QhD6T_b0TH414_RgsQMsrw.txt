I came here for the first time to meet a client for lunch.  He selected this place because it was convenient for him and his office location.  Since I don't come down to Tempe very often, I didn't realize that there's free parking for this place if you dine here...so instead, I paid for metered parking down the street because it's hard to find parking in this part of Tempe during lunch.

After reviewing the menu, we decided to split Chips & Salsa, $5 for an appetizer and I ordered a Hickory Burger, $10.75.  The Chips & Salsa was pretty good but the Burger was excellent!  Not only is it full of flavor, but it's huge and juicy....great tasting, but I shouldn't have had it for a business lunch....it could've been a disaster because it's pretty messy.  I lucked out and didn't get it on my clothes.  Next time, I will order it for dinner.

Service was good and the lunch was successful.  Looks like this place would be fun for happy hour...will have to give that a try sometime.
