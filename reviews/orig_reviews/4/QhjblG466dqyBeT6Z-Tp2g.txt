While in the area, we stopped for a late lunch. We sat in the bar because that's where he always sat when he came here. We were there for about 5 minutes and ignored by the bartender who was talking with what appeared to be a waitress about her vacation to California. 
We decided to move to the dining room. As we approached the hostess station a gentleman said I hope you enjoyed your food, come again. I informed him that we had not eaten yet, as we were ignored in the bar and wanted a table in the dining room. He apologized, sat us at a table and offered us an appetizer on the house. Our waitress was right out and said any appetizer was on the house. I was impressed that it was already communicated to the waitress before she came to our table (good job!!). Our service for the rest of our meal was outstanding!

The pollo fundido is amazing and very cheesy. My boyfriend had the enchiladas de pollo con mole. The sauce was so flavorful. I have never had mole before but one bite and I was hooked.

I will definitely come back.
