Would have given 5 stars if they served alcohol and if our server wasn't in training. Place might do better at a container takeout place with dine in sitting.  I ordered the fusion tostada with chicken. It was great. Also ordered the chicken sope. It was ok. Next time, and there will be a next time, I order 2 tostadas. My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian fusion burrito, and its one of the only times I've seen her that please by food she didn't make herself. Coke products are always a plus!!!!
