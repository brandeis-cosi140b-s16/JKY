I use to live in Brookline and I never understood the huge gathering of people outside this place all the time. I got to see their progression from small blue tarp to protect their flat top and salsa bar safe from the rain to their much nicer popup tent. 

The taco's are delicious. i have to say that the secret to their success is the home made taco shells that are beyond authentic. That combined with a pretty awesome salsa bar that could make just about anything taste good. 

So the meat is just alright but like I said it's the soft tacos and salsa's that you go for. At $2 a taco you are sure to leave full and it's not going to leave a dent in your pocket.
