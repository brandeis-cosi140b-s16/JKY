I love the Fish Tacos or Fish Quesadilla, that mango salsa and red cabbage have me addicted! I've been a big fan of this place for more than 10 years, I've witnessed some crazy things happen here that could have easily sent me running for the hills - but the food is too good to not come back! The Steak tacos are my next favorite item.. the burritos have always been a little lacking in my opinion though.. and occasionally the service is less than accommodating, but its a small price to pay when you're hungry for the best fish tacos EVER!
