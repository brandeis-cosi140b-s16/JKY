This is the good Spotted Donkey! We really liked other one before the ownership change, very much so disliked it after the ownership change, and are so happy to have found this one. The menu is full of great Tex Mex-with-a-fancy-twist-foods. Prices are a little higher than normal Mexican food however you actually get more quality and freshness for it. It's a great place to come for date night, a casual weeknight meal, or a family dinner.
