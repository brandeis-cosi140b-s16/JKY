Best Mexican Food in Vegas! I'm in love with their salsas :D I always order the Alambre Tacos every time I visit (which is once a month) and I am never disappointed.  The only complaint that I have is the service. The servers are terribly slow and uncaring. You have to try their watermelon margarita! T&T Please come to LA!!!
