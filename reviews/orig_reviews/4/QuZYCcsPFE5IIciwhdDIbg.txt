Woooo Hoooooo HOT!  If you are a fan of New Mexico style heat this is the place for you.  Be careful when you dive into the dipping sauces they offer with the chips, looks can be deceiving.  My missing star is due to the fact that I think it would be nice for the servers to give you a heads up on the heat, especially when there are kids at the table.

I have the fajitas when we go and my honey has the chicken enchiladas.  We've yet to be disappointed.  At the end of your meal they bring you warm sopappillas! (sp) that are a perfect finish.  I'd recommend trying Si Senor's if your in the Chandler area.
