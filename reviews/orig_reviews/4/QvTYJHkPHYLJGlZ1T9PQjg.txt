I've been to YOLOS many times and while I can always be assured that the roasted vegetable fajitas will be delicious, the quality of service is a hit or miss. Usually it is leaning on the bad side, though. 

Their fresh fruit lemonades are tasty and fresh, as well, but I am always disappointed that I pay $4 for only a few ounces of the stuff (about 1/3 the size of their sodas), and that there are no free refills! Come on, YOLOS.

I would give 3 stars, but the fajitas are just that damn good...
