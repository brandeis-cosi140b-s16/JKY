Chef Frank Scibelli, chef and co-cowner of Cantina 1511  knows authenticity. 

The ingredients used here are local, fresh, and of the highest caliber. In fact, they come from his very own garden. I love the traditional dishes- the chips are tasty and never-ending and the guacamole is magical. All portions are very generous. Even better, I do not feel guilty about eating at a restaurant that is conscientious of where its food comes from. The red meat is farm raised (/grazed) and there is even a gluten-free menu. 

Frank Scibelli really cares about executing authentic cuisine to people who care about more than fine dining, but also consumption.  (Scibelli also owns and is chef at Mama Ricotta's).

Dinner with drinks may run about thirty+ a head.  I have eaten on the patio and found the dining area to be a little darker than I'd like, but the music was nice. .

I avoid the Cantina on the weekends as parking is can be pain when the restaurant is busy. They offer free valet.
