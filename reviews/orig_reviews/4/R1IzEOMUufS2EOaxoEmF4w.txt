Oh, Juan's, you taunt me with your scrumptious #28 (cheese enchilada and chili relleno).  The beau and I recently discovered this place, way too close to our home, and we now need to eat their two or three times a week.  Really good chips and a fresh, simple and bright-flavored salsa.  Packed at lunch time but they still have super fast service.
