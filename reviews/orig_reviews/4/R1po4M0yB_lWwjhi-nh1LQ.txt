Love this place!

Definitely easy to pass by with out giving a second thought...don't do that!

Prices were great! Check their website before u go, they have kids eat free, 1/2 off desserts, and half of beers days.

love that you get free chips ad salsa (although the salsa is a bit thin)

prices were awesome and portion sizes are great!
