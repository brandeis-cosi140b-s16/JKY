MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS (opentable)

Once you're in, the food is great. We had the top shelf margarita, with the side of grand marnier.  Get the table side guacamole to order.   We had the dinner specials which were great. 

Have had a lot of Mexican in my travels and this rates near the top.
