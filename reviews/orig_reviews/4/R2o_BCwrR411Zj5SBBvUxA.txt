While staying in this hotel, we tried many of the restaurants here.  I love mexican food so I was very excited to eat here.  Reme was our server, he was very friendly and personable, the salsa and chips good, I like a bit more spicey-ness so I added habanero for a kick, and it made the salsa perfect! I ordered a taco with ground beef and when they brought me one with steak in it, they were very willing to bring back what I ordered made the right way, and they were very quick about it. Very reasonably priced for the strip, and I would come here again.
