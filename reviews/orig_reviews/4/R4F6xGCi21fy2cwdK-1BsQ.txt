Why do I always feel bloated when I leave...I must always eat way too much.  La Tolteca is very good, authentic Phoenix-style Mexican Food.  The corn and flour tortillas are great, as is the green tomatillo/avocado sauce.  The meats / fish are tender and marinates are tasty.  The portions are to huge (if there is one item to complain about).  Awesome bakery too...especially the tres' leche cake.
