So I was craving tacos this fine Tuesday and stumbled upon America's (thanks to Yelp!). I sold my boyfriend on the idea of their Tuesday special of four tacos for $6.95 so we headed over and devoured our meal! 

We did two chicken and two al pastor tacos. 
The chicken is awesome because it's perfectly topped with their guacamole. The al pastor on the other hand, brings a fun flavor profile to the taco with the addition of pineapple. We also ordered America's Corn which is Mexican style corn on the cob and it was fresh, hot, and addicting!

My boyfriend ordered the horchata and described it as delicious, an extra kick of cinnamon and not too thick, the perfect consistency. I got to take a sip and couldn't agree more.

Lastly, the staff was super friendly! Decent prices and super casual restaurant.
