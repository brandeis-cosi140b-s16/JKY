Lunch time, went in and got the shredded beef burrito which was actually pretty good. I got the combo so it came with rice and beans which were yummy as well.

 The place is nice, kind of small so I'm sure it gets packed sometimes. I liked the bathroom layout for some odd reason. You don't see that in many reviews haha. 

Ps I got the strawberry lemonade and it was really good, nice and sweet. Shortly after did I notice that it was happy hour and margs were $5
