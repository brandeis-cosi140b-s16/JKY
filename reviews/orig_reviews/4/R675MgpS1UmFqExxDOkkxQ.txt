Hit this place up for lunch after the southpoint was booked up, was glad we did!

Had the fajita salad and it was flipping amazing, the home made salad dressing really made it pop! Only down side it's its spendy for what is it, wanted the fajitas but didn't want to drop 20 bucks on a lunch meal. But I was happy with my selection! We also got the pulled pork and garlic frys, very tasty.

Only thing I though was strange was it's the first time I have been to a Mexican spot and they didn't give you chips and salsa. I recommend you order them they are pretty good!
