Maize was one of my go-to lunch places when I lived in Chambana. I'm from New York, so I'm not exactly an expert on Mexican food, but everything I ever got at Maize was excellent--chalupas, gorditas, tacos, and burritos. (The chalupas especially... maybe I should fly back to Champaign for the weekend...) The people working were friendly and the service was prompt. Maize is, food-wise, one of the best places to eat in Champaign-Urbana.

The only downside of this place is its tininess. There's room inside for about a dozen people sitting elbow to elbow. I always got takeout, and even standing around waiting for my order I always felt like I was in someone's way. The parking lot is proportionately small too, with only four or five spots, so you may not even be able to park at Maize to get takeout. (Fortunately it's within easy walking distance of campus, and the Green bus line goes right by so you might not have to drive.) If this restaurant were to expand and keep the same menu it would be fantastic.
