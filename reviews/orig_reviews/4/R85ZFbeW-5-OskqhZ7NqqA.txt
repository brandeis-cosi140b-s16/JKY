All I can say is WOW!, went there to get a break from the normal hospital food thats 3/4 of a mile south. 

Has the tortilla soup, and loved it, though i think they may have been running low because our bowl was 1/2 full and when other family went a few days later they said their bowls where 3/4 full.

Guacamole was great, and there was plenty for 5 people to share in the order. 

tryed a carne asada taco and it was great, I gotta go back to get more soon.

the desserts where awesome, the thres leche cake with coconut icecream and pineapple was great, the also had a lime tart, which was basically keylime pie, but not so thick. it was great as well.

deffinatly gonna go back and try a few other things on the menu.
