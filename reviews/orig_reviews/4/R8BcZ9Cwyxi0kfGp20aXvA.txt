On short family reunion to the Verde Valley and Phoenix, ate here. I had chilaquiles, my wife and brother-in-law had tortas, and his wife had fish tacos. Service good but the staff person was so busy she did not connect terribly well. We were the oldest folks there, all in our 70's and the millennial crowd was hooping it up...so not a good place for a quiet supper.
