Being a San Diego native and growing up on a steady diet of Mexican fare, the burrito bar has been set pretty high for me. Add to that the fact that I'm vegetarian, and therefore, by definition picky and hard to please, and you've got yourself a serious burrito snob. Moving to Vegas was akin to moving to hell (and not just because of the similar temperatures) - the absolute void of decent taquerias was truly disheartening. I've since found a few reliable places, and recently decided to try Cilantro Tacos after discovering, to my delight, that my prayers had been answered, and a Mexican restaurant that DELIVERS had moved in nearby. I tried to order my usual: a beans, cheese, rice, & french fry burrito, in So Cal style, but they felt it would be to tricky to work some of those fries into the mix, so I settled for just a bean, cheese, & rice burrito. I was pleased to find that their food had good flavor, their salsas were tasty, and the tortillas and chips were pretty decent quality. Nothing to write home about, but still a solid, pleasant Mexican meal that certainly satisfied the burrito craving. Had they just added those french fries, they would have replaced the Roberto's down the street as my best friend forever! That minor disappointment won't keep me from coming back, however... nothing beats Mexican food being delivered to your door when you're a few drinks in & don't want to leave the house. Just stick to the menu, and leave the special orders for somewhere that will try just a little bit harder to please.
