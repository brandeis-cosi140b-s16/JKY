I've died and gone to the hacienda in the sky! Are you kidding me?!! Fluffy, meringue like salt ion top a fresh lime margarita. Just try and remove me from this bar stool! 

Between the barbacoa taco, chorizo with my fondido, chipotle salsa and now the Salt Air Margs, I need to eat here daily!  The chips the best, I hear they make em too. I'm watching the lady make those fab corn torts this place may be in Vegas but I feel like I'm in the Yucatan.  

I love the Cosmo hotel my go to stay when in Vegas now I think I'll stay more often.
