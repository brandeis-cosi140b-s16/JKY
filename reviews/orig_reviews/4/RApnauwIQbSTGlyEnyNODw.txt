Margaritas at the bar were great, And only 3$ at happy hour! They also bring you chips with salsa beans and guacamole for FREE which is awesome! We then went into the restaurant for dinner, it was pretty good, I had the chicken enchiladas, and my bf had tacos. Both tasted good, my only concerns was that after we ordered, we font out food like 2 minutes later, which led me to believe that the food isn't super fresh, still tasted pretty good though.
