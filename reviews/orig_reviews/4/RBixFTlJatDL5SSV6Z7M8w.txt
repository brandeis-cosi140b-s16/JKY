First time in I noticed it was extremely hot near the order window, but hey the food smelt good! I tried the Soyrizo Burrito. It was a damn good burrito. The guacamole was on point, though the burrito was a little expensive in my opinion. Their meat portions are well worth it from what I saw. Ordering in English wont get you very far, but this is an authentic place, so I expected some language barriers. (I just pointed to everything). Not the classiest place, but worth it if you're looking for an authentic Mexican meal. Oh, and their salsa bar is awesome! Many additions to choose from! Totally worth a try.
