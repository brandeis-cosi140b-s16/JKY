LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere in this place!  It's got a super funky retro vibe with vintage decor and what seemed like it could have been the James Brown Pandora station.  We only had drinks at the bar but the cucumber cocktail was perfectly balanced, refreshing and slightly spicy- a must have!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am sick of places that try to fancy up Mexican food, I usually end up wishing I would have just gone to a taco shop.  I will definitely go there on my next trip to Phoenix and I will at least try the food so I can give it a fair assessment.
