This place was delicious! I heard good reviews so I had to try it out. I got a regular cheeseburger and the chencho fries. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The chencho fries were pretty good as well, however, I felt like something was missing. BUT it was still very good. Employees are super nice and I will be returning!
