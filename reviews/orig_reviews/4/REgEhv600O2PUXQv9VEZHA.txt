We ended up here about twice in just as many days, because there was almost too much to try in one sitting.  They've got a couple open kitchen stations - one for some of the Mexican items and another with a huge steamer for the Chinese dumplings, plus an area for making noodles.  I have to say that at the rather odd hours we were in, we didn't see much more than a few egg rolls being wrapped, however.

They have a fairly large cocktail menu with some interesting, though confusing things, and notably have a couple Chinese beers by the bottle that I had not seen before.

We tried a couple tacos - Silencio, with duck tongue and lychee, was quite good, the duck tongue being very approachable.  Viva China, with tendon and oyster, was similarly unthreatening.  In general, though the flavors were good and the textures were decent, these tacos put so many different components together that they often got lost in each other.

Lamb Potstickers were good, and reasonably, but again not emphatically, lamby.

Huitlacoche Noodles were a little disappointing.  The noodles had a nice texture, but we had a hard time detecting much huitlacoche flavor.

The braised pork sandwich ( Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich ) was awesome, but about two bites.

We came back specifically to try the Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice.  Expensive at $17.88, it is possible that they did in fact include 20 vegetables, cut into very small cubes, somewhere within the rather small portion.  But in the end it was just that:  fried rice.

We were hoping to see a lot more fusion on the menu, but most dishes were segregated onto one side or the other.  We enjoyed both our experiences - the servers were accommodating, though very casual, and there was a lot to look at in the space, from the cooking going on to the walls of offbeat art.  Overall, and keeping in mind that this is in a fancy hotel casino in the middle of the desert, the food is remarkably good for the location.
