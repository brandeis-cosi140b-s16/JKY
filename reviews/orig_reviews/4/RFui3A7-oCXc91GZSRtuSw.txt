Update:The owner called and took care of the issue. Great resolution and he was apologetic.  I am thankful for the quick follow up. Juan took charge and I am satisfied with the outcome.

Check your credit card statement with your receipt!  I went there for the first time a few days ago and gave a generous tip of 30 percent. I checked my credit card statement and noticed the restaurant charged an extra $22 in addition to my bill plus tip! I called three times and explained what happened. I was told the owner was the only one who can help me out so I left 3 messages. I was told the owner would call today but when I waited all day and didn't receive a call, I called again and was told the owner left for the day. I got the impression this isn't the first time this has happened.  It's not about the money, it's about the principal and service. A few dollars added to a handful of tabs each month can make for a nice bonus.
