Yummm!!!  This is the best place in town to go for burritos as big as your face.  The food here is pretty basic, so don't expect any crazy combinations, but the veggie burrito is the best in town (fresh sauteed portabellos, zucchini, onions, and peppers) and the quesadillas are awesome.  Very busy during lunch, but it usually isn't too difficult to get a seat.
