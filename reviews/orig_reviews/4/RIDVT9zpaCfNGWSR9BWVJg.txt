Had the jade red chicken and emerald chicken in a quesadilla with beans and rice.  Tasty and very filling. They are generous with portions. A very filling meal w/drink for under $10. 

The food did not blow me away, but its good and the service is very friendly and efficient. As soon as I walked in, the guy at the counter asked if it was my first time and since it was, he offered me samples of everything on the menu and walked me through recommendations and how to order. 

4 stars for the great service and unique take on Chinese/Jamaican/Mexican fusion.
