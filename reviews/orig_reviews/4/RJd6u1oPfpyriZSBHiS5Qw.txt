We went there for a Sunday brunch.  Atmosphere was wonderful.  Service was very good.  You could talk among yourselves easily without interference from the music.  The food was so good.  I hope I can go again before it  is time to return home.  I will tell you it is a restaurant you want to go to if you are in Scottsdale.  Do not miss out on the great food.
