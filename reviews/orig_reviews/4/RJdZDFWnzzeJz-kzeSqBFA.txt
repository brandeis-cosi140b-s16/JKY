Great Mexican-Southwest soul food! 4/5

This restaurant is just right next to our house. Per J's colleague's recommendation, we checked out this place right after we moved in to our Jenan's house a year ago. The atmosphere is great with great food. All Blue Adobe's dishes come in BIG portion. I would recommend sharing there. Anything we tried there was good.
