Since my sister lives in the LV, I've been able to hit this off-the-strip, real deal Mexican spot a couple of times when visiting her. It's refreshing to eat at a Mexican restaurant that is not upscale, without gimmicks, and has tasty margaritas. They also have an extensive menu with all kinds of yummy-sounding options, although their veggie selection is pretty thin. For an appetizer, try to the nopalitos--grilled cactus with onions that you wrap up in their homemade tortillas--delicious! Plus nopalitos is so fun to say. Nopalitos! My enchiladas verdes were very satisfying, though not the best I've ever had. Still, I will make it a point to eat at Lindo Michoacan next time I visit Vegas, especially on that last day when being on the strip for another moment might make me choke the 200th girl I see with a tiny waist and balloon-like double D's.
