My first time at Frijoles, I ordered three mini tacos so that I could sample the carne asada, pollo and al pastor. Of the three, the al pastor was divine with onion, cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime. I went back and ordered the al pastor burrito style and was a bit disappointed that the accoutrements kinda took away from the flavor of al pastor. Love the different types of fruit drinks. The staff is super friendly and will let you sample anything. The place seems to have a tremendous following.
