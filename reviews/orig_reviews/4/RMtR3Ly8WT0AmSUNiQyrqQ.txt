The Three Amigos.  The name conjures up images of Steve Martin,  Chevy Chase, and Martin Short--three clueless unemployed actors in Mexico who have no idea what they've gotten themselves into.  Likewise, I didn't know what to expect once this place had changed hands, but it turns out I like it a lot.   

I'll echo everything that Julia S. has said and add my own 2 cents. 

I fully believe that the food at Three Amigos is actually better than it was at Casa de las Enchiladas.  My friend ordered 3 different kinds of tacos à la carte (beef, pork, and chicken) with a side order of pico de gallo to lovingly tuck them in before devouring them and sending them to Hell.  She loved them.  The meats were savory and seasoned well, and they came wrapped in aromatic corn flour tortillas.  The pico was spicy, fresh, and the cilantro and lime juice were popping--better than before.  

I enjoyed a very nice order of pollo en mole with rice and beans and washed it down with a bottle of coca-cola made in Mexico.  Yep--sweetened with good ol' sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.  (google Dr. Mercola if you want to learn what HFCS can do to you.)  Thanks to Chad E for the mole recommendation.         

I didn't try the bar, but I'm thinking the next time I'm in there I'd like to wash the food down with a Corona.    

We have no complaints except for the dueling juke box and stereo system.  That was a little disconcerting.  

I hope you'll visit this place (AND see the movie).  Three Amigos has two more amigos as of today.  

I'll leave you with this quote: "Hey!  He's using real bullets!"
