The decor here is very "interesting". I would say it could be classified as Hollywood Mexican meet kitsch. But who really cares about that what is important is that the food is solid. I had shrimp  fajitas and they were delicious. I also drank the Jamaica , which is hibiscus tea, and it was really tasty. I can't really say anything bad about this place and I don't think that the two colleagues visiting with me could either unless you're offended by kitschy decor. Do understand that this is not a high-end surf and turf type of fish restaurant, it is a fairly authentic Mexican seafood place
