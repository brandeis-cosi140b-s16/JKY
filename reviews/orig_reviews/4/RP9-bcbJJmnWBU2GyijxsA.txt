I've attended this place 3 times during my 6 day trip. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick place to eat and get cheap shots of tequila (jose cuervo). $2 tacos, margaritas and shots, cannot beat that deal, especially if you are in Vegas. 1 taco will not fill you so order atleast four. Waitors are friendly and give exceptional service.
