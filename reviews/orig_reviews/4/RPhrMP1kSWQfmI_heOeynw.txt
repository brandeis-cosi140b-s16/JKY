Great but overpriced, maybe for a good reason. I'd say some of the best taco's in Glendale, but they are kinda stingy with salsa to go. Paid $100 for 7 and the kid only offered us 4 salsa's to go. If I wanted more, I had to pay extra. At least 2-3 per person, jeeze (Trust me, they are tiny) Would have given you guys 5 stars if you weren't so stingy. 

Also, bring back the strawberry spicy salsa, why remove your best?
