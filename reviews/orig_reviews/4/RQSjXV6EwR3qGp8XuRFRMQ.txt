I went here with about 8 girlfriends for a bachelorette party kick-off. We made reservations for 9:30pm but were not sat until about 10-:15pm. That was a little tedious but the wonderful service and food made up for the late start. 

The football game I didn't want to miss was luckily displayed on one of their giant flatscreen HD TV's. I would definitely want to head back there to watch other sporting events in the future. The music was rather loud but as expected for a Saturday night at a happening spot. I don't know if their music is always that loud. 

Once we were sat, our server was very attentive and fun. I wish I remembered his name! My roommate and I ordered the Sake Sangria and Passionfruit Sangria to sip on. Both sangrias were incredible!! We couldn't decide which one we liked more.

To start our meal, we shared the Crispy Pork Belly Roll. My roommate and I are huge fans of pork belly and this roll did not disappoint. Not only do we love pork belly, we love brussel sprouts, and this roll perfectly combined both things. I could have eaten a whole plate of those rolls! 

Like I said, we love pork belly, so for our main dish we ordered the Pork Belly Ramen. It was equally as awesome as the roll. I would recommend it!

Unfortunately my roommate is very allergic to avocados...I know it breaks my heart too...so we were unable to order a lot of things off their menu since we were splitting. However, you better believe that means I'm going back and ordering everything with avocado at some point. However, I notified our server of her allergy and they made sure not to make her food where avocado had touched. So we had a successful evening without having to take out her epi-pen. They were very accommodating!

Can't wait to go back and try more food! I love their concept.
