Went here lastnight with family and really like the place.  Atmosphere is awesome and there is so much to look at!  That said the service was as expected, fast, and they clear the tables as you clear your plates!! WOW, what a novel idea!!  I thought that was very customer focused.  The food was delish!  I had the fish tacos, shrimp and salmon with the fruit salsas and OMG!!  I wanted more even though I was full!! The chips and salsa are even more addicting here, something about the crunch, and the salsas were not too spicy and actually a little sweet!  THE FLAN WAS FANTASTIC!!  I highly highly recommend for awesome Mexican food, perhaps the best Mexican food I have had in my 10 years living in AZ!!
