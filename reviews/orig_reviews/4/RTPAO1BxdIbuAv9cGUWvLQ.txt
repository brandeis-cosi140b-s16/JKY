I won't say much as there are enough reviews already to give you a pretty good idea of the place.  One thing I didn't see mentioned too much was that compared to a lot of  mainstream mex restaurants this place generally has  much spicier food and salsa.  So if you don't like your mex food "hot" this may not be the place for you.  It's not overdone hot like a few places but definitely a step up from mainstream.  At least ask when you order how hot the particular dish might be.  Their salsa is way hotter than most places.  I have taken out of town guests here and it's been too hot for several of them.
