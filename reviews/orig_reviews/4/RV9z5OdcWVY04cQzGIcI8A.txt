The food was ok the menu is very simple and the portion size was a bit small. I can say that If u just moved here from Hawaii and is craving local food then don't come here because there's really nothing local about it. I got the seaweed rice kalua pork n cabbage thinking it would be like home but it wasn't. Usually it's mouth melting with steamed cabbage and moist rice but I got hard seaweed rice, kalua pork which was a little dry and raw cabbage. There's nothing worse then eating kalua pork with raw cabbage and your a local. Its a good "mainland" restaurant but I wouldn't say it would truly satisfy a true local. I honestly went here because I thought I'd get local food but it kind of missed its target.
