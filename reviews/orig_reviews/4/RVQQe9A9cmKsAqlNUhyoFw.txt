Recently started to come to this place with a few girlfriends of mine & we love it! We knew we would love it once we took one taste of the bean dip! Happy Hour keeps us coming back for more! You can't beat The beef mini chimis. They are to die for! Along with the 1.99 House Margarita was the PERFECT match! For it being their well tequila, it was awesome! (Thank you to the bartender Logan!) 
Not to mention their service, we are pleased every time!
