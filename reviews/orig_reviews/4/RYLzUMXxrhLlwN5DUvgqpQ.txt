My friend took me here for lunch.  I had read about the salsa bar and so was looking forward to trying as many salsas as possible.

The server let us try 3 of the taco fillings before we chose.  We then had the chicken, the pork, the Gaucho and the shrimp and shared them - all were very good.

We tried all the hot salsas (no strawberry for us!) and they were decent (not Mrs. Renfro's Ghost Pepper Salsa hot, but decent enough).

The prices were very reasonable and I would for sure go back if I was in Phoenix again.
