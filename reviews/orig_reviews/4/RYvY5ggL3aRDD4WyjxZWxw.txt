Lest  it be said that I write only disparaging reviews,  let me avow my deep admiration (love is too strong a superlative in this instance,)  for America's Taco Shop.  The home-cooked beans (runny -style) are quite palatable.  The bean buritto is a safe choice for the distaff members  of our species (provided, of course, such can politely control bowel turbulence).  And please opt for the street-vendor style corn on the cob.  There is nothing like a mayo-covered, cojita sprinkled , piece of mid-western genetically altered  superbness.  For those carrying higher levels of testastrone, opt for the Pastor (pig stuck-on-a-vertical spit) or Carne Asada (very loosely translated: "meat" burritto:"   You better order six,  they are very small.   Wash it all down with a make-believe Corona (I can't believe you shot me with a fresh lime squirt just because I happened to be glancing in the general direction of that woman's glutes) because the liquor license here is in a perpetual state of "in-process."  Enjoy.
