Not much parking and I hear there's always a wait. Never had a wait for a Mexican spot before. That's a by product of a small place and solid foot. Had the chicken and cactus. Definitely would get it again. Salsa and beans weren't bad. The chips werent my fav. Live music and traditional atmosphere. May come again if I'm in the area.
