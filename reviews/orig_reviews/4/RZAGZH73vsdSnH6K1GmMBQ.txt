I'm giving this 4 stars because the overall atmosphere and outdoor patio are what make this restaurant great. The food, however, is not great. If you're looking for good Mexican cuisine, this is not your place. If you're looking for somewhere with a good atmosphere to go have drinks and chips with friends, then it is.
