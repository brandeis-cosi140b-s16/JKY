This was a great find! We enjoyed the homemade horchata which was bursting with flavors like cinnamon, nutmeg, fruit and nuts.  Equally as delish was the guacamole. This is not your typical guacamole. It was more chopped than mashed and had dried cranberries in it. Very tasty. I had the cabo tacos and the beer batter was too thick for my liking, but my fianc√© ordered a chicken taco and it was much better. When I come back again, I will try non-beer battered tacos!
