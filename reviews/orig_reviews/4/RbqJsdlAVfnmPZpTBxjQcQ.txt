Amazing quality for the price! I ordered some ground beef tacos and the ingredients were so fresh that I actually felt really good after eating them! The meat was not greasy or overly seasoned. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and had the same opinion. You can eat GOOD Mexican food here for a cheap price.
