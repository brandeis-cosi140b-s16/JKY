Great happy hour from 4-7 featuring $2 domestics and .99Â¢ tacos, but nothing on the menu over $6.99 so go whenever.

If you've never tried a potato taco I highly recommend getting a few. Crispy and creamy at the same time some how.

They've got about 50 different hot sauces from Tapatio to Red Rooster and free wifi.
