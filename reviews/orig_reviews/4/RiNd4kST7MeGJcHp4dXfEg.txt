Surprisingly good. Very good actually! I ordered the bulgogi tacos just to taste it. The tacos were excellent. Also ordered the bulgogi fries, the bugolgi fries were tasty but I could've done without the jalape√±os. And I requested a side order of Kim Chee which was laughable due to the portion size. I will return. All in all, very good!
