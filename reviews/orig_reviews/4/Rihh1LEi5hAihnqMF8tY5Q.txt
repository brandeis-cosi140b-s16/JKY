Pedro's is one of my favorite place to go every time I'm craving for Mexican food.  I love their hot chunky salsa and chips.  My favorite menu item is # 1.  The plate is hot and huge it came out with a Red (meat) Tamale or Green (no meat) your choice and cheese enchilada and a taco (chicken or beef) and rice and beans!  Food is so delicious here I always lick my plate clean every time I come here!
