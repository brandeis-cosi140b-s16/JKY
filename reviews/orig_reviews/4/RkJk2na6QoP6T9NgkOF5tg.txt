My first time here was actually kind of ironic. We went there last night to see a band, Mason, and thought we'd grab dinner before hand since it is a Mexican restaurant. I've been on this carne asada taco kick lately, disappointedly making my way around central Phoenix looking for some good ones. I had no idea I'd find them at Padre's. What a surprise.

The place was jammed packed, literally, and I couldn't see any tacos in my future when we first got there. We ended up scooting in on a table with friends and the wait staff happily served us. I think they gave up on the whole wait for a table protocol. Everyone was there to see the band. Anyway, my tacos came right away and they were great. We had both the carne asada and the shrimp tacos. Yum!

I can't wait to go back to this place when it's not jammed packed to try out the rest of menu. I see a Taco Tuesday in my future.
