Pink Taco features fresh Mexican flavors with California influences. The Dia de Los muertos-inspired and kitschy decor makes for a fun and convivial atmosphere. Glowing tequila bottles, hand-painted skull murals, Mexican folk art, vintage low-rider bikes and hanging star lamps are just a few of the eclectic design accents at Pink Taco. There's a nice selection of margaritas, mojitos and speciality cocktails, which you can order by the glass or pitcher. 

We ordered the namesake pink tacos, shrimp tacos, fried ice cream dessert and some mint mojitos. The standouts were the fried ice cream and the pink tacos. One of our servers claimed the fried ice cream was one of the best fried ice creams out there. She was right--it definitely something memorable. A large scoop of vanilla ice cream cloaked with crushed Frosted Flakes and then deep fried to a golden brown finish. It is then drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces and laid in a fried tortilla shell. The pink tacos are a fun selection. These pink-hued handmade tortillas are stuffed with grilled chicken, pickled pink onions, black beans, salsa and fresh avocado slices. The perfect Rehab diet food. I wasn't too keen on the side of rice. I love fresh and fluffy Spanish rice and there's tasted like something straight from a box. All and all, a solid plate. 

In the warmer months you can relax on their outdoor patio, which looks out onto the famous Hard Rock pool. 

Pink Taco is a fun Vegas hotspot. Come for the creative drinks, funky decor and plenty of eye candy.
