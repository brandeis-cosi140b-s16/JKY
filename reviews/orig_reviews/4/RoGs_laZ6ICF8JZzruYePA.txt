The food was great as usual. Of course, the drinks are always great! A bit disappointed, I had to sit at the bar, the hostess said when a booth became available she would move me to it.  Four booths became available in the hour and a half that I was there. The hostess never did move me. She always sat the next customer that arrived at the booths. If there is a next time, I'd rather wait for booth instead of waiting at the bar.
