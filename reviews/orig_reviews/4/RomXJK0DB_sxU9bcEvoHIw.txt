went with a friend last night - short wait for a booth in the bar so we could watch baseball playoffs.  we both ordered machaca chimichangas and they were excellent.
Tender tasty beef, good flavor refritos, good guacamole, excellent service, The chips were fresh, homemade, and served with a very good salsa; and we got a second bowl as soon as we asked.  TS had several margaritas and said they were excellent, I had straight Herradura Reposado.
I just don't get the Haters on this place - I've been eating here since the early 1980's and the food is always good - some dishes are better than others; some nights are better than others.  That's life in the Big City
This is just a neighborhood family restaurant; if you;re looking for artsy decorations, and mouthy iPhone tramps, and hipsters with ironic facial hair, go somewhere else and leave us regulars in peace in our Homie Heaven that's been serving up good Sonoran food for 55 years in the same place from the same family..
