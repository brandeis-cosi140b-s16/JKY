This is one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever had the pleasure to dine in. I had the camerones sarandeados estilo and it was extraordinary. The staff in cluding Carolina was friendly and knowledgeable and when they saw me whip out my video she gave me a guided tour. It was a Friday night and they had this great Mariachi Band and they were fabulous, even stopping at my table to serenade our group with some Tijuana Brass music. I decided to have their signature dessert, fried ice cream. Instead I got this wonderful flambe ball of crushed nuts surrounding delicious vanilla ice cream swathed in caramel. I am soooo satisfied. If you get to this place you won't be disappointed, but get there early because they pack up after 7. I'm still licking my fingers. Oh! Did I mention the two moms in the taquiera? They were making fresh tortillas for everyone all evening and smiling as they did it?
