When we moved to North Phoenix from Scottsdale we missed some of the restaraunts that had been close to home. We were told great things about Valle Luna, so we checked it out. 

The one problem I have is that they are packed to the gills during dinner time, from 6pm to 9pm you're going to have at least a 20 minute wait to get a seat. That's if you can find a parking spot in their very small parking lot. We often have to leave the car on the street, which is something we're not comfortable with. 

It's worth the wait. The service is excellent. The food is great. They had a lot to live up to, there are some amazing Mexican Food Restaraunts in Scottsdale, and they managed to hold their own. We always go to Valle Luna when we're in the mood for a sit down Mexican dinner, and will continue to do so as long as they're still there.
