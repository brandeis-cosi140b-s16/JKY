We have had 3 meals here- twice for brunch and finally, last Sat. for dinner. The atmosphere is fun and funky as other reviewers have noted. It was a great place to bring a couple with us who generally won't venture out of their neighborhood. The brunch menu is good and I had the Pozole both times. DIVINE, and with a nice added twist with the littleneck clams. Nice spice with the serranos and overall a great dish. I almost forgot, we started with the shrimp and avocado creme ceviche. Everyone at the table loved it . Hubby ordered Barbacoa and loved it. My friend had the fish tacos. I had the carne asada tacos. Succulent and just the right size.
