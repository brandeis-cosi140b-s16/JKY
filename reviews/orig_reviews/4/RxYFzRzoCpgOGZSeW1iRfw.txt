Well this is probably one of the cutest restaurants I've tried decor-wise! Lots of outdoor seating, which is perfect for nice days. A little dessert bar area when you first walk in which was very tempting. Wasn't expecting to see a freezer stocked with Choco Tacos here! Loved the vibe of the restaurant too, and the big lit up signs and such. That made this place different and memorable. 

Service was good, no complaints. We ordered chips and salsa to start, was at first disappointed they were not complimentary, but the prices here are not bad at all here so no big deal! They tasted very good, and I really enjoyed the extra sauces they brought out. My favorite was the creamy green one, I'm guessing an avocado cream? I was torn between plantain tacos or the brussel sprout nachos. Was a tough decision but remembering the yelp pics, I had to go for the nachos. They were a bit sweeter than expected, and not something I could eat every day, but I did like them. The egg on top was a nice touch. Also the portion was huge! Usually I can finish off a meal no matter how massive it is, but I only had like half of this and was stuffed. My sister got the skirt steak taco and really enjoyed it. She said she would recommend it. When I come back I would like to give the plantain tacos a try. Also the cocktail list was incredibly tempting, but drinking at 12 pm is a little too early for me haha. I saw someone get a toasted coconut margarita served in an actual coconut and thought it was awesome. Also saw someone else get a drink with a flower in it, adorable.

Parking was a nightmare I almost hit the gate in that tiny lot haha, but its Downtown Scottsdale, so that is expected! Would love to come back for a happy hour and overall I was pleased with Diego Pops.
