It's sad when you wait so long to try a place and then finally realize what you've been missing ... and what I've been missing were some seriously good tacos. 

Like I needed another excuse to eat tacos.

Every taco I've tried has been better than the last, except for one. The al pastor was a huge disappointment. It is a sad day when marinated pork isn't good. Luckily, you can mix & match your tacos, so I was still left with the costillo. 

The costillo, on the other hand, was so good that I forgot all about the pastor. Seriously, four stars for that redemption alone. It was the Hail Marry of tacos. How do you make a taco that good and make one as disappointing as the pastor? It's crazy, I tell you.
