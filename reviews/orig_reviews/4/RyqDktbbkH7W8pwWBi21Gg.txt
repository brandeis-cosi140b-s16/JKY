What a cool place to enjoy a few drinks and tacos on a night you just need to unwind and relax. I saw Melissa Y. check in here and I've always passed it while driving on Paradise so I thought hey why not give them a try. I can certainly say this is a young hipster-y vive of a Mexican joint. Can't exactly say the ambiance nor the food is your Abuela's authentic Mexican cooking, but a bit more Americanized and modern. I ordered the Baja fish taco, veggie taco with chips and salsa on the side. I enjoyed both tacos they were both pretty stuffed. The guac was a bit more "whipped" than I prefer, but once again this a modern fix on the tacos. This was all I ordered and it came out to $9 and some change. I was pretty full, so I did get my money's worth. I didn't order any drinks, but plan on doing so the next time I come. I sat at the bar and the bartender was okay for the most part but was just kind of whatever. I can't wait to come back here with friends to enjoy our selves.
