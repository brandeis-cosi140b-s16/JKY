Best fish tacos I've ever eaten!!!!! They don't need to be modified in any way at all. The slaw is crunchy, the fish is perfectly cooked and seasoned and the mango salsa gives it a nice touch of sweet and citrus to round out everything. 

My dining partner said the tacos were small but I felt like two tacos were plenty for lunch. A little pricey but I get it, they are paying trendy south end rents which have gone up b/c of the blue which they sit right on. 

The only fail I identified at Phat B were the tortilla chips. They were actually Tostitos in a bag. A place like this should at least man-Joan's make their own chips. how Hard is that? Especially if you are serving queso that was pretty good.
