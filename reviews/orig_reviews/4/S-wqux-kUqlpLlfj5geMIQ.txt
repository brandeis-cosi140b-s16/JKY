Been here a couple times now and Bakersfield is growing on me. The tacos are good, but small. The queso is different, in a good way. It has a baked crust on top and less sweet, more nutty flavors. You may not enjoy it if you are expecting the typical creamy and sweet queso. The salsas on the table were just alright. I prefer more of a chunky salsa and a bolder salsa verde. 

The atmosphere is warm and and trendy. The service has been great and the margs strong. I wish the menu had some kind of combo plates since the a la carte menu leaves me wanting more. 

The parking is the only thing keeping Bakersfield from being a weekly spot for me. Parking is always painful and frustrating. I get a chuckle every time I see valet for this place as I don't expect or want to valet my car for a ~$15 meal. 

I hope Bakersfield hangs around for a while. Would be great to see them lease out some parking spaces in the adjacent shopping center.
