The place is a staple of Phoenix and must be experienced by everyone at least once. 

The place is a dive in a dirty (not unsafe just dirty) part of of town. The food is great and an interesting mix. Most of the people that go there head there often so feel free to ask the people in line what's good. And there is almost always a line ;)

And in case my review is the only one you have read, you can see the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode from Food Network featuring this place if you do an internet search for it.
