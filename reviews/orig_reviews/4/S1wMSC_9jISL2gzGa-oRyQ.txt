Wow, what a  solid enchilada! It's kind of Chipotle style where you pick your meats and toppings and sauces etc, but way better quality. i went with the braised short rib, took  both red and green sauce and had them top it off with a fried egg. If that's not enchilada porn to you, we can't be friends. all in all, soild food at a great price!
