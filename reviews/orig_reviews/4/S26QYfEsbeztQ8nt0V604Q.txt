The best breakfast burritos! 
Granted, I've never ordered anything else, and it's only one of many items on their menu, but those breakfast burritos ROCK! 
Add condiments/sauces of your choice, and you're starting your day right! 
Very clean, very friendly and VERY inexpensive! 
Try it! You'll like it!
