Love it. Beautiful atmosphere, great customer service and fresh food. A little pricey but worth it for a fun evening out. My only complaint is that they are closed both Sundays and Mondays--seems a little excessive but that's just me. I highly recommend the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. To all my veggies out there, never fear! Their beans are safe for us :) For many years we have been and will continue to be frequent customers.
