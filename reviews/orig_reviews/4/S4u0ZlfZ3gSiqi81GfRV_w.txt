Chips, Salsa, CLUBBING.

Well, not really.  But almost.

We walked past two ladies taking some serious booty pictures by the door as we were walking in.  Yes, they were literally pulling their pants up high (way over the butt makes the best booty pictures?) and posing.  Mmmmhhhmmm.

Walking in the door I was hit in the face with the Manhattan club scene - Sean Paul was blasting and I could barely hear the hostess over the music and the people.  

I'm good with that - I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that play authentic Mexican-style music, but I say there's nothing wrong with a little dance dance music while you taco up the night.

We opted for guacamole to start, which wasn't quite table side - we got a bowl of pre-chopped avocado mix with another bowl of chopped cilantro, onions, and tomatoes that was mixed in by the guy that brought it over.  Table side or not, it was still pretty good.

The thing that stood out to me the most was the salsa - we pretty much drank the stuff.  It was super smooth, and had the perfect mix of cilantro and onions.  It was the closest thing to my favorite salsa ever, handcrafted by La Carreta in Nashua, NH.  So now I can say my two favorite salsas can be found in New Hampshire and North Carolina, two places which fail to share a boarder with Mexico and probably wouldn't pop into your mind if you were asked to "name states that makes the best salsa."  So far - NH, NC.  Boom.  There it is.

For food, we both opted for some type of taco, one with beef and one with chicken.  They came on a not quiet hard shell not quiet soft shell briefly fried taco deal, which was actually pretty good.  It was crunchy but still foldable.

We left full, happy, and after a day's worth of driving causing what might be referred to as mild dehydration (mixed with exhaustion)....a little tipsy (let's call it SUPER relaxed) after the second round of house margaritas, rocks, no salt.
