Some of the best street tacos in Phoenix.There are several factors here including the price. You can pay upwards of $7 for a street taco in Scottsdale that will be overly complicated and not as good as these which 1/3 the price. The carne asada, carnitas and marinated pork tacos are both flavorful and tender, I suggest using some of the green and red sauce they provide to add flavor with a squeeze of lemon. If you haven't ever tried Lengua (cow tongue) this is the place to try it but I prefer the others mentioned above. The homemade tortillas are always soft yet don't fall apart. Love this place for street tacos.
