Gotta give Border a thumbs up for serving good food in relatively short order in spite of a huge crowd.  It is tough to find a combination of healthy and hearty, but several of the salads and tacos fit the bill for me.  They also have several awesome, house made salsas that make everything taste better.  It is also super-cool that you can sit outside after being imprisoned in the hotel/exhibit hall all day.
