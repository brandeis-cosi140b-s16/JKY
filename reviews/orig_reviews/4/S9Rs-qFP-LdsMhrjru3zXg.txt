A friend of mine was staying at the Hilton next door and wanted to meet up for drinks and appetizers.  He suggested this place.  The name sounded cool, so I agreed and we met up on the patio.  After browsing the menu and discussing it with our server, we decided to order:

Chips & Salsa (complimentary)

The Chips & Salsa were average, nothing special.  The Cheese Crisp was pretty good.  The Nachos were very good as well....they heap the toppings on it as you can see in the pictures above.  Of course, I had to try an Enchilada....how could I come to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not have one?!  The Cheese Enchilada I ordered was very good, above average.  Our server was very attentive and made sure our glasses remained full.  

We dined on the patio around happy hour on a Wed evening, so it was full of business people after work.  The vibe was very fun and the weather perfect.
