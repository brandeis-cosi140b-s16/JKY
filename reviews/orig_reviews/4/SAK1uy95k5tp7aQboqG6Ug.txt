I like Cantina, but I wish they'd cut their portions and prices by about 30%. Tonight I had the chicken enchiladas. They were very good and served in a mini cast iron skillet which was a nice touch. I'll be interested to see if they change anything up when they move from their current East Blvd location to Park Road Shopping Center.
