Dang, these other reviews make me wish I'd eaten more....  This was one of our "bitch about work" spots so we pretty much just stuck to drinks, chips & salsa and maybe a Quesadilla here and there.  

But still - I really like the place!  The set up in the bar is awesome, with kinda U shaped high back booths that allow you to squeeze in quite a crowd - and only the folks on the end really see anyone else in the place. Great for a girls night or if you just have obnoxious friends - and don't we all have at least a few?  The bar itself is really cool.  I love the look of it - very cave like.

What I really want to come back for though is their outdoor patio.  Huge area with tables and chairs all around and a great moat/fountain/waterfall out there.  While we all know this was totally man-made of course, it has a great "hanging outdoors" feeling.  Which of course you are outdoors... but.... well....crap.  It's like your "outside" vs. in a parking lot or a cement slab.  You know where I'm going here, right?

Anyhow, it's a good time, if your just hanging out with a frosty beverage or, apparently based on other reviews, to eat.
