Our family was looking for another Mexican restaurant last night and couldn't find it when we stumbled upon Manuels. The place was packed, which is usually a good sign. The hostesses seemed a little confused and disoriented, but after we finally got seated, the service was excellent and the food was fabulous. I grew up in New Mexico and Arizona and I think this restaurant has very authentic southwestern flair mexican food. We will go back.
