We had a group of 3 couples. Two of us had the Deal Chicken coupon, $49 for $117.00. Our coupon gave us the tortilla chips with the salsa and fundido and two margaritas for each person. I thought for sure that after drinking the margaritas I would turn red from drinking all that alcohol. That's because I'm allergic to something in the alcohol whether it be beer, wine or the hard stuff. NOT!! These drinks were watered down.
Average price for their margaritas came to $11.20. Maybe if we paid full price for our meals, it would have been much better.

My wife had the Pollo Margarita, stuffed chicken breast . which was a lot of food for her. She brought half of it home. I ordered the Grilled Salmon which was so GOOD that I cleaned the plate. 

The next order was for dessert which I had the Flan and my wife had the Tuxedo cheesecake.

The service was excellent. maybe because the table we were at was reserved for 8:00. Our server. Samantha, was very knowledgeable and personable. She was on top of everything; water glasses were constantly filled and she would make sure all the finished plates were removed.
