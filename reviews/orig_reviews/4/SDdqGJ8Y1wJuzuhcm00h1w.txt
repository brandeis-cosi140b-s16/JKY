To be brief: I am a huge fan of Cho Bandido's.  My family has eating at this restaurant for well over a decade.  The food is always great, and my best advice would be to avoid the long lines during lunch and dinner hours and just eat at the "odd" hours.  

My past few visits this year I have been greeted and served by some really energetic and friendly ladies and gentlemen.  However, my last visit my order was taken by a man named Lien. I have only ever worked in customer service positions myself, and have never come across someone so rude and unprofessional.  

In writing this review I was thinking about giving a 3 star review just for this reason.  But as this is a wonderful place that I have been coming back to for years and years, despite a recent poor experience I still have to give credit where credit is due with 4 stars.
