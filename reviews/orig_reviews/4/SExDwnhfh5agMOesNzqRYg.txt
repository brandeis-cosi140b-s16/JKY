Can we say...I love myself some fish tacos?!
I have been to this place several times when I was a vegetarian ...and still loved it. I have taken a new wonderful liking since started eating fish! My favorite is the Blackened Mahi Fish tacos. As a side, I used to get the jalepeno/cheese mashed potates...yum! Well, they just changed the options and added the avacado pasta salad...WOW...that's the best pasta salad I've ever had...it has a kick to it as well. 
The ambience is nice...California-style Mexican; great to sit on the patio as well as inside. Great for take-out as well.  When it's crowded...see if there are available seats at the bar...
Noda is doing really well lately and Cabo's here to stay!!
