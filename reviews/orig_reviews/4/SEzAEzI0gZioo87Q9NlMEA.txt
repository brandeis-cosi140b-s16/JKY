This is a VERY good mexican restaurant.   I've been meaning to come here for several months, but based on the reviews, I decided to wait when school was out and campustown would be empty.   The parking lot is SMALL.   I mean like, 6 parking spots maybe.... so either get their early or park on the street somewhere and walk on over.   The restaurant is a little hole in the wall ex-diner/donut shop.... seating is super-limited.... again, maybe like 10 seats.... so your best bet is to probably eat in your car or on the curb.   The prices are very reasonable.... you'll fill yourself up easily for $10.   I got three tacos -- al pastor, fish and a rib eye.   They were authentic -- cilantro and onions... corn tortillas.   I could've eaten about 6 of them easily.  The rib eye was good, the al pastor was better and the fish was outstanding!   I got complimentary chips and salsas while I waited. They were good.... but not sure how fresh they were since they were already warming under the heat lamps when I sat down.   

This is a GREAT Mexican restaurant.... but not sure if it's really worth venturing into campustown to MAYBE get a seat AND a parking spot.   You definitely don't want to be lugging around a baby in a baby carrier because they'll just wind up sitting next to you on the floor (limited space) --- I mean, like stretch your arms out to your side and that's probably the size of the dining space width-wise.    Don't even think about bringing a toddler here because again, they won't be able to sit still on the chairs for very long.   But if you're by yourself or with a small party, go for it!

Other than that, there are other alternatives in town that are just as good (ok, no other place has fish tacos like these, but for other mexican fare, there are good alternatives) such as Taco Loco, the taco trucks (the Mas Amigos at Prospect and Bloomington, and whateveritscalled Taco Truck in the Springfield and County Fair Dr  area).
