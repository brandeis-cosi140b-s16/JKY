Beautiful day at Container Park.  Pinches Tacos were very tasty.  Had the shrimp combo plate along with elote.  About the only downside is how they deliver your food.  They give you a stand with a number but they kept having issues finding people at tables.  None the less, the food was worth it and as the line of people backs up during a nice day I'm sure they will do well.
