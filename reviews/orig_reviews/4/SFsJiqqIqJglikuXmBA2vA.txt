This place is walking distance from our house so we go here fairly often. The service is hit or miss, but the food is always delicious. Take out can be a crap shoot of completion. It's hard to tell what's what in the bag and it may or may not all be there so dining in is best. Seating is limited and it gets busy. Worth a try for the money!
