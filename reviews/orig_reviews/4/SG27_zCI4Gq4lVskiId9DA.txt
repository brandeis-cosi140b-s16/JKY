This was quite convenient as we stayed at the encore and it was literally within 5 minutes away. The place is packed on sat night but was quite quiet on friday. I've never had this place in the california area but only heard good things about it.

Definitely not the most healthiest place to eat at but a good price for tasty food. (think the pork fat / oil is used to cook the tacos hence the taste. It was actually a lot smaller than I thought just from looking at the pictures but 4-5 of them filled me out. 

Seems the adobada is most popular. There are multiple lines as well for what you want to order. There are 2 sets of these lines if they are opened. Also it seems if you line up for one you can still order from the line next to you and skip the line (someone can correct me if I am wrong). I just saw people doing it which seemed to be locals.

I'm surprised this place is quite slow though. The wait for adobada took 30 minutes, atleast.

I would still come here again but not much selection for the vegetarian eaters and the veggie options were not that great as I was told. Can try Komol Restaurant for veggie eaters.
