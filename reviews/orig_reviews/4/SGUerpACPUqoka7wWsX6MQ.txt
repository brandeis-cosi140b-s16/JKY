My husband and I decided to give this place a try for lunch. The chips were warm and salty- yum, the trio of salsas weren't bad, they could have been in bigger containers though. On to the menu, which isn't vast but we made do. I ordered the flat iron steak strips: it comes with corn relish, cucumber and tomato with pickle red onion salad, and what seems to be puree black beans. This comes with a pipping hot freshly made tortilla that's huge. It was yummy the meat well seasoned, I order medium well and it was a little pinker than usual but still great. The husband who isn't a steak lover got the carne asada tacos which came with pickled onions, guacamole, and beans with two kinds of rice. All of which he killed in seconds- I take it he liked it. For lunch its kinda pricey our meal came to $60 including tax and tip, which only consisted of two entrees. 
This was a spur of the moment trip that was well worth it.
