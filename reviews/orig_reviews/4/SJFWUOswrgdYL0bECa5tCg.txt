Best Mexican food I've had in Madison by a very, very long shot!  

This is not the sort of place you go for the ambiance.  It's teeny, cramped, and hot, and loudish cheesy music videos were blaring from a television.  But honestly, who the heck cares when you're eating food this good?

Admittedly, my first dining experience (two or three years ago) at Taqueria Guadalajara was sort of meh -- I had the Burrito Mexicano (the one that looks like a Mexican flag!) and it was just okay.  But my second meal was so delicious that I'm thinking that the first must've been an off evening or something (for me or for them).  I had the chicken tacos, and even though it was just seasoned chicken and lettuce in a corn tortilla, it was absolutely delicious.  No dry chicken here, no sir.  My boyfriend got a pork taco (super freaking good -- I'll be getting this when I go back), a tongue taco (also very good but I personally can't get over the whole I'm-eating-something's-tongue thing) and a vegetarian sope which was just fried heaven.  I do wish they had soda from a fountain rather than in cans, but really, a minor complaint.

All that yum for $13.50?  You'd better believe I'll be back.  Soon.  And often.
