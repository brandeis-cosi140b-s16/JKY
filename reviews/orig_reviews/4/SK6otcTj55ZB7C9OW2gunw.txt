Yum.  I haven't had a bad dish here in ten tries, and the chips and salsa are addictive.  What more can you ask for?

Eating there isn't anything special other than the food is piping hot.  The dining area is pretty basic.  I usually get takeout, which survives the five minute drive home just fine.  Winners:

* Mexican pizza, loaded
* Green chili anything
* Chimichangas
* Tacos
* Burritos enchilada-style
