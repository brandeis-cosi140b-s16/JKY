Prices are a little high ($2 for a taco) but it's true authentic Mexican food! I've been craving these ever since my trip to Mexico a while back, and I'm so happy to see this joint come to this side of town!

There are lines for different meats. My mom likes carne asada and my cousin and I love adobada. We decided to try the mulas too because my friend recommended it, even adding the carne asada fries for the hell of it! However, I am going to complain about the price again because for a small carne asada fries, we forked over $5, where you could go to Roberto's 5 minutes away and pay the same price for 2x the size. 

The flavors were so authentic, the service was decent, and even with the long lines, the food was worth the wait. Great place for some late night cravings. Definitely coming back again!
