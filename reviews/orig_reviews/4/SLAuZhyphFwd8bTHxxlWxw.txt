I have been anticipating the opening of this place since a month ago when I heard about it. I was estatic when I heard two of my favorite things were being combined: BURRITOS and SUSHI. It's a very trendy place, but with that being said it's more about the hype than the food. The ingredients, especially the fish is very fresh, but it was the portion size that left me wanting more. I ordered the Redondo because it had yellowtail, and also go the drink and seaweed salad combo. The burrito was good, and the salad was seasoned perfectly. After I finished my food I was like "hmmm I'm still hungry." I considered getting another burrito, but at that point I thought to myself for the price of two burritos, seaweed salad, and a drink I could have went to an all-you-can-eat sushi joint and left stuffed. Overall my experience was good, but another call out is the noise in the place. There is a strong echo in the building and it gets loud to the point that it's somewhat annoying. I don't like having to yell across the table to be able to converse with company.
