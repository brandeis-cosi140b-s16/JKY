Nothing fancy about this neighborhood joint.  After reading the good reviews, decided to give it a try.  We looked over the menu for some time.  The staff asked if it was our first time.  Yes it was and he gave us a few samples to help the decision making.  I liked the taste of their emerald chicken.  It reminded me of a Chinese steamed chicken with tasty sauce.  Hubby ordered Jade chicken and jerk chicken.  He said both were good except the jerk chicken was neither Mexican nor Asian and very spicy.    Extra bonus for the large free Snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookie with the meal. Good value for the $ and they bring your food to the table.
