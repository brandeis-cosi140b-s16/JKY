I had forgotten about this place until recently.  I am obsessed once again.  I love their prices first and foremost.  The quality is nearly as good as a sit down restaurant and is at least 1/3 cheaper.  I love their tacos, beans and tortillas.  The service is pretty quick even when they are busy.  I love that they have an Orange Julius type drink right out of the fountain.  They are just shy of the 5 star mark because I am not a fan of their enchilada sauce  I have tried hard to like it but I just can't.  Some strange flavor to me.  Maybe you will like it.  I also wish they had salsa with chunks of tomatoes, peppers and onions in it.  They have a salsa bar but it is more of a liquid and is dispensed out of a pump.  Not a deal breaker but just something I'd like to see.

This place is great for a quick meal.  Plenty of seating and definitely authentic.  I love this place and can't wait to go back.
