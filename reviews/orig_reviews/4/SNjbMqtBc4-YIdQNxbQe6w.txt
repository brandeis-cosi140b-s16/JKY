I would give it a 3, my husband a 5 so we are compromising with a 4. The meat was tender but not particularly flavorful to me. The various sauces were interesting to try but only one of them appealed to me (3 for my husband). Service was basic, the place was crowded but it was cleaned as quickly as possible with the crowds. I wouldn't go out of my way for it but my husband would.
