Any place with an Habanero Burger served with a glass of cold milk is my sort of place.  Green Chile macaroni and cheese is quite tasty as well.  They also have a modest selection of craft beers on tap.  Menu is printed in/on a newspaper style format which is cute.  

Nice atmosphere with water and little bridges.  Good vibe.
