I eat here 2-3 times a month after visiting the DBG. This is the real deal for Mexican food. Pozole and menudo are very popular. My favorites are chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and the chile relleno.   Rosita's has been family owned for 30+ years. The service has always been friendly and attentive. 

Regarding some of the comments: 1) This is not a fast food restaurant, go to Taco Bell if you want that. 2) This is not a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.
