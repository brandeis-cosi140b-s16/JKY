I've been to almost every Mexican restaurant in Vegas whether it was in a casino, food truck or a stand alone building & this by far is the best Mexican food you'll find here. This was my 1st visit & definitely not my last. The ambiance makes it a great date spot or meeting friends. Our server Alberto was very helpful & attentive. The prices are reasonable for what is offered. The chips & salsa were good. The salsa had flavor & the blend was really good. The chili on the chips added just the right amount of flavor to compliment the salsa. We had:

Mundo margarita- I will say this was very weak. Too much mix & it overpowered the drink. Won't order again but will try another libation next time. 

Mundo chopped salad- absolutely LOVE! This salad is spicy, sweet, crisp & so flavorful. One of the best salads I've had in a long time. A definite must if you come here. You won't be disappointed. 

Chilean Sea Bass- wasn't impressed. Sea bass is a very light fish & the jalapeno cilantro lime marinade was too overpowering for it. The marinade had great flavor & was spicy but if I was blindfolded I wouldn't know I was eating sea bass. It's a great choice if you don't like fish cause you won't know that you're eating fish. Bad choice of you actually like fish & would like to be able to taste it. Won't order again.

Vegetarian chili relleno- Wow! It was amazing! The flavors of the pepper along with the cheese. & black beans was a burst of heaven to the taste buds. It was absolutely amazing. Definitely would order again. 

Coconut tres leches cake with berry compote- the perfect ending to a great meal. It's light & refreshing & the perfect dessert to soothe your mouth after the spicy meal. 

You must try this place if you haven't already! Your tastebuds will thank you!
