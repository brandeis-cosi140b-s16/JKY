Hooray! It re-opened. Shrimp/mango quesadillas are as good as ever, and most impressively, they use real tortillas. The old place didn't serve alcohol, and the new one does, which is a tremendous improvement.

Service was on the slow side, especially given that the place was mostly empty, but the food was worth the wait. I love the fact that you get bean dip, green salsa, AND red salsa with the chips!
