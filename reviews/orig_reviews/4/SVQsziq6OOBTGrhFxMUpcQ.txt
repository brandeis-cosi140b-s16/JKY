Husband and I there last Sunday for late brunch.  Even though it was a very warm day it was crowded and dark inside so we opted for the patio dining. (I do like the "speakeasy" effect of the restaurant decor.) Food choices were not extensive for brunch but we had the guacamole prepared tableside.  It was delicious, very chunky and full of goodies.  We ordered medium; it was a little too hot for me but husband likes the heat!  He had the all you can eat pork tacos and I had the steak tacos.  Sides we ordered poblano grits ( I like any kind of grits but these were excellent, not too hot) and the pureed black beans (nice with slight garlicky flavor).  I had 2 pomegranite margaritas.  The first one went down so nice I couldn't resist.  One of the best of this flavor margarita I've ever had.  Only downside was pesky flies on the patio--they need to address this, but food/drink excellent.
