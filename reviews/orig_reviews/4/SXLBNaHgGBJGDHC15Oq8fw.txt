Been here twice now. Think I have sampled a bit of everything. Tried three different kind of tacos (chicken, beef, and fish), a burro (carne asada), and a quesadilla (ground beef). Everything was really good. 

The quesadilla is quite a bit different then other quesadillas I have had. Much thicker. More like a stuffed gordita. Was really good.

Small place. No wait was I was there, but I can easily see there being one. Salsa bar is fantastic.
