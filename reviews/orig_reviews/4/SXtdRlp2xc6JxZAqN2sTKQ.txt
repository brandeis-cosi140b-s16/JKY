Design your own burrito! In a modest, slightly dingy strip mall sits Sombrero's, a small little eatery serving slow cooked, marinated meats, with your choice of various fillings and tortillas.

I stepped in today to try a tasty burrito. You have your choice of meats such as barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and chicken. Tortilla choices include tomato basil, chipotle, spinach, wheat, and regular flour. They offer fillings such as pinto beans, black beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, roasted corn, onions, cilantro, and salsa. Freshly made guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese can be added for an extra charge. 

I opted for the barbacoa, with tomato basil tortilla, pinto beans, rice, onions, cheese, guacamole, and spicy salsa. The meat was tender and flavorful. The accompanying ingredients meshed well with the barbacoa. The spicy salsa is indeed quite hot, and packs a punch!

I also tried some horchata ($1.99), which was refreshing and creamy.

Service was friendly and cheerful. My burrito was made quickly, and check out at the cashier was easy.

Sombrero's is definitely a good place for a filling meal!
