I'm a fan of this place and it's not solely because of the food. During my last visit I used the the $7 for $10 yelp special and the free chips check in.

For $7 I got two tacos authenticos, a veggie empanada, a side of guacamole, a huge bag of tortilla chips, and about 5 different salsas from the salsa bar. Wow. It was about  2 meals worth of food.

Love that Sabor has a private parking spot not too far from uptown. All food is made to order making it a perfect lunch spot. 

The inside is a little wonky. Not really decorated, an old building, nothing really special. They have $4 mojito specials on Thursday and other weekday specials (see photo).

Now for the food. I was a little disappointed with how dry and unflavorful the chicken in my tacos were but with enough salsas smothered on I was pretty delighted.

By the time I got to try the empanada it was a little oily/soggy which I cannot blame on Sabor, but was disappointing. Aside from the texture it tasted authentic and was very tasty.

The chips and guacamole were delicious! I swear the bag of chips was the same size as a tostitos bag.

Overall, 3.5 stars for food and 5 stars for convenience, value, and salsa bar. Ill definitely be returning to Sabor in the near future and I recommend you do as well.
