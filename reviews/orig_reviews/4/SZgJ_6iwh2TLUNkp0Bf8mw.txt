I started going to TeePee in 1972 and, having moved away many, many years ago, when I visit Phoenix, I alway go back and, while others may complain about the decor, I get to step back in time. I used to go there for lunch while in high school. I loved the hamburger for 55 cents at the time. If you have a HUGE appetite, order the nachos.  I love the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle. I decided I wanted to have some sent to my house. $60 shipping and it wasn't the same so it must be a "walk down memory lane" thing. I still love it when I eat there. The margaritas are great. Ever since GW was a customer there, I do stay as far away from that booth as I can. I'd lose my appetite if I had to look at his picture (really, the only negative but what are the owners going to do? Say no? Kick him out?)  I hope they keep the same decor. It wouldn't be the same if it were to be redecorated.  My spouse, who did not grow up in Phoenix, likes the food. We always stay at the Phoenician but dine, at least once, at Tee Pee.
