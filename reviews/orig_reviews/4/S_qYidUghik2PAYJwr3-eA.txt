Good chips and salsa, pretty good food (I have had both the steak burritos and steak tacos and both were good!), and good service!  

I have been to this location, the one in Goodyear (on McDowell and Litchfield), and the one in Scottsdale (on Scottsdale Rd), and all have been similar quality as far as food, drink, and service... so that's about as much consistency as you can ask for from a chain restaurant.

I'll be back... again.
