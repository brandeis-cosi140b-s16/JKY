Great place. Easy to miss though, so look closely. Small place and not much parking! Once we actually found it (we drove right past it the first time) we were greeted warmly. The menu is extensive and there are a ton of great options for vegetarians. First time I've ever had grilled cactus (and it was great!). The server was friendly, the food was fresh, and everything came out really quickly. They also have a salsa bar so you can try a bunch of different salsas on your food. The decor was also pretty awesome- lots of Day of the Dead decor. The overwhelmingly positive reviews are justified.
