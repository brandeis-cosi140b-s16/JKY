Newbie to the Elliot / 48th Street area...so on a whim decided to check out Los Taquitos. I played it simple and ordered the #1, which is 3 street tacos with beans and rice. Took it home and mowed, I repeat, MOWED it down! I got one chicken taco and two carne asada and they were equally delicious. The refried beans and rice were fresh and authentic and, lucky for me, served together in a separate container, which made mixing them extremely easy. 

My only complaint is that I loathe all varieties of onions, especially finely chopped red onions. So I specifically requested no onions, then I made the mistake of not checking before bolting out the door. Of course, since I got my tacos to go, once I got home I found finely chopped onions on 'em. The kind that would take 3 days to pick out, so I just ate 'em. Still amazing! 

There are a lot of cool little local eateries in this area and this one definitely ranks at the top for me. I'll be planning many return trips to sample some of the other things on their menu.
