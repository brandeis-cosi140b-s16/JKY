I was excited to try another of Jose Andres restaurants. Of note, compared to many of his other restaurants, this one is a bit more casual. 

The drink menu is excellent with many fresh and creative cocktails that are inspired by a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. They also have a large variety of different mescals. 

This is definitely a small plate restaurant, so order at least 2-3 plates per person and share to experience as much as possible. The shrimp mojo and tacos ( try the cochinita and lengua) were great!  The tuna ceviche was more of a poke and less seafood ceviche, but still good. 

A bit pricey compared to his other restaurants for the lesser experience but otherwise a fun place to have a casual bite.
