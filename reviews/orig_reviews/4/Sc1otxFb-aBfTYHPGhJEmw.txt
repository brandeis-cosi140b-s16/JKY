For those of you who aren't familiar with Cafe Rio: It's similar to Chipotle but waaaaaay better!

Every time I visit Las Vegas, my sis-in-law usually has leftover cater-sized portions of the Pork Barbacoa Salad with the house dressing. During my last visit, we had lunch here and this time I got to try it with their tortillas, which is seriously like crack. Normally I don't like to order salads at fast food places but this is the exception.  

The portions are pretty big but I can eat this salad in one sitting.
