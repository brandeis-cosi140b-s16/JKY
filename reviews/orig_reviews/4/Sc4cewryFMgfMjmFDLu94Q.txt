Al pastor/adobada, whatever you call it, get it here!  So good.   The meat is tender, with a little fat and chew.  I was hoping for some crisp/ char but I didn't find it at this place.  The three lines here were a little offputting for me.  I knew I wanted the adobada tacos (~$2) and didn't waste any time.  I did add an order of the mula (essentially a quesadilla with meat inside) and it was ok (~$4).  I wish the cheese they used was more flavorful.  Make sure to ask for grilled chiles, onions, and pineapples for your adobada tacos.  Also, someone suggested mula w/ flour tortillas tastes better than corn tortillas.  I will definitely be back.

Other important info: lines are crazy long and inconvenient because you have to get into different lines depending on what type of meat/cut you want, limited seating, pina colada fountain drink totally hit the spot, limited salsa offerings, did I mention the long lines and confusing ordering process?!
