This is a regular spot for us and is in walking distance from my boyfriend's house. Love coming here for dinner, or just drinks and appetizers.

My fave dish here is the mac & cheese. They have great chips and salsa and nachos too. You probably can't go wrong with any of their food, but I tend to stick to the same thing every time.

They have a great patio if you feel like being outdoors. Highly recommend coming here with a group of friends (guys + girls) or for a dinner date.
