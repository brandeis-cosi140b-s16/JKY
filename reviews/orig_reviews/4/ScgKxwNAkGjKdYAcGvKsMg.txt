Love this place. The food is fresh and delicious. However, the prices are grievously high and the service, although friendly, is very slow. A pet peeve of mine is waiting to be seated when there are several open tables. I will still go back as the food and drinks are to die for, just fix the wait time and lower your crazy prices please. $15 for a burrito is insane!
