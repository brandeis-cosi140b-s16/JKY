Vindicated.  The first visit, I went with a girl friend and I had rock salt in my Oysters Rockafeller and a waitress with a bad attitude.  

The second time I went down stairs, eat at the bar, had amazing service, and to-die-for steak tartar.  To die for.  A lovely platter with an egg yolk laden mountain of hand ground tartar yum, the complements were lovely and dish was just too good.  YUM!
