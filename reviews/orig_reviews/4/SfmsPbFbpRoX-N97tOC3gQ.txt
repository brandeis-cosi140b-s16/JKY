So finally I made it back to Vida after enjoying their soft opening a while back...ole! 

As others have mentioned - the decor is lovely. It's a well appointed restaurant with plenty of booths, large bar area, great patio (perfect for people watching) and sweet upstairs area for smaller groups. Our service last night was just about perfect - efficient, friendly, helpful and considerate. Case and point? Hubs and I dined with another couple, and my friend is about 7 months pregnant. When the server brought three of us our margaritas, etc. she also brought a mocktail for my buddy with baby. Sweet! 

Here's my take on the food...

Guacamole: 5/5: Some of my favorite guacamole in Charlotte. It was super fresh, well made and gigantic. The four of us barely finished it. It may be more expensive than other places, but it is delicious and feeds many. 

Skinny Margarita: 4/5: It is indeed a skinny margarita. I believe Vida touts this as fewer than 100 calories. It's a good margarita - especially for that caloric intake. 

Chicken Enchiladas: 4/5: I thought I ordered the chicken & roasted corn enchiladas...but maybe they were just plain chicken. Regardless, they were flavorful, cheesy and filling. While some may say $14+ for enchiladas is pricey, this portion was mighty large and with the two sides I was plenty full. 

Fried Plantains: 4/5: I love fried plantains. These are done right, albeit a teeny tiny bit greasy. 

Corn con Queso: 3/5: It's a general ear of roasted corn with a bit of queso. Nothing to write home about, but it was fine overall. 

So, overall a really solid experience at Vida. I'll be back soon...as long as I come with a reservation!
