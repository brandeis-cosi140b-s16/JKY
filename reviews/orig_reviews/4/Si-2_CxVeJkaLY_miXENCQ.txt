Was starving after having an afternoon plane ride (no free lunches anymore unless you're first class), and found this place in my hotel. $2 tequila shots, $2 tacos (small), and $2-3 margaritas - yum. ($2 regular, $3 starawberry)

My whole bill for 2 tacos - you can choose from beef or shredded chicken - and 1 strawberry margarita was like $8.50 with tip. You can't do better than that in Vegas! Tacos were just okay but I wasn't looking for gourmet. The strawberry margarita is small - think water glass - but tasty.
