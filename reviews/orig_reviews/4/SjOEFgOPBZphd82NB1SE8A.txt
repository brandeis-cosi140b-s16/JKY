Yummy Yummy! 

Had heard about this place not only being delicious but that it was started by a woman who came her across the boarder as an immigrant. With all the hubbub about immigrants these days, its sad to say that this place (amongst many others) wouldn't be here if it weren't for the blessed peeps who come over here and share not only their love but food and culture with all of us gringos who don't got nothing! I love the patio, I'm just missing the beach in front of me (instead of 7th street), especially because I've got a negro modelo in my hand, munching on some chips and (AWESOME) salsa. 

I ordered a carne asada taco and one cob of America's corn. Both were delicious! Although I was stuffed with it all, I think I could eat at least two tacos, they're pretty cute and small. The corn was amazing and the sauce the came with it was kind of sweet at first but by then end my mouth was on fire (in a good way). I LOVED IT! Jose got the quesadilla with carne. It was also delicious but small for $6. That was his problem "I paid $6 for that small thing, I could make it at home". Which, yes, is true but you didn't and its yummy.  

The staff we're friendly and genuinely nice. Great music was on the speakers and it was extremely clean. Everything taste and smelled fresh and it just felt very comfortable.

Saturdays & Sundays they have $2 pacificos, ALL DAY! I've got a girlfriend coming into town in a couple of weeks, I guess I know where we will be hangin out at.

Thanks America!
