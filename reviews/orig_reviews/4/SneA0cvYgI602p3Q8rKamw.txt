I LOVE this fun, local restaurant! Cabo is always the #1 place that our family takes out of town friends and family! The servers are friendly , knowledgeable, and quick taking our order, and the food is served hot and delicious. The chipotle corn salsa and the chipotle cheese dip are delicious starters! For a decadent starter, I highly recommend the seafood dish! My favorite dish is 1 mahi mahi taco and 1 shrimp taco with the avocado pasta salad side dish. With a squeeze of fresh lime, the perfect chewiness of the floor tortillas, and the bright flavors of the fish and shrimp--YUM! I could go there right now! :)
