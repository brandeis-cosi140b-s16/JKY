Came here for dinner and was pretty pleased. 
I had 2 of the veggie tacos which I thought were good, they come with lettuce, tomato and cheese standard and then the veggies vary. My husband had one fish and one veggie taco and was also pretty happy. We got the chips and queso to split. The chips are pretty standard and I don't think made in house but the queso was good, different than regular. 
Only bummer is that I didn't see any draft beer, only bottles.
