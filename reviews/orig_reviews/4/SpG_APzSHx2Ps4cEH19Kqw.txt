Came here after a long day spending at casino waiting for friend finishing playing.
Then came to Ricardos for a nice greeting crew, and margaritas.
Then have Vero our waitress which outstand the service.
The food was cook properly and then the end was amazing.

Price is ok, and definitely recommended.
