I seriously love me some Carlsbad!  I love that happy hour and those delicious margaritas and those yummy potstickers... I think my stomach just growled!  The potstickers are chicken and sauteed in a soy-like sauce and served with a sweet creamy corn sauce on the side of the plate... It's fantastically salty, sweet and savory.  They also do a pretty tasty sopapilla. 
The inside is a bit dark, but its a cave right?  And they have a killer patio with water falls when its not blazing hot outside.  
Note: I hear their lobster enchiladas are killer (though i don't eat seafood) and the Habanero burger got Food Network magazine's best burger in AZ!
