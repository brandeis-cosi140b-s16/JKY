El Hefe has become my go to bar in Scottsdale because the atmosphere is fun and the drinks are cheap. I came here for happy hour on Saturday and decided to try a carne asada taco. I wasn't expecting much because I have low expectations for bar food. Inside the taco was carne asada, white cheese, and pickled cabbage. It was delicious! I also tried a strawberry margarita made with fresh strawberries and that was delicious as well. I was really impressed with the food here and I can't wait to try other items on the menu!
