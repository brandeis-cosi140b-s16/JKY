Best Happy Hour in Town. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday half price bottles of wine, drink specials and from 3PM to 6PM, $5 menu items.

The Rokerij is one of my favorite little spots. Great, cozy downstairs bar with fireplace, good music and great staff. It can get a little crowded but worth it.  Great spot for a date!

The small plates are my favorite.  The bacon wrapped scallops, brie toast and chile relleno.  The plates are very rich, however.

I think they have an amazing wine list and I've never had a dissapointing wine.  They spend time on their wine and having wine sales experience, their buyer knows their wines.

It can get busy for happy hour, but well worth the wait my friends.
