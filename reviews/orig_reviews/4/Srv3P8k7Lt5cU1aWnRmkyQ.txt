Ive gone here a few times, and the fish tacos are the best. If fish isn't your thing, go for the pastor tacos.

The tall bald guy with goatee is super nice. So have a question? He's happy to answer.

The place is super small so I never dine in. Its a pain to find but once you locate it, you can find the quick ins and outs.

The only bad thing is there closed Sunday and Monday, the days I crave fish tacos.
