I didn't really know what to expect from a Chinese/Mexican place, but I was happily surprised. One thing you should know, though: It's not a fusion place. There's Mexican dishes and Chinese dishes and a heartwarming anecdote about a Chinese girl getting kidnapped by the Spanish empire explaining the name of the restaurant. 

We had my baby nephew in tow . . . and he's a heartbreaker. So we got terrific service. A high chair, attentive service, helpful beyond the norm. Our server clearly knew the menu too and offered us lots of great suggestions. 

My one regret is not ordering more Mexican food. I was more intrigued by (and our server offered more suggestions of) the Chinese food. It was tasty . . . although we didn't love the dumplings: too much dough, filling was too sweet. The tacos that we ordered were awesome, though. We got the carnitas. Delicious, but way too small for the price. Wish we'd gotten more. 

All in all, I think it's a good bet. If you are a little adventurous, you can get a great meal for a not-too-bad price. Just bring a baby with you.
