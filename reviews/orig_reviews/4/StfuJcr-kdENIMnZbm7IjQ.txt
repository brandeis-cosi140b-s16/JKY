Distrito holds true to its claim of Modern Mexican food. This is definitely not your corner taco truck, but what they do, they do quite well. 

The decor is awesome with a modern, funky, retro blend. Sliding doors open to the outside patio which it nice on a warm evening. 

Service was pretty good overall sans a couple of hiccups including getting a small ramekin of chili paste when salsa was requested. 

Food was great. Guacamole was fresh, ceviches were very good. Tacos were great, each one coming with different sauces and garnish (I really recommend the mahi-mahi with chipotle remoulade, avacado and cabbage). Nachos were a cheesy mound of wonderfulness on a plate. 

While I didn't drink (WHAT?!?), everybody was happy with their margarita, michelada or tequila tasting from the well stocked bar. 

Overall a great place I would recommend and will come back to without hesitation.
