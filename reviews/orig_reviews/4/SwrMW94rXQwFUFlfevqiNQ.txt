I am about to say something that may cause a lot of backlash... I don't think this is a Mexican joint (and by "Mexican" I am referring to the Americanized version of Mexican I'm used to, mainly like that of Azteca or Monterrey). Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not being a Mexican restaurant, but I wish I know the true origin of their kitchen and then I can just order what they are great at.

Just let's talk about the logic behind my statement. I have eaten here many times now, and something about their finished products just don't look quite "Mexican." They have potatoes in their rice, which is more yellow and not that orange color. Excellent rice, but just not quite Meixcan rice. Then the other night we were there for a group dinner and when Arroz Con Pollo came out, it looked like Fried Rice! There was no tomato sauce, or melted cheese, or sliced avocado. It tasted good, GIANT portion, a great deal to be honest, but then it just wasn't the Gringo Mexican style Arroz Con Pollo one may be craving for.

SO - here is my verdict: eat here because it has good food, but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Mexican place since I'm not quite sure it is Mexican. And I hope one day they will have a side menu of the real origin of their kitchen staffs, because I am honestly dying to know what am I  really missing here.

P.S. If you are to have their empanadas, go for the beef or veggies - somehow their chicken ones tend to be dry and tasteless.
