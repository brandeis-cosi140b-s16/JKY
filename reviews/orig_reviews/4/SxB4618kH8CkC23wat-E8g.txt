I think I just found my new favorite Mexican joint. Like other Yelpers say, this place isn't much to look at on the outside but they are cooking up some awesome food inside.

I ordered the #10 which is a carne asada taco, a quesadilla, rice and beans. I went for the taco first. Their tacos are small but mighty. The meat was tender and the salsa had a kick but was no overpowering - very flavorful. Next was the quesadilla. Granted, it's hard to mess up melted cheese in a tortilla but definitely hit the mark if ooey gooey cheese is your thing.

I thought the rice and beans were really good too. Dipping the quesadilla in the beans made it that much more awesome. 

The staff was very friendly - they greeted us right away when we came in and thanked us on our way out. 

I'm very much looking forward to my next visit so I can try the other kinds of tacos - chicken, al pastor, carnitas - yum!!
