This was my second time here. The first one would have been less stars. 

I am a burger snob, I like em fat and juicy, cooked med rare, over a flame. I like back yard burgers with let, tom and pickles, mustard and mayo...you get it. 

PVBC does a small thin patty cooked the way they want. With fancy toppings and interesting creations. This works and works well. 

I ordered the Beach House, "under cooked" with fries. The Beach House is roastedâ€‹ green chili, smoked mozzarella, pico de gallo. 

The burger looked amazing, great presentation. The flavor were perfect together and worked well. The under cooked help the meat be moist still.  

The fries were great, I believe they are "sugar dusted" as well. LOL I liked dipping them in the Jalapeno Ranch. 

It is obvious they care about the handmade and fresh ingredients here...it shows.

Well done guy's well done.
