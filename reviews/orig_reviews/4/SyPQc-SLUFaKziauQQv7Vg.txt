Pretty good food for a sports bar. I've been twice: once at the height of Friday night and the other midweek for lunch. Both times the service was quick and the drinks were replenished just in time. Like many sports bars in the area the wait staff seems to be more about being a hot chick than a great server, but when the food comes quickly and the drinks don't run dry there's not much room for complaint. The burritos are good and pretty standard for a chain. The salads are really good and very big. If you're watching what you eat then go for one of them and you'll leave full and satisfied. I tried this place for the groupon but I'll definitely go back...especially for their drink specials.
