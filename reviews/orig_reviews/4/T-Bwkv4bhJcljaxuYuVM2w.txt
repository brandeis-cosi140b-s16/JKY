Today was our first time going to backyard taco. We ordered the potato thing, a bean and cheese burrito, one chicken taco and 1 steak taco. They have a nice salsa bar with an arrangement of cells does. The place seems pretty authentic, down to the flies going after your food. Regardless it was good. We ordered the potato thing because everybody talked about it in the reviews, it was pretty good, a little difficult to eat because all the food sticks to the tin foil. The bean and cheese burrito was very good, they don't skimp on the cheese at all which is always a plus for me. We didn't realize until after leaving that if you check in on Yelp you get a free chips and salsa. Will be going back to get it another time because the food was pretty good.
