This is a cool little place to try. I think the best thing on the menu are the quesadillas. They are traditional Mexico City style which are not in the flour tortilla as most places serve but are maid out flour ( I think they are from Mexico City because we were brought up eating them this way). They are deep fried which is worth trying just because of how deliciously amazing they are! There salsa bar is unique with lots of choices, but I do wish they had at least one spicy one. I think their service can improve, ( maybe our server was just having a bad day). But overall good place.
