As promised, the second time around:

Muuuuch better! I got a carne asada taco, plus chips & salsa. I somehow ended up with everything on my taco (I was trying to avoid all the dairy, as it contributes significantly to my ass looking like a golfball), but of course, all the extras made it even more delicious. Seriously good carne asada. 

The salsa with the chips still leaves some spice to be desired, but that fresh tomato flavor is great!

I'll be giving Los Tacos a permanent slot on my work lunch rotation :)
