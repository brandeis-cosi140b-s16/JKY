This restaurant is overall really good but not excellent. We ordered a margarita pizza which was good, the gnocchi al fromaggi (pretty awesome), the angel hair with basil, tomatoes and marinara sauce and all of these were really good. But once my father, a meat lover who knows a lot about meat, ordered his oysters and after that the ribe-bye steak, it was another story. The steak was asked to be cooked "Rear//Red//Bloody" and came "Well done" with baked potatoes that were cold and hard as rocks. Also, the oysters were good but some of them weren't fresh and were stinking really bad. Hence my 4 out of 5 star rating.

My advice - Stay in the pure Italian register such as pizza/pasta and you'll be more than happy!
