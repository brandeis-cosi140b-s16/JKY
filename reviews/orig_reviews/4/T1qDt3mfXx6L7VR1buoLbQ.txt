Happy Hour is AMAZING there - the calimari and roast beef sliders the best of the bunch.  I also enjoyed the fish, branzino, I think it was.  The siracha chicken sticks were not fully cooked, which was a bummer, because the sauce was good.  I could pass on the mashed potatoes, and side salad.  Also, it's valet parking only - so bring extra for the valet drivers.

I probably wouldn't go here for dinner, but would be there in a second for Happy Hour.  :)
