Tacos here, tacos there, tacos everywhere.

You can eat it in every corner but its hard to get tired of it. Diablo brings a pretty standard set up menu combined with a jolly atmosphere. 

Go with a Margarita pitcher and Sizzling fajitas if you want to go my way, but i doubt  the food will dissapoint you. Can be crowded reg. eating hours, but you can always stick around for a drink in the bar while waiting.

It is the perfect spot to start off the night with a couple of drinks and some tacos. I go here everytime i visit vegas, and im yet to be dissapointed about the place.

If you wanna get tipsy while eating tacos, this is the place for you!
