Heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo and had been meaning to check it out. I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).

After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.

Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :)

Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did. It was hard to find a spot that wasn't dirty or taken so had to sit at the table by the bathroom. Needless to say, I ate my tacos and was out of there!
