For a Monday night, man, this place was rockin'! There's not much in the way of lively spots near the Borgata, but Blanco injects a little bit of attitude into this quiet shopping center. The patio space is expansive, and it's a real relaxing atmosphere. They bump some strange, spacey house music, which feels a bit out of place, but it's not loud enough to be annoying or ruin the mood. The ceviches are excellent: try the big eye tuna or the crab and shrimp. The housemade gazpacho base is very citrusy and juicy, which really gives the meat some kick. 

The chips are thick and crispy, but lack the seasoning needed. The salsa was fresh and peppery. The pureed tomato doesn't overpower for a good blend.

All the Sam Fox restaurants are solid concepts, and this one is no different. It's fun, hip, California attitude in the Valley and it's welcomed. Most higher-end Mexican spots are pretty cavernous and bland with no atmosphere to speak of, but Blanco is top notch.
