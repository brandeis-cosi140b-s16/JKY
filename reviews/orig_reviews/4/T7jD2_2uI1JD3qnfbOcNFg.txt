- Cool space.  I almost felt like I wasn't in a casino
- Great salsa.  Seriously top notch.  Perfect heat, tomato, and chili combination with just the right consistency
- We had the ceviche trio.  The shrimp ceviche was my favorite, which is rare because most shrimp ceviche has little flavor.  Javier's version was rich, tangy, and spicy
- I had the costilla de res.  It was nice and tender.  The sauce was delicate, which you normally don't find in Mexican fare. I loved it.  Something needs to be done with the potatoes though.  Didn't seem to match well
- The rice and beans were below average
- Ok service.  Very polite, but there was a lot of confusion around which tables ordered what
