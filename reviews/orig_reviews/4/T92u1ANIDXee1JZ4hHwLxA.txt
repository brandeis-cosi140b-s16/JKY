I love Wahoos! I agree with some others folks that this Vegas location does not make as good fish tacos as the California franchise. But I love Wahoos so much I don't even care. I went to a hi-end mexican place recently and ALL I can think of is I want to be in Wahoos. Their food is cheaper and their Lees Chili Sauce is one of the best chili sauce in the world! I can eat anything with that sauce. The servers always remember us and will bring extra when we visit. We always get great service at Wahoos, Vegas or Cali.
So I keep going back for more... I gave it 4 stars because sometimes their rice is a bit dry.
