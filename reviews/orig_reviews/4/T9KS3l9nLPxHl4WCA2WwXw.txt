note: this review is in regards to the Nacho Daddy stand at Life is Beautiful 2015. Friendly attractive man serving nachos is really fundamental to good timez. Wish I could call him my nacho daddy. At the very end of the second night we came back to again exchange cold hard cash for hot crispy chips, we were told, "sorry, we're only have free chips and salsa now." How dare they.

Chips are quality. salsa is fresh and a little hot. vegan nacho options = ***** (5 stars, not a 5 letter word). That never happens. 

BUT they don't have beans? I don't eat meat but friend ordered gringo nachos and chicken nachos and both times said the meat was rubbery. no star for meat/lack of beans 

so **** overall. but high fives all around.
