Finally made it in after hearing about Chino Bandido for years.  Fun place.  Order at the counter to the left, then cop a squat in the dining area(s) to the right and they'll bring your food out to you.  Bonus for first-timers: they provide meat samples to help you make your order.  I had a 2-item combo (jade red chicken and carnitas) and jerk fried rice.  I should have gone with 1 item instead as I'm still stuffed and lunch was an hour ago!

So the place isn't earth-shattering, but it was good.  I'll be back and I'll have no problem recommending Chino Bandido to anyone who'll listen.
