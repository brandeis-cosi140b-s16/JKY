As a restaurant this place has fabulous food but hit or miss service. We went twice the first time was great. Our bartender actually order our tacos and made us delicious strawberry margaritas served in goblets. The second time the male bartender totally ignored us, forgot to put our food order in, and was serving dudes before us. This place is also very particular on who they let in. I have seen the bouncer not let a few people in. Otherwise a pretty decent polar overall.
