Go here for happy hour.

fundido with veggies
an elote
2 fish tacos
1 carne asada taco
1 cochinita taco
1 veggie taco
tres leches cake
6 drinks (pear mojitos and margaritas)

$61.00

I think that is a pretty good price for two people who left completely stuffed. Not to mention, all of the flavors in these dishes were spot on!!! The cochinita taco was my absolutely favorite taco. If I could go back I would definitely get the fundido again with veggies, an elote, and more cochinita tacos no questions asked. If I had room...let me rephrase...I would make room for the tres leches cake.

Atmosphere was trendy and modern

I did read that a lot of people had trouble with service. I was just there last week and we had great service. We were attended to right away, had water and drink refills without asking, and our server was really personable and on the ball. I have not one complaint about service.
