Woo Hoo! I finally found a mexican resturant that is good in this town after 8 years of searching. Too bad it is on the opposite side of town. I loved the atmosphere and music. The chips, salsa and bean dip was sooo good I could not stop myself.The chili verde was so tender and full of flavor and the margaritas were fresh and not made with crappy sweet & sour. I will be back hopefully soon!
