This place looks like your average casual dining/bar (which it is).The waitresses are dressed casual but all of them are wearing belly shirts! Hey, I'm not mad at them, just wondering if this is some kind of dress code? They were friendly and there was definitely a very laid back vibe. I think I was in my bikini with some small cover up and I didnt feel out of place. There were moments when I felt the service could have been a little quicker but I am a very fast paced (like to be in and out of casual dining in 30 minutes or less) so I can forgive them a little for that.

What warrants the 4* rating? 

The FOOD!!

I would describe it as "upscale" or maybe more "fine dining" ish... nothing was heavy handed or greasy or overly cheesy as with most mexican restaurants...it was presented nicely and tasted delish and my husband and I did not feel overly full (I hate that).  We ordered the ceviche and a combo that had a cheese enchilada and I think a beef taco, with rice and beans. 

I really did not expect that caliber of mexican food when I walked into this place so I give them their props. 

Also, the location is really great- right off the strip and next to alot of shopping (Sephora is right next door) 

Anyway, seems like alot of mixed reviews of this place but my husband and I truly enjoyed their food; maybe it depends on what you order.
