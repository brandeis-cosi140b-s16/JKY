Perfect location outside Linq Hotel promenade area, where literally everyone walking by looks extremely happy!  Better than expected service and food here, a pleasant surprise.  Started off with the hot tortilla chips, nicely seasoned with a delicious spicy & hot fresh red salsa.  Then a perfect medium rare NY Strip steak with yucca fries, omg was really good.  I would come back here!!
