My mother can't live without the soup-style beans, and she's right. I get the Clare burro, which has queso fresco, whole pinto beans, and avocado. I also usually get some guacamole, which is very chunky here, and add a bit of salt to eat with the chips. 

It's a family place for me, I don't ever really like it as much when I try to take other people, and this is the second move I can remember. My folks are sticking by this one, and I am happy to tag along!
