hubby and i came here after a couple's photo shoot at lake las vegas. we had never heard of this restaurant before but love mexican so we thought we would give it a try. i absolutely loved it here. i dont understand the poor yelp reviews because our food was delicious and the service was on point. the only mark down i give this place is the time it took to check out.

we were able to sit on the patio when we went. the sun was setting and a chill was beginning. someone came and started a fire which really set the ambiance for us. a jazz band was also setting up near by. the chips and salsa were good, our waiter was attentive, we didnt have to wait too long for our food. the sangria was one of the best i have had and they had my hubby's favorite beer: bohemia. overall it was a wonderful surprise dinner. the only bad was the check out time....it took wayyyyy too long. that wouldnt stop me from going back though; and i live in NLV!
