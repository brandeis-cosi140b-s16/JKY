I really like this place.  And for being a hotel restaurant, it gets extra kudos.  I kind of doubt I would ever pick coming here again (just bc it's far from where I live and bc I can get  tasty Mexican food for cheaper elsewhere), but I did enjoy my experience there.

First, decor is AMAZING.  really beautiful place and I love how the tables on the patio have flames shooting up out of the middle. literally! fire coming right up out of your table. So cool!  And they have these cute little glass cloche type things with a succulent landscape inside on each table.  It takes up a lot of table space, but it's so pretty!  I'm even inspired to try to recreate it on my own for my house.  plus the Fairmont in general is just gorgeous.  so for this reason, it's a nice place for a special date night!

Second, food is good!  not out of this world, but I definitely liked my meal.  I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and shared the guacamole sampler for appetizer.  the enchiladas were just what you'd expect, nothing much to comment there.  I really liked the trio of guacamoles we ate!  Tasted very freshly made and had some inventive combinations (like adding pomegranate seeds, neat!)

Third, there is this guy who goes around making hot chocolate.  He puts the chocolate powder mixture in this flaming glass and swishes it around and keeps adding more chocolate powder.  I really don't know how he did not singe his hands bc he wasn't wearing gloves or anything.  It was really neat to watch and it made the entire dining area smell heavenly.  Again, great place for a special date!
