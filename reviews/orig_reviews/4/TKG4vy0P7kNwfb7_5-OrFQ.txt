I've been here plenty of times since I moved to Phoenix seven years ago, and I've finally had a dish I wasn't thrilled with-carnitas.  It was more like oven-roasted pork slices, not anything like I'm used to.
But....this is the first time in seven years I've been disappointed.  Their arroz con pollo is very good, carne asada, tacos, enchiladas, chimis, you name it-solid dumpy Mexican place!!
I've always been treated very well by the staff and never overcharged :)
