The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.

This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.

What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalape√±os. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.

The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.
