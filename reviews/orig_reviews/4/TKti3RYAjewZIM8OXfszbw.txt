I love it hot and at Los Dos it is almost hot enough for me, and for the average person the food is hot as shit. In comparison to other places the margs are strong, some say the price is high but the comparison is not from my neighbordhood, and at least they have booze in them. I dig the wait while I sit on the patio with a marg or two, you have to learn how to make good us of your time. Good food and drink with a very diverse crowd that I always find entertaining.
