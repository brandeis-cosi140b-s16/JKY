Had a nice dinner here with a group of friends. Service was friendly and attentive. I had the fish taco which was very good. The food came up quick. We also ordered their margarita in a pitcher which gives a glass for 4 people. Unlike most Mexican restaurants the chips and salsa aren't provided free, if you want any you have to pay for them.
