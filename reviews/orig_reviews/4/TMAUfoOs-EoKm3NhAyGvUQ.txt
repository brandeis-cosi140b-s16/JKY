Just went tonight.  Was looking for some late night Mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success.

This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.

I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.  

They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!

This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.  (If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)
