My friends invited me out to "the face" for lunch. I was wondering what the heck the face was, and they told me the name of this place. Then I got here and realized what they were talking about.

I haven't been to Mexico, but it seems like you might expect a restaurant there to look like this (see TC S.'s photo). Service is friendly enough and pretty efficient. I got the burrito lunch special with beef, and it was pretty darn good. The plate (which comes out hot - careful!) has burrito that appears relatively small, but that's because the beans and rice and whatnot are spread out on the place and are intended to be eaten with utensils. I also greatly enjoyed a sample of my friend's fish dish (forgot what it was called), and apparently they make some good shrimp as well.

I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants something a bit higher class than Del Taco and more authentic than Chipotle
