This place was a good find. 

Had the marinated pork and carne asada burritos. Prices were fair and they did not go cheap on the burrito fillings in terms of loading it with rice to make it appear huge (I'm looking at you Baja Taco on Ft. Apache). Lots of meat, sour cream and avocado when I told the guy "everything".

The only thing missing here would be a nice salsa bar but the burrito itself with a little salsa verde squirt did the job and was plenty flavorful.

A tasty little place with a simple menu, good food and excellent service...will go back.
