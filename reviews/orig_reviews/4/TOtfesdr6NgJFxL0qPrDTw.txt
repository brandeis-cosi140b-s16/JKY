I hate cilantro but their guacamole was so good I got over it. Had fish and shrimp tacos, so tasty. This is my bestfriend's fav spot when ever we travel to Vegas, finally got to eat lunch here and I was impressed.

Only 4 stars coz I asked for no dairy or cilantro for allergy reasons and I wasnt offered a substitute. Bummer but food was good enough to not complain since I know my dietary restrictions sometimes can kill it.
