My bf and I ate here yesterday. First I would like to mention the seating is very limited and be prepared to wait....I was in line for 30 min!! They have three different lines where you order different kinds of meat or so that's how it appears. Little did we know that you can pretty much get in any line and order whatever you want. They should make that clear because it can be somewhat confusing. Anyhow once we finally got all our tacos they were good, the adobada, tripa and taco azteca were my favorite. They did in fact taste like TJ tacos. A bit pricey though, typically a taco runs you about $1.00-$1.50 but here they are $2.00 and they are not big....2-3 bites.
