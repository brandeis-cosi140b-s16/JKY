It was a very decent place. (I still live/die for Ritos)

--Price:  It was $6.99 for my burro.  For its size, it was about average.

--Food:  I had the Oaxacan Black Mole Burro. I was good, but not mind blowing.  I would say it was worth the visit.

--Service:  Alright I guess.  I could take out my balls, rub them on the table, and the waitress would never know.  Take what you want from this.

I read so much about the chips and salsa: Chips sucked my shaved anus but the salsa was good.  I had better at Costco. **Strawberry salsa was good**

Overall it was a good experience (hence the 4 stars), but I will continue giving my money to RITOS.
