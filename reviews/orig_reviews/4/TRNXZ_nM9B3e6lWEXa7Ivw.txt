We was hungry and in an area not familiar with when it came to food. I whipped out the yelp app, saw the high ratings, so added Fat Boy to my bookmarks.  I have to give them a call before heading out, closing at 7 pm on a Saturday night seemed weird, and it was almost 9 luckily they were open till 10.

I kinda knew we was going to enjoy the food just from the many pictures of happy customers all over the walls. I ordered Guacamole Boyger and sis ordered the Guacamole Boyger meal with fat fries. While waiting I keep reading Fat Boy yelp reviews and one thing that came up a few times was the Chencho fries (fat/skinny) and of course I couldn't have left without ordering some. The Guacamole Boygers tasted really good and I especially loved the beef patty, I'm pretty sure it had jalapeno peppers or some think spicy in them.  The Chencho fries with cheese and all the additional ingredients were skinny fries which was good but because my sis had ordered fat fries I just stole some and made my Chencho fries great.  You should really order the Chencho fries fat, it takes another 5 mins or so but better than skinny. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews, maybe the location is out of the way for someone like me, but it is definitely a place to try.

I noticed they also make Boyrritos, pizzas, and wings, deliver and also have a facebook. And sell some Fat Boy merchandise.
