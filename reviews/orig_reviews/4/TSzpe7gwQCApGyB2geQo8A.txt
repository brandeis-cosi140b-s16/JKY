My sister wanted to meet for lunch one day last week, and told me to pick a place.  I was tired of all the usual spots, so after a quick search on Yelp, I came across La Pinata.

It is in an old strip mall on 19th Ave., but once you walk in, it is this funky, little retro Mexican restaurant with a cool vibe.  The menu is huge, with lots of the classic Sonoran style dishes us Arizonans love!

The chips and salsa were great; the chips were warm and the salsa was fresh and chunky with a touch of heat!  We tried the beans and they were really good, they didn't beat the beans at Los Compadres, but nonetheless, they were tasty.  We tried the cheese and the spinach enchiladas and both were really good, served piping hot!

We decided that we would definitely return to sample some more items on the vast menu!  They even had my all time favorite, the Mary Lou on the menu, and I just have to try that at some point!
