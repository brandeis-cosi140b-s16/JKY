Cinco de Mayo pretty much means eat tacos for lunch and have a margarita. So we headed to Taco Haus to indulge in the festivities. We sat on their shaded, mister covered patio even though the temps were in the high 90's we were very comfy! The specials of the day were clearly posted so we ordered a corona and a house margarita ($4 each), it was delicious, a perfect mix! The chips, guac, and salsa were all tasty and fresh, I loved the salsa verde! I ordered the carne asada taco plate with cilantro rice and lentils (I prefer the traditional black bean, but interesting spin) and my fianc√© ordered the short rib taco plate (the best short rib tacos I've ever had)! We were easily persuaded to finish off our lunch with the carrot cake and holy deliciousness! I highly recommend supporting the Haus restaurants! Always a nice atmosphere, good service, and amazing food!
