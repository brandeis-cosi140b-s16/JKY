I don't always eat tortas. But when I do, I prefer Los Reyes. Actually, I've never tried a torta before last night -- and to think, I used to call myself a cultured Mexican food aficionado.

This place is bomb, that's all there is to it. I had the pechuga asada torta (bomb), side of guacamole (so bomb), pineapple agua fresca (way bomb), and half of my girlfriend's estillo del rey quesadilla (SUPER BOMB). The guacamole was some of the best I've ever tasted, although I heard some complaints about an overload of cilantro. Man up, cilantro is awesome.

The prices were a little high from what I would expect out of a dinky little Mexican restaurant, but I guess after you're featured on Man vs. Food you're allowed to overcharge. Or if your food is this damn good.

The next time I go, I'm definitely going to scoop up a strawberry agua fresca -- I tried my friend's, and it was... you guessed it, turbo bomb. It's a little bit of a drive from North Scottsdale, but any man will drive a few extra miles for some good tacos.
