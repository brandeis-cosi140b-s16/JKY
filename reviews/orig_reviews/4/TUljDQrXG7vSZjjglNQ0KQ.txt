It had been a while since we had been to Cantina 1511.  In fact, I really don't remember the last time, it was that long.  Also, for some reason it seems like I can't remember a particularly great mexican meal that I have had in Charlotte.  Most of the mexican food that I eat is made at home and satisfies me.  Maybe I don't know where the good places are?  Anyway, we stopped by for a drink, in this case a couple of margaritas, but I was looking at the food menu and got tempted into ordering a couple of tacos.  The al pastor pork taco and the carne asada steak taco were calling my name.  Both tacos were excellent, but I would get the al pastor only next time, as the cabbage, pineapple and cilantro really went well together.  The tacos came with beans and rice, which I enjoyed, but I was already overly stuffed with the tacos.  I had ordered a lunch portion at 10$ and it was a very good value for the amount of food that I received.  Sitting outside on the patio was nice despite the heat. 

Overall, very happy that I gave Cantina another try and I will return sooner this time.
