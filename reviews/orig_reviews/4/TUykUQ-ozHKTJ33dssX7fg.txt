The food I had on this particular day was really good. We had the fresh made Guacamole, Ahi Poke Ceviche, and Pork Tacos... All were very satisfying. I also ordered the Watermelon Martini and although it was tasty it was very hard to drink because the watermelon chunks and basil leaves constantly got in the way. Overall a good experience.
