This place catered a couple of parties for my company and did an OUTSTANDING job.  

The food was decent, and the staff was on time and prompt.  They showed up prepared and made everything SUPER easy.  The queso had to be my favorite.  I still have yet to check out the restaurant in person, but it is on my "to do" list.

Thank you Tacos & Beer.
