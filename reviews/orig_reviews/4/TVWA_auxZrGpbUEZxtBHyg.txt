This place is really good and close to campus.  They moved in after Papa Johns closed and I heard from either a magazine or some sort of food magazine that said to stop in.   

The thing about the Taco Shop is that they have really good Burritos and all sorts of great mexican delights that will fill you up and leave you satisfied.  There menu is diverse enough to give anyone something to munch on.

It is a step up from Filibertos or Taco Bell and  is very different tasking then the Chipotle burrito.  This is where I must say if you have the craving of Chipotle your obviously going to go there, but switch it up one time.  

It is conveniently located to ASU campus and they have amazing salsa and chips.  I have dreams about there red salsa now, it haunts me with its good taste.

Recommendation: For people want a taste other-than Chipotle , making the change, for a more authentic mexican meal for its pricing, taste and red salsa.
