So I was out in the field calling on clients with my manager when lunch rolled around and we were struggling to think of someplace we'd both like, I remembered Barrio Caf√© from seeing it the night before on Diners, Drive-Inns and Dives so viola!

Loved the atmosphere and the parking in the rear, provided a nice urban feel too often lacking among Phoenix's stucco-covered strip mall restaurants.

Service was good.  I had the pulled pork tacos, the boss had the carne asada tacos.  He felt his were "good, but not great".  I thought the pulled pork was excellent.  Unlike most "street" taco plates, these were fully stuffed with excellent pork.  The sauces on the side were terrific and unique as well.  

I'm a fan and I'll be back.  There are some unique dishes that I still want to try.  The menu certainly isn't your typical Mexican fare.  The only draw-back that I saw would be the prices.  They're certainly proud of their menu, perhaps a little more than is warranted in my view.
