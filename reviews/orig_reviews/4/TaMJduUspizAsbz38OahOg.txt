I wasn't sure what I expected when I came in here. This is a pretty casual burrito joint, where you order first and they bring the food to you. It's not as "gourmet" as Chipolte tries to be and is likely closer to authentic Mexican food than specialty food.

Again, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I did like the special that I ordered. The portions have a decent size to them, too.
