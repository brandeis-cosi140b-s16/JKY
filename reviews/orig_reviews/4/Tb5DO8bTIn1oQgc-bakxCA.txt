Walking inside the place I noticed how the overall atmosphere of it is very 50's 60's. the decour inside
Complimenting the atmosphere!


We were not greeted by anyone and it took them about 4/5 mins to meet our server. When she did come over she was quite nice and brought out drinks out right away.

My boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy and I got a tuna salad
Sandwich. The biscuits and gravy were delicious! Tasted very homemade and full of flavor! The sandwich was good as well very large portion,
Definitely moneys worth. 


I plan on going back and trying their burgers! 


The service wasn't all that great but not terrible either... The food was tasty and fairly priced!
