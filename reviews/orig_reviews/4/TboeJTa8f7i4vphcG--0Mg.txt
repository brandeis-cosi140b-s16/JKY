This place has at least 3 different names: La Condesa on Yelp, La Santisima on the front of the building, and Santa Santisima on the menu.  Call it whatever you want, just find the place.  It's so good, my friends and I came here twice during our trip, on the word of some locals we met at JoBot Coffee.  It's a really small place, so expect a wait unless you happen to get lucky and pop in at a slow time.  The guacamole is stupid good, as are the shark and pork tacos.  If you're really hungry, skip the 2 taco platter (just adds rice and beans) and get a third taco, or order the guac.
