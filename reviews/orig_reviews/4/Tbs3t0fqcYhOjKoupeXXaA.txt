Stuffed sopapilla was amazing.  Carlito's burrito almost as good.  Enchiladas are so-so.  Taco shell was greasy and chewy.  4 stars overall, but if you stick to classic New Mexican food it's 5 stars.

To think that Super-Mex (which I think is the worst Mexican restaurant ever) is down the block and busy amazes me.  If Carlito's had a good location it would be the hottest place in town.
