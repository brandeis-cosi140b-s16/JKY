So, don't expect authentic Mexican street tacos here. The tacos were good. Not Amazing, but good. I had three: pork belly, fish and the short rib. Pork belly was dry and not fatty at all (that last part may or may not be a good thing depending on your perspective). The toppings were good. I did not like the short rib one at all. Not my bag of chips. Now, the fish was pretty darn good.  Crunchy fried with s nice combination of toppings. Oh and I almost forgot, they make their own tortillas and they are solid! 
However, best thing of the night was the guacamole. It was different. Very chunky and I like the fact that it was all avocado. I hate guac that's muddled with tomatoes and other ingredients. This was perfectly lime green avocado and lots of garlic for a change. Perfectly seasoned creamy chunks. I've been craving the guacamole ever since. Need to go back and taste a few other tacos.
