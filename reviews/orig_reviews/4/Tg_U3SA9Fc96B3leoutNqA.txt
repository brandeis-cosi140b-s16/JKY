Great food and cool ambiance but it fails in the realm of "bang for the buck".  I can get a really good and substantially bigger taco at the right street vendor in town or I can get a better, albeit three times pricier at a 1/3rd the size, taco here. It's a question of economic utility here.   By the way, I like your bathroom.
