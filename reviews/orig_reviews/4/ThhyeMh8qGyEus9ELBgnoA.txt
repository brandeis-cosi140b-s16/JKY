Super onolicious semi-local kine grindz! Braddah's is da winna!
Kalua pig is a must try! Huli-huli chicken is pretty good for haole standard. Pulehu steak is so so. 
Da furikake rice wanna-be is tasty but they put too little rice for hawaiian plate standard. 
I think they should localize it a bit more by having 2 scoops of mac salad as a side option or maybe add spam as a meat choice. 
Will definitely spread the word and will be back soon for sure!
