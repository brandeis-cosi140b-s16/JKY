Went to the symphony during the mid part of the day and happened to run into La Condesa based on a Yelp review. This place is very tasty. Their salsas are exceptionally good and a must if you make a visit. Their drinks are good as well. All items served are unique in preparation and taste. We had the taco's gaucho, quesadilla and some orchata. The food was excellent and the service was friendly and attentive. Overall this place great for a mid day lunch of evening meal.
