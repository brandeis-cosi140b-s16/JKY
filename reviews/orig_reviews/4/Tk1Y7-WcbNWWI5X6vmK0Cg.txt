We go to this place often it has great food! I love the fact that they offer you the three types of dips with the chips! The Pollo Fundido is my favorite and I get it pretty much every time unless I'm feeling adventurous and I am never led astray. The only reason why this isn't a 5 start review is because when you need extra chips it's .99 but we never get it anyway...cuz they usually load you up pretty good the first time.
