Canteen was pretty cool. 

I popped in after an evening of shenanigans in Scottsdale because I was meeting up with someone down in Tempe, and we decided to hit up Mill. 

Canteen was our first stop, mostly because it seemed like a decent place to grab a couple drinks, listen to some music, and watch the hot messes from ASU.

There's no cover or dress code (clearly), so anyone can get in. Having said that, it does get crowded here at night, particularly after midnight. 

You have to kind of jimmy your way into the front of the bar to grab a drink, so be assertive, make eye contact with the bartender and order quick, otherwise someone else will. 

The layout of Canteen is pretty cool, there's a dance floor adjacent to the bar, and a fairly large outdoor patio (which is jam packed). My only gripe with the outside area is that it was hot, so some misters would've been clutch.

The crowd is pretty cool, although you can tell that this is where people are before they graduate and end up in Old Town Scottsdale. Baby-douches! Ha.

Drinks aren't inexpensive, and you are probably paying for the atmosphere, but it's still a fun place to bring someone. 

I'd come back, but probably earlier to try the food. If it's a sister restaurant to La Bocca, then it can't be all bad, could it?
