I have driven past this place numerous times. Today I decided to stop in for lunch. 

Entering the building one immediately gets a feel of urban contemporary.  Great ambiance but not stuffy.

The menu is small but very nice. The salsas are excellent.  We tried five different ones. The cilantro lime was my favorite. 

I wasn't surprised at the prices.  It seemed appropriate for the location. I was surprised however at the portions.  The tacos are served on small shells. The gourmet are about $4.50 each and the regular ones are $2.50. What really surprised me was $2.50 for a non refillable diet coke. Lunch for two, with tip, was $36.00. We also ordered chips. 

I left still hungry but satisfied. The food is excellent.  I will go back but may have a small snack first.
