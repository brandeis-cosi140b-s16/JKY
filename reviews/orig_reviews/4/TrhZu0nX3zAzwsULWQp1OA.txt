I love this place.  

I have had only a couple poor experiences with food here. One was a veggie burrito, What the hell was I thinking?  It blew.  Everything else I have had here has been amazing.  My personal favorite is the Chicken Quesadilla it is a taste de force.  The tacos are all the bomb diggity.  They are exactly like street tacos you would get in Mexico or from a taco stand on the streets in Phoenix.

Another good thing about this place, unlike other taco stand type places I have patronized, this one has never turned my GI tract into a Wal-Mart the day after thanksgiving. You know, lot's of traffic and little to show for it when the day is done.

Another Yelper said that a "good looking family" owns Mi Casita.  I will translate this for you.  He really meant to say "The family that owns this place has a  smoking hot daughter."  I have stared into her eyes many time trying to remember what in the world I came in for.  She has eyes like the lady in the famous National Geographic cover photo.

Go to this place.

Mmm.... I am starving.
