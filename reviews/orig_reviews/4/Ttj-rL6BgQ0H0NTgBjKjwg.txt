Yummy, yummy burritos! I've done Phat Burrito mostly for lunch. One of the offices where I used to work would make it into a Friday lunch trip out now and then. The lines were always long, but we were on the clock, so the lines were kind of nice.

I love, love, love the salsa bar. The hot stuff is really hot, so watch out for it if you're a wuss. It's fun being able to determine for yourself if you've got enough salsa or not...I hate when Mexican places dole it out to you. End the salsa tyranny!

My favorite dish is the vegetarian quesadilla. It's loaded with stuff, and the vegetables are nicely cooked before they go into the quesadilla. There's some kind of juice that drips out, which is exciting because then you can sop it up with the outside of the tortilla. I have a whole technique...I should upload a video. Can we do that here?
