Diablo's is a fun place to hang out and have drinks with friends if you want to be somewhat outdoors and have a view of the strip. The outdoor seating is fully covered but opened to the Vegas air. You can enjoy the excitment of Vegas but comfortably seated at a table drinking big schooners of drinks with friends. I love coming here! Especially when you get great seats outdoors. Diablos has a great lively atmosphere. Shocking to find at the Monte Carlo, but being in the middle of the strip is something to hoot about. Their drinks aren't terribly strong but that's the fun about  those big fruity drinks. Get some extra shots if you're looking for a little extra. Their nachos were mile high and delicous. For $14 I'm glad to see that it was a huge plate of food.

I'm a fan! And will be back for sure!
