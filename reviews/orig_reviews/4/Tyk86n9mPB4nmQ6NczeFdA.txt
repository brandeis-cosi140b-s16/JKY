Terrific, fresh and creative NEW Mexican dishes prepared expertly from a rather extensive menu.  The breakfast items are served til 10:30 and then the chips are put out for added pleasure with the 3 tasty salsas. I'm from Boston and never appreciated spicy dishes but LA raised Hubby does.  We both leave sated and smiling every time which is, lately, twice a week.  Now that the owner has added a wondrous green chile cheeseburger once a week we are guaranteed to be there on Tuesdays, rain or shine.  Friends, I dream about this burger! All aspects of this meal are delectable including the meat, the bun, the fries and the green chile sauce. The only reason I'm not giving New Mexican Grill the 5 stars it deserves for quality and taste is a bit of inconsistency.  Today's burger was delicious but with a different sauce and the fries were not as crisp and light as previous weeks.  It was still a wonderful meal as were all the others we've had in the last year: Savoy meat stuffed burritos and chimichangas, lighter taco salads, green chile pork stew, machaca beef nachos with green chile sauce.  All were worth writing home about! 
Some of the very special places in our world can be hard to find and New Mexican Grill's lack of signage puts it in that category.  I happen to believe this adds to its cool factor.  You will not find this little treasure unless you know where to look!
