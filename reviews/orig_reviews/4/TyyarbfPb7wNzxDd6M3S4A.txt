MY WIFE AND i HAD A WONDERFUL DINNER EXPERIENCE

food was great, very authentic mexican. we shared a starter of beef questadia. for main i had the sow roast porc which was a little on the dry side i must admit however the plate was beautiful, the meat was still very tasty and all the side dishes, salsa, avocado, sauces etc were very good.
my wife had the fish tacos which were very good as well

couple of beers later and we were at $90 however everything was very delicious, its a famous place by a top chef master participant so all in all i guess we really enjoyed the food, the service the experience and the authentic feel of mexico

we recommend!
