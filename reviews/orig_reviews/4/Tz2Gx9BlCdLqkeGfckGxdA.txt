I went here with Jessica M. the other night while in PGH. The place was really loud due to the Steelers game on the TV. Unbearably loud really. The seitan tacos were most excellent. The chicken soup was huge, but I could barely find any chicken in it. The two drinks I had were strong and tasty. I loved the dreadlocked lady bartenders. One has a really neat tattoo of a bridge outside of Pittsburgh. I will definitely head back here the next time I'm in Pittsburgh hopefully when the weather is warmer so I can hang outside on the patio.
