Randomly driving off the strip and happen to spot this place. The bean dip tasted just like typical frijoles so i wasn't that impressed, but it was good. I had 3 tacos de chorizo and they were super delicious! The chorizo was piled high on these which was a nice surprise. My plate came with more beans and some rice both good. The sopa de fideo wasn't bad either but I love my mom's better :) the service was awesome. Our waiter was super courteous and came frequently to refill our drinks. The place is very nicely decorated with authentic Mexican decor and the Spanish music (Vicente Fernandez) playing in the background just added more charm and authenticity to this good Mexican restaurant. I'd definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Vegas.
