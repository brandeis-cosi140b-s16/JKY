Well....I spend a lot of money on restaurants and eat at the best and the best dives. This one is close to the top of my list. It would get 5 stars if they had indoor eating, I froze my butt off but  the food really warmed me up couple that with the price and you've got a real winner here. Communal tables make for interesting conversations. Fish Taco's were a disappointment, maybe because they are not fried...tasted too "fishy", not like Rubio's. Parking sucks but park down the street and walk, it's well worth it.
