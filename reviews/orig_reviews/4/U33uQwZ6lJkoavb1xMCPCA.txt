Haven't had a bad meal or cocktail here.  Wait staff is better than average.  
However, last night, it took 20 minutes to get our cocktails and 30 minutes for dessert to arrive.  Granted, it was a busy Saturday night, but the bar and kitchen should have been staffed up.
We did make a complaint to the manager and his response was appropriate.
