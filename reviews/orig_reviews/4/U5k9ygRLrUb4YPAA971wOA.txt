Vegas + Mexican Food = A good time for me. Came here solo while on a business trip. I had made a reservation at check in and was seated promptly when I arrived.  Service was very friendly and attentive. Chips and salsa were a nice compliment to my potent margaritas and there was great people watching. The food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but I kept it simple and ordered a taco/enchilada combo. To be honest, after the first margarita, I could have been eating taco bell and been happy, ha! But the food was good and I had to take my third margarita "to-go" (gotta love Las Vegas!!)  A little pricey, but that's to be expected at any Vegas resort.  Next time, I'll try something a little more fancy and unique ... with a nice margarita to go with it, naturally!
