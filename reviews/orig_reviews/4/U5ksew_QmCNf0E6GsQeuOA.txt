We went here on Cinco de Mayo. Fortunately, I was able to make a reservation for 4 two hours in advance.

When we got there and found that the food was Southwestern/New Mexico style instead of Mexican, I had mixed emotions. On the one hand, Yelp said this was Mexican food, and it was definitely New Mexico-inspired, Hatch chile-laden cuisine. However, we just got back from Santa Fe and Albuquerque a few weeks ago and were eager to get some more of the cuisine we had there.

I have two friends that ripped Blue Adobe Grill to shreds with their reviews, mostly because of the service. Fortunately, I didn't have 30 people in my party, so the service was a bit better. But to say it was great would definitely be lying. Service was slow but adequate...and probably cost this rating the fifth star.

But the food was absolutely incredible. All four of us were impressed! The chiles made the food spicy hot...but not at the expense of flavor. The meats in our dishes were incredibly tender, including the shrimp in my enchilada. Shrimp is so often overcooked and tough...but not this dish.

Additionally...some of the best chips and salsa you'll ever eat is right here. 

If you're used to Taco Bell...skip this place. But if you like good food, spicy food, and don't mind being a little patient with service...this is the place.
