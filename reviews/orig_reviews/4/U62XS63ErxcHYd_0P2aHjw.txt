Solid three and a half stars, rounded up because I am feeling magnanimous today . Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans). 

Being a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn "tortilla" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.

My SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.

The location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me). 

Overall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time...
