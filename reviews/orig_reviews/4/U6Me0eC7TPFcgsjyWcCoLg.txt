So I decided to try Sabor again (that's not to say that my first time was horrible or anything, but it wasn't stellar).

I can safely say that this trip changed my views on it. I ordered the same burrito (steak three amigos burrito) and it's as if it came from a different place compared to last time. The meats were seasoned and juicier than last time, everything just tasted so much better together than last time when it seemed a little bland.

Again, I'm not saying I had a bad experience the first time I ate, I'm just saying this visit improved on what I had last time.
