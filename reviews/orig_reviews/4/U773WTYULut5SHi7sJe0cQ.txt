this place surprised me. I had tried it once a while back and ordered the wrong thing. I just ordered the grilled steak burrito with spicy sauce - very tasty and good. Salads are very good as well. stay away from the sweet meats and sauces (too sugary) and not savory. for some reason many places are going with these ultra sweet sauces and sweet marinated meats.
