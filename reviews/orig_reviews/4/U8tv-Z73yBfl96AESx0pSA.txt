What a great neighborhood spot!  Checked this place out for the first time tonight after hearing about it from a friend.  It is a small place with a Mom n Pop feel.  We tried the Bacon Paradise Burger - delicious, fresh, and very reasonably priced.  The jalapeno ranch was tasty.  We also tried the Brulee burger which had a fried egg and burnt sugar on it - was alright, not my favorite.  The french fries are seasoned and done well.  Overall, a great experience and a refreshing type of place for this area.  I'll be back for sure.
