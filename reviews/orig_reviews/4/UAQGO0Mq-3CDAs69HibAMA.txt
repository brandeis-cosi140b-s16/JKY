 After a disappointing taco experience a week ago, I wanted to erase that memory with someplace better.  Taco y Taco definitely fit the bill.  Making last minute plans with the b/f and BFF, the three of us met up for dinner around 7:00pm on a Thursday night. 

MENU SUMMARY:
 Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls, elote (corn on the cob), fries, nachos, mulas, and vampiros.  I don't know what a mula is, but we found out that a vampiro is made up of two crispy tortillas with cheese and your choice of meat in the middle.
 The meats: al pastor, asada, pollo, tripas, carnitas, cesos, cabeza, lengua, trompa, suadero, buche, and chorizo.  Vegetarians have an option of soy chorizo and panela (pasteurized cheese).  

 We were offered a sample of their al pastor when we first approached the counter; this is what it's supposed to taste like!  Whatever I had last week did not compare to this flavorful meat.  I ultimately opted for two asada tacos and the elote, Mexican street style.  Those choices cost less than $7.  There is a salsa bar available so you can jazz things up if you want, as well.  I had my tacos made simply, with onions, cilantro, and salsa and they were both delicious.  The mere fact that they offer elote alone will keep me coming back:  I love that stuff.  For $2, I got a very large ear of corn on a stick with everything, which means mayo (yes, mayo), cheese, and chili powder:  fabuloso!  
 The place is spacious and clean and the staff is very personable.  We stayed for over 2.5 hours, enjoying their food and our conversation.  Definitely look forward to another visit soon;  barato y delicioso!
