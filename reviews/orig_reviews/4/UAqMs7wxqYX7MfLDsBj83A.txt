I'm a Cafe Rio fan! Everything here is tasty and fresh. They make their own tortillas and it's one of the best I've ever had. I really like the chicken quesadilla with green sauce. The salads are delicious! They are lined with fresh tortilla and served with a heaping amount of lettuce and a good amount of the protein of your choice. I usually get the sweet pork barbacoa. The salads usually make two meals for me. As far as dressings, the creamy avocado one is the best. If you have kids, they'll give you a complimentary kid sized quesadilla...just ask! Cafe Rio's chicken tortilla soup is pretty good. The horchata is pretty good and so is the minty lemonade. Be on the lookout for coupons in the mail or online. There is usually one floating around for buy 1, get 1 free salad or burrito.
