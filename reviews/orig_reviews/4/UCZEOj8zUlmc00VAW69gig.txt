Went here today as a spur of the moment yelp spot.   Was looking for something around Charleston and the I-15 area and lo and behold i found this place.

My first impression was how fancy the place was.  You're ok if you dress casual but you'd feel a lot more comfortable if you wore something a little more dressy.  Like a button up or something of that nature. I walked in with a T-Shirt and jeans thinking it was a casual restaurant and was surprisingly mistaken.

Ambiance is Very classy romantic.  Would be a good place to get to be able to talk and get to know a date.  They have unique chandeliers hanging from the ceilings and a wall of dim lights that gives it that romantic feel

Service was great and very accommodating.  For the ladies the waiter would place the napkin on the ladies lap and all that fancy jazz.  While i can learn to love the feeling i know the ladies felt funny about it knowing we were feeling underdressed.  They were very prompt on refilling drinks and making sure we were very comfy.

Food was delicious.  I ordered the shrimp diablo.  It was filling, packed with flavor and heat (as something with the word diablo in the name should!)   The rice it was served with i felt accompanied the dish very well. My friend ordered the Sea scallops with the mango relish and was in love with that as well.  We all felt full but not quite full where we were uncomfortable.  So it was justly sized portions.

Price of the place is on the high end of the $$.  Typically entree's ranged from 20- 40$ 

Overall i liked the place a lot and would consider a date here if i'm on that side of town.  Maybe a nice stop to fill up before first friday or something.
