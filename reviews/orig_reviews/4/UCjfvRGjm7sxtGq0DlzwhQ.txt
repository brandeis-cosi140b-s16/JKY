I have never been disappointed with America's Taco Shop. I love this place... 

The vegetarian quesadilla, beans, guacamole and salsa are all staples for me. And I just LOVE that they have lard-free re-fried beans...  At most places,  if you want vegetarian, you have to get whole beans or black beans... 

The co-chata (half coffee, half horchata) is seriously amazing.... They also have one of the best margaritas I've had in quite a while, which was surprising to me... Even better that its low-cal and on tap. 

I guess the only thing that would make this 5 stars is if it were slightly cheaper... but whatever, I'm always willing to pay for good food!
