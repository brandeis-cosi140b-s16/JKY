I really enjoyed this place!  The BF and I stopped in for Happy Hour, and ended up staying for dinner.  Really cute place....great decor!  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Good margaritas, good chips and salsa.  I checked in and tried to use the free chips and salsa check in offer, but our server said since it was our first time in, chips and salsa were complimentary!  Great food too!  All in all, great experience and we can't wait to go back!
