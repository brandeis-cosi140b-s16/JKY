Overall, a great place to hang out.  The chips were a little stale but the corn salsa had large chunks of tomato which made it extra special.  The Tavarua Wahoo Tacos were very tasty and had just the right amount of heat.  We sat on the veranda since it was a nice evening.  The service was great - constantly checking on us.  The noise level inside was on the higher side.  The Nectar of the Gods margarita went down very fast.  My only disappointment was that they don't serve any Johnny Walker!!!
