This location is vastly superior to the Henderson location!

The food is more flavorful and the service is really, really good. I've always ordered combinations and haven't been disappointed. Also, the "Burro Bionico" is very tasty! I'd advise coming here when very hungry, as the portions are enormous. 

This is my go-to when visitors tell me they want Mexican food. It always gets rave reviews!
