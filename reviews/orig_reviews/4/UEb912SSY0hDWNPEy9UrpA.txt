Looking for an organic Mexican restaurant?  This is the place!  They even describe it on the first page of their menu.  Usually have the taco platter as the carne asada, carnitas and al pastor are all great choices!  Full bar is great and love the locals discount on Mondays.  They sure know how to take care of the locals.  Nice late night spot if you're looking for a place passed midnight!
