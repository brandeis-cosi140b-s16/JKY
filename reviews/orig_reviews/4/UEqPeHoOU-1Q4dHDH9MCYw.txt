In my opinion you don't get better Mexican food than Los Olivos.

It is fun to get the Old Town Scottsdale feel and it really has a pretty outdoor area.

A little bit of a sketchy part of town, but the food is definitely worth it. 

The wait staff can sometimes be cranky, and the restaurant a little dirty but it is wonderful authentic Mexican food.

The Tamales and Enchiladas are out of this world.

One down side is that they start charging you for chips after basket number 2, which is a disappointment but the food is still worth it to me. 

Decently priced too. I would definitely recommend anyone who loves authentic Mexican food to go here.
