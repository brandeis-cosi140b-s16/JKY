The short rib tacos were very good, almost a little sweet but very good none the less. I do wish the hot tacos were a bit spicier but everyone's palette is different. The chips and salsa were pretty phenomenal, freshly cooked chips and salsa spicy enough to stand up and take notice. The one thing that really brings the rating down is price, for the size of the taco, I think they were a little pricey. Model customer service means I would go back
