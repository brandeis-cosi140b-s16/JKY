I have mixed feelings about El Hefe. I'm a huge fan of Dia de los Muertes so I'm instantly fan of their deccor and ambiance. It's 75% inside 25% patio with full exposure to the patio.

Now my first experience was somewhat awful. It was late on a Saturday night and the place was packed like sardines. If you thought you were going to take a step to the patio for some fresh air, think again. You'd be lucky if you made it out there or found room to stand. I think I learned that night, you just can't bring a big crowd to this location on a 'busy' Scottsdale evening. 

Second experience was Happy Hour! I believe it's from 4-7 and they have a great happy hour menu for both men and women. I'm a bit partial to their Beer-goritas. , which is a 32 oz margarita and a coronita upside down in it! I love it, I think presentation sucked me in. Yea I'm a sucker.

The tables with the taps on them seem pretty sweet, and made me think about possibly holding my bday party there but the seating is limited and the booths just arent that big. 

They have a lot of creative and unique margaritas to choose from and I definitely plan on making a few visits back but debateable on if this is a good birthday setting or not...
