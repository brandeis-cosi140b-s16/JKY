grab a nice cold margarita on one of the hippest hidden patios around.  Frank and Lupe's has been serving up some of the best Mexican food in a town overflowing with Mexican restaurants for over 25 years now. Located on the corner of Marshall Way and Indian School, Frank and Lupe's features authentic Mexican dishes such as Carne Adobada, Shrimp Enchiladas or Chili Relleno.  But the real treat awaits out back.

For those of you who know about the back patio (or discovered it on accident while searching for the bathrooms) we don't need to say anything else. For the rest of you, skip the small restaurant up front and head in back for one of the best outdoor experiences around.  I love to grab the Chicken Mole Enchiladas (fabulous) with a ginormous  (yes it is in the Webster dictionary now) margarita on the rocks and enjoy the great weather Scottsdale has to offer. The back patio is hidden from the traffic and pedestrians of Marshall way and offers a south of the border feeling when you want a little retreat.  What better place to enjoy a time out!

Need a real treat? Skip the Sopaipillas and try a Xango. What is a Xango you ask? A deep fried cheesecake rolled in a flour tortilla!
