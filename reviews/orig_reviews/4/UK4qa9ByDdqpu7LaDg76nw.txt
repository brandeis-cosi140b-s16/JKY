I had been waiting to try this place for YEARS since coming to town from Raleigh for a concert, but its always so packed when we're there. I finally discovered they do take out, so we by-passed the hour wait (at 8:30 on Friday night) and ordered food at the bar. We got chips and the amazing tomatillo salsa while we waited, and luckily, by the time the food came out (which wasn't long), two seats opened up at the bar and we got to eat there. And lemme tell you... It was well worth the wait. The beer battered tacos were out of this world. My husband had the mahi, which I liked on its own, but liked my taco more. The avocado pasta salad was the winning side- my black beans and rice were a little bland. But overall, it definitely lived up to the hype!
