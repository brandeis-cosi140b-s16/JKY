No need to be scared. Read the menu, figure out what you want, and get in the designated lines to get your tacos. The idea of splitting the tacos into groups and getting people to order from a certain person is genius. Instead of one long line, the customer can bypass it and just get what they want before heading to the cashier to pay.

Yet again we were the minority. I am beginning to enjoy this. When the menu does not tell me exactly what I am eating and the other patrons are of the ethnicity, the food must be A1. I came here with my sister and some of her co-workers. Since she is about to leave town, we have been knocking off her bookmarks in blocks. Today, it was time to get some tacos that have united the Yelp world. 

My fundamental Spanish was enough to understand that I wanted tongue and head meat filled corn tortillas. They are definitely the stand out of my meal. The meat was tender and melt in your mouth. No gaminess and all flavor. I could eat a tray full of these alone. Then my sister got the shaved meat and carne asada. The Adobada is just as good as everyone has made it out to be. With the shaved pineapple only makes it that much better. The steak taco was nothing spectacular and was my least favorite. I know now that it is all about the leftover proteins. If I stick to these, it would be a solid meal. Add a horchata to wash it all down and I have never been happier. Four tacos and a drink was only a little over $10.
