I will start off by saying that Tacos El Gordo is EXTREMELY clean for a mexican restaurant, and I say this with all my love for mexican restaurants and mexican food. 

Now that we got that out of the way, the tacos are pretty amazing.  I had the lengua (tongue) tacos, and I must say they were probably the best tongue tacos I have had by far, and I have had quite a few lengua tacos.  The tongue was prepared to the almost-perfect texture, and as my dining companion has described it, the tongue "was clean" - pure tongue meat. 

And, of course, the adobada tacos were also very delicious.  The grilled pineapple highlights the flavors of the meat and becomes a pleasant surprise in the mouth.  

We also had the carne asada, which I thought was quite tasty; however, it was not spectacular.  

One thing about Tacos El Gordo is that it is a bit pricey compared to its competition.  At $2.50 a pop for the lengua taco, it is definitely on the high-end side.  

Then again, you get what you pay for!  Me gustan tacos!
