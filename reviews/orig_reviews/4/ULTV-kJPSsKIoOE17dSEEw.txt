Great happy hour. Select items half price!

Had the chicken nachos which were enough to share with 3 or 4 people.  We also order cheese crisp thing with guacamole a bit salty, but was still quite tasty.

The margaritas were sweet and refreshing which was key since it was 113 outside!  

Service was could have been more attentive, but our server was friendly and the food came right out.  

What I liked was the group table in the bar.  So much better than sitting at the bar because it allows you to sit across from someone you want to talk to and share food with.  The restaurant had a nice vibe to it too.
