If you like hot and spicy, look no further.

Los Dos Molinos was a place somewhat discovered by just driving by on our way back from South Mountain Park.  The place had a festive ambiance to it so we decided to give it a shot.

The food did not disappoint.  As I mentioned, if you're into spicy flavors, this place has it.  I had the enchiladas with red sauce which was a great selection.  Service was also top notch. 

Had a great experience here and would highly recommend.
