I love sabor. They definitely have the best shrimp burrito in town. I love their tacos too. The veggie is delicious, as is the shrimp and chicken. 

But, there are a couple of pretty big negatives: 1) they always mess something up in my order. I don't know if it's the staff or their computer system or what, but what comes out has rarely ever been exactly what I ordered. 2) it's pretty dirty. This doesn't actually bother me that much, but it can be a little on the grimy side. On the plus side though, in addition to delicious food, the staff are always accommodating about fixing my orders. It adds about 10 minutes to my wait, and it can suck when my friend's order comes out fine the first time around and we have to wait for mine (or vice versa) but they do always correct it. 

I am happy sabor is here in the neighborhood and hope that they get a better system for making the orders! And maybe a better cleaning method too.
