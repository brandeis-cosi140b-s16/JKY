I am confident that this place will garner a fifth star with subsequent visits.  My problem is that I can never make it past the bakery counter.  My sweet tooth always takes over and by the time it is satisfied I haven't the appetite to try the more savory options.  This place maintains its authenticity while creating an atmosphere that would rival anything put out by Fox or Upward Projects.
