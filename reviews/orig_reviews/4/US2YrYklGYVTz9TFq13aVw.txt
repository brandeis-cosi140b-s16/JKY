This place has a very nice atmosphere. It has a beach theme going on, with sand on the patio, tables shaped like surf boards, and two canopies on either end of the patio. Food was great as well. My only complaint would be the service is very poor, we waited for quite some time before anyone even acknowledged us and our waiter was not friendly. Also, we wanted to sit on the patio for the beach atmosphere but the smoking on the patio is very bothersome for those who don't smoke!
