AMAZING Tequila selection. Met a friend for an early dinner on the patio. Chips and salsa starters are great.  I had the seafood taco, she had the steak. Both were excellent in taste and size. Prices are a little high, but if you want cheap, Super Burrito is across the street. Great looking place and patio. Service from bartender was friendly.
