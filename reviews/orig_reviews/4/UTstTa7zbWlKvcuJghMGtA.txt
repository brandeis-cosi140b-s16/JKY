Great food and decor but pricey Mexican food.

I have been here several times and the service has always been good even when we had a larger party.  The food is tasty but over priced in my opinion. The ceviche is $18 and the guacamole is $10.  At that price point the portions were entirely too small especially to share.  We had to order several of each. I ordered the carne y camerones which was $60. Very tasty but expensive!  If you are looking for casual Mexican this is not the place.  If you are looking for tasty expensive Mexican food and you want to impress your date then this is your spot.  

The ambiance is great as it is open to the casino so you can easily people watch. If you have s large group and its the weekend I would suggest making a reservation.  You can also order food at the bar or the lounge area.
