always on the hunt for a new taco spot, i stopped in here last night. tried the suadero tacos and mulitas with chorizo. the tacos were exceptional- the suadero was way juicy and there was some spicy sauce on them too. awesome. first time having a mulita. like a quesadilla sandwich i would say. anyway the mulita was good, but i consider myself a bit of a chorizo connoisseur and i have definitely had better. not bad though. place was way clean. girl was even outside windexing the windows when i walked in past midnight.
