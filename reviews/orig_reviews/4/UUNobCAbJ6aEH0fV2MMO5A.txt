Interesting menu.  Definitely something neat.  I think it got a bit built up from what I heard.  It's really between and a 3 and a 4 star for me, but I think the uniqueness of the place and the pretty good prices give it a 4 star.  I'm interested in trying some other food from here and see what else I may like.
