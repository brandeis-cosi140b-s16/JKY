Sunday Brunch.  11:00.  Arrived, "walked the [plywood] plank" through the construction outside of the parking lost.  There was a 20-minute wait for a table but we lucked out and took the last 2 seats at the bar.  

I smiled when I ordered a bloody mary and the bartender informed me that my bloody mary came with a free 3oz shooter of the beer of my choice (had to go with my girl, Stella).  $6.50 for a cocktail and an "appetizer" drink?  Quite the steal. 

The food was fantastic--I followed the Yelp advice and got the green chile enchiladas + eggs (next time I will get both enchiladas with the shrimp, and order the eggs over easy instead of scrambled).  The friend I was with ordered the breakfast burrito.  Both of our dishes were VERY tasty and HUGE -- I ate about half and made another meal out of it later in the day.  I think all the brunch dishes were $9-$14, but with the huge portions and cheap drinks, it was a steal.

By the time we left there was a long wait just to get a seat at the bar, much less a table so we definitely beat the rush.

I will make a point to get back here for dinner ASAP!
