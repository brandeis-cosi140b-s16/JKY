I was in town for a conference and found Fuego CityScape through Yelp for my dinner plans. I'm so glad I checked Yelp! 

It has a very fun, hip atmosphere. The Prickly Pear Mojito was excellent and the Fuego Margarita with jalape√±o-infused tequila was very good as well. 

The veggie nachos came piled high and my friend and I couldn't finish them and the very tasty Fuego Tacos with tilapia. 

The Happy Hour/Patio pricing is very good. I highly recommend this place.
