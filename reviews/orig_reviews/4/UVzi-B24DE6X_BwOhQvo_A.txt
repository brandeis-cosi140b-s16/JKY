This place is a little different than your typical Mexican food joint. I say that because the tacos are actually pretty big. They're not like your usual tacos that you need like 8 of them to get filled up, here you're good with just one or two. 

Their quesadillas are amazing though. There's a semi-thin layer of cheese and it's cooked on a flat top so it is extra crispy. And every table has a bottle of green salsa, which is not too spicy, but if you do want spicy you can just ask for it at the counter.

Other items on the menu include burritos, tortas, sopes, and much more. And of course can't forget your jamaica, horchata, and tamarindo
