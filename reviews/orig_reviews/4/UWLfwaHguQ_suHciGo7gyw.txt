BEST TACO EVER!  - Barrio Pollo & Chorizo -   I wanted to try a few tacos and get a variety, and this one was far better than the rest!  Don't bother with the other interesting ingredients and titles.  So straight to the bold party on your palate.    

Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really was the best taco I have ever had.    Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really great!   The other tacos had interesting titles, but seemed bland & boring.....Ehhh? 

That why this is a 4 star review.

Barrios also has 3 jars of tequila, mescal & jamaica which they keep displayed.  We tried the tequila and mescal and they were wonderful!  The Tequila & Mescal were unusual & good.  They liquors are hard liquor, so be ready for a strong drink which one should sip and savor.  NOT flavored but infused with the actual peppers.  The pepper Tequila was quite hot.  If you like spicy, this is perfect for sipping on a cold night.  It warms you from within. 

I am no connoisseur.  I just like bold in your face flavors.  Barrios has bold flavors if you stick with these recommendations.
