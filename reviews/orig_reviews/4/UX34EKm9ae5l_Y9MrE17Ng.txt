Located right down the hall from the convention center and the Michael One show, this is a great location. You can sit at the tables overlooking the pool, pull up a stool at the bar or tale the food to go. Everything is a little pricy, but the food was worth it! Dining in is a little dressier at night, especially with the crowd who is going to a show that night.

We tried the steak quesadillas and the chicken nachos. The steak quesidillas were good. They were gooey with big chunks of steak and a side of sour cream and guac. Yum! The real winner though...the nachos! Flavored chips piled high with loads of cheese, beans, chicken, sour cream, guac, and pico. They were delicious. I really appreciated the quality of the cheese. No processed cheese here!
