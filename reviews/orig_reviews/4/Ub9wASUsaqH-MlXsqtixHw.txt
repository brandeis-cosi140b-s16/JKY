Not to be confused with  Luncha Libre Food Truck - this place is located just south of North Mountain on 7th St. Great Tacos! and home of the 1lb burrito - this thing is massive!

If it's your 1st time be sure to ask to sample all of the meats; they offer a nice variety of Mexican-style meats, from barbacoa to carnitas, pastor and adobada.

The atmosphere is also entertaining with the bright colors and wrestling motif throughout; the staff is very nice and helpful- you'll be sure to enjoy dining in.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Santos!!
