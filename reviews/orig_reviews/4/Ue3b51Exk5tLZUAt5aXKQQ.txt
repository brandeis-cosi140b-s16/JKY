Hey, it's typical Mexican fare, so don't expect gourmet. Atmosphere is family-friendly, gives you nachos to munch on; spicy bean dip--YUM! and salsa--while you are waiting for your food. They pretty much leave you alone to eat, which I am thankful for...One standout is that Raul our server was on time when we wanted anything and had it right to us. Chicken tostado soup to die for. The strawberry margarita was actually pretty good. All in all- a good place to have close by. -- I like it. I'll be baaahhhck. - :)
