This Cafe Rio is located on 215&Decatur near the Wells Fargo. The area is busy, so the restaurant can also get that way at times. 

Ambiance: 4 - if you haven't been to Café Rio, it has a specific look just like most fast food chains so it looks like a regular Café Rio!! however, sometimes the drink area isn't too clean.

Service: 5 - The service is actually really good here, they are really fast and efficient! Also, they speak Spanish here. 

Food: 4 - I really like their food here, especially the chicken tostada. Sometimes they forget things that I ask for on my meal! Love going here because I can buy a salad with horchata!! (and dessert!) The other big food chains can't say the same ;) 

Useful Info: if you come here a lot, you should ask for their loyalty card!!
