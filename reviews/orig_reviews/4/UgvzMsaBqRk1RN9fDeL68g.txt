Repeat customer for 20+ years...today not so impressed with staff in bar...normally Greg or Joey upbeat very personable...today no bartender to be found (apparently their day off) one server in lounge too busy cleaning tables to even notice we sat for at least 5 minutes with no drinks or salsa while he continued to clean tables around us...decided to move to main restaurant where hostess didn't even care we were waiting and asked if we wanted her to tell her staff we were there lol ... sat with Gely in main restaurant thank her for making my almost horrible experience a plus....great service attentive!!!! Get rid of who is in your bar today!!!
