Love the layout of the business. Lots of seating out side and also seating inside. Only been here twice. I would go lots more if I did not live in Peoria. They are extremely friendly and helpful when you are ordering. I have had their tacos, burrito and last time the vegetarian Quesadilla. I have found their food very fresh and tasty. I will definitely go back to see them when I am in the area. Go see them I am sure you will enjoy your meal.
