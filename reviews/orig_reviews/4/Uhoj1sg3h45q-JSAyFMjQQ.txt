It was really strange tapas style atmosphere with things coming at all different times, but I'll be back.   The one thing that I didn't get is them telling customers that the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes as 2000 of us exited the Chelsea from a concert.  Coordinate people!!!! A lot of people walked away because of that, and for the few of us that ate, the waitress was running around frantically.
