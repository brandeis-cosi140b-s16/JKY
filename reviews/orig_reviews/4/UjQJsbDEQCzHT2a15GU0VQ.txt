I dig this joint!  Stopped by because oregano's was jam packed.  So glad for that.  I had lunch with 4 buddies.  We had (Chris?), I think that is his name, (the owner of the establishment) order us 3 meals to split between 4 people.  Each of us had a drink and the bill with tip was 36bucks.  It was a Thursday in the middle of lunch hour and although I NEVER expect quick and decent service at a mexican joint, I was pleasantly surprised.  Our experience was 100% psotive and i would come back here in a heart beat.  unfortunately i cannot recall the exact meakls we had.  A fish taco of sorts...a meat taco of sorts and then another meal which 4-5 daysd later I cannot even try to describe what it was....sorry bout that.  Great experience, Great establishment..MUCH GUSTO to ya'll.
