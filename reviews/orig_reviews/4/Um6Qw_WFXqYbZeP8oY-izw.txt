Maybe I'm just not into chipotle anymore but this place was only okay in my books. 

I choose the steak salad with all the components inside. It was just kinda bland to me. I had to squeeze extra limes to get some flavor going. The steak was a little dry and over marinaded. The salad was healthy and refreshing which I liked. 

The service is great! One star extra for them because they go above and beyond to make sure you're doing okay.
