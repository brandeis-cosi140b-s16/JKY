I've eaten here 3-4 times.  I get a traditional cheeseburger that is juicy and a perfect size.  The staff has always been friendly.  I went last week and there was a long line.  Come to find out that it was on DDD.  NOOO!! Now more people know about this place.  Darn!  It is a smaller burger, but a good one with lots of choices for unique toppings.
