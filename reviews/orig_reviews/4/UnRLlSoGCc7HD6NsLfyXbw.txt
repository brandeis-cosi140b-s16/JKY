This place was great!! Located on the atrium level inside the Luxor Hotel and Casino. The atmosphere is trendy and relaxed, decorated in a minimalist style (I think that's because of all the activity that's going on around the restaurant). The only down side is that sometimes tons of people can be walking by, and a lot of them will look at you stuffing your face if you're not seated in a good spot. 

I went here with my mom while we were on a summer vacation getaway because it looked good in passing. We were seated right away, and the waitress came for our drink orders. I was upset that we weren't served chips and salsa right away like other tables. In fact, after I placed my order, my mom had to specifically ask for chips and salsa. It was like because she didn't order anything, they didn't want to give us any chips. When we did get them, they were delicious, as was the two types of salsa. 

I ordered the veggie tacos, and they were amazing! The peppers and the cheese blended really well together and it was just like a flavor explosion in my mouth. They were EXCELLENT! This is definitely one of my new favorite places to grab a quick bite whenever I'm in Vegas. 

If it wasn't for the chips and salsa mishap, I would have rated this place 5 stars (maybe nexttime). But other than that, it's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner by yourself or with a friend. If you have a larger party (4 or more) you should probably make a reservation if you can.
