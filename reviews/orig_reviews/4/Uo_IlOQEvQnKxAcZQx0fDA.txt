The chips in this place are ridiculously good!  I literally ate an entire basket myself.  We stopped here for drinks and an appetizer and were thoroughly impressed.  The Guac itself was decent, the presentation of it was really good.  I was a big fan of this place and would go back in a hurry.  One thing to be aware of is the fact that the advertisements for drink specials on the sidewalk are a little misleading, as they are only valid in the really small bar area.  Next time, I will be sure to grab my drink first in the bar area for the discounted price before I sit down.  Enjoy!
