We had been meaning to try this place for a while, but weren't sure if it would be picky-eater (aka, the kiddo) friendly so we went while the wee one was away on vacation.

It's tucked in a strip mall and the space is very small but it seems like a small operation so don't let that deter you from trying it out!

The service was more like when you go to a friend's dinner party and they're running around all crazy trying to play host/hostess... a little chaotic and sporadic but they get the job done.  Also, they are very friendly!

The food was great.  I had chicken fusion taco, the hubs had chicken fried rice, and we split the fusion bulgogi fries.  They also bring you chips and salsa to snack on while you peruse the menu.  The chicken bulgogi in the taco was delicious (btw, they are wee tacos,  so if you want to try different kinds, you could probably order 3 and have an entree-sized meal), I really enjoyed it.  We had a half order of the fries and it was plenty for 2 adults (and we both are pretty good eaters).  The fried rice was better than your standard take-out fried rice, and the hubs didn't cover it in soy sauce like he usually does.  

All in all, the food is great, next time I might just call in an order and pick it up.

They also had a note on their menu that the menu has been truncated to allow for expansion....  no indication of where the other location will be, I hope it's closer to me though!
