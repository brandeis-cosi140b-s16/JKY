We went to Sunday brunch here, and saw the menu offered a buffet brunch.  Twist on this... it's done tapas style, and there were about 20 different items on the menu to choose and the price was $34.99 per person.  

You can order as much of anything you wanted on this list, and bottomless mimosas were offered for $8 (I was told they were $12 each, so this was a great deal already).  The bottomless mimosas are only offered with the brunch, not the regular menu.

I would go back, the menu was different than the usual brunch you're used to.
