We went here the Saturday night after seeing the Fabulous Amy perform her stand up routine at Doc's Place. As soon ad we walked in at 10 until we left around 11 we were surrounded by friends, be it the staff or patrons of the bar itself. Everyone danced while the band played until close. We even got to see the owner take a dance with a tiny little old lady. To be honest, I don't have a pallet for Mexican food, until that fateful Saturday night. The food was SO GOOD. Especially the Cilantro Mousse chip dip. I will be returning soon to enjoy all that is Padre's: food, music, drinks and fun.
