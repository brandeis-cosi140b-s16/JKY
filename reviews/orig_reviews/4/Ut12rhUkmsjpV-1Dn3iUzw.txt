Early in the morning or late at night - it's always a good time for Tacos El Gordo! I eat a lot of tacos, probably too many tacos, and this place is my gold standard for taco measuring. Great authentic tacos, plus they have free guac (take note, Chipotle) and delicious quesadillas. People literally sit outside of this place waiting for it to open in the morning - it's that good. But don't be fooled, they may open the door but you still have to wait another 40 min or so to get that taco goodness in you because they still have to finish cooking it all so all you can really get when they first open the doors is a drink. It's a tease. Plan accordingly.
