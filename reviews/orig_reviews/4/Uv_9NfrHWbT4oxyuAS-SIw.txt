I tried Taco Guild again and the second experience was WAY better the second time around.  I'll definitely be going back.  The service was awesome, music wasn't as loud, food was amazing as always.  This time we sat at one of the high tops instead of a booth and I thought it was way cooler to be able to look around and check out the cool design of the place.  On this visit I tried the veggie tacos and they exceeded my expectations--they were tastier than my non-veggie tacos since they were marinated (I think?) roasted veggies.  We also ordered the corn and had them cut it in half, one of my favorites.  We ordered cocktails and if it weren't for the price to strength of the cocktail ratio I would have given them 5 stars.  The drinks were good!....But, for the price ($9-$11ish) they had less alcohol than I'd prefer.  That's an expensive drink in my opinion and I'm not splurging for a second one at that price if it's a lot of filler.
