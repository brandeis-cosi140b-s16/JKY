Great Southwestern restaurant.  The food is incredible, especially the stacked enchiladas.  Normally I do not eat heavy foods, but this was way too good to pass up.  The chips and salsa were very tasty as well.

Service was very friendly and timely.  The interior is pedestrian at best, but still a pleasant environment.
