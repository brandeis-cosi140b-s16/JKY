What's with all the negativity, yo? 

My guy and I had an amazing experience having happy hour 2-for-1 adult slushies, cheese sticks, and nachos in the bar area.  

The drinks were Steee-RONG! So tutti-frutti sweet too, which was expected. I don't normally like drinks like this - at all - but when in Vegas, you just gotta roll the dice!

We met some really fun fellow tourists here too, and had some loud, happy conversations with people from all over the world. Vegas is truly a melting pot, and Senor Frog's is a great representation of this (even if it is the epitome of a tourist spot). 

Fun. Fun. Fun!
