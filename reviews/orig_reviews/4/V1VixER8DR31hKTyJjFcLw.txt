After a long walk in a hot day in Scottdales,I decided not to go to far from my hotel so my friend and I chose Papi Chulo for dinner.From the outside it looked like an average Mexican restaurant,but when I walked in the restaurant,it was casual and cleaned restaurant with quite a.nice decor.I ordered Nachos,Margarita and Mazatlan Shrimp.I did not order my main course since the server suggested that it would be too much for me.The Nachos was quite yummy.The melted cheese and sour cream were such a good combination and the salsas was great(they served 3 kinds of salsas here).My Mazatlan Shrimp(Shrimp stuffed with Cheese wrapped with bacon and Fried and served with Rice)were surprisingly delicious.This restaurant offers variety of Margaritas if you love to drink , this restaurant is perfectly suits you.The waiter who waited on our table was very friendly.However,the restaurant should play more Mexican music than American ones. My friend and I like  Papa Chulo so much that we went back there again two days later.This time I ordered Shrimp Al Mojo and my friend ordered Chimi. 

Do not pay attention to the negative reviews here,this restaurant is still worthed to try. To me it is a nice cozy restaurant that serves delicious food, food presentation makes the food here are appealing and enticing.Slow but good and friendly service.I will come back here again if I am in Scottsdale.
