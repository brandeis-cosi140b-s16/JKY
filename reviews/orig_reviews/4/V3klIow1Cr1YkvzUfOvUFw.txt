Delicious spot in Aria - great Mexican cuisine!

Being from TX, we know a thing or two about Mexican food, and this one has  really delicious and creative options!  We had a late lunch here on a Friday afternoon before attending a show later that evening, and were greeted with friendly service and a laid back atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were fresh and spicy, the perfect accompaniment for a tangy margarita.  

The shrimp ceviche was some of the best I've ever tasted, and the taco plates are the perfect size.  My husband loved his beef tacos, and the rice and beans that came with it were flavorful and some of the best he's had outside of TX.  We definitely recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner, but be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations here on a Friday or Saturday night - I think everyone knows how good the food is here so it gets packed pretty quickly!  Cheers!
