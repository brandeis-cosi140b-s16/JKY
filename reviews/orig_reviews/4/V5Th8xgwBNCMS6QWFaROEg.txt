Been here a handful of times, never disappointed.  This trip I had the Grilled cheese with bacon and Anahiem peppers, none too shabby.  What I really like about this place is the diverse menu. If you dont feel like mexican food they got burgers and even a bacon wrapped hot dog.  I know its mexican food but i really like the fries here.  Service has always been good as well.  Good selection of beer helps too (Arrogant Bastard Ale on tap!)  Go ahead check this place out!
