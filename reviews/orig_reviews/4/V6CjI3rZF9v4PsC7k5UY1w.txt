youre in vegas, youre all party'ed out, and now you need to stuff some food down your gullet.  some real food.  not the foo foo over priced hotel cafe grub that everyone too drunk to venture decides to go to after a night of clubbing.

as long as youve got a DD, cab, or can walk to this place, youre solid.  tacos taste pretty damn authentic and to the adventurous foodies bold enough to consume the awful parts, they have it here too.

good spot, not too far from the strip, decent food.  the spot may be a little suspect late at night, with all the characters out and about on the streets, but i have no problem with it
