Rito's is as good as they say. One of my coworkers is moving in a month and we've pledged to go to Rito's at least once a week because she knows how much she'll miss it when it's gone. 

Everyone loves their green chili burro but I just wanted to put a plug in for their tostadas; I always get a bean tostada and a guacamole tostada. So delicious and flavorful but you won't get that heavy, sleepy, mid-afternoon food coma that their burros tend to induce.

I echo all the negatives prior reviewers have mentioned: the staff is often rude, they only accept cash (seriously?), it's situated in a random not-so-nice neighborhood, and there's only crappy picnic table seating. But I still think the positives outweigh these significant gripes, I just recommend taking it to go and eating it back at the office! Mmm now I'm craving a guacamole tostada...
