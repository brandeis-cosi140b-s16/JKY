Tacos El Gordo has great food. Carne Asada Fries and Pastor and Adobado Tacos were as advertised.

However, I don't care how good the food is. I'm not coming back until they fix that line situation. 

At TEG you have to get in a different line for every item you are ordering. After waiting for 15 minutes to collect all of your food, you have to fight your way back through the line toward the cashier, near the exit. Then, after paying for your food, you fight your way back through the line to the far corner of the room to fill up your drink. Then, you fight your way back through the line again and hopefully you can find a seat in the always packed dining room. 

It's just not worth the hassle. And if you can't speak spanish, I would bring someone who can. It will make things a whole lot easier.
