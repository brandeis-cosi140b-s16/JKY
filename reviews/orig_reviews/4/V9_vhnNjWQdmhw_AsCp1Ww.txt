I really wanted to find Mexican in Las Vegas, but there were so many places and reviews that we just came here since it was close to our hotel. Our waiter was Mexican, and had some good recommendations about what was good. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about eh menu. Also, I got enchiladas and they had 4 or 5 sauces to choose from based on spice-level. I got the mild mole and they were awesome! And even though it was $18, it seemed worth it since there were 3 of them, plus a huge heap of rice and beans. Given Vegas overpricing, it was definitely a decent value. The chips and salsa was $3 and good, so we didn't mind spending the 3 bucks. We didn't drink because we were too exhausted and dehydrated (1st day in Vegas- walked way too much!), but overall we were happy with our decision to try this place!
