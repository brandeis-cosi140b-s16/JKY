I will always preface my Mexican restaurant reviews by saying I'm originally from L.A. and there are no Mexican restaurants in L.V. that can hold a candle to the ones in L.A.

I usually end up at Bonito or Lindo Michoacan when I'm in the mood for Mexican.  They are the safest bets in town.  More likely than not I'll end up at Bonito, mainly because it's closer to my house and I'm lazy.

The service is great. The waiters and bussers are all very attentive and friendly. They're always ready with a refill of whatever you need.

I do the same thing every time I eat at a restaurant that serves chips and salsa.  I fill up on that, so by the time my dinner comes I'm full, so the great thing is that I can usually  share a meal with my dining partner and save money.  Haha

The food is pretty good on the whole. I shy away from the combination platters, since they're relatively generic. I enjoy the fried fish and some of the spicier chicken dishes as well as the fajitas. 

You can't forget the decor either. Clowns, clowns and more clowns. I love it.

Top your meal off with a yummy mixed drink and your golden.
