Met here for Smunch right about opening time.  Without even getting in to the food the feel of the place was great.  Spring was in the air and the doors were open to the patio with more seating out there.  Our service was great the whole time for a party of around 10.

We had a large enough group several items on the menu got tried.  I had the enchiladas and they let me have one of each.  They were both good.  Normally they serve it with both red and green sauce, next time I would ask for all red as I preferred it.  The salsas and guacamole were great.  The only thing lackluster to me was the beans.  Of those that had tacos it seemed like the fish came in last with shredded beef winning the day.  All of them were good, just in different degrees.

This is just a wonderful spot to gather on a spring day in Phoenix.
