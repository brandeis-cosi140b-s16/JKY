After walking back and forth the strip, I was hungry. I only had a 730am breakfast burrito from the OAK airport all day. By 930pm, I was ready to bite someone's arm. LOL Anyways, I ordered their Chicken Tortilla Soup, a Large Strawberry Margarita and Shredded Beef Enchiladas. I didn't know their soup was in a huge bowl. It was a meal by itself already. So, I only ate one of the enchiladas and boxed the rest to go. The food was good. The place was noisy and crowded. Service was friendly and attentive. Chips weren't free! Boo! I guess there's nothing free in Vegas. Go to the Bay Area and there are tons of free chips. Overall, it was fun. Would I go back? Probably, after I tried the other restaurants around it.
