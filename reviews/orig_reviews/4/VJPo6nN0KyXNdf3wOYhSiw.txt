This place has amazing chicken flautas. I love, love, love them. The rice is especialy flavorful. It's nice that you can sit down in a casual environment but they still bring the food to you...the serve complimentary chips and hot sauce, but their "veggie" salsa--really just regular salsa is delicious instead but you have to pay for it. The guacamole is just okay...it's pretty much just the mashed avacado with nothing else in it. Very reasonably priced. If I could make one suggestion it would be to include all white meat or at least offer it as an option. The meat in the pollo fundido is kind of iffy.
