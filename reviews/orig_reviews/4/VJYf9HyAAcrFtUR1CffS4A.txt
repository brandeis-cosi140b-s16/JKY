This is a hometown favorite! the chips and salsa are yummy and totally addicting (be warned the salsa stays with you until the next day ;P) My favorite items to order are:

1)  Old Pueblo nachos w/ green chili (share this, it's huge!) Fully loaded with tons of everything you want on your nachos- fresh chips, green chili, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, sr. cream, guac,... You will crave these for weeks after having them! 

2)  The shredded chicken bowl with grilled veggies (add cheese!) this is an off menu item, but they always serve it. A great 'healthy' choice ;) A perfect portion of seasoned chicken, onions, peppers, tomatoes (and cheese!) 

3) The veggie quesadilla- stuffed full of yummy grilled veggies (peppers, onions, tomatoes) , grilled to crisp perfection! 

Things to avoid- the carne asada and the fish tacos.... I have ordered both of these a couple of times and neither have ever impressed.
