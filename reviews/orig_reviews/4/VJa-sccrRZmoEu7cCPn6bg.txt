Mexican Fusion Goodness. The dishes were unique but with the Mexican flair you are expecting. I had the chicken poblano enchiladas which were quite tasty. The chips and guacamole were pretty good if a little pricy. The Stuffed Shrimp were delicious and the giant Strawberry Jalape√±o Margaritas were great. Be aware that this is not an inexpensive stop but the quality and the taste are there. Not sure if I would go back with all of the other options near by but it was a satisfying meal.
