Pretty Good - #1 - Not a chain although a 2nd one is getting ready to open - bummer.
Food was good - stayed away from the meat - veggie burrito and salsa bar were both good.   I actually work right across the street - need to remind myself to go to Phat Burrito more often. Its  really quite good.  Oh and by the way - veggie burriot was HUGE!!!
