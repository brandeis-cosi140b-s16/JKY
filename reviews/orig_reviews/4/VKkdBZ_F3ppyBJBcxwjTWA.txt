I really love this place, I didn't realize how big it was. You could have a large group for a party. The parking is actually pretty genius since it's off the freeway it gets congested do to avoid that when you leave, they have you exit out the back to avoid car accidents. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Mexican food, it is spicy but very delicious
