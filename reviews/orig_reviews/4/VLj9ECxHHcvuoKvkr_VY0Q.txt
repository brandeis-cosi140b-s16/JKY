First time to @galloblanco tonight. What a great experience!

Went for a social/journalist type event, #JDEB. Had a nice evening, chatting, getting to know a few new people.

Enjoyed the $5 pints of hefeweizen, and appreciated the bartender's attentiveness to my dislike of fruit in my beer. (Orange in wheat beer?! Amateur!)

After a while, the hunger set in, and a few of us decided to have dinner in the restaurant.

I ordered the sopa del dia, which was chicken tortilla, and the breakfast burrrito (served all day, woot!) which was chorizo and egg, one of the few perfect meals in existence.

I had high hopes and expectations for this meal, as many of my friends dine here regularly.

The food did not disappoint in the slightest!

The soup was VERY hearty! Chock full of generous chunks of chicken, and flavorful bits of tortilla, and plenty of flavor. Delicious! And nearly a meal on its own.

But I was hungry, so not quite.

The burrito was superb! For starters, it was huge. Given the price, and the type of establishment I had assumed GB to be, I wasn't expecting such a large portion.

Nonetheless, the burrito was delicious, and had plenty of egg and chorizo, and a very tasty pico, rolled into a nice-sized tortilla.

The bartender, as well as our restaurant server, were attentive, and very personable.

Oh, did I mention they serve Cartel Coffee?

Yes. Another plus for them.

Gallo is on the west side of town, and a distance south of me, but I think it is now imperative that I return, as often as possible.

I am dying to try their chilaquiles! And the guac, as I didn't get the chance tonight.

Yes, I will be back, without question!
