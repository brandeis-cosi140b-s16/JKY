Clean, friendly, and fast, this little mexican cantina is more Maestros than Macayos. Its not overbearing in the class, and the food is reasonably priced. Tasty, and fresh this is a nice change of pace from the standard mexican fare. With a short but varied menu, craft beers on tap and a wall of premium spirits, its a welcome addition to the north valley. Great place for a date
