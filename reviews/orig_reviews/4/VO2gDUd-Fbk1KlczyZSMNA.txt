I love Pepe's!!  I come here every time I visit my friends in Vegas.  No Vegas trip is complete without a meal at Pepe's.

Chicken hard tacos: Yummy yummy!  And not too greasy like some hard tacos can be.  My personal fave.  I crave them when I'm back in LA!
Asada super burrito: The boys love 'em!  Just one is enough to put you into a happy food coma.
Prices: Good!  I fed myself and 3 full-grown men all for $20, drinks included.  And trust me, those boys eat a lot!

We were having a taco-crazy weekend, and Pepe's was delicious even though this was the third time we sat down for tacos in less than 24 hours.  Yeah, we take our tacos seriously.  I've been telling my California buddies about this place for years -- Best place to wind down and have a cheap meal before driving back to CA.
