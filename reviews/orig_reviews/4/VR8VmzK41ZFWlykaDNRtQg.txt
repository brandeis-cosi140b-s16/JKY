We searched yelp to find good Mexican and gave it a shot. Great food, great fast service( too fast if u want romantic but great for us with kids)we had a great waiter, fast great runner refilling and taking plates! Alot of food! Next time we'll share. Only bad thing is we wanted great margaritas and were disappointed! But everything else is so good they still get 5 stars from me!
