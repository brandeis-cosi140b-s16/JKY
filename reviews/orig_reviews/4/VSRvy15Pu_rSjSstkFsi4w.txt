After driving past this joint for years and never stopping in,  I finally saw it on tv on diners drive ins and dives with Guy Fieri. I figured,  if he ate there and lived,  it must not be so bad! 

Staff is super friendly and helpful, they realize it's confusing of you've never been there before.

The pork is outstanding,  my favorite.  The jade chicken comes in at a close second!

Fun place to eat and break the norm, unless fusion food is your norm!

Go give then a try,  you'll be surprised!
