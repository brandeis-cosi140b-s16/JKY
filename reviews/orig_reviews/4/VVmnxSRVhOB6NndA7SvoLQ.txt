Whenever I go in the customer service is great, I'm indecisive so when I don't feel rushed I'm happy. This place is about the same price as Filibertos but the food quality it much better. The beans never taste old, the tortillas aren't dry or hard and the rice has good flavor. I usually get bean and cheese burritos (Which are great here) but this time I got a carne asada burrito which was one of the best I've had, from anywhere.
