Have been hitting up Rubio's for my fish taco fix, but the wife wanted me to try out this place. Lucky I listened to her cause the food was awesome. It's fresh cuts and fried well. The prices are comparable, but the thing that stood out to me was the delicious selection of sauces they provide.

I personally like the Chipotle and avocado sauce. It's unlimited so make sure you don't overload on it :).

Will definitely become a regular at this place.
