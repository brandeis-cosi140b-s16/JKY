I have been to this particular location several times and I have always left with a happy stomach and a smile. My favorite menu item is the SALAD with SWEET PORK BARBACOA. Serious drool action. Your "bowl" starts with a huge housemade flour tortilla and from there, you can go crazy. I usually ask for black beans, rice, romaine lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, and the medium and hot salsas. Top that off with some fresh cillantro and cojita cheese, yum! Their dressings are even better and I ask for both options - Creamy Tomatillo and Cilantro Lime Vinagrette - so I can blend them together. SO GOOD. It is extremely filling and if you don't want a lot of carbs, you can control how much tortilla you eat (but, I must warn you that it's addictively good).

Recently, I have been adopting a Vegan diet for health reasons and I was soo ecstatic to find out that Cafe Rio had Vegetarian/Vegan-friendly menu suggestions! So, on my most recent trip this month, I got the same salad that I love, except it came with an extra scoop of black beans, no cheese, and just the vinagrette (they'll actually offer you an extra scoop of rice as well, but I couldn't afford the extra carbs). But guess what? Still amazing and very satisfying!

I don't have any opinions about their other menu items because, honestly, I haven't ordered anything else! However, that salad keeps bringing me back, so that's definitely saying something.
