Got to sit at a table by the canal which was fantastic.  Got there for happy hour and enjoyed some "cheaper" drinks.  Had chips, salsa and some guac.  All were very good.  The main course was OK, nothing fantastic.   The black beans were tasteless and not worth more than a bite or two.  They also served the meal with this cilantro rice, which I found myself self eating even after I was full.  It was unique and very good.
