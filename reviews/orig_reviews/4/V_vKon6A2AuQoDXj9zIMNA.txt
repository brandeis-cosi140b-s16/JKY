Stumbled across this place with a friend and a Groupon a few years ago. It was pretty good, service was horrible. But the food was good enough to give it a second try, it's become a downtown favorite and a place I take people from out of town. I've never had anything bad here and the service (on the inside) is great. Mistake was eating outside the first time....the outside seats don't seem to ever be used anymore...perhaps because they forgot about the people out there. Great for large parties too.
