I love Maverick!  They have a great drink selection, lots of menu options and a great patio when the weather is nice!  It's always nice to get free chips and salsa when you drink/dine out.  I personally love the queso blanco dip (especially with chorizo) and the guacamole.

I usually get a taco plate and mix and match my options - some of my favs are the jalapeno mahi mahi, the chimichurri skirt steak and the crispy white fish tacos.  The spicy cilantro lime fries are also amazing.

My favorite cocktails have been the jalapeno rita, the cucumber jalapeno cocktail and the blood orange cocktail.  So good.

The service can be touch and go, but I have found the food and atmosphere to be worth it.  Especially if it's a night with specials: good deals!
