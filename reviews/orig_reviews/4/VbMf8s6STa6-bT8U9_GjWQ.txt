Okay, I hate to do it... but I have to bump Tacos El Gordo down a notch.  There are several reasons for this abrupt, unexpected change.  Notice that this is still a four-star establishment - I still love my beloved Tacos El Gordo - but now I have a few caveats.

1)The last two times I visited, there were men walking around the restaurant and trying to sell bootleg copies of new movie releases.  Beyond being illegal, it was just annoying.  They wouldn't take no for an answer and kept shoving copies of the movie Ted in my face while I was trying to eat.  I think it's pretty incredible that this goes on and no one seems to put a stop to it.

2)Once in a while, the meat in my tacos is downright cold.  From time to time, I get a taco that tastes just a bit funky and lukewarm.  Pretty unappetizing.

3)I'm beginning to agree with other posters (like Misti Y.).... the absence of rice and beans is very depressing.  Sometimes I get sick of just eating taco after taco.  And no, I really don't feel like eating gloppy fries with my tacos.  RICE AND BEANS!  That's what I want!

4)Los Tacos.  Los Tacos has ruined this place for me a bit.  To me, nothing can compare to my beloved LT.  Nothing.  Sorry, Tacos El Gordo.
