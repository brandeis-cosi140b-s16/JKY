Now we're talking.  Fabulous tacos -- the Chicken Tinga is amazing, as is the Cochinita Pibil.  The salsa bar is amazing; lots of choices, some of them specialized for your taco/burrito.  Reasonably priced hole-in-the-wall.  Service is just o.k. and it gets hot in the summer (no/weak A.C.), but the food and the value are excellent.
