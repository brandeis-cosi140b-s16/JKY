Horchata and carne asada super nachos! 

Ordinarily I have no problem passing up horchata, especially given that I prefer to get my calories from food over drink, but this horchata is too good to pass up!

And, the super nachos? The best nachos around!* Loads of chips with enough cheese to go around and a generous serving of your meat selection (I encourage carne asada) with a scoop of guacamole (pickled jalepenos upon request). It's such a big serving, it is easily enough to share.

*I prefer "fake" cheese over shredded cheese on my nachos. I believe cheese preference can make or break nacho satisfaction.
