The nachos were top notch. I'll be back so I can try more items on the menu. Really liked the vibe and atmosphere at the place, and the prices seemed reasonable. And they provide you with complementary chips and salsa when you're seated. Friendly staff as well, at least those that I interacted with. The breakfast menu actually looked pretty good too. Like I said, I'll be back.
