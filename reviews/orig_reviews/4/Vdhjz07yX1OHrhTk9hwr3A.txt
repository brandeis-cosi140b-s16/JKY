Great little place with super fast service. Many repeat customers and locals, friendly staff.

I had the baja chicken and it was really good! Not overly smothered in sauce, get fresh flavors, and a great portion for the money.

Chips and salsa were never ending, and the staff was very friendly and attentive!
