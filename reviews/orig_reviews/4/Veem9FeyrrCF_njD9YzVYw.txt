Where do I begin, Café Rio? I can't remember the last time I craved a salad... but you've made me love lettuce like no other. Of course, once you fill a tin with a warm, chewy tortilla, rice, beans, marinated chicken and some famous lime cilantro dressing--how could you not love the lettuce you pile on top so generously? The chicken breast salad at Café Rio has more flavor than most 4 course meals. It's refreshing, filling and will make your taste buds shake their maracas. I've also had a chicken quesadilla, also delicious, and bites of Mike's enchiladas and burritos. We also love their queso and chips and love to get an extra freshly made tortilla to dip in the queso. Their tortillas are divine. Thick and chewy, always warm and perfectly cooked. 
If there was a drawback to this place, it wouldn't be the food, but the crazy people that scream at you for your order. I always feel a bit rushed getting through the line and making sure you got what you want. They're quick to move onto the next person (because there's always a line--sign of a good place!) and if you're not careful, you'll be left in the dust. 
Overall, their food makes up for any of the customer service issues. We've been to a couple of locations and always have a good meal. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some casual Mexican dining.
