just had lunch at Z-Tejas in Tempe with three co-workers.  Friendly smiling happy waitrons, and excellent service; constant attention to refills of water, iced tea, and colas.  four different salsas plus guacamole and excellent chips. 
I had the Daily Special which was green mole' chicken enchiladas - excellent; served with very good black beans and Spanish rice. 
Dude had avocado turkey burger with chipotle aioli sauce. cleaned his plate
Ladies had Parmesan pecan chicken salad and the Five-cheese Macaroni & Achiote Chicken and raved about both.
dessert was a shared warm apple-berry cobbler with ice cream, Yummy and plenty.
In and out in just over an hour, but we were in no hurry and lingered.  Surprisingly good sized crowd for a Wednesday lunch in downtown Tempe in late July - the reasons are as noted in my review - very good food and excellent service too.
