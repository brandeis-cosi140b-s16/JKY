Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up and
down screaming "¡Muy Auténtico!" but this place still
delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent
service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar
off your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce that
comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful.
And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees
are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get
a side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm on
Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually
make it over here. A late dinner after some event. 
Parking is always good since it's a mall.
