Solid!

The Chile Relleno Camar√≥n is a wonderful taste adventure that you must take your mouth on. You'll be a better person after eating it.  The soup. I'd come just for the soup. The house tomato soup was the best thing I ate on our vacation. The Habanero Salsa is just hot enough to have a little kick but just mild enough where I was happily eating as much of it as I could before our meal came. When our meal did arrive it came with  fresh, homemade, tortillas! 

The food easily deserves five stars and the service is superlative. Our drinks and chips were always full. Did I mention the soup?

When we arrived around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon every seat was taken and there was at least three parties in front of us. There is tiny place for about four to five people to stand in the door but after that you can wait outside in the shade. This San Francisco kid can't handle 108 in the parking lot. I don't mind waiting for an excellent meal, and it was worth the wait  but I need some place to wait that has A/C. I'd still come back in 100+ degree heat and stand outside in the shade for an hour, it is that great! I'd love more than anything to give this a five star review because I'll never forget how amazing it was but there were tiny little things that need minor improvement. 

When I'm within 100 miles of this gem there is a 99.98% chance I will be back.
