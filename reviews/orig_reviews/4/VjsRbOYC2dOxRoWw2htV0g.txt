Besides being a good taco/burrito/lemonade stand, THBH is imo the coolest club house on the block. It's chock-full of knickknacks, posters, and snarky signage that will keep you occupied while waiting for your order. I wasn't even bothered by the lingering smell of lavender incense, plenty of which to select from. I purchased opium and cherry. Nope, never gonna burn em; impulse buy. The side patio is a great spot to sit and munch on 2 dollar tacos while being windblown by industrial coolers and misting systems. I love it. Tonight's attraction, Poetry Slam, and man this was one slam jam. Note to self, take up ripping people to shreds by way of organized angry verbal release. Possible new found therapy. My mental first draft in play as a sit sipping on a paper parasol topped watermelon lemonade. In sum, I find one word that describes this jaunt, E-CLECTIC! Beats the heck out of drive-thru any day.
