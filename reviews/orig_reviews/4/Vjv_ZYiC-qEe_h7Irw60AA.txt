I stopped in for lunch the other day and I really enjoy this place. Dive, yes this is a dive.  Nothing fancy at all. This location is tucked away in a corner and can be a little hard to find.  It's a good sized space with lots of tables.  It's a simple place with a different take on chinese/mexican/carribean food.  I like it.  The portions are generous and it's pretty cheap.  No plates, your food comes in aluminum containers so you can pop a lid on it and take it home if you don't finish.  The menu and how to order can be a little confusing but the folks behind the counter are super helpful and always offer free samples to help you make your decision.  I'd bump it up to 5 starts if it were cleaner.  The tables and floor need to be kept up better.  The soda area is around the corner and I think they tend to forget it because it's usually a bit messy.  If you go in knowing these things you won't be dissappointed.  I'm suddenly craving a jerk chicken quesadilla........
