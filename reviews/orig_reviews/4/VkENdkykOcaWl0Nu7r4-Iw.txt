I had beef fajitas (so original of me) and my wife went with a crab dish (something new on the menu).   Food was great as always.  The atmosphere was good and full of great energy.   When we checked in we were told we would be seated in 10 mins.   We left our names and hopped on 2 bar stools to scarf some hand made Guac while we waited. My first question to the bartender was "will the hostess find us here" (this based on the fact hay they don't have the little light up vibrating "it's your turn to sit toys).  He said absolutely.   After realizing way more than 10 mins had passed I went up to the stand and asked "are we up?"  The hostess said "you are next."  I said "so you skipped us."  She then reluctantly admitted yes we called you and you didn't come.  That is about the only negative to our night at cantina.  Great place to get some Mexican food!
