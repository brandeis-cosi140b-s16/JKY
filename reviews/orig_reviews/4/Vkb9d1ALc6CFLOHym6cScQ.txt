I cannot remember ever having better service than I did a couple weeks ago at Distrito with Ben, the awesome server.  I felt like I was the most important person to ever walk into the joint.   

The food was fantastic.  I had the chille relleno which was perfectly cooked and beautifully filled.  The ceviche was fresh and lightly citrusy.   And I loved the spicy margarita and great glass of wine.  

Really a find in AZ.   It is a NY quality restaurant, with the best service I have experienced in eons!

Can't wait to go back, and will make sure it is when Ben is working.
