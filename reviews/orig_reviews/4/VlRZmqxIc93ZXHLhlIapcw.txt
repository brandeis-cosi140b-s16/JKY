I have been to this location a couple of times,  because it's my go to meal on the go, I usually order the taco salad with the whole wheat soft taco, it's my all time favorite,  but today i decided on the special Mahi Mahi fish tacos,  i totally enjoyed it, fish was fresh and i love the rice and beans, the drink order that comes with the meal is your choice of sodas but i got the mint limeade, it's sweet but i do enjoy it.
I do agree that the customer service could be better, i always feel so rushed when i have to place my order.
This location is the closest and convenient for me, so i am a regular here, I also love the free meal after you order 10..that's always a perk .
