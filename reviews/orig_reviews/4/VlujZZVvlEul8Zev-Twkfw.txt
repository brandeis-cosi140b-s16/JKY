I saw the DDD spot a few years ago and wanted to check this place out more for the sisters who own it than the food itself.  After eating there, the food stands on it's own.  In Phoenix, I don't think you can get better carne asada.  If you like breakfast burritos, you haven't had one until you've had their carne asada breakfast burrito with potatoes, eggs and cheese.  Fantastic.  I work around the corner, and eat here at least twice a month for that reason.
