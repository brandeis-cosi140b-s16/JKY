Love it! 
I visited Cabo Fish Taco a few years ago on my very first trip to Charlotte.  Since I enjoyed it so much then, I requested a repeat visit when I headed back to Charlotte last month.  
I was not disappointed.
I went all out with soup and an entree.  My soup was of the curry shrimp and chicken variety.  It was on the Specials board and sounded too interesting to pass up.  On a rare (I'm told) snowy night in Charlotte, this soup was the perfect way to start my meal.  Oh, accompanied of course with a delicious margarita, of course!
For my main course I chose the mahi tacos with rice and beans.  It did not disppoint.  I was so full from the soup that I really didn't need to eat it all but I certainly did.  
My co-diners were less than thrilled with their main entrees however one of them also thoroughly enjoyed the soup so it wasn't a total loss for them.  Overall the experiece was good for all and when they go back (sadly without me!) I am sure they will go back to their old favorites.  
SInce I have been back, the restaurant has expanded and so combined with the snow, that meant that we did not have to wait for a table although that might not be the case on a normal Charlotte night.  

Out of towners, I suggest you ask your hosts to take you there on your next visit!
