Love come here before on several occasions and been impressed with both the food and the service.

 This occasion was no exception. I came with my family and my mother. We were promptly greeted and seated. 

The waitress didn't pressure us to order and encouraged us to take our time. We opted not to order appetizers since the chips and variety of salsas was plenty.

The choices of the night were the Monterey platter for mom, stuffed chicken medallions for me, the fajita chimichanga for my wife, and the taco and fries for my daughter.

I must start with the kids taco. For once I can say that it was a taco that I was honestly impressed with and would have welcomed to eat myself.

The chicken medallions were quite good and I would certainly order them again. They were moist and cooked to perfection. The papas that accompanied them were also incredible. For once the rice at a Mexican restaurant was not only edible, but also different in a good way and tasty.

The Monterey platter was enormous and presented plenty of leftovers for the next day. My mom loved it. The only downside was the piece of plastic in the guacamole that she encountered. An apparent corner from the guacamole cream the add their avocados to when they make guacamole. Don't get me wrong, the guacamole is delicious. This was brought to managements attention and dealt with immediately and in a very satisfying manner with the apologies of the staff. I only include this bit to show how good the service is. 

The fajita chimi looked good and must have been since my wife wouldn't let me near it.... jokes on her.... I'm attacking her leftovers tonight when she goes to sleep.

The meal itself was very satisfying and delicious.  The service was good and we will definitely return.
