If you like tacos, you'll love Fuzzys. They have great tacos and large, strong margaritas! 
Prices are great, making the shop a hit with the college kids. A great place to hit up after a couple of drinks as well. 

I only have two problems with Fuzzys: the parking because Mill Ave sucks with that and the ASU gear decorating the place. Go eat here, you won't be disappointed
