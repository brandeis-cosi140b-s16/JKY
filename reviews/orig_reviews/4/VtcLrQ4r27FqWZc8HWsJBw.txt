The fact that you get a free margarita with any entree for checking in with yelp might be swaying my opinion here... But this place does have decent Mexican food.  I've always gone for lunch as I was traveling for work, and never had any problems. I'm not sure if I would give anywhere in Vegas 5 stars just due to the price gouging everywhere.
