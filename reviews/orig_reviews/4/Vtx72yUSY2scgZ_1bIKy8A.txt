After SO many recommendations of this place from so many locals, we finally went for a late night dinner here.  For no one there at 11pm, I was astonished to see how much meat they were chopping up in the back of the kitchen.  There were 2 huge mountains of shredded chicken and 2 employees were cutting up what looked to be about 100 pounds of red meat.  No one else was in the restaurant!  Anyways..we went for the chicken burrito ($3), carne asada burrito ($4.50) and carne asada nachos ($6).  No rice, beans or cheese in the burritos, just a TON of meat and guac in the carne while the shredded chicken burrito had a couple of carrots.  

Anyways, no point in going to Taco Bell for me!  My wife still prefers Taco Bell over this though.
