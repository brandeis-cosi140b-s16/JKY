Being a local here, this place is not too bad. Prices are reasonable and portions are great. As other reviewers have said, the chile relleno was much like an eggy pancake with a small chile inside that was not stuffed with cheese. Was not good at all. But the rest of our meal was great and filing, the complimentary chips with salsa, bean dip & guac was tasty. And a refill for the dips is not $7-8 as another reviewer complained, it's only $2. The margarita needs some improvement, add a lil tequlia to it. The servers were quick, attentive and kept our drinks filled.  We will definitely be back
