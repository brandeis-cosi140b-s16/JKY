I am a huge fan of Crescent Ballroom.  It is an amazing venue to watch a show.  The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there a couple of hours before the show to eat dinner and have cocktails, but when we wanted to go into the show, we had to exit the restaurant and get in line.  I don't understand why they can't scan our tickets from the inside and give us bracelets there.  Other than this issue I would recommend seeing a show there anytime you have a chance.
