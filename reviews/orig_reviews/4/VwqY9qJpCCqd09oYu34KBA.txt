I have to give this place 4 stars the food is just really good. Every time I have gone to this restaurant it was delicious however it is very old and even the tables do not match you would not want to bring a large group of people because there is really only a few tables for large groups however there is also some nostalgia to the place because it is so old other than that it's definitely worth 4 stars and worth trying because of the food
