This place was delicious! Free parking in the downtown area because they have a private lot, so that was nice too. My only complaint is that the bread and rolls were cold and the service people were confused about who would be helping us at first. I got the hanger steak with fajita veggies and it was amazing! Veggies were cooked perfectly. I could have eaten a whole plate of those.
