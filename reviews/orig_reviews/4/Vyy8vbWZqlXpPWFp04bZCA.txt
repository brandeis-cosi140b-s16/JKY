Easily one of the Best Mexican Restaurant in the Greater Phoenix Area, especially for the money.

SERVICE
Always friendly, fast, and very accomodating. There is not host/hostess in this restaurant. So, servers will seat you although you can seat yourself if you don't mind waiting for your server.

I have been there many times and unless they're quite busy i never wait for a refill on beverages or chips and salsa. They are not always the most thoughtful servers, but always very accomodating to your requests. 

FOOD
Always hot, fresh, and higher quality than most mom & pop mexican hole-in-the-walls. i have yet to find something i didn't like on the menu. However, i do reccommend any item with steak -- their steak is so favorful. Absolutely excellent!

They do offer several kinds of salsas. They usually bring out a bean salsa and your typical mexican tomato salsa. Both are good, although most of my friends and I find the bean salsa to be superior and more unique than most restaurants in this category. Also, they do make a darn good Horchatta as well.

The value of food for your money is superb! Most items do not cost more than $10. The amount of food you receive is above average, not ridiculously large, but on the more generous side. Plus, as i remember i've never been nickel and dimed for extra sides of sour cream, pico de Gallo, etc. except for maybe cheese and guacamole which is understandable (even then, i didn't pay any crazy extra amount).

AMBIANCE
For being a hole-in-the-wall in a small shopping center in not the greatest of areas in Phoenix the decor is simple, mexican, and welcoming. Their restaurant is always clean from what i've seen. Bathrooms are nothing special by any means, but pretty well kept.
