We really like the food at Carolina's!  The prices are fair, not the cheapest mexican food you can get, but delish!  We like the wide variety on the menu..they also have a very large fountain drink selection, both pepsi and some coke products as well as other fountain drinks!  It has always been very busy when we have been there so we generally take it to go or try and grab a seat when someone gets up!
