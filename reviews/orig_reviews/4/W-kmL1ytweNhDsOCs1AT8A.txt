Very good experience at Los Reyes de la Torta! Their service was exceptional and very friendly. They make you feel at home. I had the Torta Del Rey and shrimp ceviche. The portion size of my Torta was humongous!! It included: breaded beef, pork, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, almost everything but the kitchen sink! It was ok but my breaded beef and pork were over cooked, so it made my torta dry. They give you a red and green homemade salsa to put on it. 

The shrimp ceviche was FANTASTIC! So good I had to get some to go! I look forward to coming back and trying a different torta of something else (and the 99 cent ceviche of course). 

I recommend you try Los Reyes de la Torta, you wont be disappointed.
