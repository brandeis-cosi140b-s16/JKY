HELLOOOOO new cravings....

I love tacos (of all kinds but soft corn is the best)!

My wife went to high school with the manager so she dragged me in for lunch today on our way home from the children's museum. Located on the east side of 7th street in a used to be house. A line to the door usually means it is good and it was! 

We had to take the food togo so I was already thinking that it was going to be sub par. I was so wrong.
I had two asada tacos and a bean and cheese burrito.  The tacos were perfect with the lime and the smokey salsa that came with them. The tortillas were soft but not soggy, the meat was smokey and tender and packed with flavor. The burrito was creamy and rich with melted cheese everywhere and beans that were not too heavy. 

I can't wait to go back... and soon.

Thank you America's for making a no fuss slam dunk taco shop!
