We thought the food was delicious and the prices seemed reasonable for a sit-down Mexican restaurant. The salsa was a bit on the spicy side for me, but my husband and grandpa enjoyed it. I had the fajitas and they were wonderful. Tons of chicken and fresh veggies. We sat out in their beautiful patio and enjoyed our visit.
