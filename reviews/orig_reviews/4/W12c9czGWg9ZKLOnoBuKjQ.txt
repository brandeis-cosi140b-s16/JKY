We found this place by accident and now I'm a big fan.  The outside of the building is colorful but from 24th street it doesn't scream try but you need to.  We started off with the guacamole which was very flavorful but they served it with the chips stuck in it so there weren't enough chips in the beginning.  I had the shrimp special which was delicious but I don't like to have messy dishes served with tails on as your fingers get sticky.  My friend had the cesina a thin sliced sirloin cured and then grilled.  They served this with the chilaquiles a tortilla casserole in a ranchero sauce and rice and beans.  The sirloin was very flavorful and nicely spiced and the chilqquiles tasted like a dish a grandmother would make with love.  The space is a little small and tight and service was a little slow but the servers were very friendly and the food was fantastic.
