We went in for dinner on a Saturday night. The hostess was a bit rude but not anything I couldn't ignore. We were promptly seated and our server was very friendly and especially knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. He sold us specialty cocktails we wouldn't have normally ordered and they rocked! The tacos we ordered were very good. We had the shrimp tacos and the filet mignon tacos also the sweet potato tacos were great. I really love the black bean salsa they give you with chips. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a change of pace in north Scottsdale.
