You know, downtown Mesa isn't half bad.  It is quaint and has some understated charm.  Mango's is the same way.  Aside from the kitschy tropical decor, the place has a comfortable feel and the Mexican standards are executed as well as any abuela.  

They have some great dishes just beyond the realm of the traditional.  Their tilapia is mild and light, seasoned perfectly by the onion and cilantro.  

There are so many other nooks of the Valley that get so much more attention.  Spend an evening in downtown Mesa and have your dinner at Mango's.  It will be pleasant, I promise.
