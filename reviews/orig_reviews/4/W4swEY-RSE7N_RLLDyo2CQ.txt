Lets start with the good aspects.  The food is phenomenal!  There was 4 of us and we all shared our orders so I got to try a bunch of different dishes and I was surprised and delighted by almost everything we ordered.  That is right, i said surprised by what we order.  Most of the dishes had some unexpected element that worked in an interesting way.  The Guacamole had orange in it, the vegetarian tacos had a wonderful sauce and a bunch of different veggies,  and we had a giant cheese cone thing which was basically a dunce cap of cheese cooked to a cracker consistency.  All the food was superb.

Now for the not as good aspects.  First and foremost, the service was not on par with the price of the restaurant.  I was constantly out of water and we had to ask for coffee 3 times.  Additionally, the server had a bit of a ripe smell.  I know I have an overly sensitive nose, but still, waiters should not have a funk about them.  Also while the place is beautiful, its a bit more "hip" then what I usually go for and the music was too loud and terrible.  However, the food is so good that these complaints will not keep me from returning to Gallo Blanco whenever I am back in Phoenix.
