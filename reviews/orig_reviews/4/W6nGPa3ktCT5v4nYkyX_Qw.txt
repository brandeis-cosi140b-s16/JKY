Nom nom!  So good!  If you want something different when it comes to Mexican food think of this place as gourmet, upscale Mexican cuisine.  It's absolutely fabulous and everything is fresh, fresh, fresh!  Fun, modern, eclectic decor allows for a relaxed evening or a fun night out with friends.  Great stocked bar with one of the best margaritas I've had in Vegas so far. 

However, my only complaint is that when we first went here we came with big group of people and I had made reservations ahead of time.  We stayed a long time, ordered bottles of wine and lots of food.  But for some reason our server was very confused and somewhat irritated when we said we wanted to split the check amongst the couples.  He huffed and puffed about it being difficult to split the check etc. but in the end did it for us even after we marked the bill accordingly with each couples' items. 

I'm sorry, I used to be a server and 1) it's not hard to split a check with the automated system that I saw this restaurant had and 2) you should pretty much assume that one person in a large group of people is not going to pick up the whole bill.  It would have been nice if our server had hashed the particulars with us ahead of time before we all had a wonderful evening and then had to deal with bill drama.  Perhaps if you go here with a lot of friends tell the server up front you will be splitting the check accordingly.

Otherwise, I would highly recommend Mundo as an off-Strip but tasty find.
