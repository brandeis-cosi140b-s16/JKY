We went there on November 23rd at around 11 am  and the place was just opening. They have about 8 tables but the place though modest, seems like clean. The prices are very reasonable and the food is good. This is not the place to take a date for the first time, or they will be underwhelmed. Its just a clean taco shop with cheap good food. We ordered burritos, carne asada tacos and a bean tostada. All of them very good. I will go back there when I go again to Phoenix.
