I've been really looking forward to trying out The Blind Pig, and I'm glad I did.

I came in here with a friend one afternoon for lunch, and there was barely anyone there.  

The inside feels more like a bar than anything else, with TVs, bar stools, and a friendly staff.

They have a beautiful patio for when the weather is nice.

Both my friend and I got tacos and really enjoyed them.  I got the Short Rib Tacos, and for the price, I was amazed.  

I think this is a great choice for a cheap lunch, especially when you can sit outside.
Nothing is more than around $12 or $13, and for the area, that's rare.

Enjoy!
