We used to frequent this place quite a bit when we were locals and were happy to return. We split a pitcher of sangria and it was enough to make us happy! We also ordered the queso bean dip (love this stuff!) but the real standout were the potato taquitos. Soo good and unexpected! Our service was excellent and allowed us to take our time to finish that pitcher without felling rushed. This place is worth a visit!
