Their re-vamped menu is a huge improvement.  A high-end taco joint on Carson? with fresh, adventurous ingriedents?  awesome!  I was really psyched to try it.

Of the 3 tacos i ordered, it was the underdog black-eyed pea taco that killed me.  I liked it better than the flank steak and way better than the chorizo.

I will definitely return to try more gourmet tacos!

Oh, and the bartenders ROCK.

*I wrote a few weeks ago that the soup was very average- i had the soup again last night, and it was outstanding.  the highlight of my meal, even.  get that tortilla soup, yinz!
