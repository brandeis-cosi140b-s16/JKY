Great atmosphere, even better drinks and service.  The staff was courteous and attentive, offered great suggestions for a novice tequila drinker like myself.  Though I didn't order food, my party had nothing but good to say about the food.

Wouldn't mind staying in hotel afterwards, the pool looks absolutely fab.
