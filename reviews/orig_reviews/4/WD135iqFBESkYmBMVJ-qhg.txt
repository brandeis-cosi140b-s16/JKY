I made a triumphant return to Canteen last night with a couple of friends and, yet again, it was pretty awesome. When we got there, there was a wait BUT it was awesome because they take your phone number and call you when the table is ready, so no sitting around the restaurant awkwardly. I love that! The wait was much shorter than anticipated and we were seated outside, which was nice. We got Sonoma (?) margaritas...the ones with orange and prickly pear in them. They were soooo gooood. Sweet without being too sweet. We got the chips and salsa and I thought it was just ok. There were three different salsa, a verde, which was spicy but not super flavorful, a chipotle, which was really good, and a pico de gallo, which was...pico de gallo. I think 6$ is a little steep for this. The three of us ordered the quesadilla, the brisket tacos (because they were out of pork...booo!), and the carne asada tacos. The brisket tacos were good, but not nearly as good as the pork and the carne asada was just ok.... it kind of tasted like gas or propane or whatever chemical they use to grill things....I'd stick with the meats that are cooked low and slow here. Our service was fairly good, although my water was never refilled...maybe as a ploy for me to drink more alcohol...I'm not sure. I still like that this place is cheap and tasty...so it stands at four stars.
