This place is right by my house. I come here all the time, love the breakfast burritos! They are always made fresh right in front of me, and you get a lot of food for the money. In fact, writing this review is giving me a craving. I've been going to this place since shortly after they opened-the first time I went I nearly cried because the rice tasted just like my grandma's. Sometimes they can go a little heavy on the salt, but it's so tasty I don't mind. It's a hole in the wall place so don't expect a lot of seating, but it makes up for it in delicious food.
