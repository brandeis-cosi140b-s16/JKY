Delicious food but it can be chaotic and confusing for your first time. There's multiple stations to order from, it can be really loud during peak times, and most of the menu is in Spanish. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. Other than that, love the Gran Tacos, Barbacoa street tacos, and the Corn on the cob served Mexican Street style is the best!
