The food was good. They make the guacamole table side and give you the option to not include any of the ingredients. 

I heard the flautas were amazing, but didn't try them. I got the barbecued salmon with mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus. Salmon with 2 of my favorite side dishes are hard to beat. Perfect amount of food too. Enough to create a nice base for drinking all night, but not too much that you feel bad leaving most of it behind. 

I felt the specialty drinks were a touch too sweet, but you could tell they were made well. 

Also our server was incredibly nice and not just split up the tab for us but also split the shared items so we were charged a fraction of each.
