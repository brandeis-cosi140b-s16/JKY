The menu is incredibly small, like three types of tacos small, but the tacos were filled with flavor. The set up was kind of weird--there's a drive through as well as walk in dining, and the same person was doing the drive thru orders and taking orders with walk in customers (it was pretty confusing and weird). However, staff was really friendly, prices were reasonable and service was fast.
