Absolutely amazing burgers! Good quality meat, dressed with fresh veggies and thick cut pickles. The Stand sauce reminds me of Utah fry sauce, and it's tasty on burgers and fries alike. The fries are good, but not great. Could stand to be crispier, but they're seasoned well. Good service, too. I would absolutely come back next time I'm craving a burger.
