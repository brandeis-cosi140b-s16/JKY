Down-to-earth authentic Mexican food - reasonably priced and simply prepared.  Excellent chips and salsa with a variety of options. Beware their measures of spiciness may be different than yours - moderate per their description is not so moderate to me. But, they are nonetheless delicious and offer a whole spectrum of salsas. Tacos were likewise fantastic - the chorizo were the star of the meal. This place also has excellent margaritas - not the cheap frozen style mind you. Ambience is great once you make the trek through the mildly scary staircase... Clean with excellent service.
