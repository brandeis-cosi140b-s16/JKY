I went to Yolos a few months back for a friends birthday. We were very excited to go here because of their fresh fruit margs they advertised online. We got to our reservation on time and the 2 girls standing there told us it would be over an hour wait. Well, needless to say we had just walked all the way from another hotel and we figured we could wait.

When we got seated we got served chips and salsa immediately and we were starving so that was nice. We obviously ordered drinks right off the bat. The server that was bringing us our drinks got knocked into and down went a margarita all over my leg and my friends. They apologized, but didnt offer to give us a towel or comp one of the drinks. 

We werent going to let that put us down- we are in VEGAS! so we got our food and that made up for everything. I got the roasted vegetable enchiladas and my boyfriend got the street tacos. I also ordered the cilantro rice, which I was expecting to be bland. It was probably the best rice I have ever had (and I'm not a big rice fan)  

I haven't had Mexican food better than this yet.
