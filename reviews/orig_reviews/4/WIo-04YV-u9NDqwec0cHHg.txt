Aye Carumba... Gotta try it, but be ready first.

1.  The real deal - This is the real deal of Mexican food my friends. If  you are used to having tacos, nachos, burritos, quesadilla, taco salads, or items from Chipotle and Baja Fresh or Zabas, then don't expect more of the same.  If your idea of good Mexican food is El Jefe, or Chevy's, then just put on a different view point for this place.

2.  It is...- The food here is the real deal and it is very, very tasty.  How many places can to go to order  caldo de res (beef soup)?  Or even the Birria (Goat Stew)? This stuff is authentic.

3.  Parking??? Que Paso - How many restaurants are you aware of in Vegas, where you have to park on the street or across the street because the already large lot is so full of guests?

4. All this means...- This place is a great place. It is real food, so you have to critique it as real food. The salsa is wonderful, the tortilla hand made.  

5.  Music and Decor - Be careful going on nights and weekends when they are playing music. It can be a bit loud.

6.  Reservations - The staff is a bit on the non efficient side. Be careful.  And, the place is busy....

Try it, Try real Mexican Food,  Ask the waiter for what is really authentic. You will find it here. By the way, yes it was an italian restaurant in the past, but the place back then was never full and never that good. This place ROCKS.
