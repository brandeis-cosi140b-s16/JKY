Even though it's so close to my side of town, I never bothered to get out here until today. It's actually not all that hard to find after you turn from Tropicana on to Pecos, If it's your first time, enter from the street side to start at the front of the line and read the overhead signs to see what you can order. Go around the corner for the taco stations and try to line up roughly near a sign with something that you want, and just try to get in your full order.

Shelling out $2 per taco isn't terribly expensive for the morsels of goodness that I managed to obtain, and being able to use my credit card was a pleasant surprise. I went for the al pastor, having heard so much about it, as well as the lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head meat) because those just sound good. The al pastor had a great combination of heat and sweet, the lengua was very good aside from one overly chewy bit, and the cabeza pretty much melted in my mouth in a very good way.

This is a great spot that I plan to visit several more times so that I can fully dive into their menu. Stamp of approval... stamped.
