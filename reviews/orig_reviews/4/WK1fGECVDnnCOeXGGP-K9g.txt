Was pretty impressed with the food and service during a  very large private group dinner here in January 2015. Some logistical issues are also pointed out but I'll start with the positive:

We had a set menu that included their delicious variety of chips; a generic salad starter; 
a choice from 4 entr√©es heir seared tuna, vegetable pasta, chicken pasta or sirloin steak (not sure what the exact names are); and dessert. As a bonus they also gave us some corn husk wrapped white chocolate with nuts.

I chose the seared tuna and was floored at how good it was. Two generous tuna steaks/filets came served on top of a blend of fresh grilled bell peppers, zucchini and other seasonal veggies. The tuna was dressed in a delicious dry rub and zesty sauce, like zesty mayo or something. 

Everyone else seemed happy with their food. We were quite a diverse crowd with different backgrounds and tastes so it was quite impressive to hear overall satisfaction. 

A couple logistical things that were annoying was that there was some miscommunication between the kitchen and wait staff so quite a few of our guests who ordered steaks had to wait quite a while until they finally came out. I mean a long wile... like to the point of wondering if they had to go lasso, haul, and slaughter the cow. They were also out of dos equis. Also, this reservation had been made for a month or at least weeks in advance...how do you know you have a group of 45 people coming with a beer & wine allowance and not have a fully stocked selection of your beer? Or, how do you not inform your staff that it's not available so don't suggest it? Anyway, just some logistical problems that could've been better.
