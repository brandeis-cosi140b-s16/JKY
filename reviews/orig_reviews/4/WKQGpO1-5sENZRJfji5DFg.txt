I'm not a fan of New Mexican-style food, but Dick's Hideaway isn't your usual New Mexican / American fare.  Not sure what you'll find on the menu?  I highly recommend Sunday brunch.  Try the Huevos Rancheros.  Unlike your usual ranchero-esque experience, these are cooked with blue corn tortillas and smothered in your choice of red or green chile.  I went with the green.  Delicious.  Nice heat.   The order of potatoes and beans rounds out this plate.

The Bar tending staff is friendly, professional and cater's to the customers' needs.  Why not?  This place is about the size of my living room...quaint and perfect for hosting any friend with a hangover.  The ambiance is perfect for the perfect bloody mary.

If you can handle the breakfast menu, don't be ashame not to clean your plate.  Dessert is always something to look forward to after a tasty meal.  If chocolate is your thing (it's not mine), try whatever is on the blackboard.  The chocolate brownie a la mode was on the menu...and it was delicious. 

I highly recommend this place for those who don't want to be seen, or for a very private meeting with less than a handful of people.  Dick's Hideaway sets the tone.  Enjoy your meal with a little extra spice. Enjoy your drink.  Enjoy your company.
