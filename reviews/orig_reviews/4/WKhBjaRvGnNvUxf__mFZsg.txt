Went with a group of 16 to celebrate a Birthday and they were very accommodating and on point! This was my first time there and I really enjoyed the food and service. I ordered the molcajete de camaron which is a spicy shrimp hot soup in the stone bowl with nopales and cheese. It was delicious and very filling I took half home, to drink I got horchata because everyone recommended it to and it was good not the best I've had but good. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because they made a really big deal about not splitting checks or letting us pay with more than 3 cards. I understand we were a large group but we asked before hand to split and they said yes then when it came time to pay they said no so it was annoying having to do the collection rounds and needing to get cash out. Other than that it was a good time and we would definitely go back again!
