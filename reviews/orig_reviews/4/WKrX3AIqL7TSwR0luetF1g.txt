I usually stick to my tried and true favorites for Mexican, but I've been trying to branch out.  I'm thinkin' Padre's will go on the rotation.  

The atmosphere was perfect for catching up with a friend.  Padre's is dark and cozy with lots of small rooms rather than one large dining area.  We sat in the bar at one of the high top tables.  I think we were the only customers in the bar, but it was during the week. 

Our waitress was one of the best I've had in a long time.  Her recommendation of the duck tacos was spot on, I should have listened.  My friend got those and I can't even remember what I got.  The queso dip was also delicious.  It's not completely melted, there are chunks of cheese left in the creamy mixture.

I will definitely be back for Salsa dancing.
