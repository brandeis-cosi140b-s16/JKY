This is a cool spot to check out if you want something a little less over the top. 
The club scene isn't really my cup of tea, I'm more of a bar hopper and a foodie, so this place was nice to hang out at.  Also, it was conveniently located right by the Excalibur where I was staying so I didn't have to walk too far drunk. Haha.

Anyways, when we got there at around 8:00ish it was pretty empty, but boy did it get packed as the night grew longer. Especially  at around 10:00pm when they clear out the bar stools and a few tables & chairs to make room for the dance floor, because on Friday & Saturday nights they have a DJ. So when that happens, it's crazy packed and everyone is dancing, which I didn't care for. Mehh.

I just stayed at the bar with my bf and watched all the sweaty people dance. Haha. The bartenders were very friendly and kind. They did their job well, I must say. One of them even gave me a shot of tequila on the house because it was my B-Day. Very awesome! 

Mmm so they have very yummy half  yard margaritas that you have to try. I asked our bartender to make it more on the stronger side and he pulled that off very well. Wow, that thing was strong and delish. And you get to keep the thing it comes in as a souvenir. 

Now about the food...
My bf and I shared the steak fajitas, those were so good! They had a very yummy taste to them and they give you a pretty big portion. 
We also came here one morning for breakfast because they have great breakfast deals, and I mean AWESOME deals! Very cheap, yet great quality food. I got the Huevos Rancheros and I was very satisfied!

I totally recommend La Salsa Cantina!
