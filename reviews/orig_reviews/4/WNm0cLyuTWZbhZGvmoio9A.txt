Wow, my wife and I had a great time here.  We just got off the plane, and were a bit groggy.  This awesome meal really perked us up.  We had their 4 for thirty menu (you have to ask for it, it is not on their regular menu).  It was super tasty, and a nice value.  Part of it was a mixed green salad, and it had these spicy pumpkin seeds on it that were soooo good.  All the other items were great, too.  My green chile pork stew as an appetizer was super tasty.  We both got the house margarita, and it was very good.

The service was good, but not great.  He seemed annoyed about the 4 for thirty thing (even though we tipped him as if we paid full price for everything).  We would have ordered more drinks, but he disappeared.

Still, because of the great food, we would definitely be back.  It was a great time.
