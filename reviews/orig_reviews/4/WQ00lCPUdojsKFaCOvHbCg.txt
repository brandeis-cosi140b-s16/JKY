In search of a new good Mexican restaurant, we decided to drive across town after reading the good reviews here on Yelp. I have to say that the neighborhood was a bit suspect, and as we walked up to the door there was a vagrant right next to it. The first thing we noticed when we walked inside was a strange smell, followed by uncomfortable heat. We sat down at a booth, the waitress came over and asked what we wanted to drink, and then we asked her if the air conditioner was on. She proceeded to tell us that it was broken (by the way, the temperature outside was 108). Inside it had to be 100 degrees without exaggeration. She brought back the drinks and the chips and we considered at that point that we might just leave. Even the other guests were mentioning how stifling the heat was.

HOWEVER- after trying the chips and the salsa, we knew the food would be worth staying for. We ordered a cheese quesadilla and a steak chimichanga, and needless to say, it was FANTASTIC! I'm not a huge fan of Mexican, but the chimichanga was absolutely delicious: the steak was tender and the tortilla was fried perfectly! We ended up eating for under $20 without tip. 

The service was mediocre, but the food was fantastic. Even though there were flaws in our experience, great food will always bring us back! If the air conditioner was working, we probably would've given it 5 stars.
