Holla! 

This resteraunt continues to impress me. Rustic atmosphere that makes it feel just right. Pretty much what'd you think of when you think of Mexican food. 

Portions are great, the beer is ice cold, and the prices are very reasonable. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because the food is very basic. There isn't really anything that sets them on a much higher level from your other generic Mexican place. 

I do however think they are better than your basic Mexican place.  Definitely worth going in and I intend to go back!
