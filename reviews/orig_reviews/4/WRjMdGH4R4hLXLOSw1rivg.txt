LOVE LOVE LOVE tacos el gordo! To be honest, I'm pretty sad that this location is now a good distance away from the strip. It's past or in downtown LV from what I can remember. 

The food is yummy as always. Get the adobada! The lines are long and can get confusing since they tend to curve around the tables in the middle. Remember, each line is meant for a specific meat! It's not very cool in there so it kind of sucks when it's hot as balls outside, but it's okay. I'd do it for the food. Eat and bounce! 

While I was in line, a child spilled a drink on the floor near me. While I was standing waiting for my order of fries, the lady who was cleaning the floor pushed me out of her way! I understand that you're trying to wipe up the drink but she could've tapped me and asked me to move nicely. What if I had stepped onto some liquid after she pushed me and slipped? 

TL;DR eat here if you're craving some bomb freaking tacos. Remember, adobada!
