This is the first time I have gone to this place in the whole country, so I had a blast here. Even though, I didn't order food, we got DRINKS quite a few of them. We were group of 6 guys, everyone else got food and they could hardly finish their meals. The service here was FANTASTIC, super friendly staff. 

So, it was one of my friend's b'day, so I asked the server if we could get him a piece of cake/ dessert on the house . He said NO!    *At this point, I am like shitt*

The very next second, he says, I can do TEQUILA shots. I was thinking maybe it's for him only, but server got it for entire table.

Tip: You can get a house margherita if you do a YELP Check-IN.
