First time here.  Overall this restaurant is the best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at since I moved here about 2 years ago.  I'm not a fan of the salsa but my wife loved the margarita she had and the tamales.  I had the carne asada which I also enjoyed. We also had some desert the mexican flan and the sopapilla.  The flan was pretty good the sopapilla was good but the honey that came with was not appetizing at all.  I would recommend this restaurant to my friends.  Can't wait to try some other dishes.
