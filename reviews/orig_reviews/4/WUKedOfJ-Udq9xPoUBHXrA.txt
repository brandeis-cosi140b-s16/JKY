Wow!  I just had an awesome dinner at the Blue Adobe Grill and not only did my husband and I enjoy our meal the service was great!   I can't remember the name of my entr√©e but it was a lobster tamale with a seafood chili relleno....yummy!   My husband had a blue corn seafood enchilada that he loved.  We will be back!!
