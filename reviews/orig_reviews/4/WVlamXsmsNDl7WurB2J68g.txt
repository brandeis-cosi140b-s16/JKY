Ya I just want to say I love this place!! How could you not? The found is outstanding every time I come in I know I will not be disappointed . Idk maybe it's the margaritas talking  but this place is a must try make sure to start out with the dumplings. The flavors in this dish alone gives them the four . It would be a five no doubt but it is always very loud and the service is a hit or miss. But to a foodie like myself the ambience doesn't  really ruin everything So enjoy over eating over drinking and your left overs in the morning! ( they have awesome portion sizes)
