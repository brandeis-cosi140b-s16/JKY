As with the other Upwards Project restaurants this is a win.  It may not be authentic Mexican food but it is good.  
The decor is a lot of fun.  The seating is very comfortable.  That was the first thing that was mentioned.  The booths were big and comfortable with plenty of room.  The music is fun and upbeat.  
Now to the food.  The chips and salsa are great and they just keep coming.  We got the nachos which we could have finished with and had a great night.  My mother in law got the vegetarian burrito and said she would love to come back and get some more.  My husband and I got the 3 tacos and they were each very good, not authentic but still good.  My daughter had had the chicken tacos in the past so decided to have the burrito and ate every bite.  If she only kind of likes something she will eat some of it but when she eats the whole thing it means she really likes it.  The orange cucumber sale was a big hit.  The black beans were ok the rice was not so good.  For dessert we had the churros and the banana pudding.  My husband knowing full well that I am allergic explained how delicious the pudding is.  The churros come with a chocolate sauce that has a hint of spice to it.  I have already been there twice and plan on returning.
