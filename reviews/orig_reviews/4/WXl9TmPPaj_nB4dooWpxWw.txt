Earlier tonight I had a breakfast burrito with eggs and chorizo from here, and thought it was great. My family comes here often to quickly pick up some dinner to take home and eat. I am never disappointed with the food and it always meets my expectations. Their quesadilla is amazing. It's a little large and greasy, but it is one of the best quesadillas I've had and the cheese is delicious.
