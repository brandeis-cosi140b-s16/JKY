This place is delicious! Great variety and reasonably priced - can't beat that!

Try the guacamole, but head's up....it's spicy! Not mind-blowingly so but a little surprising. Especially for my wife who doesn't like spicy food - she ate it anyway. 

I also got the chicken flautas. Plenty of chicken filling, great sauce on top and a dollop of guac as well. 

Great place and a nice place to hang out. There are only a few seats inside but plenty outside where you can see the show of Container Park going on.
