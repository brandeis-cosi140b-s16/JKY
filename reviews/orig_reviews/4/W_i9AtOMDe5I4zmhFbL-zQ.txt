Really enjoyed our dinner at Abuelo's.  We took a seat in the bar during happy hour and had the Jalapeno Cheese Fritters - very good.  All three of us had a combo meal and they were generous and tasty and actually priced reasonable.  Now the food is good buy not as authentic as some would like,  I wouldn't call it Americanized but it was not like eating at the local taqueria.  Still very good.  The service was super and the beer cold -- what more can you ask for!

We will be back.
