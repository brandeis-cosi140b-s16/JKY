This place is really great! The food was affordable and good quality. I write a travel blog and I'm always looking for ways to save money or find delicious authentic food. The burritos were around 5.60 and for an additional $3 you can add a "sopapilla" and 2 sides. My grandmother is from New Mexico and they had some dishes I remember eating when I was a child, like the chile verde stew with shredded beef chunks. 

Overall a great place, if you live in the area or have a car while visiting I suggest taking a ride over to try it out.
