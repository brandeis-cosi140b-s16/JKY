Javier's is one of the better Mexican food places in Las Vegas. I just moved here from Tucson, AZ so it has been a difficult adjustment when it comes to the lack of good Mexican food, to say the least. Javier's has been one of the better places to satisfy your craving for some south of the border cuisine. 

The menu had classic Mexican dishes with original twists. One of my only complaints is that some of the dishes seemed to have a bit too much salt. The guacamole was amazing and you cannot have too many cucumber margaritas (except you definitely could because they are so strong.) 

Great atmosphere as well. Really enjoyed it.
