What an amazing find! I was in town for the weekend and my friend took me here for what was to be an unforgettable meal. This place is rather unassuming among all the other establishments on the street but do not let that deter you! Something I have always loved about traveling is enjoying how chefs will mix the local cuisine and their cooking pedigree. This place surely was a melting pot of that idea!

We came for an early Friday evening dinner and the place was already picking up. A good sign that this place is popular. The decor inside was eclectic and it is not a big restaurant by any means but it really works for this place.

For an appetizer, please get the table side guacamole. As a midwesterner who spent a lot of time on the West Coast growing up, you don't realize how great fresh the avocados are until you leave the West. It was so good here, and the pomegranates were definitely the reason why!

I ordered the Pollo Poblano which did not disappoint! The chicken was moist and tender and the pine nuts in the dish really stood out to me! The cheese on it was also extremely fresh and I just loved the dish so much i ate the entire thing in one sitting! This very easily could have been two meals.

For dessert, we ordered the Churros which were amazing! The ice cream it came with also perfect as well as the caramel sauce it came in! Whenever I come back to Phoenix, I am going to this place!
