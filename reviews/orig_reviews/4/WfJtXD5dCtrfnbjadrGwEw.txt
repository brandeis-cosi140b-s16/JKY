Happy hour!  After checking into our hotel we had already planned that this would be our first stop and we needed a drink!  Wanted to check out the place, and to get our Vegas on!  The Hubs and I both had a Margarita and we quickly decided to try the Happy hour Nachos and Tequitos. Both were really good and my picky husband commented on how good the beef was on the nachos. A little spendy for 2 Tequitos (even though they were big) Fun place!
