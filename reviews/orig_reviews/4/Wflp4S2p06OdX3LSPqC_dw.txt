Okay lets get the facts out of the way;
1. The place is a dump.
2. It is a quik service place.
3. Prices are very reasonable.

If you are in the mood for fast mexican food that tastes muy bueno - this is the place!  Cheap eats and authentic taqueria type food.  

I had the carnitas plate - carnitas, beans, rice, and chips. With a drink it is about $10.  The plate was enough for 2 people easily (I think the girl behind the counter liked me so she may have given me extra...not sure though).  

A friend had the carne asada - I sampled it and it was right on.

All of the food was simple with lotsa flavor.  I am guessing the beans had real lard, too.  Hey every once in awhile is good!

Viva Pepes Tacos!
