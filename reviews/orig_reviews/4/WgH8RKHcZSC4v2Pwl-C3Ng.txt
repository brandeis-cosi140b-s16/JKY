I do love restaurants that are in converted houses, don't ask me why.  The patio is great because in the winter they have heaters and on the weekends a guy sitting outside playing guitar and singing in Spanish, making for great ambiance.  
But this is tough because I've been to this place and gotten 5 star service and meal, and then I've gone and gotten 2 star service and meals.  So I've settled for in between.   As for the menu they do have excellent, authentic mole which is hard to come by.  I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein.  If you are more in the mood for something in a tortilla their shrimp and fish tacos or seafood enchiladas are both stuffed with fresh seafood and dressed with homemade sauces.  They serve healthful sides like black beans, brown rice and fresh veggies.  To end the night I highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy, chocolate mouse filling. 
On a side note you can buy tamales in the winter months full of fun flavors, like chocolate and pineapple.
