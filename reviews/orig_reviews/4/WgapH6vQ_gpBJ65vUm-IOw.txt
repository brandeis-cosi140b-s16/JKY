I'm with Ashley, can't believe I've not written a review.  Amazing, my favourite Marg's in the entire valley. You see those people squeezing those wee limes all day long. I really can't stand an over sugared sour mixed yankee margarita. I've always sat at the bar, had brilliant service, grand  late night and early eve happy hours. They have daily specials too. I love their chips and salsa, warm and not overly salted like el segundo (no offense segundo, I love lettuce entertain you, but your chips and salsa are wayy  to over NaCl(ed).  If you order the guac, you don't have to get the table side you can order one from the kitchen and its a bit cheaper.
Cheers and thanks for turning me around now a regular.
