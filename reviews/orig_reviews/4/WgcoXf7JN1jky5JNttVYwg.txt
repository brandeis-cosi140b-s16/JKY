Ive been here 3 times already , and every time has been packed , which is a good sign. Ikind of dis like having to squeeze through to get my salsa and garnishes, maybe its time to get a bigger spot? haha . I'm a huge fan of Tacos de Cabeza , alot of places have too much fat and are really greasy , but here its ON POINT . I havent tried any of the plates they have on the menu , usually stick to tacos . My daughter gets a cheese Quesadilla on a corn tortilla , and my hubby almost gets one of each taco on the menu ha . the green salsa the have there is the best ive had since my mother in law & the guacamole sauce (i think thats what it is) is also great . On my last Visit i had done take out , ordered 4 tacos de cabeza , i was craving it like crazy, took less than 10 mins, took me another 10 to get home , peeled back the foil and realized that I got Carne Asada, i was so sad or fat that i got dissapointed and ate my food unhappy , but that was partially my fault for not checking my order . i'll be back soon when im craving tacos !
