Great value for your money!

I was in Vegas on a work conference. After finding out that the evening event would only serve appetizers (I know, lame!) I quickly found a place for a quick bite. Yelp had a deal for DJs taco bar, so I gave it a shot. 

I got the fish tacos, and while they weren't necessarily the best I've ever had, for $10 they did just fine. I also got the beans and rice as well as chips and guac. 

I'll knock off a star for the fact that the food was good, not great. Value-wise, I feel like I got a lot for my money. They also took longer than I expected to make the food.

Bottom line: If I'm in the area and want a quick, delicious bite, I'll go back!
