Food is outstanding, service not bad. This is a very modern creative approach to Mexico cousine. We had the guacamole for appetizer which the waitress prepared table side it was a bit chunky but very flavorful. California enchilada was exploding with nice flavor. Tacos were very small more like sliders size but very tasty.
