This is so close to my house that it is a shame that I have been driving by it for the last 4 years.  Finally, tonight, my wife was feeling adventurous enough to try a new place.  We were very happy with our experience and will be returning again in the near future.

Chips and salsa were good.  The salsa was a smooth, red sauce that I would define as medium hot, although I like SPICY food.  The chips were crisp and not greasy.

I had the Enchiladas Blancas which were green chile enchilada with a spicy cream cheese sauce.  They were very good and the tortillas were crisp.  The meat inside was delicious.  Rice was good and the bean salad side was interesting.

My wife ate the El Pollo Fundido.  It was one of the best I have ever tried.  The chicken was tender and not over-cooked.  My wife is Chicana and can be very picky about  her Mexican food.  That she liked La Casa Blanca means a lot.

The kids had chicken tenders and french fries, cheese crisp, and a bean burrito.  All of the kids reported they liked their meals.  They also had strawberry smoothies which were delicious.

Our waiter was quick, attentive, and friendly.  For the five of us, the bill came to just over $50, which I consider very reasonable for what we got.  We were very happy with our meal and sorry we had not tried this great restaurant sooner.
