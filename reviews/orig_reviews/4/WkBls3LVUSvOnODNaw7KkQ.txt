Korean/Mexican fusion? Who woulda thought of that but I'm glad someone did. Pretty good. 

My brother brought me and my gf here. He had the bulgogi nachos (huge portion), my gf had the fusion chimichanga w/pork and I had the combo flautas (all 3 meats with cheese then fried).

I tried everything and all were good even the free chips and salsa. If we make it back here I'd get the fusion chimichanga.

Service is friendly and very helpful if it's your first time.
