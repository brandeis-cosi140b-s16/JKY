Owned by a husband and wife team, this place has what it takes to really become a great spot for traditional street-style Mexican tacos and other native Mexican cuisine. 

Favorites on the menu are the Taco Oriental and side of guacamole. 

The Taco Oriental are these tiny tacos on corn tortillas with seasoned, diced pork.  They come plain and wrapped tightly.   If this is all you get, get 6.  If you get guacamole and chips & salsa to go with, I recommend 3-4 Taco Orientals. 

Guacamole is super fresh.  This is NOT fast food.  If you stop in, prepare to wait.  It is worth it, the food is made fresh.  I am not sure the tortillas are made fresh.   Which I find somewhat disappointing since this is such an easy thing to make fresh.  I need to confirm this. 

The décor is also noteworthy.  Its this fusion of Mexican and Native American with a modern, clean look.  For a strip mall, it's refreshing.  I loved the décor so much I thought perhaps I might want something similar in my home kitchen.  When I asked, the owner told me his wife did the décor.  How impressive!   She was also cooking.  So I will let her be for now.  Ha. 

He did lose the music: said he did not know he would have to pay royalties/fee to play music, so he has a TV now.  So there is some entertainment.  But no music is a downer to some degree.  

I always get "to go" here now, but there is a quaint seating area and I have dined here with my toddler before and the service is great.
