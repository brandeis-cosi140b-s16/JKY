Love faustos! When me and the hubs are hungry and grumpy we go there and get carne asada fries. They put us in a good mood again! My only problem with this place is their quality of beef. A lot of times I'm chewing on gristle. But it's a small price to pay for A LOT of awesome food at at a great price!
