My review is a little biased, Diablo's was having an event so i didn't experience any of the food but the atmosphere was great. The music was exactly what I personally like to hear when I come out. The party was upstairs and I loved the set up! Plenty of seating around the bar and a little area in the back, Plenty of ceiling fans to keep you cool, it was all very chill. The bartenders were top notch! Even though it was busy they were all friendly and  personable, which is rare on busy nights. You really got a chance to see their personality as they interacted with the customers and often grooved themselves as the music got really good. 
These elements alone make me want to come back and check out Diablo's on another night just to see how they normally roll, I will more than likely be back..!
