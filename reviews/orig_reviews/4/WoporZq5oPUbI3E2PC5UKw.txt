Like the beef more than.the chicken...
Everybody calls this place the pink chicken because the chicken really looks pink.  The food is great.  I don't think that they do substitutions because they charged me the regular price when I asked if i could get rice instead of beans with my meal.  I usually order the combo meal but thought I'd give the all beef a shot.  I love their tortillas and their pico de gallo is just the right amount of spicy for me.  The only thing annoying about this place is that they don't take credit cards.  I have to make a special trip just to the atm before i come here.
