Hoo-boy, did I feel like an idiot.

I've been wanting to try Dick's Hideaway for some time now, being a lover of New Mexican cuisine.  My main stumbling block was not knowing where the hell it is.

After circling the intersection several times and cursing my GPS I finally decided to park and wander around.  It's a good thing I did!

After walking past the unassuming doors a few times (hence the idiot feelings) I finally saw the tiny menu stuck next to the storefront.  I cautiously went in.

The interior is small to the extreme, but very cozy and well appointed.  The bar area was completely full so I stood by the door in the hopes of finding a hostess or server.  Ten minutes passed and again I felt like an idiot.  Finally a kind server took pity on me and seated me at the public table.  From here on out everything went smooth as butter.

The menu was full of enticing food.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Christmas style (red and green sauce).  The food was delivered quickly, and it was amazing.

The eggs were cooked to perfection and the beans were well flavored.  I didn't intend on eating the seasoned red potatoes, really I didn't.  They were so perfectly cooked that I couldn't resist.  The red and green sauces were exactly what I was craving, perfectly spiced.

Maybe there's a trick to Dick's Hideaway, a perfect time to come or a way to sneak a seat at the bar.  If I can solve the riddle you can bet I'll be back again and again.
