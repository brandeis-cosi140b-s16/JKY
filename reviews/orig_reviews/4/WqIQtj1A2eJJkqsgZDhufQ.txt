This place is a good go to when you're looking for a mexican infused panda express.  Haha.  Yum!  I got the combo meal with the Jade Red chicken made into a quesadilla and the diablo chicken.  Really good!  I also got jerk fried rice.  The beans were also very good.  Yummy in my tummy.  I really enjoyed Chino Bandido's, but don't think I could go more than once during a trip to Phoenix (I'd get very large from eating like this!).  :D  Oh yeah, if you want something more than a snack, don't just get a quesadilla by itself.  My poor brother thought the quesadilla would be huge and good enough for his dinner (thinking taqueria size), but it was pretty sad and small.  Luckily, my combo wasn't that small and I had extra food to share.
