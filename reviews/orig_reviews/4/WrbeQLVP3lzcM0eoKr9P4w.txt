First of all, their chips and salsa is very good.  I am embarrassed to admit how much I actually ate.  Then came the chicken enchiladas (I forget the actual name).  They were also really good.  They came with a side of rice and beans (I just got rice because I don't like beans).  I actually wasn't a big fan of the rice, but between the enchiladas and the chips/salsa, who needs rice.
