Atmosphere is great, good music, friendly and very attentive staff. Our waitress was always right there to refill our drinks when they got low. Over all great customer service. I believe something I ate there was either bad or I had a reaction because the whole next day I was puking... However I can't fully blame them cus I ate other things that day too . Would try again
