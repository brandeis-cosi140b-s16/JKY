We've eaten a few times and each time (knocks on wood) the service has been great and the food has been really good.  Lots of great flavor and the portions are not over the top.   Parking can be a little bit of a pain on a busy night... but... other than that... we will go back again next time we are in Tempe.  Well worth the trip.
