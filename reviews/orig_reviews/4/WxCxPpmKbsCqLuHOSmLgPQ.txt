Ordered take out from here, and was actually impressed! They were super quick and the food was really good. I had a blackened shrimp burrito with a delicious chipotle cream sauce as well as a lobster taco (I mean, how could one not order a taco with lobster in it right?) The blackened shrimp burrito came with a side of chips and was everything I was looking for in a lunch. The lobster taco was also delicious, and the lobster was cooked perfectly.

I'm thinking of ordering here for a large group order for work in the future, just because I think it would go over really well! The only thing I wish (as someone who works in the area) is that they delivered, but honestly I'll definitely be back.
