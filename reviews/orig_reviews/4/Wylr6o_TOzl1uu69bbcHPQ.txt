I can't really comment too much on food at Z'Tejas since I didn't eat here but I can comment on their service, decor, and margaritas. Now one thing I'll have to say to Z'Tejas is "Job well done on your margaritas" You take your special drink serious and the taste shows. Your service as fast and friendly. Your decor as very Phx and Southwest proud. Next time I'll try your food but let me just add your prices for your food are too high and that was a turn off and we choose not to eat there. Otherwise...your team is going a great job.
