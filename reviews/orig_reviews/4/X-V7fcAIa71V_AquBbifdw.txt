Very authentic tasting tacos and quesadillas. You know the food is good when 95% of the people dinning in a Mexican restaurant are Mexican! We just got to Vegas and it was Cinco de Mayo and there was no better place to start off the festivities than an authentic Mexican restaurant.

I had the carne asada tacos, DELICIOUS!! The staff was great and really friendly and the restaurant had a really cool atmosphere and prices are very reasonable.
Will definitely stop by next time I'm in Vegas.
