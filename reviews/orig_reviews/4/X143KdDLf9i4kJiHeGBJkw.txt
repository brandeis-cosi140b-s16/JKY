A fantastic Mexican inspired restaurant that will take you beyond taco's and enchiladas.  The drinks are fun and interesting including the Flor De Jamaica Margarita**** (Hibiscus flower reduction, Tesoro Silver Tequilla and Grand Mariner). 

We started with the Kuali de Camaron and an appitizer of the Pork Taco's.  The Kuali de Cararon***** was an amazing five star appetizer which had layers of flavor.  The roasted jalapeño filled with queso de cabra y oaxaca was spicy and creamy.  The shrimp and avocado gave the dish that extra level of flavor and texture although I would have eaten just the cheese and cream filled jalapeño as is.  I ordered the pork tacos*** because I wanted to try the pork which is marinated in the achiote and sour orange and cooked in a banana leaf overnight.  I have tried this marinade myself and wanted to see if I got it right.  The pork was wonderful however I thought it was missing something like an avocado slice or a creamy cheese to balance it out.'

For my main course I enjoyed Chef Silvana's Iconic Dish, Chiles en Nogada*****.  This is a fire roasted poblano pepper filled with chopped chicken, apple, pear, dried apricot and pecans, in a delicate almond cream sauce.  Cilantro and pomegranate seeds complete the Mexican flag colors for final presentation.  This dish was different and very tasty.  I think the almond cream sauce and queso fresco is what made the dish for me.

My wife had the Pescado del Mar***.  The fish of the day was halibut however she didn't get to try most of it because she was full from the bounty of shrimp, scallops and sweet crab meat which it was covered in.  The halibut was a little dry as well.  The cream sauce and crab meat really store the show for this dish.

We didn't have space for desert.  Great decor here as well.
