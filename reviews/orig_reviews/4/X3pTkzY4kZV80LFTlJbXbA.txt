Happy hour is a must!!! $5 margarita? Can't beat that. The trio (guac, salsa, queso) was really yummy! Fresh cornbread? To die for! I had the veggie/mushroom enchiladas, what sold me was the MOLE SAUCE. So good! I don't typically order all veggie dishes, but with the portos it was hearty enough...too bad I couldn't substitute ALL Porto's, but I understand as they can be pricey (I did ask). They were SOOO BUSY! Way to be on top of things and have a ton of wait staff to help others, I really like seeing that team work.  Hug parties in the back, and I saw a few managers busting their butt too, congrats. Our server was really great, I think her name was Sara
