this place has a very cool layout. entering from the street, it opens up wide with a wrap around patio, lots of shade from structures and trees, cool foliage, and even a big duck pond with lots of ducks, swans, and turtles. 

we were seated immediately and served some very tasty, crispy chips and 3 types of salsa's. i had 2 of the house margaritas which i thought were so good, they went down too easily. we split a green chile tamale appetizer, 1 each, and they were surprisingly very filling and packed with chiles. we also split a fish taco plate, which was mediocre and a little high priced for only 2 tacos with one tiny sliver of fish inside. 

the black beans and rice were cooked well and had a great flavor. for out 2 plates, 2 margaritas, and 2 beers, we paid about 50 bucks with tip. our sever, poor guy, didn't smile once and although prompt, was obviously not happy to be at work today. 

when the folks come to town, we might have to venture out this way again.
