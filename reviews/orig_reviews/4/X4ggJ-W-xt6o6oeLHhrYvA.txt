Very small place, super friendly service, really good food, awesome family "feel". 1st come, 1st serve seating. Went with a party of 6 total. 2 adults, 2 young children, 2 college kids. There were two large parties of people (6 top & 8 top) waiting to be seated when we arrived. We arrived as my 5 year old was melting down from hunger (and sitting through his sisters orchestra concert). Waiting was becoming a problem--shortly after we arrived as my 65 lb child was sprawled across the only hallway between the kitchen and seating area--he was just DONE. One of the staff, saw me struggling to get my kid up & took it upon herself to bring him a basket of chips & salsa!!! She smiled sympathetically while delivering them. OMG my kid got up and started cooing over the tricolored chips while scarfing them down. That move on the part of that lovely staff person was one of the most thoughtful public displays of parenting support i have ever experienced. We were seated about 7-10 minutes after we arrived. The food itself was very good. All fresh, good flavor, good size portion without being overwhelming.
