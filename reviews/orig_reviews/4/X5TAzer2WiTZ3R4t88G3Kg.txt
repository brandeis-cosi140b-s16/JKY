As soon as I walked in the door I knew we were in for a real treat! The inside of this place blew me away. Not sleek, modern or sexy but comfortable antiquity. The sheer volume of this space would rival some dim sum houses.. its huge but cozy, I know that doesn't make sense.. you have to see it.. like going to your rich Mexican grandmothers house. 

The food and service was awesome! This is how Garcia's used to be when I was a kid before they started to go down hill. Pollo Fundido was awesome however, the chicken had a slight fridge taste so you know it wasn't made that day. Seriously, if you go you have to try the Fundido!  It's stil super yummy!

Oh they used to have something called Olivia's sampler, basically everything in miniature with a green corn tamale.. its been renamed the Appetizer sampler.. this to is a must!  A TON of super yummy goodness! 

Make the trek to the 'hood.. this is an oasis in the middle of a not so great area!
