When we moved from Houston to Charlotte, we were heartbroken to leave Chuy's behind...and were thrilled when we found out that they'd be opening in Charlotte this summer. We were out of town for their actual Grand Opening, but finally made it in about 2 weeks after they opened. We were seated quickly around 6:15 on a Wednesday. As soon as our server came over to take our drink order we also asked for a cup of the creamy jalapeno dip to go with the chips - it was delicious, but not quite what we're used to - I think it was missing some garlic, or maybe even some jalapeno. I had a Bloody Mary, others in my party had margaritas.

I ordered my old standby, the big as your face burrito with fajita beef, with Boom Boom Sauce (think cheesy, green chile goodness). I love that I get a solid two meals out of it. The Boom Boom Sauce was extra spicy that night, but had cooled off a bit by lunch the next day.

We're hoping that this location will be participating in the annual Chuy's Green Chile Festival in August.
