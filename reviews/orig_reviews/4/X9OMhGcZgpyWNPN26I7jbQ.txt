During the mile-long trek back to our hotel, we decided it was time for a margarita (and when you're in Vegas, when is it not time for a margarita). A quick search on our iPhone's Yelp app turned up this little Mexican restaurant which serves some of the best Primo margaritas I've had. To be honest, they're actually the only Primo margaritas I've had (I usually opt for the Cadillacs at Paco's), but now all other margaritas are hereby known as Secondo margaritas. These little beauties are strong, though, so be prepared. Pair them with some excellent nachos, and you've got yourself a party.

Note regarding the restaurant's name: It looks like I spent four years living in Isla Vista without knowing how to correctly pronounce it (if my memory isn't complete shot, everyone said "EYE-la"). You can chalk this up to just another example of typical gringo ignorance. I'm sad and ashamed.
