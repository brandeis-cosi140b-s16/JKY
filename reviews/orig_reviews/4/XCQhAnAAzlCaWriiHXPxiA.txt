This place had great, fast service.  The waitress was friendly and knew the menu well to make recommendations.  Their flautas were amazing, as well as the mac & cheese.  Their chips were fresh and they have a great salsa sampler.  The frozen auntie ox drink is one of the best I've had!  Would definitely recommend this place to people willing to try something new.
