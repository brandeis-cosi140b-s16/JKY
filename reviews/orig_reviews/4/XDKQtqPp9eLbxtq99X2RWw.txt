Ay Yai, Yai Yai, I Yam the Chino Bandido!        Can you hear the tune?  

We took the trek from downtown Phoenix to the 'burbs to get this Mexican Chinese fusion fast food.  it was was an easy drive there, but a round-a-bout way back thanks to my refusal to read a map and my co-pilots poor navigating skills.  We were trying to "see" the Arizona typical architecture--in the dark... But we WERE full and happy.

It was so totally worth the drive!  A helpful girl de-mystified  the ordering process  and fed us samples. It's a confusing ordering process to the uninitiated,  I won't even try to describe how to order, the helpful girl will do a much better job when you get there.  

We ordered the Jade Red Chicken--like General Tso's Chicken, ok, nothing spectacular.  Pork fried rice--I loved this, different flavor and tasty to please me. Chinese BBQ pork--different from te bright red Chinese style that I was expecting. Very delicately flavored...so good.  Emerald Chicken-- a nice bright clean flavor with cilantro, my favorite. Chile Relleno--filled with a lot of cheese and fried in what looked like a Cheeze-It crust?  Wierd and too crunchy.  A mouth full of crackers and melted cheese with a hint of roasted chile. Um, no. 
Cuban Black beans, they were good because I'm not a fan of refried beans.

Casual fast food environment in a strip mall. With a free snickerdoodle!
