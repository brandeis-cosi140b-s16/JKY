No wait, great service, delicious food, great primo margarita, and fairly reasonably priced.

My girlfriend and I decided to stay in the hotel because we were watching a show at 9:30. Figured I would check Yelp and we chose this place due to all the good reviews. The reviews were on the money.

I had the chicken nachos and the mole poblano. They were both perfect. Everything on the nachos was great, especially the cheese. And if u like mole then u will like this one. Very chocolatey and nutty but not overpowering. Very well done.
