Hip place. Very nice inside with interesting colors and very clean. Terrific bathrooms. 
The tacos and chicken quesadilla were good; different than your local 'burto's taco shop in a good way. 
I'd say your paying a little bit for the "experience" but overall is worth it. Definitely will return.

Just don't expect the dilapidated taco shanty prices
