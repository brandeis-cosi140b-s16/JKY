We came here for lunch on a Sunday after a weekend of watching spring training Cactus League baseball in Mesa, AZ.  The location is a convenient Phoenix strip mall location.

The first thing you notice is the wildly colorful lucha libre decor, with dressed mannequins and posters everywhere.  Very interesting and creative!  Great picture taking opportunity.

The ladies at the counter are very nice and they offer you samples of the meat.  If you can't take the heat, it's a good idea to ask them for the not-too-spicey ones.  

We got 5 small tacos, 3 enchiladas, guacamole and two drinks for about $20, what a bargain.  The food was very good, too.  

I would definitely come back here if I were to make it to spring training again.
