I ordered takeout from here because of a Livingsocial deal. the online ordering process was really simple and easy. the food was a good value for the price (even without the deal). we ordered the carne asada plate and the chicken taco combo. it was a ton of food for two people! come here if you want tex-mex style food - meaning LOTS of cheese on their rice and beans, good guac, and great salsa
