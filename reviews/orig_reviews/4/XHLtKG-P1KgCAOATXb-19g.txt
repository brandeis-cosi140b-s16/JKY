I went to TQLA with a group of friends after hiking so we were hungry and ready to eat.  We sat in the bar area and our server quickly came over with chips and salsa and took our drink order.  Their avocado salsa was amazing and I would go just to eat that and drink a few beers.  

I had the carnitas burrito off their lunch menu my friends had the Fajitas and Baja Tacos .  The food was good and everyone enjoyed their lunch but the food is more tex mex then authentic Mexican.
