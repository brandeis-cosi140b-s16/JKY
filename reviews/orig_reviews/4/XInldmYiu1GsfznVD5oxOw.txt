The food here is great and one of the best mexican restaurants in the area, amazing tacos breakfast quesadilla and mole de puerco... Its frequently very busy and you may have to wait.

My only problem with La Unica and the reason for dropping a star is they frequently mix up the mole and you get chicken instead of pork. The pork is amazing, the chicken while still probably better than any other food in the area is still not as good as the pork.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone.
