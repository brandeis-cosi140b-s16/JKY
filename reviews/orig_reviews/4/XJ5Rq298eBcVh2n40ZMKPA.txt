We had dinner here on Friday and it was excellent! Our server was one of the friendliest I had and was eager to help us decide what to order. The margaritas were great! Our group of 3 had the wagyu tacos, the chicken chipotle enchiladas, and the short rib enchiladas. All were quite good, although the chicken enchiladas were my favorite.

The 15% off for locals is quite nice -- not easy to find on the Strip!
