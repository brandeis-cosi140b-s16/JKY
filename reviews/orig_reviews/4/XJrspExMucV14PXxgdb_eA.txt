I will have to admit that these guys have earned my business again , I was contacted by the general manager and he was very apologetic and he wanted to know what the full problem was , We discussed and he said he would make notes and pass it along ..

We decided to go back again and try it last week and i must say that they redeemed themselves the food had a whole new array of flavor and it was how it used to taste , there still could be some improvements in how organized the wait staff is other than that I'm a fan again!! 

Good job
