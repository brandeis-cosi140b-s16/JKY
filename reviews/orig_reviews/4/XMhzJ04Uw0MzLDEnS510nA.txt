First time at this place. Food was great. I'd definitely recommend getting the ceviche and the chicken sopes. The fish tacos we're also delicious. However unfortunately, the margaritas we're not good and I was looking forward to them. Overall, good food, poor drinks but great service. Ronnie, our server, was on point!
