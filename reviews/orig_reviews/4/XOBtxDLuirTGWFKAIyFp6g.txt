Really good!  Awesome patio and great bar area.  Everything I have ever tried has been hot though, even the chips are spicy.  It's not so bad that your tongue swells and you can't see straight.  You can still taste and enjoy the food.  

I always find service to be hit and miss.  Never terribly bad, but usually just average.  Last night, we did have terrific service.  I tried the filet tacos for an appetizer-OMG!  They were sooo good.  Pricey, but well worth it.  Next time, that's my dinner.

My only complaint is the dining room is quite small and not necessarily any quieter than the bar.  If they try to seat you on a busy night near the pick up window, wait for another table.  Also, if you go around happy hour, expect overflow from the bar into the dining room which can make for a less than peaceful experience.  I just try to remember that in my working days there were plenty of times my own loudmouth group of friends were even worse.  I forgot to mention chips are not free-totally lame, yet I buy them every time.
