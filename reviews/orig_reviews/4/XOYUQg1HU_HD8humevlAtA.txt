We hit up the Rokerij on Friday night for an early bday celebration for the hubs! Sooo glad I made reservations, the line to be seated stayed strong the whole time we were there, one group would get seated as another entered the building, the places was jam packed! 

Our waiter, Clark was ON IT all night! He was a great waiter and went above and beyond! 

The food was pretty decent. I ordered the Rokerij burger medium well, but it came out on the medium/medium rare tip...But I dealt and ate it. I had a side of the roasted beets which were pretty fantastic. 

We ordered a couple apps, calamari, onion rings and prime rib and brie cheese toasts...all were delicious!
