Vida is a great spot to bring friends or family, or grab a drink and yummy mexican with a date.  We had a lovely time, great margaritas, great atmosphere for people watching but quiet enough for chatting and serviced was incredibly attentive.

Highlights:

Crab Nachos
Taquitos
Queso Dip
Carne Asada

We will definitely return!
