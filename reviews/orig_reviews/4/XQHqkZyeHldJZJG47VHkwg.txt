I tried their Lengua Chili Verde and it was pretty fantastic. :)

Casa Don Juan was packed tonight (just as packed as it is on First Friday) but the service was fast and attentive.  My waiter was really "on top of things" as he was juggling a few tables and helping celebrate a birthday on the table next to mine.  

(On a side note, if you know someone who really enjoys it when people sing "Happy Birthday" to them in public, this is TOTALLY the place!)

The Lengua Chili Verde was soooo tasty and was just the right amount for the tortillas that it came with.  I definitely recommend! 

I need to go back and try some of the other things on the menu!
