The chips and refried beans dip is something out of this world. I could eat that for my main meal. Their appetizer noodle soup is great. 

The chimicangas are also great. So is the chicken burrito. All the servings are huge and we always have leftovers for a lunch for two.

The atmosphere is very friendly and warm. It is like the typical Mexican restaurant. Food is a little better than most. With exception to the bean dip...it is the best.

Have gone back several times and will continue to do so.
