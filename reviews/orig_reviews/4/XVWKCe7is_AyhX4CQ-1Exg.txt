"A good old Bar"
Old Town is the location of the original Dos Gringos.  Known for a at home feeling Dos provides great bartenders and a friendly staff.  I go to Dos often especially to feel comfortable with a hooded sweatshirt in Scottsdale, its that kind of place.  The music is great is diverse from hip hop to rock and roll.  

Drinks:
Dos is known for Coronas, they promote awesome specials for Thursday, and when it rains Dos offers cheap drinks. 

Food,
I enjoy the prices of the late night menu, they cook until 2AM, nice.
My favorite is the hard shell tacos, a former employee suggested them, I think their great for a small snack at the bar.
