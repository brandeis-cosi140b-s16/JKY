Just stopped in for a taco or two (or who am I kidding? when it's three tacos for $6 you buy three tacos) I got the grilled fish, the green chili beef and the pork. It's kind of a choose your own adventure when you order three tacos and since I start and finish on the same taco, I had to pick my favorite child. I started with the fish taco, you know the Olive Barragan of Tacos. It was very tasty. They put rice and cabbage and a Chipotle sauce on it. It was a solid taco. I then went to taco #2, the green chili beef. This guy was so very tasty. This was the taco that solidified my return to this place. Having tried their salsa out on the fish taco o decided that their green was the tastiest and put some on taco #2. Happy day. Finally my pork taco. It was a great end to the meal. I washed it down with a blended strawberry lemonade which was $3, a little pricey but they got me to fall for then with the three tacos for six bucks hiw could I say no. Tip these guys is my last bit of advice. They're sweating hard in the 110Â° AZ heat. The outside searing has some solid mist going and fans so you stay cool but those boys earn their tips. Oh yeah good atmosphere and lots of fun stuff to look at.
