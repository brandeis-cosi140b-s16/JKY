If I could give 4.5 stars I would! This place was so great. I can only speak on the tacos since that's all I tried. 

First, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming. The decor is nice but I wish it was a bit more bright. You know how some restaurants keep their lights a bit dim? Yeah, not a fan of that!

But the tacos, OMG! My personal favorite was the pork belly one. I really liked how it was paired with pineapple. I also enjoyed the short rib taco and the fish one as well. I would recommend trying all of them honestly. The amount of meat is generous! I think it is definitely worth the $4 dollars. 

I seriously can't wait to come back here! They remind me of the taco trucks I like going to, but much more luxurious and meaty.
