I looooove Mexican food. Burritos, tacos, you name it. I'll eat it all! So it doesn't come to a surprise that Mad Mex is something I'm a fan of. We ordered takeout from this location last week and the food was great! 

I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito which consisted of chicken, beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, peppers and sour cream. Yum! It wasn't anything that made me go crazy,, but consistent to what I'd imagined. What left me most impressed, however, was the size of the burrito. It was freakin' huge! It pretty much took up the entire take-out container. For $10, I thought they could have thrown in some chips or something, but all in all, a great meal! 

They do a great job at packing their take-out orders as well. Everything was neat and situated well with no room for any spills or accidents. They even pack things like lettuce, tomato and cheese separately for things like tacos so you can put on as much as you'd like. 

Good service and good food. It was must first time eating from Mad Mex in years and I'll definitely return after my last visit.
