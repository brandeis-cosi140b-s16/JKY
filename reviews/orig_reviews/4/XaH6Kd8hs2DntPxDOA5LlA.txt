Isla, inside Treasure Island, is a really good semi-upscale Mexican restaurant. While I was there the bar was always packed and reservations were required in the dining room.  Service was very efficient at both the bar and restaurant. If you are a Tequila person there is an extensive tequila menu. I am I did and was not disappointed. Waiter will assist you if you can describe what you type of tequila you favor.

We went with a group on both occasions and no one was disappointed.. I had a chicken enchilada type dish on the first go around and it was pretty good. The filet mignon burrito was also a hit on my second visit. The taco chips were OK not great. And their top shelf Margies were also a hit. 

If you are staying at TI this is a good place for happy hour and people watching. If you do have drinks, Apps and dinner it can get expensive, but the food and drinks are very good.
