Bravo!

Went for dinner, and liked it so much, went back two nights later.

Name it, service, cuisine, ambiance (you need a flashlight or candle to read the menu), or friendliness...this is the place!

Date night? Yes. Celebration? Yes. Gourmet enrichment? Yes. The guacamole ROCKs, order it! The street corn rocks, order it!  The grits (both types) rock, order both! Try any recipe with pork shoulder. Each bite is a celebration of flavor. I was pounding on the table with joy. Pumpkin bread pudding was a celebration of wonder. Order it.

Don't come without a reservation unless you feel lucky. We saw people being turned away. Come hungry. They limit your time...so say for a 5:15 reservation, they politely indicate when being seated that you have until 7 (rare, but they do it well). This didn't bother us at all as we had plenty of time.

This place is a Scottsdale must, possibly even a Phoenix must. You MUST dine here.

Bon appetit!
