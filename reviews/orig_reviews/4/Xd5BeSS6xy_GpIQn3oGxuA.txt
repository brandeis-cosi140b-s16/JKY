I just stopped here during a business trip to grab dinner. I received a coupon for a free app from my hotel (Hilton) so I figured I would check it out. Hands down I was extremely impressed and will certainly be back. The shrimp appetizer I had was out of this world and not what I was expecting. The main dish, I forget the name of it, but there was a good mix of different foods. The services are not huge but don't let that worry you because you will definitely be full. Check out Vida if you're in downtown Charlotte.
