I love those beeritas! The price for them are decent. The food will keep you tied over. It's not authentic Mexican so don't expect to be overwhelmed, but it is tasty. Go for the drinks and if your hungry the food will do too. Wish the price of the food matched the taste cuz it could really stand to be cheaper. I like the pleasant and friendly service, and the overall feel of the place. It's fun and that's what I love about it! Shrimp enchiladas are my favorite, but if your trying to save money Taco Tuesday $1.75 per taco is your best bet.
