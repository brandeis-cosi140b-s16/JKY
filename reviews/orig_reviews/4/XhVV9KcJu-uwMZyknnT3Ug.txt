The partner and I went last night, and we had a great time! 

Monday nights seem to be a good time for visiting new(ish) restaurants, we had great service from the hostess, server(s) and manager.

On to the food! The chips were outstanding! I'm guessing double fried, I don't have high standards but I couldn't stop munching on these. As others have mentioned, the roasted tomatillo salsa was outstanding, something I would expect to pay extra for at most restaurants.

The menu consisted of 5-6 appetizers $8-12, 2-4 soups and salads $8-11 and about 8 main entrees from $11-30. There were ample vegetarian options and last night there seemed to be a lot of fish on the menu. Also, I'm by no means an expert on the subject, but the menu struck me as not tex-mex but more something Rick Bayless would put together.

I had the chile rellenos de (something or other). WOW! These poblanos were SPICY, but manageable, over some awesome white & black rice with loads of perfectly wood grilled veggies (including grilled fennel bulb, yum!) surrounding the plate. The sauce was super smoky and savory. Also glad that these were not fried.

My partner had the enchiladas de verduras, as others have mentioned, and we were a big fan. Maybe they have changed it up a bit, but they were just oozing with smokey chard cheesey goodness with another roasted sauce that I would aspire to at home.

There's a wall full of tequila, you can imagine what that is used for, 8 or 10 draft selections, and a somewhat paltry wine list. I went with the Big Hop.

Overall, it seems like everything is either smoked, grilled or roasted... and I'm super down with that. We were very pleased, but just felt like the menu was about 25% pricier than we had hoped. Ambiance is great, should be loads of fun on the huge patio in the summer.
