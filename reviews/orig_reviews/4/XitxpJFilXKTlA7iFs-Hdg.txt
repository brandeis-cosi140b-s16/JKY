This is one of my favorite places to eat. I am wild for the "wild mushroom enchiladas" -- have had them several times and have really enjoyed 'em. The complimentary cornbread and butter is very good, especially when it is served warm. I also love their pecan-crusted chicken spinach salad. The ahi tuna appetizer is a treat.  http://www.ztejas.com/
