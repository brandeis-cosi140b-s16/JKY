A Mexican veggie option other than a veggie burrito/ taco is that too much to ask for?

Thankfully Otro has two other unique offerings. A veggie torta and the real reason to come if you are vegetarian the veggie paella. 

Many of the basics here are similar to their sister location (gallo blanco) the thick quarter round chips the green and red salsas how ever a bit more sour. 

The paella was great full of flavor and textures from the various fresh veggies, it was very hot from the nearly nuclear iron skillet it is served in so take your time as it will burn you. It is served with a few token corn tortillas which are good but few in number.

The value was decent I will be going back.
