Carnivore heaven.  Seriously.  Charlotte (and surroundings) has no shortage of Mexican places, especially to the East and South sides, but go a little further beyond the usual and out to Indian Trail if you're looking for your fix.  It's worth it.

I totally get if you want some mole at Casa de las Enchiladas, as I jones for it too.  But if you just want some tasty pork to drip flavor down the esophagus, look no further than this almost unmarked location in a strip mall.

Do not linger - signs on the wall warn you to have your entire party before being seated and not to have business meetings during lunch.  They pack them in and get them out again.

As others have mentioned, the chips are tasty and they are served with two salsa.  The chunky one is awesome.  The mild one is so-so.  If you go for the chunky, you might need something to tame the heat.  Consider yourself warned.

Everything else?  Nothing special.  Rice, beans, tortillas.  The real star here is the meat.  I don't know if they marinade it, kill it fresh or age it in a backroom somehow.  Frankly I don't even care if it's mixed with something I'd rather not see.  It is that good.  I only wish the rest of the food would match up to the meat.

Still, you can get average sides anywhere.  I don't think you can get meat this tender anyplace in the area.  Go.  Now.  And bring me some.
