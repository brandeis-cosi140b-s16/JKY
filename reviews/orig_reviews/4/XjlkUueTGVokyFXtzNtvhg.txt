Very small place and gets crowded during lunch rush hour, but my review isn't about that...

There were so many choices I didn't know what to get! I tried a little of everything so I ordered:

Bulgogi burrito
Bulgogi fries
Bulgogi Kim Chee taco. 

The burrito was tasty and bulgogi was tender. I love that it had Kim Chee (you have to ask for it) which gave it an extra tang. I wasn't too fond of the rice, as it was lacking in flavor and a bit mushy. 
The fries looked delicious at first, but was hard to eat as the cheese quickly cools making it hard to have a perfect bite. I thought it was just ok, and would easily skip on my next visit. 
The taco was pretty tasty, the only con is that there's too much liquid from the Kim Chee that it makes the tortilla soggy and breaks it. It was pretty messy. 

All in all, the items were good, but I'd just stick to the burrito. I'm eager to try more items off their menu since I enjoy the Korean Mexican fusion concept.
