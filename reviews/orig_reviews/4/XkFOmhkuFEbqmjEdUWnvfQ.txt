I don't like pink tacos, but I do like Pink Taco. Sure it's a little cheesy and the initial draw is the borderline inappropriate name of the restaurant, but you'll be surprised to find that the food and drinks here are legitimately good and strong. Big margaritas and delicious carnitas plus a comfortable dining atmosphere and nice servers. To top it all off, the prices don't make you want to head immediately to the casino afterwards to win it all back.

Sadly, yes, there is now more than one. However this location is better to go to than the LA one. Strangely, this one is less flashy and I think the food and service is better, no slashies (waiter/model/actor/singer) 'serving' you. Been here with both the bf and also with my fam - it's appropriate in both instances. Only downside is it's so far off the strip. I'd recommend going here after shopping at the mall/outlets or maybe before or after a day at Rehab.
