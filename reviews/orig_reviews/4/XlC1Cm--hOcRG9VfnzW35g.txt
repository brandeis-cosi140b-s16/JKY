I love yelp and want to be a fair reviewer. Went in late Sunday night craving some tacos and wasn't expecting much after the last 2 visits. This time however sat at the bar again and the bartender did a great job getting us a beer and taking our orders. Paid great attention to everyone and even noticed the guy sitting between myself and a couple came in drunk and annoying and let him know politely he was cut off. The food was ok but the bartender did a much better job than any of my recent visits. Kudos
