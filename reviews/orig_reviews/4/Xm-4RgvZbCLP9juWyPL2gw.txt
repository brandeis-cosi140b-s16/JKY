"Nooooooooooooooooooooo", (actor holds hands outward, palms to the sky), "Why Lord, why Bobbie's place?" (actor cries, arms tired and starting to shake, but still outstreached)...... "Why take the good ones???!!!"

I come into Vegas on business, and having lived in town years back, and visited relatives who lived there through the 70's and beyond, I don't really have any interest in the strip hotels, restaurants, or attractions. Bottom line, I "specialize" in finding food and lodging far away from the "action." (want a traditional Italian hidden gem? La Scala on Desert Inn Rd.)

First trip to Bobby's restaurant, it was three of us, two from corporate in Pittsburgh. We ordered, literally, 10 different entree items, then shared them with booths near us in the dining room. Had we gone to our usual "after the show" hotel restaurants, the bill would have been near $500 for three. (I don't drink much, but we do have those who love wine!) Here the total bill was around $200, including pitchers of their margaritas.

Just trust me on this one....... compared to ANY Mexican restaurant, in LV or L.A., Viva Mercados rates right up there, both for food and service. I take clients here, family, and refer this place to many clients coming for trade shows. It's comfortable, and what with all the plus's just mentioned, makes for a great value and great time! It's not priced like a little family hole in the wall, or a Rubio's, but very fair given the ambiance, service level and menu.

Geeze........ almost forgot until I saw someone elses review! The bean dip! That's how they start you off. Between the chips, salsa and bean dip, you cannot, possibly, in any way, leave this place hungry!
