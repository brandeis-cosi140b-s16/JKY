The green salsa was to die for! I could drink it. The tacos were good, but small. We had the braised brisket, pastor, crispy fish, and shrimp. The crispy fish was really good and fresh and probably my favorite. The horchata was the best I've ever had! Check this place out! Hopefully Mucho Macho Taco is here to stay.
