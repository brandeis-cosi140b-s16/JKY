So good, it's sinful! I've eaten here twice, and really looove the rustic-gothic atmosphere. The tacos are really good but a bit pricey. Each taco is about $5 and they're not that big:  they're traditional, Mexican-sized, not American-Biggie-Sized. With that said, either the Old World or New World tacos are tasty. The bar is almost full-service and has some interesting liquers. The margaritas are the best I've had outside of San Diego and quite potent, which is the way I like them. The chips taste homemade as do the salsas and hot sauces. Me gusta muchisimo!
