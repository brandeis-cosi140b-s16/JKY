I have been hearing about Chino Bandido for sooooo long. Everyone on earth raves about the place and I finally got to check it out this weekend.

its as fantastic as they all said. good food. fun, laid back atmosphere. the servers were incredibly helpful.

finally, I have somplace to take my friends when they visit that is local, good, and isn't a chain restaurant!
