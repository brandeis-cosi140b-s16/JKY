The thing that drew our group to this place was the happy hour: from 3-7pm they have a $3 special drink which changes every 30 minutes. Sounds like a great way to get drunk with friends for cheap, without having to think about what to get.

What surprised me about the place was the service and food. Our waitress was super friendly, and would remember that we had told her to get us a round whenever the new drink came up. The three of us ordered the basic nachos with cheese, guac and sour cream, and couldn't even finish it. We ended up scrapping dinner plans because we were all so full! Not only was the portion huge, but they tasted great (not much chance to screw up basic nachos, but still was good).

I would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.
