I'm not sure if I wanted to give 3 or 4 stars...hubby & I sat at the bar & started with a beer & a frozen swirled sangria (so good btw) they brought out chips & 3 different salsas.  We got there a little before 9pm when Happy Hour started so we waited to order the dip trio, they were great! $5 for 3 different dips is an awesome deal in my book, especially when they keep refilling chips for you.  Husband ordered a street taco & it took about 15-20 min for it to come out which was disappointing since the bar area wasn't very busy at all.  Service was a bit slow but we had a great time snacking on chips & cooling off with yummy drinks.
