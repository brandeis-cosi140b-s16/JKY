I stopped in for lunch today with Laura A. and had a good meal.  We got there right around 11am when they opened so there wasn't much of a crowd.  I wasn't hungry for the full entrees so I went with the tinga tacos which are one of my fav's.  They were pretty good and I couldn't finish all 4 of them with the fries so I would say for the price they were worth it.  I read many people say this place is over priced but if you look at the portions and quality of the meal I would say you are wrong.  If you want a cheap good meal then there are many places for that this is for a nice meal with lot's of flavor and variants over tradition.  As I was reading through the menu options I saw things that you can't get at most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix but some things you can and yes they may be cheaper at other places.  So just plan ahead eat something special here and enjoy it.  This is one place I will sure be back to for dinner and some more of that yummy homemade horchata.
