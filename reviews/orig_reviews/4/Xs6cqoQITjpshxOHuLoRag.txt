I went here after seeing this restaurant featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Drives.  I wasn't quite sure about the mixture of Mexican and Chinese food...but I was pleasantly surprised!  The menu is a little confusing, but the girl at the counter was helpful in explaining it.  There was plenty of food and it was tasty!.....One of my creations was the carnitas in a quesadilla.......Mmmmmmm.....try it out!!!!!
