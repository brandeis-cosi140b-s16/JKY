A tasty island in a sea of mediocrity.  The East Valley isn't known for dining excellence so a place like Tia Rosa's is cherished.

I usually dine at the Taqueria as it has my favorite tacos at a cheaper price then the restaurant.  The salmon taco and seafood enchiladas are superb and virtually unrivaled in all of Phoenix.

The restaurant is good although it is typically loud and could stand to lose a few dozen decorations.  The place is so laden with every kind of Mexican curio and keepsake that it crosses good taste and sets up shop in the land of kitsch.

Think of it as the Barrio Cafe for the suburbs.
