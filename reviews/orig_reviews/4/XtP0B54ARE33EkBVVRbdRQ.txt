Went here the other night. So good! The black cherry Sangria is a little on the sweeter side. 

We had appetizer sampler, I highly recommend it. You get to taste everything and it's perfect to share. 

The chips and salsa you get first are fresh, hot and made in house. Be careful, don't fill up on them! It's easy to do. I will go here again.
