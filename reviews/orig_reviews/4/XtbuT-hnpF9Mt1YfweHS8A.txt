If you have the time to plan a grocery shopping trip around making it to a Ranch Market here in the valley, I would advise doing so. And go without a list. You will not cooperate with your list once you've walked through the entry to the glorious Ranch Market. 

Do also go when you have the time to enjoy the market as it is always bustling and the check out lines can take a while. 

I almost always walk out of RM with some fresh pico, and other salsas depending on my mood, and some fresh chips to go with that. I then usually wander until I come up with some Mexican meal I want to make and go at it. 

Pricing is great as you can find prices similar to a Food City or Walmart. All fair and same good stuff. 

Only knock I have is the food they serve inside RM at the food bar, while deliicous smelling, and also well priced, has not always been high quality. So I skip the food bar, and drop my good grocery money on the fresh made items and other ingredients necessary for a yummy mexican meal.
