Pretty good food, lots of choices.  Great view if you're at the bar.  not a great place to gamble though ;)  It super loud so if you don't mind that it's fun.  Some of the seating is way too close together so try to get a booth, we were seated in what seemed like a cage the last time we were there and actually we all had to move tables and chairs just to get out! but the food is good :)
