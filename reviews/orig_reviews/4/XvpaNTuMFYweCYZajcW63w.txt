I am a big fan of Mi Patio ... the food is extremely reasonably priced and they always have specials on beers and margaritas.

What is most important for me is that they have a ton of vegetarian options. The beans are veggie friendly, so they have multiple choices from bean burros to taco salads to quesedillas to veggie burros... etc etc

The service is always really good to. The chips and salsa are provided immediately, and they food is always out pretty quick.

This place is certainly not upscale, but perfect if you want some good mexican food and a place to chill out.
