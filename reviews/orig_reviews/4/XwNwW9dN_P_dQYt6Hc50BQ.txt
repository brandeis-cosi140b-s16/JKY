Super solid tacos and such. Great Monday deal with $2 and $3 tacos and a happy hour from 3-6 with half price apps and drink specials. We started with really good chips and the 7-8 bottles of salsa that come with it for $1. Great chips and great variety of salsas. The Diego Pops margarita was small and weak for my taste (even for $4), Tacos, on the other hand, were really good. I had a fish taco, a pastor, and an adobo chicken taco. All great, and $7 for the 3 of 'em. I had a taste of my friend's plaintain taco, carne asada and shrimp, and they were all super, as well. We had churro fries (dulce de leche dipping sauce) for dessert. Meh. Tasty, but nothing special. Great service, and a nice cool patio. If you like Joyride and other "upscaled" taco joints, you'll like this. I'll be back.
