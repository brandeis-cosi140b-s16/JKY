Very nice place -- everything was tremendously fresh -- diced tomatoes almost look fake, the color was amazing!

Carne Asada Burrito was superb -- and the guacamole on the side was fantastic!

Sweet lady chatted me up about how fresh the food is, no preservatives, no frying of anything -- it is all food as it was meant to be.

Would have been five stars, but the serving size was a little small.  If I had ordered a side, I am sure it would have been enough.
