The desk clerk at the Courtyard Marriott recommended this place. I told her I wanted local and I got local. I nearly screamed with delight when I saw the menu. Red Chili Menuedo, Calabacitas, and Albondigas Soup. I cannot wait to get back to Phoenix to take eat more of the delicious morsels. I had the Albondigas Soup and I really enjoyed the extra surprise of carrots, zucchini, and squash.
