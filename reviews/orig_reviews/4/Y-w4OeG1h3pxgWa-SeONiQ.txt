this place is one of our favorites. the inside is fairly lame, but the patio is perfect. i always get the carne seca (or is it seca? i always get them confused) plate and i'm never disappointed. spicy enough it makes my nose run and loads of flavor. the service has always been on-it; i've never been left hanging with a burning mouth and no cold beer. i've never tried the "american" fare on the menu, their new mexican food is just too good.
