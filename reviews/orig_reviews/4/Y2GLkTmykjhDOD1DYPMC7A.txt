A co-worker and I went her for lunch and both loved our dishes.  We both got two tacos.  He got a pork and a shrimp, and I got the octopus and a short rib.  I couldn't believe how tender the octopus was and the beef melted in my mouth.  The side dishes are even tastier than your typical rice and beans.  We will definitely be back, maybe happy hour next time!
