I give 4 stars for the restaurant.  5 for the amazing staff and waitservice, however a 2-3 for food.  I live in California where you can get a bomb super burrito for $5.95 so I may be a tad extra picky when it comes to a yummy authentic plate.  

What you must order:  margaritas, guacamole and soup!  Random I know, but absolutely worth the trip to Diego's.  The margaritas are made with fresh muddled fruit, the guac is made on a rolly-cart fresh and made just the way you like it, and the soup is sooo amazing!  I know you are wondering "Who orders soup in Vegas?" but just trust me on this one.  Mmmmm....  :)

The atmosphere is really nice, the look, the feel, everything is fancy and a great dinner spot.  Just remember...soup, margs and guac!!  You can't go wrong!
