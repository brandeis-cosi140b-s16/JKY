Food was delicious and the portions are considerable.  I enjoyed the daily special of stacked green enchiladas with shredded beef.  The beans served were whole and well seasoned.  The rice was tasty and had the texture of uncle ben's rice.  It was still good though.  The guac was fresh and delicious.  The salsa not so spicy, but good.
