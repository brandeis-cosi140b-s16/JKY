Gallo Blanco has made so many best-of lists we weren't sure it could live up to the hype. But the food did.

We came on a Thursday night around 7pm and waited in the bar for a table. Get the Paloma--it's like a marg but with grapefruit juice. Not too tart, it was perfectly mixed.

We had a couple of tortas--they were amazing. If you're super hungry, get a couple of sides, too. The chorizo had a nice bite (as did the salsas they brought). My pork was tender and flavorful, though I think we all wished we had gotten the open-face Naco (I think) torta. Hubby got the burrito and said it was ok. We finished with tres leches which was just ok; I wouldn't get it again.

The service was hipster-laid back (so don't expect it to be attentive, ok?).

Our only other comment, and the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5, was the damn noise level. Seriously, it's loud in there. 

But yah, we'd definitely go back. The food was really yummy and reasonably priced!
