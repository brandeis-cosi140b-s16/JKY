Husband and I were walking around and saw where they served breakfast 2 eggs, toast, meat, potatoes and unlimited mimosa's for $5.99 and we had to do it, it was only around 9am but why not we were in Vegas I mean. The food was very good and everything was done just right. The mimosa's were served in a beer glass so these were quite big and I had 4 of them, my husband had 3. We had to take a nap afterwards but it was worth it:)
