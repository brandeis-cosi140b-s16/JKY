I love this place! It's always consistent and the service this most recent time on my birthday was no exception! My server was Jazz,, I think short for Jasmine,, she was very professional and attentive, and also drop dead gorgeous. Made my day ! The bald bartender guy who has been there awhile even seemed somewhat chipper which I've never seen. Thanks Diablos!
