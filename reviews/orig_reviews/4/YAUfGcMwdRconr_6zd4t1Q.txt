I ended up in this restaurant by accident. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their nachos were not enough for 2 people, they had to refill our basket twice since we were munching on them like they were the last snack on earth. As soon as we walked into this place I felt I was eating at an upscale museum, the d√©cor is simply beautiful and refreshing and I even told my friend I feel I am not in Arizona, feels like we are somewhere in Mexico. I ordered their lemon salmon with veggies and rice, again food is very flavorful but to me the rice was too small not enough, the salmon was a good portion but rice and veggies to me didn't fill the plate cause I wanted more. I would definitely come back with friends and try something new on the menu or maybe order the same salmon again since I wanted more, it was very tasty with the lemon butter on top. The waitress was sweet and helpful, our order didn't take too longer to come to our table. I was a  happy customer.
