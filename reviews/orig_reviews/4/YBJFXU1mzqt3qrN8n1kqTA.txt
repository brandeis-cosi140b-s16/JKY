Great atmosphere! Their mango tango margarita was delicious! Staff was nice. Food was great. I didn't make it on time for their happy hour when I was in town this time. Prices for drink wasn't bad without happy hour. I did get to peak at thier happy hour menu and I would deffinetly recommend. The prices looked great. This is a place I would make it a point to visit when I am back in town again.
