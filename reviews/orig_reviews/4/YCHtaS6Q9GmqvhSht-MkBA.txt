Food is always good.  They have the best chips & salsa/hot sauce in town.  Pretty standard but tasty fare.  

The tacos are great as is the steak picado.  Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  It's all good.
   
The place is pretty basic (original location is more interesting inside)  and the service is quite respectable.  I have been coming to both locations for many years and will continue to!
