While in town for Spring training, we stopped here for dinner and thought the food was wonderful.  As everyone else mentions the chips are a unique mixture of flour/corn tortillas with a little extra seasoning on some.  We also asked for a little spicier than normal salsa (not the inferno one!), and it was perfect with the chips and the dinner.

My husband and I both got the Rockin Shrimp Enchiladas and they were the highlight of the meal!  They were really good and with the extra spicy salsa, they became excellent!

The drinks were so-so.  I had the special tangerine margarita - which was okay, but then I got the Prickly Pear margarita and it was super sweet...too sweet for my liking.

This place does seem to get busy - even on a Sunday night.  Unfortunately, it was too cool out to sit outside, but the patio looked nice.

We topped the meal off with their chocolate chip cookie and ice cream in a cast iron skillet.  This, too, was great!

If we're in the area again, we would definitely stop for for the food.
