Ok first things out of the way. Yes it is not cheap -- it's in a casino and very few restaurants in a casino are cheap. Next, the margaritas are just average. Save your money for one of the $7 beers that should be $3.50. Now the food: the carnitas was verrry tender inside and nice and crispy outside -- some of the best I've ever had. The cheese enchilada was very good as well - the only way to mess up a cheese enchilada is to use plastic cheese which they did not. Freshly made chips were a nice touch. The salsa was just so-so and the guacamole is no where near as good as what they make at Viva Mercado right at your table. Overall a good experience - I would recommend it.
