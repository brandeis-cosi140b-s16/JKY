Hearing the name Dos Gringos just makes me want to day drink. I love coming here. First of all, I love patios and they have a huge one downstairs and also one upstairs (I rarely go up there though). I have probably only sat INSIDE a handful of times here. They have lots of good specials, they have giant Jenga, a couple different bars, a really good Thursday night special, etc. It's jus a fun place. We used to come here on Thursdays and get the wristband and get 50 cent Coronas or whatever the deal was and it would get PACKED and be a blast. The food is your basic bar food, pretty good if you're just grabbing some nachos for the table or grabbing a couple of tacos. It's fun at night but it's better (in my opinion) for some good old day drinking. Service has always been good and the servers have been friendly.
