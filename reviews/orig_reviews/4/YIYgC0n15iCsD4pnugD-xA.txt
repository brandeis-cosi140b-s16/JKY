Quick Sand or Sand Trap?
By The Rue

Sandbar, Sandbar I know your trick,
It isn't the food that gets me to stick,
It wasn't the fajita burrito with chicken inside,
It is the yummy workers I must confide.

I'm not sure my waitresses name,
I'll have to come back when I have more game,
Of course I'm not telling the truth,
I was raised right and have more couth.

Going off topic, back to the review,
The selection is decent on their menu,
I wasn't a big fan of the rice and beans,
Both were lacking in this cuisine.

The icead tea was good and filled up often,
I was never a big fan of Kenny Loggins,
This is the first time that I've been here,
Didn't even have time to order a beer.

I certainly want to come here for happy hour,
I'll probably have a beer not a whiskey and sour,
The patio seems like a fun place to chill,
Next time write your number on my bill. 

Bump, Set, SPIKE!!!
