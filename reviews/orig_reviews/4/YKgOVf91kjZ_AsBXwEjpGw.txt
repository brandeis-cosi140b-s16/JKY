So I've been back a bunch of times.  But I just have to add, their volcano cookies served only on weekends (or maybe every other weekend) are awesome, even better than the snickerdoodles.  Picture a brownie-like cookie, soft and gooey on the inside, covered with powdered sugar.  Awesome.

Still love their machacha beef, emerald chicken, and veggie quesadilla.  The chile relleno wasn't nearly as good as I remembered it being, I will not order that in the future.
