Totally impressed with the Taco Guild! Last night was our first visit and the interior is very inviting. Lot's to look at and an intimate but very open feel. There were candelabra's on a couple high tops in the center that were a little too bright but not a deal breaker.

Adam was our server and he knows his stuff. We asked for his suggestions for margarita's and taco's and he was spot on. I am not a fan of frozen margaritas but their house - $5 happy hour margi was awesome. We tried the veggie, duck and lamb taco's with a side of guacamole and their vegan beans. Everything was perfect, seasoning and flavors were bold and unique and the speed & timing of service & delivery was the best. We will be back and will bring our friends!
