The burgers were delicious!!! Meaty and cheesy, and great flavor. I unfortunately, didn't care for the chencho fries, the sauce had a very strong lime flavor, which I personally thought was a little odd. I will definitely be back for a juicy burger, but will order regular fries next time. My husbands fried mushrooms were pretty tasty. FYI, there is limited seating in here, you may want to get it to go.
