I went with a group of 6 to Border Grill for Cinco de Mayo.  They have the best Margaritas in all of Las Vegas.  All they use is Tequila, lime, and Agave.  So many places use sweet and sour mix and I think it is just awful.  I ordered a portabella dish and it was excellent.  I did ask for it without dairy and they messed it up twice, but corrected the issue with no problems.  I used a 15% off card they gave me and a restaurant.com gift certificate, so it was a great deal.  The Chef, Mary Sue was in the kitchen and came out to say hello to us as we are Top Chef fans.  We were also lucky enough to hear the Black Keys play live.  They were playing a private event at the Mandalay pool and since we were sitting on the patio outside we could hear it!  I like the patio because it is one of the only places on the strip where you can sit outside and not be on the street.  Great service, drinks and food.  I will go back soon.
