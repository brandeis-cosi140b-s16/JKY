I've been here a couple of times. 
i wish i could come here more often. 

It's very good homemade mexican food, but it's not too mexican which i like. 

i love this place because it's like a hole in the wall from the outside. but when you go in, it's very cute. 

i think this would be a cute place to go out on a date. 
very quiet and small. and most importantly it's clean. 
[which is not true for most mexican restaurants]

i've had the salmon salad every time. i know it's really not mexican food, but it's SO yummmy. 

this is owned and run by a local family. 
i've heard that the parents own the one on sahara, and the son owns this location. and i'm all about support local businesses. 

try this place at least once!
