Seriously unfair how good the tortillas are from Carolinas. Shit gets REAL at lunch time, prepare for long lines, crazy parking, and making new friends at the random seat you may find. 

We used to order ahead and pick up during my office days in the Valley. Machaca is solid, bean and cheese burro is up to par, and god help me I would hurt someone for the green chile right now. 

Weird location, but don't be afraid white people. It's soo delicious.
