I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican fusion food back in California, but I wanted to try this out after hearing about it from friends. Overall, the menu has decent variety of Ko-Mex selections, ranging from burritos, tacos, fries, rice, etc.

We ordered:

1. Fusion Burrito ($7.50): You can choose from beef/chicken/pork as your meat. The burrito comes with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. Overall, the burrito was delicious and the flavors were great. This is great for sharing between 2 people. (5/5)

2. Fusion Flautas ($8.00): They come in 3 pieces. You can choose between beef/chicken/pork bulgogi, but we opted for one of each just to get variety. The flautas are rolled in flour tortillas and deep-fried with guacamole and cheese. YUM! The chicken was our favorite as it was tender and juicy. We thought the pork was a bit too spicy for our taste, and the beef was all right. (4/5)

KoMex is off the strip and more of a hole in the wall place. Locals love it and I am a fan! The service is pretty friendly too.
