We were able to treat ourselves to Chuy's during a "soft opening" night for the media due to my friend, Nikki, knowing everyone in town so Yay for us.  The place was packed!  They had drinks on special and I treated myself to a virgin lime frozen margarita.  NOOOO GOOOO on the virgin margarita.  It was super sour.  The food, though, was quite delicious and made up for the drink.  I had the Chuychanga with queso and YUM.  My friend had the Bang-bang sauce over chicken enchiladas and they were to-die-for.  Honestly, very good Tex Mex and for someone who has lived in Ft. Worth, TX for four years, it was nice to remind me of my years there.  Try it!
