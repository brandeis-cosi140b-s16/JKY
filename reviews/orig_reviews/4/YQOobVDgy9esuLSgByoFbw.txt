Carolina's is a hole in the wall in all the best ways. Food is delicious and inexpensive. Service is friendly and relatively fast. FYI the red sauce packs heat so if you don't like spicy, order without this sauce. I happen to enjoy a little flavor kick so it was a pleasant surprise. 
The restaurant is set up with a counter to order and pick up with a separate room with tables and chairs to eat. Carry out is offered but no delivery.  When your food is ready they call your order number over a microphone for you to pick up. 
Park on the side away from the main road as it may be difficult to get back out. Parking on the main street is only supposed to be for compact cars but I saw several large pick up trucks. 
Overall a good experience.
