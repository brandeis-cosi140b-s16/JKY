To say I don't like Mexican food might be a massive understatement, but this place is very good!  Plus, the guy playing video poker at the bar next to where my friends and I were having drinks scored a royal flush...Yes, playing video poker...a royal flipping flush.   Faster than a walnut rolling off a hen house, we begin jamming cash into those machines.   Unfortunately lady luck was only with him that night...
