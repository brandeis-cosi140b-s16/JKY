In all fairness, I've only ever had the Cod Tacos but they were so good I came back 3 days in a row for more!  

The fish was crispy and perfectly sized to fill (not spill) the taco.  I'm pretty picky about tortillas but these had a nice texture (not the dry rubbery ones that come from that fish taco chain) and the cabbage / sauce was fresh and tasty.  I couldn't stop thinking about these tacos and had to go again... and again.  

The price was right, about 7 bucks for the two tacos and 2 sides - rice (which I liked and typically don't) and the beans (which I really liked).  

For me, the portion was perfect for lunch, just enough that I could barely poke it all into my smallish appetite but not so much that I had more than a bite or two left.

I called in my order all 3 times and it was ready in like 8 minutes, fresh and packaged really conveniently for a quick lunch in the car (parked, of course).

The d√©cor is really modern, sleek and inviting - the patio looks amazing and I'd love to try sometime when I have more time.

Parking was ample in back, there is a large parking lot and that's where you enter.
