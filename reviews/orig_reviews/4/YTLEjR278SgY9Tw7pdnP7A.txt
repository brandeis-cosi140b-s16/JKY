The hubby and I had a late dinner here a while back but I forgot to add my review. I love the different taco options. I had the cochinita and the shrimp tacos. Both were perfect. The margaritas were nice and strong. My hubby had the huevos rancheros and really enjoyed it. I'm getting hungry just thinking of this meal!
