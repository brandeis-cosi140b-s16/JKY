So the salsa has way to much black pepper.. the service isn't always friendly.. but the list of tequila's is TDF! I generally frequent this place for a cheap yummy lunch, green chile Navajo taco, and is super close to work.. nothing like tying one on at lunch time to make the rest of the afternoon smooth by.. just kidding, I never do that!
