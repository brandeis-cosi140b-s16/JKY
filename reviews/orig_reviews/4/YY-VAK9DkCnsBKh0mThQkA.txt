We had an Open Table reservation at Mary and Sue's place for 7PM with a request for a table with a view of the outside patio.  Our view was better than anticipated as we were seated on the patio, but the night was comfortably warm so we registered no complaint.    The complimentary taco chips and two salsas were a cut above your typical cantina.  A special menu was offered in celebration of Mexican Independence Day so I chose (by pointing) the manchamanteles - even the waitress admitted being unable to pronounce it.  As it turned out the kitchen was out of this stew-type dish, so both Ms. Westie and I settled for chili rellenos - roasted poblano peppers stuffed with manchego, panela, and cotija cheeses served with both roja and tomatillo salsas, two types of rice, and black beans. The poblano peppers were super sized and the amount of cheese used in the filling was over-the-top, but tasty nonetheless.   I used a $20 coupon from one of the freebie magazines to ease the financial burden, but we were $8 short of the required $50 tab, not a problem as we shared a large slice of tres leches.
