You walk in to something like a barn or a backyard that you wish could be yours.  It was nice.  The host very polite and told us our servers name.

16 minutes later that server came over.  She got our order and hurried away.  Our appetizer came very fast.  So fast I had not even got my drink I ordered.  The bar was not busy so I am not sure what they were doing besides dilly dallying.  Half way through my app I got my drink..it's was a Cadillac Margarita...yummy.  Our food came and was wonderful.

I am really thinking it was just my waitress that sucked...otherwise this place is awesome....but doesnt give them an excuse to hire any bimbo.
