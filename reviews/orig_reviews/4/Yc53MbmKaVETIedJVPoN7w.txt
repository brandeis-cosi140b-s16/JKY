Saw this place on a couple of Food Network shows and it sounded good so we headed on down to try it out.  Mexican/Chinese combo plates....Im listening!

We walked in and were greeted by a nice lady who asked if we had ever been here before.  We told her no and she had a guy take us over to the "sample station".  They give you about 5 different samples of stuff and then show you how to fill out the little card to place your order.

I decided to go with a combo of a jerk chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  My wife went with a plain bean and cheese burrito, and a veggie quesadilla.  You place your order and then grab your drink and sit down and wait for them to bring your food out to your table.  

About 15 minutes later our food came out.  It was awesome!  The jerk chicken quesadilla was bomb!  Its pretty spicy and had a great overall flavor.  The jade red chicken is their specialty and it lived up to the hype.  A couple pieces could have been a bit more moist, but it was really good overall.  Excellent fried rice too.  My wife said her burrito was good, kind of average, just pinto beans and cheese wrapped up.  I took a couple bites of her veggie quesadilla and it was alright.  It had what looked like some nacho cheese in it, where as my jerk chicken quesadilla had shredded cheeses in it.  Good none the less.  The grand finale was a free cookie they bring out.  It was a snickerdoodle type cookie and it had lots of sugar on it and was still a bit warm from the oven.  A perfect end to an awesome meal.

Total damage for everything was $19.00 and change.  The staff was super nice and helpful and if I lived here, I would have this in my regular rotation of places to eat.
