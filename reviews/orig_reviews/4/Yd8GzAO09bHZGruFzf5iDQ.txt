I've been here a few times with some friends but I finally remembered that I haven't written a review yet after visiting late last night. That's the cool thing about C.T., they serve food very late, till close at 2am! Last time I ordered the carne adovada burrito, and it was pretty good. I lived in northern New Mexico for 8 years so I know good carne adovada when I taste it. Still not as good as Blue Adobe on Country Club Dr. in Mesa though, that's where it's tops. C.T. takes second place, sorry! Still delicious though!
  Last night I came with a few GF's for a late meal after a movie shoot. The machaca nachos were piled high and delicious with the red and green salsa sides (containers with a spoon), and the gals ordered the habanero sliders. I thought they were crazy and reminded them how hot habanero was. "I can handle hot," she said. Well she admitted less than one slider in that it kicked her ass. I had half a slider from the other gal (she couldn't handle it) and took the other one home. You get 3 sliders and fries. The fries were PERFECTLY done and delicious.

Update Sept. 2012:
Came here for some happy hour apps n drinks with a few friends.
Patio was shady and nice but we were getting attacked by mosquitoes.
Crab cakes were small, only 2, and came with a salad on a tortilla.
The potstickers were scrumptious!
Sopapillas were delicious but only a few were pillowy, most were flat.
The big nachos were good again.
The "skinny margarita" tastes weird. Get the Cabo Wabo one.
The Malbec wine was good.
