This fun spot has seating right next to the canal so you can see the live  serenades taking place in the gondolas, it's kind of amazing people watching. 
We only stopped in for a snack of chips, salsa and guacamole (which was amazing, I had to restrain from licking the bowl). The service was great, I'd go back just for the people watching!
