Delicioso! Oh and the Margaritas are delicious...I should know, it's my middle name!  But really, the food here is quite authentic.  The chips and salsa are very sabrosos!  The serving size is substantial and enough to take home leftovers.  I prefer their green chile (again, I'm from New Mexico and very picky about my Mexican food!).
I had a combination plate with enchiladas and tacos (if a place can't pull these two simple dishes off...this chica from NM is gonna go elsewhere) and they were both delicious.

Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food.  

I can't wait to go back and try the albondigas soup which I've heard so much about.  I hear they also have a pretty good happy hour. 

Buen provecho!
