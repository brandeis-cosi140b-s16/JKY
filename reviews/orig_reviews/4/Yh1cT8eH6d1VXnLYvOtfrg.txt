This place has a Chipotle type ordering system but the flavors and unique style of making the dish is absolutely great. I tried the two enchilada plus a lada for 2$ more. So I tried the chicken, pork and bison.. All very moist and flavorful. Topped them with cotija cheese sour cream and guacomole..I thought the prices are adequate. I highly recommend this place.
