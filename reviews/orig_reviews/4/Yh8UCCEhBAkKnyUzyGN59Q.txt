My friend and I went here when I came to visit him in Phoenix and it's one of his fave mexican joints to eat at. They have a really cool bar area and two huge big screen tv's featuring the latest sports event (phoenix suns game when i was there). The drinks are pretty good, we had some beer and girly drinks (strawberry margarita and mojitos) which tasted not so bad and the fresh chips and salsa were kept us from going hungry while we waited for our actual food (the service is really slow). I had some chicken taquitos and shrimp tacos were which came with rice and lettuce. I thought the food was pretty good, but I don't know how authentic it is. I'd still go here again as long as I had some friends with me
