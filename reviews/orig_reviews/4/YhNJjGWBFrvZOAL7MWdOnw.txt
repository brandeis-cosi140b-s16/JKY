I am SO glad Mad Mex opened up a Shadyside location after having to practically sit on top of undergrads at the tiny Oakland location. It's beautiful in the inside, rich colours, and a garage door opening for summer nights. While it was pretty loud the time my boyfriend and I went to have late night margaritas with friends, we had good service, and my drinks came out quickly. Go after 10 pm for the $7 big azz margaritas. I love the raspberry and mango ones if I'm feeling wild :).
