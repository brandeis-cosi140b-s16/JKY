Caution: this place is dark, very very dark, watch out your steps!

Another check off on my foodie list, pleasantly surprised with everything here!

Shrimp Anticuchos. -  Great start! A lot of bold flavors on a 3-shrimp skewer, do not skip it!
Chorizo Porchetta - A very rich dish for my taste, as it was recommended by our waiter. A big piece of pork shoulder had probably 35% of fat on a bed of chorizo, I got full after finishing barely half of it. If you have a big appetite, give it a shot
Malbec Braised Short rib - the guys finished this without any left, i guess this is enough said.
Espresso churro with milk shake - This is such a cute dessert, perfect to share for 3 people. Milk shake was good, though I didn't think the churro was flavorful enough as it called 'espresso churro', and they were quite oily. 

Overall our experience was great, every single dish was prepared well with very nice presentation, I call them photogenic kind of dish. Service was great, high noisy level and dark, very dark....
