Excellent. I took a friend of mine to Yo Rita for her 21st birthday, and all I can say is, "excellent." Nice ambience, great bar, sweet salsa, and SUPERB tacos.

I had the duck confit taco and she had the salmon/apple/mushroom. As for drinks--everything was pretty standard for a well-made mixed drink, but I have to recommend the Moscow Mule. It goes down easy and has just enough spice to be paired perfectly with the duck confit taco that I scarfed down.

The dessert was even better than the meal (some sort of cheesecake with a chocolate cherry sauce), and when added to the great service and the friendly bartender, Yo Rita easily becomes one of those places in Pittsburgh that one just has to try out.

I'm not frequently in the mood for soft tacos, but I definitely know the place to go from now on when I am.
