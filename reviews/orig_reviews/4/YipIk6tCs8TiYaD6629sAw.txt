Excellent experience! We took a 5 or 6 mile detour off the highway after researching good places from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives between Atlanta and Washington, DC (long car trip!) to stop at Cabo. It was one of the best meals of the trip!

I really like that you can mix and match tacos on your plate - you aren't committed to two of the same tacos, you can swap from one of the specials or any of the others featured on the menu. I got the BBQ Mahi, the sheepshead (fish) special, and the cactus side salad. The BBQ Mahi was DELICIOUS - I can't say enough good things! The sheepshead (which I've never had before - mild flavor) would be good any other day of the week, but it was hard to compare after the BBQ Mahi. My boyfriend got the avocado pasta salad, and I'd recommend that over the cactus salad (the salad wasn't bad, just a lot of beans to it - fresh flavor though).

If you're in the area or passing through on the highway, I would definitely recommend this stop. It's worth it!
