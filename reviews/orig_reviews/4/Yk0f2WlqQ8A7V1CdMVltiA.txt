First, if you want "mexican food" then you need to go to Mexico and get it.  Same with any other ethnic type food.  If you want the real deal go to that country.  Otherwise what you're going to get (in most cases) is an Americanized version of whatever it was you were trying to eat.

Moreover, as you travel east from Cali on I-10 towards Texas, you will come across at least 4 different styles of American Mexican food.  What you like and what you call mexican food probably has a lot to do with were you had it first and where you had it good first.

This brings to Elmers.  Small shop, family owned.  Relatively simple menu.  Pretty low prices.  Lots of homemade stuff...beans,chips, salsa, etc.

Quite frankly, from a quality standpoint this is as good mexican food as you can get anywhere in the greater Phx area.

Going to a chain (Macayos,Garcias, etc) store will not get you better food.  It will get you high prices. It will get you a larger place.  It will probably get you a larger menu selection.  But in the end the food will be substandard in taste an quality to Elmers

Bad thing about Elmers is that it's across the street from the Chandler High.  an as such the volume of people there can be pretty great.

But in the end get a bean and cheese and a red chili burrito and you'll be in business.
