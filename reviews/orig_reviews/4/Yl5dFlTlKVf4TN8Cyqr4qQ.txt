I think this place lived up to the hype.  I've been wanting to come here for months!

Awesome tacos!  I had one with crispy eggplant and one summer squash.  As soon as my plate arrived, i tasted one of the pieces of eggplant and knew right away that I would love these tacos.  

I will definitely be coming back soon.
