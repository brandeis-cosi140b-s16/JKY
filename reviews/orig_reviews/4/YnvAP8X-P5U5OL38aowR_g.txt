Yeah for the new Secreto!!  Visited Secreto before the new owners updated the space to a Cantina style restaurant.  We like the more casual vibe...and the green & red chile menu.  A good happy hour M-F until 7, with drink specials (loved my margarita tonight) and $5 appetizers.  The Stack is yummy with chorizo, chicken, beans, and an egg all smothered in green chile.  Tonight we tried the Green Chile Mac & Cheese...we are hooked! Even ordered a 2nd order to take home & have with our leftover Pork Rellano, which was the perfect amount of spicey.  The beans could use a tad more seasoning, but other than that everything was perfect.  Loved the salsa and chips...fresh and yummy.  Kristina, the new owner, came over to our table to check on our experience.  She was friendly & I really appreciated her checking in.  Sounds like they have music Fri, Sat, and Tuesday nights...  We'll be back -- think we'll try Taco Tuesday ($2 taco and Dos XX!  Nice to have this place close by...great atmosphere and food!
