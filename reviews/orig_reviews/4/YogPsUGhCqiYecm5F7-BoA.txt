Honestly, if you like Mexican/Latin American food, eat here. The food is great!! I didn't care too much for the salsas because most were too spicy for me or just not to my liking...but I'll give them a pass-who needs salsa when the food is that good! The restaurant is small, and can be uncomfortable when full. But the place does have character, and our server was more than wonderful.
