The BEST $2 Carne Asada taco in Vegas!!! Also had the Carne Asada tostada - very authentic with guacamole, grilled green onions, radish, and lime garnish...... REALLY TASTY! Don't expect rice, beans (they don't sell any!) and other extras - they have lingua, al pastor or pork (the wife liked that).  Green and red salsa - the green was surprisingly spicy - I really liked it. The staff was helpful and kept bringing us extra tortillas, napkins, and salsa. The service was 5 stars and we left a monster tip!!! Easily exceeded my expectations after reading about 5 reviews - it IS THE REAL DEAL!!! Walkable from The Riviera and better than anything in their food court!
