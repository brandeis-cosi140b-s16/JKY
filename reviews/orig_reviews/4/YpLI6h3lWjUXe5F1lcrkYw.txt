I am a huge fan of all Upward Project restaurants. 

Joyride is a new addition to my list. 

I ordered in. The person over the phone was super nice and helpful, which made my ordering experience that much easier. 

Picking up was a great experience as well. Fast, with great customer service. Food was nicely packed so when we got home, everything was kept fresh and temperature of food was excellent. 

Food was delicious. I do not know what I was fan of more, enchiladas or tacos ;)

They have advised us that now they have a happy hour every Tuesday. We attempted twice already; however, the wait was petty long. We will keep trying as I would like to experience of dining in the restaurant. 

It has perfect location. Parking is well situated. 

I highly recommend it!
