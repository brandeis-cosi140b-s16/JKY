Quick getting seated. Friendly staff. The food came out so fast and it was delicious. I got the pollo fondito, which is supposedly "everyone's favorite" but I have to be honest, it was good but not the best. My fianc√© got the el crudo and it was great! I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes, though!
