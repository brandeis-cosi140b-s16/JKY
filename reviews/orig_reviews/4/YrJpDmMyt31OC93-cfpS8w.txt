Went here with a friend who raved about the place. When you walk in, the staff greets you in unison, VERY friendly crowd. This place does burgers and tacos so I got one of each. Order came out quickly. First thing I tried were my buddy's fries, and I give them an A+, lightly peppered and slightly salted without a ton of grease, cut from potatoes with skin on. My burger and taco came out, and I went burger first. They're thinner double patties, thick butter pickle slices, tomato slice, American cheese, lots of very green lettuce, onion, and some kind of sauce. It blended together nicely, but the bun was very plain (easiest area that would take the burger to the next level). Beef tastes good, but it's not grass fed, could taste fresher...I give it an A-, but must admit it hit the spot. The taco was average,I got chicken. I give it a B-. Overall, really good burger, great fries, average taco. Half liter bottled coke is always nice touch. I hear they have good milkshakes, but I don't have room to try one. Give it a shot.
