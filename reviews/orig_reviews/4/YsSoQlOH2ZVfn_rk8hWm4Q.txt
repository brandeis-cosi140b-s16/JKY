A friend and I went here on a Friday night to take a break from gambling at the Flamingo because of the $20 all you can drink until 4 am wristband deal.  You just can't beat that!  It included three flavors of frozen margaritas: regular, strawberry and mango.  I asked the awesome bartender Cory to pour some extra tequila in there for me each time.  I tipped $1 or $2 each time he filled my solo cup and he gave us a fun show throwing bottles around, juggling them and being super nice.  We stayed from 10:30 pm to 1:30 am and it got really hopping around midnight for some interesting people watching. The DJ played really great tunes which got better closer to midnight when it was full on the dance floor.  I cannot speak to the quality of the food, but it's a fun place to go to dance and have some cheap drinks. I didn't want to do shots, but that was an option.  The $20 special did not include beer or any top shelf drinks, but hey, it was well worth what I drank that night.
