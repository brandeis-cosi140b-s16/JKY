Had lunch here today and it was great. Decor is fun, love the clear plastic covers on the floral booths!  Lots of TV's around the bar which can be seen from just about everywhere in the club.

We had chips and salsa to start.  We all agreed that the red (hot) salsa was the best, although they were all good.  For lunch we had Sonoran Dogs.  Very big and tasty!  Service was good too!  Looking forward to our next visit to try the tacos...
