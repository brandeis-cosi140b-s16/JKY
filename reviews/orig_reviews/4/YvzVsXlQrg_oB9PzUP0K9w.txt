So much to like here.  I know it's a favorite of locals, and college students.  They've got great retried beans. Good enchiladas, although a tad small, they- gasp! - used the right cheese! Woah. But the shredded beef Taco? I wound up doubling down on that bad boy, ordering another. Yes, I pigged out, and I was a very happy pig!

Tips- I'm more of a Calfornia (Sonora style) Mexican food guy- for the purist, this is more of a Jalisco style food found in, say, Mexico City and Guadalajara.  I forgot this, and got green sauce on my enchiladas. That was ok, but I was looking forward to the red sauce.  I assure you that I'll be back to try those too. All's ya gotta do is ask. 

One shout out to the big guy that waited on me. His Spanish is great, but his service is spectacular. It's been months if not years since I've been waited on this well.  What an upbeat guy.  He makes it worth going. Tip well!
