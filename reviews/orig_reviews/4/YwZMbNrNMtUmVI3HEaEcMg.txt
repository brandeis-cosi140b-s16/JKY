I've already been to this place twice, and I enjoy the atmosphere. I was seated very quickly. Service was good; though I did not know the chips and salsa and fries were addon items.

I ordered the Pollo Asado, and was fairly large portion. Cooked to perfection, nothing tasted dry at all. Also the aioli salsa was great.
