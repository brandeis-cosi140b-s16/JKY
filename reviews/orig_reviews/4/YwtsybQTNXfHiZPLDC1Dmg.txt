This place is just fun. 
I love that it's in Chandler too.
I didn't experience the actual "sand" as we sat in the back but this place was great. We tried all the margaritas and I was really happy because they don't skimp on the amount of drink and just cover it up with a bunch of ice. We also had some dip when the munchies started kicking in and it was delicious (but I was slightly drunk so I may have eaten anything and loved it). The waiters and waitresses are a little odd, but super nice and seemed genuine. 
This is definitely going to be one of my new hangouts.
