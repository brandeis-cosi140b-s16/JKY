This is the perfect lunch spot -great service, delicious food and (virgin) drinks, and food comes quick!

This place is walking distance from my apartment and I've been hearing how tasty it  is for a while. My boyfriend and I finally decided to go last week. We were served tortilla chips and fresh salsa when we arrived and I ordered a watermelon agua fresca. It came out quickly and was so delicious. It's a perfect refreshing drink for a hot summer day.

I ordered the nortena de pollo and it was awesome! The bread is warm, light, soft with a light crunch. The chicken, cheese, and toppings were great! I loved it!

My boyfriend ordered the del principe with steak. It has basically the same ingredients as the nortena de pollo but with a thick slice of cold Mexican cheese. He wasn't a huge fan of the cold cheese on the warm torta, but I thought it was tasty. For newbies to authentic Mexican food, just realize the Mexican cheese will be a cold thick slice and the melted cheese is obviously warm and melted. 

We definitely plan on coming back and trying more tortas. Check this place out
