my bf and i are afficianados of las vegas but NOT pretentious clubs and bars.  enter diablo's cantina...

we visit diablo's a few times each time we're in vegas.  the location is perfect for people-watching, they have really good food and the drinks...mmmmmm....

we like to snag a table at right on the railing as soon as we get into town.  get some chips and the three kinds of salsa that accompany them, a few margaritas, and let the laughs begin!

the place gets pretty busy at night so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  they have a great selection of tequilas so if that's a favorite you're in luck.

the service is top-notch and diablo's has excellent music!

and as i said in the beginning, there is nothing pretentious about diablo's...you feel like you fit right in.
