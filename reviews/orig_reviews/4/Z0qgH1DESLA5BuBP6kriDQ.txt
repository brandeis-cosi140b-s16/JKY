Sometime it's not about the food...when you're all about hanging out with a couple of good friends and enjoying the balmy Phoenix evening...then this is where Frank & Lupe shines

We had enchilada, chicken in mole sauce, fish tacos and beef flautas...nothing really stood out as being particularly good or bad...and the wait staff was somewhat lackadaisical in their attention to service...but washing it all down with pitchers of ice cold margarita was a more than pleasant way to end our Monday

So just 2.5 stars for the food, but we'd be back for more good times on the outdoor back patio.
