Yeah,  wow,  Poncho's this Mexican food is amazing.
I just knew I hit the jackpot after I saw my first order, the sampler platter.
tamales are great here i get the green corn.  Man I'll drive here just to fulfill a tamale attack.  

The place has a cool set up winding around room to room it just never ends. I"m glad its open a little late for those late night customers.  

Watch out for lunch here during the week it can get full, its one of those place people know where to find.  Just of Central in South Phoenix.  I don't get out here that much 
Destination location for sure.
My personal note: we live in Arizona, experiencing some of the best Mexican food America does not know about  makes me really enjoy the valley
"Poncho's Mexican food,  Kevin U. place  to try."
