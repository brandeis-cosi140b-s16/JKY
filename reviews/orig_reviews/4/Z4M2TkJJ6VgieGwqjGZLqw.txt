This place almost single handedly rescues Phoenix from dinning-mediocrity.  It is by all means a ma-pa shop tucked away in a not so developed area of east-Phoenix.  If you are going south on 16th Street, it will be on your right hand side after Thomas Rd.  It's across the street from a strip mall and honestly there's not much else around.    Their small parking lot is in back of the restaurant.

But inside, fantastic Mexican food and a cornucopia of Tequilas await you.  Guacamole is made fresh table-side.  Tell them to go easy on the dried cranberries or raisins.  The menu has a long list of authentic Mexican dishes.  The mole sauce is very good but definitely try the fish tacos.   Prices are reasonable, be prepared to spend around $20-25 for dinner.  All in all, Barrio is a great experience.
