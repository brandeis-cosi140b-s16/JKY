Komex is one of the hidden gems of Vegas. If I hadn't found it on Yelp, I probably wouldn't have discovered the awesome fusion food it has to offer.

The bulgogi fries are amazing, and they give you a TON. Even with 3 people sharing it as an appetizer, we've had to bring home leftovers. It's just the perfect blend of cheese, salsa, and bulgogi on a bed of french fries.

I've been here a handful of times now, and almost every time I order the fusion burrito with bulgogi beef. Usually, I like to try different things when I go to a restaurant, but when I go to Komex, I'm craving that fusion burrito and can't be deterred.

The service is a little on the slow side, but they're all really friendly. You also have to realize they don't have a really big kitchen to work with. They have even put up a sign recommending you call in first. My hope is that they one day expand or find a bigger place because it is almost like a hole in the wall joint right now.

All in all, Komex has really decent fusion food to offer for a great price. Definitely worth checking out.
