I love Juans!  I have been coming here for about 10 years and the food is definitely authentic!  I have always had great service and most of the time is is pretty quick.  I have found the owner, Juan, to be very friendly.  The salsa is great and I haven't had anything I don't like here.  Their refried beans are fantastic and my favorite is their green chile!

I highly recommend Juans!
