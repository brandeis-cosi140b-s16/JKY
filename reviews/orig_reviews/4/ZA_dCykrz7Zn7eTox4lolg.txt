After UYE event we decided to check out this place , I've never been here so this is a first. At the world market center, parking outside is best rather than the parking lot.

The dining room is spectacular , I felt like I was in a high end restaurant on the strip. It has a modern cool feel.

Chips and salsa: crispy and dusted in a chile spice, salsa is fresh and flavorful, with a slight kick to it.

Unfortunately, I had to leave early for work so I did not get a chance to try the food. I will update this if I ever go to this place again.

This place could have been 5 stars if the hostess would have redeemed my yelp check in offer, which was supposed to be a hi five.
