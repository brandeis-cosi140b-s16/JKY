The people who claim this taco joint is the greatest ever are probably not from the southwest. It is a very typical Mexican taco joint - all types of beef-related meats (carne asada for most, tongue and brain for the the adventurous. This place has a straight-forward menu. Heads-up:  when they ask you if you want everything on your $2 tacos, you are ok'g onions, cilantro, guacamole and salsa. The service is good and quick. I went at 6:30 pm on Wednesday evening during CES and there was no line.
