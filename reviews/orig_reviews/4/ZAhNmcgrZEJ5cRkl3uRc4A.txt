Dined in for lunch on Monday and practically had the place to ourselves. It is a large space. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the experience! 

Chips are ultra light, fresh and crispy and salsas are flavorful. 

I had the enchilada Veracruz and it was delicious. The green sauce was tangy and the plate was vibrant with colorful fresh vegetables. The enchilada was filled with fresh spinach and topped with red cabbage and carrots. Perfectly crunchy saut√©ed  zucchini and red peppers were served alongside. The rice has a unique flavor which is not my personal preference but different! Hubby was also very pleased with his carne and enchilada. His steak had a delicious grilled flavor. The prices and portions are just right. 

The kids meal was excellent. Around $5.75 for 6 half taquitos with pepper cheese dip, rice and beans and a drink. Disappointed they did not have milk for my guy though. 

We had the mango tres leches to finish. It was very good but could have been a little more soaked in leches. Service was good but a bit slow for the number of patrons in the place. 

I would definitely go back for another lovely lunch; the outdoor space looks like an excellent spot for a margarita when the weather is not so HOT!
