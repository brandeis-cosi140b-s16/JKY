I must say after watching so many positive episodes of Guys Big Bite on the Food Network I started to question him as a legitimate food reviewer; however, after trying Chino BandidoI must say... Guy got this one spot on! The jerk rice and black beans were well balanced with their spices and sweetness. The carnitas and jade red chicken were both out of this world delicious. Their desserts, volcano or snicker-doodle cookies, were soft, fresh, and full of their sweet flavor. The staff was superior to the norm. And their dining room, although nothing special, has the "hole in the wall" feel that most of us look for in a non corporate restaurant. This is definitely a place i will be returning to.
