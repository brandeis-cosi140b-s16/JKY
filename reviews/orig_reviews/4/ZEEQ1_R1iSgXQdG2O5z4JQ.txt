Solid upscale, inventive Mexican fare in a full-service setting. Complimentary chips and salsas were terrific (one traditional, one looked/tasted like black bean & pepitas). The guac app and elote were also solid. I had the grilled quail - very tasty and fun. Wifey and dining companions enjoyed their fish, veggie tacos and margaritas. Props for having a craft brew (Lagunitas IPA) available. Service was very friendly and reasonably prompt. Only downside was that our meals were brought out about 5 minutes after we ordered. Weird -- made it seem like things were all pre-prepped and/or we were being pushed to turn the table.
