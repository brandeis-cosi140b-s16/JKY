I have been going here since it was two doors down, with hardly any seating. From day one, the food has been fresh and delicious.

At the old location I had always gotten a chorizo and pulled pork quesadilla, washed down with a lime jarrito's. It was xtremely satisfying and also very inexpensive. 

Since they have moved, I have tried to be a little bit more daring with my choices. The last time I was there I had both the chiles en nogada and the avocado fries. The chiles en nogada has been, hands down, the best item I have had on the menu. The peppers are oozing with cheese. The cream sauce with goat cheese and pomegranate seeds take the dish to an entirely new level.

The avocado fries tasted fresh and were nice and crisp. The isleno sauce that they come with isn't quite a sauce (it is more of a tapanade), but it is still delicious.

I highly reccomend going to Casa Rasta and enjoying a delicious blend of traditional Mexican flavors with a Caribean flare.
