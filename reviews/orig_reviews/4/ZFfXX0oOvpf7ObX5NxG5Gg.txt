I may have had a little too much to drink the couple times I ate here but I thought the food was unreal and their presentation is even more impressive. I got the shredded beef enchiladas and it's all I thought about for the next week. Seriously. Like most things in Scottsdale it can get expensive fast but this is one of those few places where I just ignore the price column.
