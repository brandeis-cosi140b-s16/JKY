Love it!  This place was a lot of fun, had a great band and a decent sized dance floor.  It was fun partying upstairs under the stars while The Streets played set after awesome set.  It's a mixed crowed.  I didn't feel like the oldest one there.  I don't know about the food.  I didn't even know they served food!  It was free to get in and drinks were about $6 bucks.  I would definitely go back.  We made a night of it and were very pleased.
