The food is delicious.100% authentic Mexican food. Me and my co workers always choose to go there for lunch. Their salsa bar has many great options and their horchata is delicious. 

I do have a couple of complaints to say; during lunch time the place gets packed and has very limited space. The dining area is very small. Some portion sizes are unreasonable for the prices they charge (ex: torta below charged at $9.00) And the waitress/cashier during the day, skinny with black hair is extremely rude. She has no customer service what so ever. She seems bothered when you ask her questions about their menu or just in general. If you read through the reviews I'm not the only one who thinks so. She makes our visits  very unpleasant. 

Other than that I recommend the quesadillas. I gave this review 4 stars because of the food but if I had to go by service then I would give one
