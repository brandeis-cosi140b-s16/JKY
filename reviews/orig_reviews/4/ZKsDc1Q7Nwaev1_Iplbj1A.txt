While to some folks its less "authentic" vibe is a problem, to me it's perfect.  I have taken several folks here, who are not originally from Arizona and had never liked Mexican food, and they leave here liking mexican food.  To a girl who could eat Mexican food 5 times a week and not get tired of it, getting my family and friends to like Mexican food with me is VERY important.  While some of them have evolved to other things, for others this remains one of their favorite spots - with their Chimi's always being a #1 pick.

Maybe it's just me, but I like a little kitch now and then.  Bring on the chili lights strung around a fake cactus.  It's a ploy to make it seem safe to the gringos.  Just like the food.  Nothing to spicy.  Nothing to scary.  We're all here to have a good time.  See the funny stuff on the wall?  We're your friends.

The bar area can get super packed.  And for Cinco de Mayo it's just crazy.  If you don't want to be squished on the dance floor, the only way to do it is to go early because by mid-happy hour the place is packed.  And the DJ's have been a bit hit or miss.  Some of them have played some great stuff, but others.... not so bueno.
