Love the soda options here (the horchata of course) along with my food.  Tried it after some great recommendation and was told the pork verde would be the best.  Knowing myself, I would most likely choose a terrible dish with my luck.  I did get the Carlitos burrito pork verde and knowing if I'm going to be unhealthy for once, I better get it smothered.  Wrong decision there with the smothered adovado sauce as I wasn't a fan of it.  I'm glad I did get the pork verde as the chunks of meat on this thing was huge and tender.  I ended up eating only half after my buffet at the soda machines and taking the rest home along with the smell of the place on my clothes.  I think next time, I would love to get it not smothered and to thrown in those good looking nachos I had my eyes on throughout the night of other people's orders.  Definitely a place if you want a fix on some tender meat at a decent price.
