While staying at the Cosmopolitan, we decided to venture away from the addicting "Secret" Pizza place that is on the same floor China Poblano is on.  Yes, this place is definitely pricey. Newsflash to everyone: EVERYTHING is overpriced in Vegas and if you don't want to spend money, stay home. 

My rating is based on service, selection and quality of food -not price.  

We ordered "Cold Tea for Two" that combined the flavors of green tea, tequila, and beer; this was very refreshing and interestingly delicious.  The green tea in it made me feel less guilty about drinking alcohol so early in the day. 

Then we ordered their guacamole served with handmade tortillas -this guac is just like my mom's with generous slices of jalape√±os! Best thing about the guac is that they make it to order from this huge mountain of avocados and you can choose how spicy to make it. The Guac was a meal in itself -but I felt like a vegetarian pig and ordered more.  

The vegetable spring rolls were delicious and our waiter was so attentive about my needs that he let me know that the sauce had fish in it and made an alternative soy sauce to dip them into.  I ended up dipping them into that guacamole and felt like I was eating Asian taquitos... 

Then came the "Setas" taco made with wild mushrooms on top of MORE GUAC! -supper yummy! My carnivore boyfriend ordered the "Rou Ji Mo Street Sandwich" that looked more like a "gordita" with carnitas.  He said it was very tasty. 

Yes, there's more... We decided to try their "Tres Lychees" dessert that took the concept of a traditional "Tres Leches" Mexican cake and added lychees in three different forms: Lychee Ice Cream, Lychee whip cream, and fresh Lychees on top. Perfection!

I will definitely return...
