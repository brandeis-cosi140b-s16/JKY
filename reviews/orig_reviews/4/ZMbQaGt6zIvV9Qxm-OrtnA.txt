Always fresh food and very tasty.  Staff is efficient and very customer service focused.

They have a return customer card that lets you get a free entree after you fill up the card which is a definite bonus!

Like that they have the horchata as well as lime drinks which adds to the foods great taste!  

Always in the top 3 of choices when I don't want to make food at home.
