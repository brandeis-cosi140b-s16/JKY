Holy crap. Some of the best filet mignon I've ever tried, and I'm a steak fan who usually avoids the stuff in favor of more flavorful/fatty cuts like ribeye.  I wasn't expecting much from ratings, but I was quite surprised. It's a good size for filet, very tender but flavorful, not dry at all.  Cooked to a perfect med rare. Unfortunately it was about a 40 min wait to get it to go.  Um, well worth it.

edit: went to Craftsteak the next day and got a ribeye for $$$.  This was miles above on both flavor and texture.  Cannot trust yelp reviews anymore e_e
