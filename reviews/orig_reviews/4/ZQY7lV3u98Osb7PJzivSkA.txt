I visited Yo Rita while chef Kevin Sousa was still helming the kitchen, so the experience may be a bit different now.

The food at Yo Rita is, to put it lightly, inspired. I felt like what I was eating could be served in a more metropolitan city and be treated like it belonged there. Pittsburgh's a small town and its small town sensibilities often invade the meny, not so at Yo Rita.

Everything was fresh and just weird enough that you felt bad ass but not like you were vying for Andrew Zimmern's job.

The pork tacos were fork tender and topped with crushed Cool Ranch Doritos, a combo that sounds weird until you try it.

We sat at a table for no less than five minutes but our server was so appalled that we weren't taken care of yet that he gave us each a complimentary glass of wine, not bad at all.
