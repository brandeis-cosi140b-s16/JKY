My wife and I stopped by for a quick bite here the other day. We always drive by and think to go in.  The staff was very knowledgable and friendly. Chips and salsa were nice as well. Good was pretty good and prices were fare. My fave was the red tamale. Just note that it is a different taste then Mexican food. It's not bad, but if you are going in for Mexican, you will be disappointed. This is a New Mexican place.
