This place was surprisingly delicious. They have an unassuming storefront in a little strip mall off 16th st North of Bethany. The husband and I met our friends (Erin B and her husband) at Urban Taco for happy hour on Saturday night and happy it was! Their happy hour offers $1.50 street tacos, 5$ margs, 5$ beers, and 1$ off salsa flights. We decided to get 8 (yes... you read right, 8) salsas, guac, and a vast array of tacos. The salsas were awesome, with the table coming to a consensus that the best were the chimichurri, chipotle, avocado, and habanero (which was not very spicy at all) and the ones we would pass on would be the corn and garlic (really odd flavor), the roasted tomato (nothing too special), and the cucumber (some liked it, but it wasn't overly flavorful). The guac also was nothing special, so maybe pass on that. I had a short rib taco (which was really good, the meat was tender and flavorful), the braised pork (also very tasty, but a little less so than the short rib), and the pork belly and potato (pretty yummy, like a mashed potato taco, but the belly didn't stand out). I tried the octopus taco, and it was good, surprisingly tender, but a little fishy for me. I had a marg and it was standard, but a good deal at 5$. Happy hour goes until 7, even on Saturday. Check them out, I know I'll be back!
