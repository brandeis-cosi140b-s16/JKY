Once upon a time, a guy selling Mexican food out of his van at my workplace sold me on the perfection of ceviche on my palate. Ever since changing jobs, I've search wide and far for the same perfect mixture of tomatoes, cilantro, lime and shrimp to no avail. Besides stalking the Mexican food van at my old job, I think this restaurant has come the closest to that perfection I first tasted in ceviche.  Besides their great selection of seafood (I haven't order a bad dish yet), their margarita is one of the best.
