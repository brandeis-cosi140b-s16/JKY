I'm a fan and I'll be back. Staying in the Cosmo, I had to check this place out, and I'm glad I did.  Cochinita is a win. Carnitas tacos also a win. For the Asian side I got wheat noodles with spicy pork sauce and peanuts- delicious. The noodles were definitely the highlight of the meal!  The queso was not great (although the homemade tortillas were), so i'd pass on that next time.  Service was excellent and the overall ambiance is very nice for such a small place.
