Another surprise Yelp find for me! I had never heard of this place or even see it, even though I've driven by a billion times. It's kinda small but they seem to move pretty quickly so if you do wait, it shouldn't be long.

The food here is excellent! If you're a fan of guacamole, make sure you try the fresh guac here. A waiter will come out with fresh avocados, all the fixings and make it exactly how you want...so good! Their chips are homemade and they also have a really good fideo soup. I ordered shrimp ceviche for my dinner which was alright but definitely not the best I've had. My wife had chicken fajitas which was great and I would definitely recommend it. 

Aside from the food, this restaurant has some of the best service I've ever gotten. The staff is friendly and ridiculously fast at getting what you need. My drink never came close to being empty. Their menu is also pretty big so there's something for everyone here. I'd come back, even if just for the great service and killer fresh guacamole!
