My wife and I tried this place out on 4/27 and I'll say Ken R's. review is about right. Mas Amigos is our go to Mexican place the food here is of the same quality. The place is very small 5 or 6 tables. Our feeling about this place is if your doing dinner get it to go if for no other reason then the terrible lack of a margarita, they do not have a liquor license may not want the liabilities that come with that, but for a quick lunch sit and have a taco or two. One thing that needs a lot of help is the menu, english would be a good place to start and there are no appetizers or sides on the menu we had to ask if they had guacamole. They do and its very good, you think you might want that on the menu? So as four stars says yay I'm a fan, it just needs a little work the food is great the price is right and they are fast. So the feel of the place is fast food joint think Taco Bell with great food.
