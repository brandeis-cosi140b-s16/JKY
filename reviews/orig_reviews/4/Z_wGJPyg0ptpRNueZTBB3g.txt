Overall, the food was pretty good. I tried the chicken tostadas - the proportions were perfect; just the right amount and they had a good flavor. My boyfriend had the baja fish tacos which he said were good. He tries fish tacos from just about every place we go and hasnt been pleased with every place, but seemed satisfied with these ones.
