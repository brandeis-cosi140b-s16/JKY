I went here today for a mini-vacation from the kiddos and a date with my honey. The staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is yummy, the music is awesome and the atmosphere makes me feel miles away from home. I like the openness and sunlight and having been there twice during the day and once on a Friday night, I definitely prefer the crowd and experience during the day. 

My waitress Nikki exchanged my food for me and didn't make a fuss even though it was my fault that I ordered the wrong menu item. My boyfriend called the manager Trev over to thank him for the great experience we had and to compliment our waitress. Trev spent at least 15  minutes talking with us and was very friendly and professional. 

I live in Ahwatukee and I'm really glad to have a spot like this to break away from the daily grind. It's like a mini-vacation.
