Yup, I came again on the eve of leaving Phoenix.

This time, we split the GRILLED SHRIMP (six bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp and four dipping sauces - very very tasty).

I ordered the MIXED GRILL (grilled tenderloin, lamb chops, and pork chops - the tenderloin and chops were cooked nicely, the pork chops were slightly over cooked, but the flavors were there).

To conclude, I had the FLAN which was light and tasty.
