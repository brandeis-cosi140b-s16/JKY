At first our waiter was rude then she started to open up more, this place is pretty good, we ordered there nachos with chicken and carne Asada they were pretty huge portion, and we also got a carne Asada burrito with a beer and strawberry margarita. We also used the coupon when we checked in with yelp. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas, just be prepared to pay a lot, it's worth it!
