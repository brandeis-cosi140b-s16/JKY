I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. It's a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, I'd be here a -lot-.

  For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.

   That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.

   The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.

   As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.

   Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes.
