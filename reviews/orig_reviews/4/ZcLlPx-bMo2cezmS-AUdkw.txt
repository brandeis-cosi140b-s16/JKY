Stopped in for dinner a few weekends ago, been looking for a reason to give them a try. Started with a carne quesadilla, the wife and I shared a pork burrito and an order of their cheese and spinach enchiladas. 

I think the quesadilla would have been better as chicken, the carne was a little chewy, but then again - that is the way some people prefer carne. The pork burrito was excellent and the enchiladas were top notch also. I skipped the chips and salsa since they were an added few $ - Im glad I did because the rest of the meal was filling.

I loved the flavor of the rice as well as the beans. I wouldn't really call them the best ive ever had though; we do live in Phoenix. The rice and beans capitol of the world if im not mistaken.

There's a few options here for all you bargain shoppers out there. Theres a margarita yelp check-in offer as well as a restaurant - com coupon you can pickup; however, you can't use them in combination with each other. We picked up a $25 off $35 which is an excellent option for two - ended up leaving at just under $20 with tip.
