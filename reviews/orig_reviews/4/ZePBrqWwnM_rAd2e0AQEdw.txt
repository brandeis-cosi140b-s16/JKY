This was some of the best Mexican food in Vegas!!!
The salsa's were awesome, all 3 of them!!!
I went there on a Saturday, busy but was seated fast!!! luckily~
The lowrider car club "LAS VEGAS" cc decided to end there cruise there as well so the whole parking lot filled up with old bombs!!!! and cool cars.
The margarita was a fish bowl~ and the plate I had shredded beef tacos
Was excellent... over all service was excellent,food and decor was a 4 star night****!!!!
