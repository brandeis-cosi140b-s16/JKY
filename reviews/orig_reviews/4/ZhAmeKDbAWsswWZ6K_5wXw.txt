Very close to car rental return.   Dollar to food ratio is quite high.   In terms of quality, I would say it tastes pretty close to home cooking.   There are large chunks of meat with meat gravy and the right amount of kick to the burrito.   The place is a bit run down and not much seating but service is fast.    I'd try it once but it's not iconic.
