My lady and I went for dinner, last night.

I ordered a Marco Polo which is an egg, rice, shredded beef or chicken (I got beef) & pico de gallo burrito.  It was awesome, really awesome.

My lady ordered the Veggie Mixto which was beans, rice, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce & cheese. She loved hers, too.  "Forget Chipotle.", were her exact words.

These burritos were so good that I'm bumping this place up a star despite that as of 04/01/11, you don't get chips with breakfast burritos, anymore.
