What originally drew me here was the fact that you could eat and people watch the strip at the same time. DING DING DING! That's all it took to rope me in! We got a bucket of beer, mahi tacos, and some chips & queso and had ourselves a great time here. We ended up accosting some cute guys from the strip, sharing food with them, and it ended with all of us doing shots of tequila. Definitely one of the best dining experiences I had in vegas (as far as fun goes). The atmosphere here is so laid back and great. The servers were attentive and adorable and everything tasted good. I will definitely make this a stop the next time around! 

And I didn't get the skinny on that 'Wall of Fame & Wall of Shame' , but I am making it a goal to get on one or the other next time!
