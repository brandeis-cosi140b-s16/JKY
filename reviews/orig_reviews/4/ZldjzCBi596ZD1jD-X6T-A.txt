This is the best place on mill for happy hour! The service is hit or miss sometimes it is awesome but other times it can be slow and rude. It really doesn't keep me away since the drinks are great and it very spacious so you can enjoy with large groups. My friends and I have had tons of birthdays, happy hours and party events here just because of the location and prices!
