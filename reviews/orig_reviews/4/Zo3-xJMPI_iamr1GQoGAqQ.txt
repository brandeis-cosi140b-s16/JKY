Love the inside of this place. You're welcomed by a huge room that surrounds a massive tree in the center of the restaurant. If you choose to sit at the bar you can be seated where you can see the cooks which is an inviting appeal. Also they have a huge bar on the opposite side of the restaurant. I think the style of food is unique and delicious. Love the scene. It's a great place to get a group of friends to drink and eat.
