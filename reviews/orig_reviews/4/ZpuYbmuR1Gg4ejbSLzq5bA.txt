This new taco bar/cocktail bar concept..is brilliant!  When my girlfriend mentioned that we were headed to meet friends for dinner and we were going to Taco y Taco, I imagined the normal small taco shack with great food as you would find at their other location, with underwhelming decor.  
I was overwhelmed when I entered Taco y Taco on Eastern. This place is big, two levels with plenty of seating and you'll want to spend some time here.  It has a nice ambiance with cool modern chandelier lighting and dark accents.  It's a surprise that their tacos are still only 2.25!?! 
We sat at the bar waiting for friends.  We had some happy hour beers and the bartenders were super nice.  Once we got around to eating, we went through the taco bar.  I had 3 tacos: one al pastor, a carne and a carnitas.  My fave of the 3 was the carnitas.  I wasn't overly impressed by the al pastor.  I've definitely had better.  My gf had tripa, lengua and an al pastor.  She seemed to enjoy them and had the same feelings about the al pastor. This is definitely a great spot for something quick, something slow and some late night dining.  Enjoy!
