"Valley institution" is a code phrase. It means the restaurant dates from an era when Phoenix and environs were small towns in the middle of nowhere, back in the day when the middle if nowhere didn't have the same chains as everywhere else. If you moved here from a larger, more established metro area, a Valley institutions are distinctly eat-at-your-own-risk.

I like this one because it's one of the few places on Mill Avenue that isn't some sort of "scene." There are times when I do not feel hipsterish or sophisticated or possessed of sufficient humor to eat fried food served by scantily clad young women (which describes a lot of bistros here, not just Hooters). I want food put in front of me in decent quiet by servers who stay off my lawn. This restaurant does that.

Chips were admittedly undistinguished and served with traditional Phoenix-style salsa (translation: mild and stewed). My chorizo con huevos, however, were hot and delicious. The tortillas are super tortillas engineered at a top-secret location and well worth the security clearance. The refried beans are also truly fine. My margarita existed. There are plenty of bars Mill. Go to one of those if you want your margarita to be other than an aid to digestion.


Service is friendly, unobtrusive, and fully clad. My shattered nerves are repaired. I left feeling like I'd wandered into a nice abuelita's kitchen and emerged properly nourished.
