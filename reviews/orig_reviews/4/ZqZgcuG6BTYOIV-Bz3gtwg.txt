I had their taco salad which was spicy and nice, but what really took the cake was the Cheese (Que so Fondue) that they had on the menu.....they melted 3-4 types of cheese together with ground up beef that was served in a hot skillet with really thick tortilla chips that would make your mouth melt. I also had their signature Mango Margarita which was sooooooo delicious and sweet.
