Solid, solid lunch place. 

The large guacamole with chips was plenty large enough as an app for three. 

I ordered a shrimp taco autenticos and a chicken empanada. The shrimp (shraaaamp) taco was awesome. The shrimp are small but that works on the corn tortilla. The chicken empanada innards tasted good but mine was a little too oily to eat the exterior. Lunch mate did not have the same problem with her beef empanada. 

Table mates had beef taco, beef empanada and one of the entrees (I forgot the name...). Thumbs up all around. We also split a horcheta, a rice milk drink concoction. All were good. 

This is definitely a place to go back to on a non-work day, the beer bottle selection looked interesting.
