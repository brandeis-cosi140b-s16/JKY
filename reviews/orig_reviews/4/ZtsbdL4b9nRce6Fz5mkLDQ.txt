OK, I just have to say something: NEVER go to Lindo Michoacan when you are hungry (or think you are hungry).  The food is not only tasty but you can't help but eat everything they have.  We had a very good experience (other than the horrible service).  The waiter was just standing around and we waited for our checks, for him to take our dessert order, and he was very stingy on the refills.  My partner ordered the Vegetarian Fajitas and I ordered the Fish Tacos.  The Veggie Fajitas were great but they don't give enough tortillas in my opinion.  He got 2 when it is possible to make at least 3 for the meal.  He enjoyed it for sure.  My Fish Tacos were scrumptious!  Instead of a whole, fried fish fillet, they use pieces of fish then fry them.  It also came with this spicy ranch dressing that was very tasty.  Now, I am not a fan of spicy foods (since it makes me sweat), but the ranch dressing was so good I let go of my aversion to spicy foods.  As if the meal wasn't enough, we ordered dessert!  My partner had his favorite, the Sopapillas.   I ordered the Flan.  OMG!  The flan was awesome.  It was almost as good as my mom's.  Now, that is a very good compliment since my mom makes the best flan.  It is on the pricey side, but with the gourmet preparations of the food, it is very much worth it.
