Moving from Phoenix I can be a bit of a taco snob.  Although its not "real" Mexican food its really tasty. I like the lemon shrimp tacos the best. The corn salsa is refreshing and I'll add this place on my list of regulars for sure. 

The only thing that puzzles me is why there is California Reggae Dub music playing in the background.  Its more like Mexico meets Texas on a tourist Jamaican vacation.  I'm a huge fan of tacos and Reggae/Dancehall but I've never seen them meet this way.  It's interesting.

I'll keep coming as long as the shrimp tacos stay on the menu.
