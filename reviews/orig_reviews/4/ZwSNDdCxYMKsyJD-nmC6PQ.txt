Barrio Queen is the sister restaurant of their original more intimate 16th Street location in Phoenix. It's harder to retain quality in a restaurant probably 5 times larger than their original location but Barrio pulls it off. 

The food is expertly prepared with lots of very fresh ingredients. If you have a few days in the Scottsdale Old Town neighborhood, Barrio Queen should be on your short list.
