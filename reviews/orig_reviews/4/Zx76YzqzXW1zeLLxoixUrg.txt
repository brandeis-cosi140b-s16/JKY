This place has something for everyone in a very non-chain, dimly lit smokey cabin kinda way.  Written on chalkboards above the booths, you'll find several fresh fish and meat selections that are subject to change.  The menu features several small and large plates, along with additional entrees.  We got a large plate as an appetizer (the garlic dish) and it ended up taking over as the main dish.  It was divine and very unique for Phoenix.  The wine list is great because it has some inexpensive selections that you can get in two-glass pitchers.  And like Richardson's this place offers the famous GCP (green chile potato).  Mmm, mmm.  Oh yeah, and whether you choose to eat there or not, at least visit downstairs.  It's magical.
