The prices are relatively cheap and affordable, with a decent amount of bang for ur buck. I adore the kids bowls as the portion is just right for an easy snack that'll keep you going for the next couple hours. I've also tried the chicken and carne asada quesadilla (2 separate ones) and both are DELICIOUS! though I like the carne asada one better. They also have option for tofu and being that my gf is vegan and vegetarian makes eating really easy. The tofu bowl is her favorite and is quit delicious. 

Also love the decore makes you feel like your at a taco shop in Cali on the beach somewhere, weird how the place originated from Cali. Haha

I also love the brown rice option. :) Makes me feel a little better about going out to eat all the time... XD In any case, we all left happily ever after! Till next time!
