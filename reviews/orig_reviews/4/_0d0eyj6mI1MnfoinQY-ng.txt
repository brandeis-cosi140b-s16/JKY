Strange, but quite tasty. The restaurant looks kind of dingy, but the food far exceeded my expectations. The bulgogi anything is delicious -- the flavor of the beef is so excellent. Chips and salsa were also really tasty. Portions here are HUGE and for a good price! Service was also really friendly.
