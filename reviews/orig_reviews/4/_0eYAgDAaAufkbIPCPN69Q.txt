4 1/2 Stars.  I was referred to this restaurant by my favorite barista at Starbucks. Park at the ladies and gents club Sapphire. The place is open 24/7 which is convenient after a long night next store and the interior d√©cor is upscale and impressive. 

For starters, I received chips and three types of salsa which ranged from habanera hot to mild. My friendly waitress suggested the pozole or chicken enchiladas and I took her up on the pozole. The pozole pork was lean and wonderful tasting. It came with tortilla chips - which I  broke up & threw in the soup which was an added treat. I was pretty full but ordered the flan which was bomb dessert!

I would highly suggest El Dorado grill for a business meeting or intimate dinner. BTW they also offer local specials and happpy hour here, so definitely check them out!
