I recommend the al pastor Torta (Mexican sandwich).  The bread is slightly toasted and just the right size to be a full meal. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the corn tortillas they use are not very authentic and it doesn't even seem as if they heat them up completely. It's a little small inside but has a huge outside patio.
