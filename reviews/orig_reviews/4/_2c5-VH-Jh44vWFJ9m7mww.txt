Yay went here on Father's day. Love the service loved the food. The salsa was perfect hot but not too runny. The hot sauce was good too. Had 6 of us eat and only $60.00 perfect setting for us for Father's Day. We go back often. Tried the chicken taco grande will try the chicken enchilada's next my youngest said they were really good.
