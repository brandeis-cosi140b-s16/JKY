North Valley Mexican excellence.  I have only been here one time that I was disappointed with the service, but one time compared to many other enjoyable times is forgivable.

Great food, excellent drinks and the bar is where it's at.  My favorite is the heart stopping Fundido.  Happy hour has 1/2 priced apps and BIG mugs to wash them down.  Chips and Salsa are in abundance and may fill you up before you enjoy your meal, so take it easy.

Great for a date night, family dinner/lunch, or a happy hour excursion.
