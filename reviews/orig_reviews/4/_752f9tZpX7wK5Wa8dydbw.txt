Moved here recently and have been trying to find good Mexican food. While it's not your typical Mexican restaurant - they have several different types of meat for tacos. 

Tacos were $2 a piece and the salsa, pick, and guacamole are readily available in the store. Tacos were awesome - we'll definitely be hitting them up for dinner again on a regular basis.
