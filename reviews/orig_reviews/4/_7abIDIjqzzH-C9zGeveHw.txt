I saw Casa Ramos on Eight's Check, Please! Arizona and I just had to go there.  I went with my parents tonight, and since it was the night after the airing of the show, the place was packed.  We waited a little while for our table, then ordered.  We shared a Cheese Crispy, golden brown and tasty. My dad ordered a Carne Asada burrito enchilada-style with rice and refried beans, which he enjoyed.  I got the Camarones a la Plancha: good-sized grilled shrimp and sautéed mushrooms in a garlic butter sauce served with rice and whole pinto beans.  Absolutely delicious!  

My mom planned on ordering something else, but after seeing a flaming, sizzling skillet across the room, she ordered the Fajitas Mixta: large shrimp, scallops and tilapia sautéed with bell peppers and onions, which she thought was delicious. Problem: the skillet wasn't sizzling when it got to her, and it took a while to get our silverware. We spoke with management, who reminded us how busy they were (jeez, not like we couldn't see that!), but did us a solid by comping the fajitas and assuring us we'd have better service next time.

Just as we finished our meals, my mom reminded me about the flan and how good it looked on TV.  We got one and... oh Lord... it was bomb, like bomb.com.  I can't believe how good and creamy that flan was with that caramel sauce, the vanilla... it's the best I've ever had and we ordered another one to go.  I was thinking "all is forgiven!" with a mouthful of flan but then I wouldn't be a very good yelper if I didn't mention what happened, right?  Had it not been for that, this would be a five-star review.  That being said, I would definitely go back, it's my new favorite Mexican restaurant!

BTW, to Rosario, our server: thanks, you rock!
