My boyfriend and I thought this place was great.  We went during happy hour and sat at a big picnic table outside.  Service was prompt.  All drinks and apps were half price.  I had a skinny margarita and the nachos.  The margarita was a little on the bland side.  Will have to try the original next time.  Nachos were decent enough, but nothing special.  Boyfriend had the wings and really liked them.

This is definitely a party place.  We had fun though, and when were we leaving there was a line out the door of people waiting for happy hour seating, so get there early.
