Great  place to hang out and have some drinks the appetizer are amazing the chicken and steak skewers are out of this world and me and my husband also loved the tacos the Green dip sauce is crazy good we could just drink it Been back about a  4 times in about  2 months also there on groupon you can't beat the deal that's a plus to go back also    

But the music can be a bit loud I don't mind the music but when you can't hear your self talk,  service can be a bit better but overall nicer
