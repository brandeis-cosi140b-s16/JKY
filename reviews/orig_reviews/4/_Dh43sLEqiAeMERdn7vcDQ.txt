We were meeting some friends for lunch and we asked them for ideas. They chose Juan's and I am glad they did! Located just west of the 215 on Tropicana they are easy to find. We were immediately greeted and sat in a large booth. 

Within seconds our waitress arrived for our drink orders and chips, salsa, bean dip and grilled onions and peppers were delivered. The latter is a nice touch that I have not seen before. I went with the shrimp fajitas (lunch size) which comes with rice and beans and all the typical sides. Our friends ordered the queso fundido which was excellent. 

When the fajitas are delivered they set them on fire (hence the name Juan's "flaming" fajitas). The shrimp were cooked well and came with plenty of grilled green and yellow peppers and onions. The service throughout the meal was excellent. We were always offered more chips and salsa and our drinks were filled.

The only downside for me was the guac didn't seem like it was made fresh and the cast iron skillet had a lot of oil in it making it a little greasy. Besides that it was a great lunch.
