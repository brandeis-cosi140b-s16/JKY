This is really a 4.5 from me. 

I have been to several of the Arriba's and have never had bad service or any problems with my food. (I have been to the locations on Camelback, at Arrowhead Mall and off the 101 in N. Scottsdale)

They bring out chips, salsa and bean dip and it tastes absolutely amazing. The chips are always fresh and they have great salsa. They just keep refilling and refilling them, so my only complaint is that I get too full and cannot eat all of my food!

Jamie M. mentioned having trouble finding a vegetarian option there, but I have not had a problem. I normally get the bean and cheese burro topped with queso dip. I have also had the abado pizza with beans vs. beef the taco salad sans beef and the cheese quesedilla. I would eat any one of those items again. 

The red and green sauce are not veggie friendly, but you can easily top your meal with the salsa or their queso dip, just ask for no chorizo on it.

The margaritas are really amazing too, and HUGE! I think you pay $11 but they are big enough for 2-3 people to share. The cost of the food is reasonable.

The restaurant itself is pretty fun. They have a cool mexican/sonoran theme throughout and everything is bright and colorful. 

It's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley.
