YUM! My boyfriend has been here several times while in town for business so he wanted to take me here while I was in town visiting. I can definitely see why! I love Mexican food and this was top notch. We started off with the street corn, and it was SO delicious. The corn was so fresh and the kernels were huge! The sauce on top was super tasty and I couldnt get enough. We didnt have the tableside Guacamole, but I thought the $12 was a little steep. For lunch, I had the Mahi Mahi tacos and my boyfriend had the Pork Belly tacos. Both were amazing. The size of my fish was huge! My boyfriends was very fresh tasting with the grilled pineapple on top. We also had the Chips and Salsa and the salsa had a chipotle taste to it, which we both enjoyed. 

It wasnt a cheap lunch that is for sure, but the food is super good and the portions were  a decent size. We left lunch pretty stuffed! I would love to come back for dinner some night, the courtyard out back is so cute!
