I think the best way to think of this place is like Mexican Tapas. All portions are a few pieces or bites of each item. Dishes arrive as they are prepared. It makes for a great grazing meal and most will find they can fill up on far less because of the pauses between dishes. 

Great food and overall not too pricey. Our meals ended up running about $25 each, including an alcoholic beverage. 

While not an issue for me, the chief complaint my party had was the noise level. My parents are older and have trouble separating out noises in a loud place. This is not the place to go if you want to have a "quiet dinner."

All told, I will definitely return! :-)
