What a pleasant surprise during my recent 6-day trip to Giants Spring Training!!  I went twice this trip--the first time for dinner and another time for lunch before a game.  For dinner, I was in a large group of 8 and the restaurant couldn't have been more accomodating.  We were greeted warmly and seated on time.  Food and drink service was equally friendly and efficient.  Nothing like a few margaritas and table-side guac-to-order to put one in the mood.  Ole!!  My lunch started with a wonderful mojito and some taco sliders.  Much better than ballpark food!  [fyi food at Scottsdale Stadium is MUCH better than Salt River!!  The Rockies, however, are looking good.]

The Mission is such a find and worth repeating...hopefully, just like our Giants!!

ps...I felt a little underdressed at dinner in my flip-flops.  Thankfully, the room is dimly lit.  The Mission is definitely a place to impress a date!
