I live down the street from this location so my fiance and I have been here several times now. The food has always been good and the service is usually pretty good, the only time we have had and issue is when it has been extremely busy. The large size draught beer (I get kilt lifter) is almost as big as my head for only $5.86 which is pretty darn good. I have gotten the cheese enchiladas with Colorado red sauce the last couple of times and they have been great. The durango shredded beef burrito is also amazing and it's topped with queso sauce which is melt in your mouth. The margarita's are so so and pretty pricey so if you had to choose between beer and a margarita here I would choose beer. Overall good Mexican food at a reasonable price. I will be back.
