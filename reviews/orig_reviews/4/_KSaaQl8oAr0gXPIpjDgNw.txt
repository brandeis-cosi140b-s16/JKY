This place is good. Maybe if you are a college student you would give this place five stars but since I am an old fart I go with four. The food was delicious. I got some kind of jicama salad and it was great. Also we got the chips and salsa as an appetizer and it was fun because they give you three different types of salsa. On balance, four stars is just about right for this place.
