Can I say anything bad about phat burrito? No I can't. Nothing beats a bbq chicken burrito. The food is fresh and flavorful. The salsa bar has a great variety and the service is chill and laid back. Just found out they are serving breakfast now too. 
Only advice I have is try to avoid this place during peak hours. Other than that you're always in for a treat.
