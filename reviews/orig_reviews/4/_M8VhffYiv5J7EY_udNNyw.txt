This is the perfect place to go for Happy Hour!  But get there early.  My friends and I got there around 6pm on a Friday and didn't have trouble getting a table.  But by the time we left around 8pm, there was a long wait.

I ordered a few Dos Equis (which came in mason jars with lime - a nice Lawrenceville touch) and the tacos de seitan.  The tacos were nice and very fresh, compared to most cheese-laden Americanized Mexican food.  They were made with seasoned seitan, avocado salsa, onion, radish and cilantro on corn tortillas.  Gah, so delicious!
