I always love going to Macayo's! Very friendly staff and the blackened ahi tacos are delicious!! I gave 4 stars because my waitress was not very nice and seemed to have no enthusiasm, but her co-worker, CHRIS, automatically saw that we were displeased and came to the rescue. He was very helpful and made out experience that much better!
