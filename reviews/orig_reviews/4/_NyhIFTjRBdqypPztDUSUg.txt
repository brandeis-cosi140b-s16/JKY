This review is for the food not the service (I placed an order for pickup). 

It was simple and quick to order my meal over the phone. I arrived about 15 minutes later and it was ready for me. There was a slight problem with the bill but nothing major. 

I ordered a bowl with Ono, Cajun style with brown rice and black beans. It was absolutely delicious - the portion was too big for me but I'm not complaining. The fish was juicy, flaky and just a little spicy. This is definitely a go-to place for me now, I just hope the service inside doesn't disappoint.
