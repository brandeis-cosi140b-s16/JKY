first let me prefix my review by pointing out that I was there for a catered group dinner so my experience may or may not be normal...

The service was excellent, help was everywhere and no one went hungry or thirsty. The food however left a bit to be desired. I tried a few of the dishes and all felt like they were missing something (flavor mostly). It was all fresh, just not much taste to any of it.
