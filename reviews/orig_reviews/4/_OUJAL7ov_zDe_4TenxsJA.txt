This is located right next the Ross, just after Cathedral Way (past the Wynn). You can't miss the hoards of people meandering in and out of here. 

It's fast, cheap and good. It's got this interesting set up of 3 different counters all serving up different things on the menu, although some of the menu items repeat. So you really should know what you want to get before you stand in line somewhere. I was sober and had 4 years of high school Spanish and I was still having a hard time figuring out where to stand and what I wanted to order! 

You will see all sorts of people in all sorts of dress, here, a true testament that affordable good food draws the masses. In the 30mins we sat and ate, I saw suited up limo drivers and casino security, folks in medical scrubs, construction workers, migrant workers, families who look like they just came from a quincinera, UNLVers, clubbers....and us tourist from HI in our slippers looking for a proper taco that doesn't cost $4 each.

At any rate this place is so convenient to the strip and my beloved Guardian Angel Cathedral that it will be a steady freddy everytime I'm in the 702. 

Pros:
-Late hours, cheap, good, easy parking, fast service, good lighting, lots of people around, no brainer for a taco fix
-SPICY PORK. Yup...that's the one. 
-One order carne asada fries can seriously feed 4-6 people. Watching them prepare it was ridiculous! Seriously, a mound of meat and cheese about 3 inches high just dumped on an entire fry basket of fries. WTH! 
-There's a parking lot and lot's of open spaces. 

Cons:
-It's ain't fancy and it ain't fragrance free. So you will walk into a place where smoke from meat being roasted and things being fried is visibly hanging in the air. 
-Seating can be hard to find as it's busy, but turnaround is fast
