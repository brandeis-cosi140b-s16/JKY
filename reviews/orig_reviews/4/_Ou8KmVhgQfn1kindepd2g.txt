Have a craving for Asian food but want Mexican grub? This is the best of both worlds! All of the fusion dishes are full of flavor and spice. Warning: spice level is not for the faint of heart. The spicy pork will set your mouth on fire. Bulgogi fusion burrito is a must try! The fried rice dishes also hit the spot. 

My only complaint is that there isn't more than one location, since the restaurant is way off-Strip.
