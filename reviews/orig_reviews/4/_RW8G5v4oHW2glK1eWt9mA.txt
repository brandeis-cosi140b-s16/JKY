Came here because of a restaurant.com coupon. It was fun and the food was really really good. The mariachi band plays recent rock, rap and pop songs. They were a highlight. Located in the shops between Mandalay Bay and Luxor. Closer to Mandalay Bay. 

PROS: Hussong's Chilli Relenos - stuffed with ribeye, cheese and salsa.
            Mariachi Band
            The atmosphere

CONS: Parking and walking through Mandalay Bay to the shops.
