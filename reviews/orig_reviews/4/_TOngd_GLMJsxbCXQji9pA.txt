Love love love. This is the closest to fast food that I will ever eat. BUT, curious how a super live lady bug makes it thru washed lettuce? Most likely, triple washed? But hey I get it & my daughter thought it was the coolest thing ever as she played with it out on the patio for the rest of our meal haha. I really wasn't even upset. And they were cool about it, apologized & remade my delicious meal all over again. And then, in the remake, there was a piece of plastic.. Hmm. I didn't bother bringing it back up to the line as I was embarrassed to make a scene at that point. I just threw out the rest of my meal, but I will definitely return. I never, ever send anything back but just odd that 2 things in a row happened that shouldn't be in my food!
