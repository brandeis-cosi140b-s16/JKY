Been going here since they opened.  Really great tacos. My favorites are the shrimp and braised beef. Food is definitely 5 stars but giving it 4 stars because I really wish I had one server when we went. All the servers help out each other which is nice but never quite sure who to ask for something when we need it. Everyone is super friendly and fast. This is definitely a great place to bring family and friends.
