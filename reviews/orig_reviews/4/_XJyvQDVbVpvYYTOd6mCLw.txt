This is a great new location in Arcadia!  I recently stopped in to Milagro for a birthday happy hour.  They have the best happy hour specials.  The staff were friendly and was able to accommodate our large party of 12.  I tried the Milagro Margarita (DELICIOUS) AND Sangria Blanca (AMAZING).  These drinks went perfect with the 
Chips and Salsa de la Casa.  I tried the Camar√≥nes Dulces and these were the perfect amount.  Beer battered Rock shrimp on top of iceberg lettuce cup, with aioli dulce and house pickled chilies.  I tried a little bit of the PB&J....mind-blown yummy goodness!!!  I want to order these on my next visit to Milagro.
