This place is awesome. Large menu with alot of variety, strong drinks and an interesting atmosphere. I usually prefer to sit downstairs next to the fireplace and have a few cocktails before checking out the menu. The service is eh, dont expect much on that angle but the food is great and the atmosphere is a close second.
