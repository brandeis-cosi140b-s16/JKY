I'm going to go ahead and give a review update here, mostly because last night was the first time I've had dinner at Verde. I came last night with a group of friends and immediately ordered a pitcher of margaritas coupled with the glorious chips and (particularly good) salsa, along with some tasty gaucamole. On top of this amazingness, I also tried the sopa blanca and tacos hongos. These were both perfectly flavored and seasoned, particularly the tacos. I don't think I've ever had mushroom tacos that good ever. The service was good, considering it was a very busy Saturday night, and I always enjoy the ambiance and people watching opportunities. The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating for me is that even for how good it is, I still consider the food to be significantly overpriced. First, 9 dollars for gacamole and chips? Really? This would cost about half as much at almost any other restaurant in the city. Also, my two small mushroom tacos ran 10 bucks, which is also about twice as much as two tacos at Cantina down the street. Although the quality of the food is hard to beat, I'd consider other places to meet my Tex-Mex needs on the regular and save this place for special nights.
