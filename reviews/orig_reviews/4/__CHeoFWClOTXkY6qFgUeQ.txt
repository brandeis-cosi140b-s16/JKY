What a wonderful place to eat.  I have eaten here many times and I always come back for more.  The food and drinks are a lil bit on the pricier side but what do you expect from a restaurant inside the MGM.  
I had the cochinita Pebil, if you don't know what it is,  watch "Once Upon a Time in Mexico", it's the plate that Johnny Depp's character orders every time he eats.  Anyways the Pebil wa fantatstic,   the pork was soft and tender, it practically melted in my mouth.  

My G/F had a the steak taco's, which were really good,  what I like about this place is that the put your taco stuff on a plate and you pretty much make your own taco's.  Its good for picky eaters like my G/F.

Probably my favorite thing here is the Guacamole,  it's made right at your table and it is soo fresh and the taste is fantastic.   Also the chips and 3 different types of salsa make waiting for your food not a problem.
