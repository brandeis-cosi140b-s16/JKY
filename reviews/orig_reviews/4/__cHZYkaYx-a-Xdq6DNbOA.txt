My 4sar review is probably a bit slanted. The truth is, I've been here several times, today for lunch in fact, and I've only eaten their Thursday special: Barbacoa pork tamales. these tamales have changed my opinion of tamales. The pork filling is slightly sweet and delicious while the masa is moist and tasty. The hot sauce isn't very hot, but it has good flavor. I like the variety of drinks available as well as the torino's syrup selection so u can make insane drinks. I prefer cafe rio over chipotle. Thinking of the pork tamales is making my mouth water.
