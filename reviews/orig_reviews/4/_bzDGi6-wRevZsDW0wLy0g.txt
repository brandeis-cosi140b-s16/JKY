I drive all the way across town, from Arcadia to Tempe for Restaurant Mexico's green corn tamales. Alright, it's only a 15 minute drive, but I'll tell ya, I'm drooling the whole way. Rumor has it that "the man" is going to tear down the whole block to build a high rise, I hope and pray that Restaurant Mexico relocates to the empty ice cream joint over on 38th street and Indian School so I can just walk across the street for its yummy awesomeness. I had to take away one star because the salsa is inconsistant, when it's good, it's awesome but when it's not it resembles watery soup.
