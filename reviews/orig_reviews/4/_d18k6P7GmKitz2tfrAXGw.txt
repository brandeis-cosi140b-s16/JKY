Great place for tortas!  I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and ordered the Del Rey to go.  The service was great, the price was really good, my meal came out fast, delicious and hot.  The torta was stuffed with all my favorite things and came with two different kinds of sauce and a bunch of ruffles potato chips.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and would recommend Los Reyes de la Torta if you're looking for a creative, huge meal at a low price.
