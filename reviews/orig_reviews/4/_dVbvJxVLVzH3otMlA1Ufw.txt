Bummer reading the bad reviews. That wasn't my experience at all. Here in Scottsdale on business, and stayed a couple blocks away. The entire Old Town part of Scottsdale is cute. This place fits in well. Cute look inside and out.

Server sat me right away. I hardly looked at the menu before deciding on the Special, shredded beef tacos and a Corona. Chips and salsa were so-so. The tacos were delicious. Came with some rice and lettuce. Very simple, and exactly what I wanted. The added bonus is the tacos had a good spice to them, and the tortillas were tasty.

Before I could ask for dessert they brought me the check. The real reason I was there was because I saw they had sopaipillas. I asked my server to add an order (2) of sopaipillas, which she gave to me gratis. I know better than to expect great sopaipillas outside of New Mexico, and these were just ok. Still a novelty to get them somewhere without having to travel to NM.
