I wasn't sure about going here. It came highly recommended but I read some reviews and they weren't great. I think the problem is that some people have unreasonable expectations, especially after having visited for myself. The food was pretty good, the portions were unusually large and the service was far above average. This is not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but nobody at my table had anything but positive to say about their menu choices. My daughter in particular had an adult-size meal that she ordered from the kids menu. I tried it. It was almost as good as my carnitas chimichanga. I hope that people wait til they are in a better mood before they write their reviews. When a place truly sucks then I could see, but this place doesn't.
