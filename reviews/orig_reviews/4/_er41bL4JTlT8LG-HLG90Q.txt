Except for a couple of forgettable lunches, every dinner visit here over several years has been very pleasant. Well managed, superb ambiance and lighting, the right amount of bustle and noise, a wide patron demographic, nicely balanced menu, reasonable pricing, and attentive service. Every dish is worth a try, although the ceviche was perhaps a mild disappointment.
