Late evening on a week night and we were hungry. We phoned around to a few places and decided to come here. It was a short drive from where we were staying but Ztejas has never disappointed before. I used to go in Vegas and loved their Diablo Chicken Pasta. I am sure if I had ordered that, I would be giving the place a 5. But, I decided that I had been eating a lot like I was on vacation and probably needed to be a bit more sensible. I got a grilled chicken salad and SG got the fajita special.

They bring out corn bread to start with honey butter (needs more honey in that honey butter.) It comes out in this great little cast iron skillet. It is soo good. But do not get carried away, because your meal portions will be large too. My salad was big, but the bowl was bigger, making it look a little small. It had one chopped up grilled chicken breast and some delicious spicy ranch dressing. There was corn and beans in the salad too, so I felt like I was getting more vegetables. SG's fajitas were good. There was grilled meat and peppers, some salsa, guac and cheese. Only three tortillas come with the plate, but they are resonably sized. 

We both ordered bottomless iced teas and had them filled about a million times. Our server was great. She was fun and lively and the service was really good. 

This place is very good and I would go back to this or any of their locations. The food is always good quality. Best try that diablo chicken pasta sometime if you like spicey, creamy, yummy chicken pasta.
