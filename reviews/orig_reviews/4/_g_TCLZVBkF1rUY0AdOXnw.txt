Damn. Did I wake up in Tijuana? It doesn't get more authentic than this. I found this spot by walking to Los Tacos and noticed that it looked a little busier than usual so looking around I spotted this place about 30 feet away so I decided to head over there. As I walk towards the entrance I have a young kid trying to sell me bracelets that I see in Tijuana, okay check. I walk in to the restaurant blaring mariachi music - check. The guys behind the meat speak to me in nothing but Spanish - check. That red pork or whatever meat it is, on the right closest to the door with that green creamy sauce had me speaking Spanish in 3 seconds flat. 

Damn, good.
