Alright this place is a definite regular go to for me and my companions for primarily two reasons 1) food is deeeelicious 2) prices are super duper reasonable. 

First, after you order, you get complimentary chips with salsa and guac, which is already hard to not like. Also, while, I haven't tried everything on their menu--recently, they added more to their repertoire including pork belly spam musubi, which was really really tasty. The pork belly was just the right amount of stomach fat (sorry if that sounds unappetizing) and meat, and cooked so that it was slightly crispy on the edges, but still able to melt in your mouth alongside a bite full of rice and seaweed. Other than that, my go to's are usually the fusion tacos, or fusion---anything and I usually get the spicy pork. The bulgogi is good, but it's a little to sweet for me, so I opt for the pork, which is just the right amount of heat. Also, another fave of mine to add onto everything is their homemade chili sauce thing? I'm not sure what it is? But it has bits of, what looks like, kimchi and chili paste and it hits the spot every time! 

The only critique I have is.....they don't serve alcohol LOL. Not that I'm an avid drinker, but sometimes it'd be nice to have an ice cold beer while eating my Korean-Mexican fusion tacos. 

Lastly...if you, like myself, drink water/non-sugary drinks like a camel, I recommend ordering regular ice tea. It's less than $2, I think, and the glass is way huger with unlimited refills...and for some reason they refill these faster!
