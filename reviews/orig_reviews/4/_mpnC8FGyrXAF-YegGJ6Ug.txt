Oh damn. This place is in a pretty innocuous-looking building (save for the Blue roof!) just outside downtown Mesa. A very casual atmosphere that was desolate at 4:30 but filled up entirely before 5:30. They serve 'a' Sleepy Dog beer (yay, locals!) but that's one more than you usually see on tap.  

I ordered the Carne Adobado (Adovada here, you know how Spanish be) and my Moms had the 'Taos' plate, which comes with a Chile Relleno and a bunch of other things that were unidentifiable under a blanket of cheese (not always a bad thing). 

The food came out within 20 minutes and was piping hot. It couldn't have been any better. The last 'chill' in Arizona before the swelter really starts had just hit, so the moment was perfect for something spicy. The adobado is basically cubes of pork in a spicy/powdery sauce with rice and beans on the side so you can make mini-tortillas out of the stuff. The pork is that "fall apart" slow-cooked type that takes years to master.

The server didn't seem to care much for us (the guy could not smile, I swear--but the Boston Marathon bombing had just happened so maybe he was affected) but he was quick and helpful. The price point here is "two" dollar signs but the adobado is really only one (10.95). Oh, before I forget, they are one of those rare Mexican places that still give you free chips and a tasty chipotle salsa.
