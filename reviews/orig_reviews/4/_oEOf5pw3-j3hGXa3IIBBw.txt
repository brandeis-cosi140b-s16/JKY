We LOVE FOX restaurants in general, but it's nice that they have this Mexican restaurant thrown into the mix of their usual Italian, Steakhouses, etc.  The food here is SO GOOD!  Service is usually really good too.  Sometimes, we'll get an average server which is why didn't give the FULL 5 stars, but this is definitely a must visit!!!

The atmosphere is great with a nice patio.  It's not too awful casual in that it feels like you're dining at a pretty nice restaurant yet you could still get away with walking in in your nicer work-out attire (which I have).
