This place was a real shit-show when we walked in, but I'm glad we powered through.  It's chaotic and busy and you're in everybody's way while you're waiting in line.  Your patience will be tested if you're an impatient mutha like me... but your patience WILL pay off.  My most important piece of advice to you is to make sure you are in the correct line for the type of food you want... there are labels at the front of each line.

These tacos are tremendous.  They are also very fairly priced, because although they're pretty small - they're also just $2.  I ordered 3 and had wished I ordered 6 (seriously, 6... they're not that big).  Worth a trip to the northern end of the strip for these, just make sure you have some time to wait.
