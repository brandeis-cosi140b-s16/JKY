Jaburritos is run by some passionate cats. I loved going in and meeting the staff and trying their food! The place is very technologically advanced (machine that smushed rice into seaweed) and also Eco-friendly (recycled/repurposed furniture). It made me feel good supporting this business.

Jaburritos does a fusion burrito with sushi concept. You choose a wrap like soy paper or seaweed and then you pick the insides a la Subway type ordering. I opted for one of their pre-decided burritos. 

It had shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and an array of veggies. With soy paper I enjoyed the freshness of the burrito. Their veggies were great and the spicy tuna was good. My let down was the shrimp tempura. They give you 2 pieces and the shrimp have very little shrimp in it. The shrimp they use are super breaded. It literally shouldn't even have been on there it was THAT small.  
The price with a canned green tea came out to about $14. Which I think was worth the price. I think for $10.95 a burrito that they could use better shrimp for their shrimp tempura.

I also tried one of their burritos with steak in it and one of their salmon burritos. They were both very good.

Overall I did like Jaburritos, but in my honest opinion I wouldn't go here often. The concept is great and the food is good, flavorful, unique. I would just rather go to an AYCE sushi place is all. I can't be the only one out there. It's really just giant hand rolls. That's just me. To me this falls into the novelty category. I'm glad I tried it, I liked it, but there is an alternative I'd rather go to called all you can eat sushi. 

Go here for a light and satisfying lunch or dinner. The staff is super nice, the place is clean, they are unique, and they won't break the bank.
