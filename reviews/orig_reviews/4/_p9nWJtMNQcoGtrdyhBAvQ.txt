We came here on our last day in Vegas after picking up show tickets at the Wynn. My companions went to eat in the food court two floors up but I decided I wanted something different, so my boyfriend and I came here.

We decided to try a few appetizers as not to ruin our appetites for dinner and ended up splitting an order of nachos with pulled chicken and tamales,which neither of us had ever had.

Service here wasn't super fast, they were kind of busy but not too busy. I'm not sure if the kitchen was just slow or something but service could have been faster and more... together. We had one server, then another and then another I think.

The nachos we had here were quite good - you can tell the nachos aren't from a bag here and if they were, they're pretty damned fresh. The chicken on top was nicely spiced and had been cooked in a sauce with some onions so that really added to the flavor of the nachos. The tamales were something else. I had no expectations on what a tamale would be like, so when I dug into the soft, almost mushy tamale, I didn't know what to expect.

Flavor town indeed! WOW. So good. I was expecting something much more savory but this tamale was pretty sweet but it was SO good. I would try tamales anywhere after that experience. We split both dishes and couldn't quite finish but it was an excellent meal.

Overall, aside from the slower service, the food here was excellent. I would come back, its in a good location and you can sit on a patio without being in direct sunlight after walking around the strip for a while.
