Great new Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I had high expectations since I also enjoyed Gallo Blanco.  

Nice space, friendly service and delicious and reasonable food!  I tried the al pastor and the shrimp tacos with a side of rice...super tasty.  My husband and friend tried the paella and were very pleased...it looked and smelled delicious.  My husband started with the chicken soup and it was amazing too - big chunks of chicken and noodles.

Definitely check out this great place!
