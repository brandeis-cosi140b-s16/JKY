Another awesome Mexican restaurant within a couple of miles of our house....this place is pretty awesome.  I don't know why it took me so long to try it out....perhaps because it's kind of tucked away out of sight in a shopping mall that doesn't generally get a lot of traffic...?  I don't know....but one thing I do know is that it's no on my radar and I will be back many times.  Here's my Son and I had on our first visit:

My Son ordered the Carnitas and I asked him for a few bites so I could sample the plate...it was very good, nice flavor.  Beans and Rice complimented it well.

I had the Nachos and the Carne Asada Taco.  The Nachos were awesome....the did a great job with this dish.  It's Spicy and has a ton of flavor....portion size is big too.  They serve it on a Pizza dish....I think that's the trend now as this is at least the 2nd or 3rd place I've seen Nachos served on a Pizza dish.  Before moving to the Scottsdale area, I'd never seen that.  Back to the food....

The Carne Asada Taco was OK...it was the only dish that disappointed.  They do something different here with it....they add Lettuce....a lot of Lettuce....too much Lettuce (see pics above).  I think the Lettuce overwhelmed the flavor of the Taco....if I order this again, I will either order it without the Lettuce or take it off before I eat it.

The service here is good too.  We asked for very Spicy Salsa instead of the normal one they give you with your dish and they came back with a Habanero based Salsa....it had a serious kick to it.  It was nice to have that option.
