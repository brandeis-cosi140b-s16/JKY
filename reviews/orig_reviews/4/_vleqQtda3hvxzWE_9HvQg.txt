I work in the industry so sometimes by the time i'm off of work, it's a bit after 1 AM and i'm starving. I enjoy this place a lot and they have a great late night menu.

i love their fillet salad but i'm starting to venture out more. don't forget to ask for the industry discount if you work in the industry!
