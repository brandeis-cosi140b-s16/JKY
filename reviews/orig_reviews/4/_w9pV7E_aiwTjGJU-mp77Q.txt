Being in Phoenix for the summer, I decided to get Los Reyes De La Torta a shot instead of La Tolteca, which is a much shorter drive from where I am living. 

Went at about 6:30 on a Sunday evening with a buddie and had no wait at all. Good atmosphere. Had great, prompt service. Our waitress never let our drinks get below half way and was simply fantastic. Restaurant is in a small plaza but does not feel (and is not) dirty or grungy or anything of that sort. I ordered the Del Rey while my friend ordered the beef tongue torta. Both came out in about fifteen minutes just as we ordered them. Once again, very very good service. 

The only reason I am not giving Los Reyes five stars is probably my own fault. I got the Del Rey because of all I had heard about it, but probably should have gotten something that is more my taste. However, the sandwich was fantastic, the meat was juicy and tender, and the egg and avocado made it truly enjoyable. No complaints about the beef tongue either.

All in all, if you are in the neighborhood give this place a shot. Great service, very good food, and very affordable. I will definitely try to make the drive again while I am in town.
