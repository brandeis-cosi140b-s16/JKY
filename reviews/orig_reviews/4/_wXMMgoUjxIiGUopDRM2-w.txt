I happened to be a the Venetian and initially had planned to eat at Javier's for my last night here on business but was too tired to walk all the way back to the end of the strip so based on a recommendation from my wife who recently ate here I decided to dine for dinner. Had the chicken enchiladas and requested suiza instead of ranchero sauce along with a House Margarita. 

Overall...I would give the meal 3.5 stars which translates to 4 stars. My server was very engaging and guest experience overall was great however, I was dining during non-peak dinner hours (mid to late afternoon).Price and value is better than Javier's and recommend this for folks who are on a budget.
