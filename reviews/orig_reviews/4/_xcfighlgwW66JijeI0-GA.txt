Mexican fast food but really great!  We were craving Mexican after long Sunday on Havasu and needing to nurse some hangovers . This fit the bill perfectly.  We tried the chicken burrito, taco al pastor, guacamole and chips and cheese stuffed chile poblano.  Everything was great and much more authentic than a Taco Bell.
