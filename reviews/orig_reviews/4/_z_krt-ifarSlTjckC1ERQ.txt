ate here on a Sunday at noon and had a great experience, no wait in line to order and plenty of free tables. the restaurant has a really clean, colorful, fun atmosphere. I ordered the carne asada taco combo that came with rice and beans. it was a lot of food, I brought more than half of it home for leftovers. I've never had rice like this before - creamy white rice with bits of corn in it. it was different, but good! I love how hot their salsa is and their chips are great too. will definitely be back here again. especially once it cools down and I can bring my dog and sit on their front patio.
