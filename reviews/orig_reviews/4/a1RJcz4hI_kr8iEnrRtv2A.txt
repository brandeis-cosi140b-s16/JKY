been here 3 times my boyfriend eats the carne asada regular tacos.. 
i have had the super taco.. in carne asada  and another time chicken.. the chicken seemed under cooked but it wasnt.. so kinda werid..

I came from living in NYC (the king of street tacos and taco trucks)  So Rudy's was very close to authentic..

I had their churro too YUM! 

their Horchatas were just ok ok.. ive had better..

I would come here again as my boyfriend loves this place and he is picky ( i mean he cannot have onions in his food and the regular carne asada tacos arent cooked with onions- whew)

we also ordered beans and cheese nachos.. its just refried beans and shredded cheese.. no big deal but the chips were warm n good
