To me, Mad Mex is a place to watch sports, drink beer and eat wings!  And for those points and those points only, I am giving Mad Mex 4 stars!  

It's convenient, there's street parking, it's a fun atmosphere, it's not impossible to get a table, and they have a decent happy hour!  What is there to complain about??

I can't speak to the food because I basically refuse to eat mexican food outside of CA or Texas.  (And yes, I know that Tex-Mex is fake mexican food.)  So, I'll defer to the rest of the yelpers for opinions on the food.  But given that there are several locations, I'm sure the food is your run-of-the-mill chain mexican options.
