In the downtown area, I highly recommend making the stop.  Tends to be a bit busy at lunch, staff moves quickly to accommodate.  I ordered the Red Machaca with Beans.  Excellent flavor, subtle heat, perfectly cooked.  A hit!  One tip, if you order a side of chips and salsa, make sure you have friends dining with you or be prepared to bring home a Doritos sized bag of leftovers!
