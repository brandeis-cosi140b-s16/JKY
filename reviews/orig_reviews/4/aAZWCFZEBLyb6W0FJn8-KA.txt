I really like this New Mexican style restaurant!  The Hatch green chile and sopapillas are yummy!  I have to admit that I have only had their cheese enchiladas but they are always so good and if you like whole beans opposed to refried beans, this is the place to get them.  This is definitely a regular restaurant for me.
