Having last visited Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger's second Las Vegas outpost of Border Grill on New Years Day for brunch, it was not until General Manager Jennifer Holley tweeted a picture of festive holiday pumpkin that I recalled an invite to stop by for some ceviche - a special "Day of The Dead" menu launching on the anniversary of my second year in Nevada an added bonus as I sat with a friend and her son on the "patio" for a celebratory multi-course meal.

Conveniently situated at the base of spiral escalators on the ground floor of Caesars' Forum Shops with the Too Hot Tamales signature style offering a backdrop to upscale Latin favorites crafted from largely local, sustainable, and organic products, it was moments after 6:00pm that menus were confiscated, Jennifer taking the reins and steering us through eleven plates, four cocktails, three types of salsa, and a few too many warm tortilla chips.

Tasting a refreshing Cucumber Cooler before sipping the sweet Pineapple Margarita far more quickly than usual for someone who usually nurses his drinks, it was with smooth Haas Avocados pureed with a bit of heat that the meal got started and having been promised ceviche Mrs. Holley delivered precisely that just a few moments later, all four items crafted at the specially designed bar absolutely outstanding in terms of taste and texture, the candied pumpkin with cinnamon notes offering the best bites from my standpoint as sweetened plantain chips acted as spoons with heat turned up by Aji Amarillo.

Minding the youngster with chicken fingers, though he more than happily tasted from the special duet of Enchiladas and Pork as well, suffice it to say that anyone with a sense of ingredient quality is bound to appreciate the obvious time and skill involved in crafting such a deep and aromatic mole, the green "sacred leaf" tortillas another well thought piece to the puzzle with a slightly sweet finish helping to lighten the heft of the meat with a bit of crunch added by crispy chicharrones.

Thrilled by two more Margaritas, the Acai infused iteration a bit more my style than the smoke and spice infused Blood Orange, another round of savories featured two items off the regular dinner menu and although the flautas were essentially traditional Mexican fare benefited by superior ingredients the warm beet salad was a spotlight-stealing sort of side dish with great texture provided by creamy fresh queso while the natural sweetness of carrots provided a deft foil to bitter beet greens.

Generally unimpressed by most flan, though happy to have my mind changed, it was with a DÃ­a de Muerto duo that desserts got started and although both the creamy coconut and textured sweet potato rounds were better than most they simply could not compete with what I still consider to be the best Rice Pudding on this side of the Atlantic.

****Admittedly trending more European in my tastes than Latin (or Asian for that matter) Border Grill disproves those who seem to believe that "Ethnic Food" shouldn't be 'upscale,' and with superior ingredients generally yielding a superior product the experience is further benefited by top notch service with both the food and beverage offering enough variety for virtually all palates to be pleased.
