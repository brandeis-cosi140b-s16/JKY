Went here the weekend of the infamous Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. This restaurant was located inside of Planet Hollywood. It was extremely crowded that weekend. However, when the four of us entered this restaurant, we were seated and serviced quickly. The food was awesome! Customer service was good, but wasn't excellent. However, no one was rude. They did what they were supposed to, but wasn't exactly working for tips as it relates to service with a smile.. That is the only reason I didn't give this establishment a 5 star rating. I would definitely go back though.
