Had the tostados for appetizer and shared the pork shoulder tacos.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The handmade corn tortillas were perfectly sized and made.  I am usually not a fan of modern fusion cuisine and always love the simple street soft taco like King Taco back home in LA.  But this place didn't loose any of that simplicity by making it their own.  Both dishes were done with just enough "flair" to add to the dish instead of taking away from it.  Definitely a place I'd recommend and come back for.  Everything was great.
We sat at the bar and the service was excellent too.
