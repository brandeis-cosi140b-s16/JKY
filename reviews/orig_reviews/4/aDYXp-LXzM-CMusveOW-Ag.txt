Stumbled upon "Taco Tuesday" - buy any drink (alco or non) and get 2 tacos for ~$7.  Our party all partook the special offer and were all pleased with the results.  We had an array of taco flavors, my personal fav was the tenderloin (beef), while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  The chips and salsa they serve pre-meal were fantastic, really great flavor in the salsa.  Great place
