I had a shrimp burrito.  You know what I liked about it?
It was simple.  
No special sauce.  No fancy take on a classic.  Just some good grilled shrimp with minimal seasoning, fresh lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  Good tortilla too!
I dig the crazy concoctions and re-imaginings as much as the next gal, but when simple is done right you are reminded how good it is.
