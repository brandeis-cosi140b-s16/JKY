I had to used the Eat Street service because I couldn't get out for lunch and was hungry for Mexican food.  I had never been to Taqueria Guadalahara before so I was a little scared about what I might get.  I ordered the Enchiladas Mole with cheese and it was fantastic and exactly what I wanted.  It came with refried beans, Mexican rice and a little wedge of lime was a nice touch.  Sour cream and fresh avocado were extra, but at .35-.40 cents each, it was well worth it.   Loved it!
