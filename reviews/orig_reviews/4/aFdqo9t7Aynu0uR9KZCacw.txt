After watching "Heat Seekers" on the Food Network, I decided to try the Cry Today, Cry Tomorrow chicken.  Before I ordered, the manager gave me a taste of what I would be in for!  This was impossibly HOT and could not be eaten and this was only about an eighth of a teaspoon,  I had to run into the kitchen to ask for milk to kill the burn.  I had already ordered an appetizer and a pork dish but lost my appetite do to the fire within and had to cancel my order, unfortunately.  I would rate it 5 stars for service and atmosphere, but I really didn't eat.  There is a big selection of tequilas and mezcals if you wish to imbibe.
Special thanks to Jamie, my waiter for being accommodating while I was on fire!!
