I was lucky enough to try the kim chi fried rice when a friend brought it home to go. So after nearly a year of anticipating the fusion goodness, My BF and I ventured to the other side of town and ordered the Bulgogi Fries and Kim Chi fried rice with chicken. 

It's a hole in the wall shop that boasts flavors and service very unmatching with the decor, It got pretty busy and the food that was laid out on either side of us looked and smelled amazing. 

I can't wait to go back!
