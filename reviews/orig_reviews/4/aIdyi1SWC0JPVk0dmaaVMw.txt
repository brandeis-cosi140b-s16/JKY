Ok, I'm a fan.  Not your traditional Mexican Restaurant and not at all what it 'used to be'.  That said, hi end quality, reasonably priced delicious entrees.  Had an early dinner, and the wait staff was trying hard and succeeding.  Try the Pollo Las Brisas.....superbly done (grilled while you wait).
