Pleasantly surprised at what i found after walking through the doors. Yum. I underestimated the 2 taco plate size and got two additional street tacos (happy hour 3-6 m-f), leaving me stuffed.  The fried shark was great - awesome crunch with perfect texture while not being fishy. I've had better mole but it's worth the try if you've never had it. Carne asada and cochinita were also good.  Experiment with the different salsas to make each bite different.  This place is not cheap for tacos but def worth the groupon when available.  Good luck parking in front if it's busy.
