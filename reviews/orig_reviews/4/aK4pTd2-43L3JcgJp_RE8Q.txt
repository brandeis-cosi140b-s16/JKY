Deciding to come here was an easy compromise for the meateater BF and me. This place gets automatic points from me for having a vegan menu!

The Vegan Nacho was a MOUNTAIN of ingredients including grilled peppers, onions, corn, salsa and pinto beans. There was veggie patty crumbles that I'm pretty indifferent about however the amount of mushrooms seemed to be minimal compared to the ratio of other ingredients. I also wish it had more guacamole but that's more of a personal preference. I was impressed with the amount of cheddar and mozzarella Daiya. Jalape√±o chips were stacked pretty high and I was happy to see that the ingredients weren't just piled on top of the chips but layered within the dish. $15 may seem pricey for a plate of nachos but this place makes a genuine effort to make the price worth it. http://bit.ly/1Ic9mRg

The meateater BF had the Buffalo Hot Nacho which he devoured. I think that means he liked it.

Service was friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I appreciated that this place wasn't overly cranking the AC like most places do. I understand that Vegas weather is hot but it's inconvenient to have to carry a light sweater just to stay warm indoors.

Overall, I'm a fan! I predict that we'll be back to check out other items on the vegan menu :)
