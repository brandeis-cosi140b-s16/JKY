Cafe Rio...where have you been for most of my life? Ok, I admit I discovered you late in life but better late than never!
Sweet...pork...barbacoa...whaaaaat?! So delish! It's like the Mexican BBQ pulled pork with a smokey sweetness that had me craving it for months! I turned everyone I knew onto it who didn't know from before. In a quesadilla, burrito, taco, tostada...oh heck I'd even try it on vanilla ice cream. I know sounds weird but give it a thought ;)
Then there is their signature chicken...yummy WHITE meat chicken in a special light sauce that has me wondering why the other big Mex place can't serve white meat (?)
The guacamole with salsa & cheese could be a meal in itself, creamy guac, crazy fresh salsa with just a pop of jalape√±o to wake you up is perfection.
They make their tortillas fresh...hardest working tortilla people in my opinion.
They give you so much chips that by the end of your meal it doesn't look like you made a dent.
The drink bar has the perfect makings for a virgin mojito. I like mixing the mint lemonade with the red stuff with a spritz of soda water. Plus they have flavored syrups if you want ice tea. Talk about the ultimate suicide drink bar!
