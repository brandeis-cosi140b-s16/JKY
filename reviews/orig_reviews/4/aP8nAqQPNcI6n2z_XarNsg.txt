Anyone that grew up here in Vegas has most likely grown up going to Macayo's. I was upset to find out that the one on Decatur closed down since this is the one I grew up going to with my family.

    I was pleasantly surprised to when I got to this one with my wife because of how nice, new and clean it looked compared to the other ones around town. It was clean with a nice friendly staff who were attentive but not over bearing and very friendly.

   The food was good of course. I got the Beach Tacos which were chicken tacos on flower tortillas with rice, pico, lettuce and cheese with a chile-lime ranch... Amazing

    If you go you also have to make sure you order TCT its what they are known for( besides their Margaritas and Pina Coladas)

   Overall I was very pleased with the new Macayos and will definitely be back.
