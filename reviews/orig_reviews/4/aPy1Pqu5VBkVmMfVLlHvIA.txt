My husband and I have eaten here 4 or 5 times. We have always had great service. When the weather is nice, the patio is great. We like the pork belly tacos, shrimp tacos, chicken empanadas, kale salad, and halibut ceviche. We order the tacos al a carte and not with the sides. This way we can share the roasted corn side dish. It is very unique and a take on the Mexican street corn on the cob. The prices are slightly higher than a lot of the run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurants around. The quality of the raw ingredients and the creative food combinations make the extra cost worth it. 

Give Taco Haus a try!
