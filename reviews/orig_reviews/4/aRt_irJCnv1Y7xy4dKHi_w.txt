I never had the food here so this review is based solely on this place as a venue. It's a pretty fun spot to go hang out and have drinks when I don't feel like going to Mill Ave or Old Town. When it first opened up, it would get stupid packed but as time progressed the crowd slowly subsided. There are nights when it still gets pretty packed but still enjoyable. Crowd here is mixed, which I like. It doesn't take very long to get drinks which can be a buzzkill sometimes. Their bar is pretty well stocked and they seem to have most of the things I've asked for. I like to switch things up now and then. There is also a little small dance floor area should your heart (or feet) desire to do so.
