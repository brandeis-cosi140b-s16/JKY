I could easily eat here every night of the week.

We finally made our way to Gallo Blanco.  It's been on  my list to try for a while, especially with us living in the Coronado.  Locally run hotel, local restaurant, local sourcing of product, what isn't there to love?

NOTHING! 

It was the perfect dinner back in town (I had been gone for a family wedding) with my husband.  Margarita Monday made it even better (a pitcher for 20 bucks).  The acapulco crudo was phenomenal (and I'm craving it right now), the guac deliciously fresh.

They serve breakfast all day and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his chilaquiles.  I had the famous street tacos: ahi tuna, cochinita, and carne asada.  All very good, the tuna being a fantastic special from the summer menu.  Yum!

Hubby had the orange cake which disappeared quickly.  I didn't even get a taste.  I had the postre de chocolate, which is basically smores in a cup and, oh man, that thing was delicious.  I savored every bite of it and couldn't finish it!  There was probably one bite left, but I just couldn't.  I absolutely can't wait to go back.  It's definitely one of my favourite mexican restaurants in the valley.
