It was 7pm on a Sunday, St. Patricks day, and we were out-of-towners looking for dinner near our hotel in Charlotte.  We were surprised to find that most restaurants were closed.  Azteca was the fourth one that we tried and, finding it open, decided to give it a try.

When we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming.  There was a plate of food on display which looked kind of congealed and gross - it had probably been there the whole day - and made me question whether dinner there was a good idea.

There was no wait for our table.  When we were seated, they promptly brought us delicious chips and salsa.  Our waitress was very kind.  We ordered four different dishes and shared - they were all fabulous.  Large portions for great prices.  There was also a woman walking by with a cart making fresh guacamole on request.  She was adorable and I loved that she made it right in front of us.

Overall, Azteca was not a place I probably would have chosen first but I'm really glad we stumbled upon it.  A great find!
