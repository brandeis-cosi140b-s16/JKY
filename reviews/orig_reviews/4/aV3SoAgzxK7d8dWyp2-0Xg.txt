My partner found this out of the way gem in a crappy small strip mall. Park in back.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but the nice faux finish d√©cor and segregated dining areas on the inside make up for it.  We had the Pollo Especial and The combination Red & Green chili plates. The red chili is amazing.  I am typically more interested in chili verde but the red chili is terrific. Be sure to request corn tortillas with this plate instead of the usually served flour tortillas.  The bean and rice are great.  The rice is moist & flavorful. If you are choosing between the queso dip and the spicy bean dip, go with the bean dip it does have cheese in it with great flavor, not too spicy either.  The Pollo plate is great, it is one of the most popular dishes on the menu, however, to me the least Mexican.  Try the steak or chicken picado.  I did not try the menudo but everyone around us was ordering it, which looks delicious.  We were there on a Sunday around noon, shortly after we were seated & ordered the place began to fill up. By the time we left there were several parties waiting for tables. There is a nearby church and everyone was there following services.  So if you go on Sunday for lunch, get there by noon.  The food has incredible taste and is quite authentic.  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix Metro as you can imagine, but there are not a lot of good Mexican restaurants.  This is a very good restaurant.  The salsa is made fresh daily & you can tell, it has great flavor (I would prefer it more spicy). Our waitress was great, smiling, attentive, and serviced well.  
Next time I will order a bowl of the Red Chili with corn tortillas.  I don't need the rice and beans just a giant bowl of that delicious Red Chili.
