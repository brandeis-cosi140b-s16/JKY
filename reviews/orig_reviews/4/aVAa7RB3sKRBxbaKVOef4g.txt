Considering, I just came back from Mexico, I was not really excited to have tacos.  However, my hosts insisted.  Really glad they did, I ordered the lemon grilled taco with refried beans.  My wife ordered the beer battered white fish taco.  My Grandmothers ordered the salmon tacos.  We decided to mix and match to try all three and I must say all three were amazing.  The grilled shrimp taco had wonderful flavor, loved the basil and sauce that it was served with.  Also, I love how each flour tortillas is fried to a perfect crispness.  The white fish taco had a nice crunch to it, the salmon taco tasted great as well.  The salmon had a really nice grilled flavor.  Their retried beans were great and the avocado pasta salad had a nice bite to it.  The only item, I did not have was the complementary chips and salsa.  The chips were good, but the salsa was terrible.  It had a lot of corn and red onions, to this tasted more like a coke slaw than your typical salsa.   In summary if, I lived here, I would definitely frequent this place.
