We were checking out Cosmopolitan and accidentaly came across this restaurant. When I looked at the menu I thought it was way overpriced, but then I realized I was in the brand new 5 star Las Vegas strip hotel, so it was OK. All restaurants in LV strip hotel are overpriced anyway.
Expect to order at least two dishes per person (around $30) because the portion is really small.
 
We had:
- Guacamole
Really good but a bit salty. The tortillas are super good, the best I have   tasted so far.    
- Twenty veg fried rice
The best fried rice I have ever tasted, rice is cooked perfectly and the vegetables are super fresh. (I am Chinese, so I know my fried rice)
- When pigs fly (steamed pork buns, dimsum style)
So so. They used the really fatty part of the pork, so I can't really taste the meat when I bite into it.
- Chicken JiSong 
It was OK, good, but not impressed.
- Unruly monk (vegetable noodle soup)
Really good noodles, perfectly al dente. The soup is OK.

So among the food I ordered I was most impressed by the fried rice. The portion was super small for $16, but it was good.

Will visit this place again on another trip to Vegas.
