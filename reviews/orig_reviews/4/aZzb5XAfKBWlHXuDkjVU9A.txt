Best place for Mexican food in surprise and we've tried a lot! We've eaten here a few times. Last week was for a birthday celebration and there was 7 of us, all drinking and eating so a good sized bill and we were all shocked when the restaurant didn't honor a 'birthday' how other restaurants would have. The waitress was told at the beginning we were there specifically for a birthday and nothing special was done. This was the only misfortune we had there.
