Always enjoy the food and drinks here after work.

I love the salsa that comes with the chips!  Drink specials are great - always a good place for margaritas. 

Whenever I come with a large after-work crowd they are able to accommodate us.  The food is good, not true authentic Mexican but delicious.  This time I had tacos, three different kinds.  Shrimp and fish and pork.  More than enough food (especially after enjoying the chips and salsa!)
