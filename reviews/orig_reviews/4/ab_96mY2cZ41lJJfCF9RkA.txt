I was in town for Dodgers spring training and LRDLT on my to do list of Arizona eats. I made it just before closing 8:50pm (they close @ 9pm). I took a peek at the menu but I knew what I was there for Torta de Rey!!! 
     It did not disappoint it was a monster it has everything you can think of stacked inside 5 different types of meat cheese avacado tomato onion. It truly is a meal fit for a King. Im planning a trip to Arizona in July for the All-Star game and I know I will making a couple trips to Los Reyes.
