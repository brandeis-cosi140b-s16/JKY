Awesome, authentic Mexican tacos.  All kinds of meat that...er...I wouldn't eat. Did I mention it's authentic ? I had the asada and pastor tacos. I assume by everyone's smiles that the brain and internal organ tacos were yummy as well. Lines for different meats are kinda confusing, but, they help you sort it out. If you are a gringo ( like me ), bring a Mexican.  It helps. ;-)
