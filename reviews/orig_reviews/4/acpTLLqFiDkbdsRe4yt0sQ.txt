just tried this place with some friends who are regulars and DAMN, its good. good prices, they bring not just salsa but fantastic beans with your chips (!), my wife informed that the 99 cent margaritas (thats the regular, all day price!) are actually boozy instead of the watered down cheap ones you get at other places. staff was pleasant and attentive...well worth your money and time
