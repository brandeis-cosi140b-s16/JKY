Not your usual Mexican fare! We dropped in on a Saturday evening without reservations and were seated right away. There was live music, but it wasn't so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our table. The food is very good and unique.  For example, the guacamole made tableside contains cubes of avocado, chopped red onion and cilantro, lime, and pomegranate seeds. I had a delicious torta with chicken, poblanos, and onions - my daughter had beautiful chicken tacos.  The prices are not inexpensive, but the portions are huge!  The atmosphere is fun and although the neighborhood looked a little iffy, we felt comfortable parking in the back and walking around the corner.
