First time eating at Backyard Taco and left happy! We tried the Crazy Potato w/Carne Asada and a Carne Asada taco. 

The crazy potato is essentially a baked potato loaded with all the fixings plus your choice of meat (carne asada, pollo, or birria) inside a tinfoil bag. All in all the crazy potato was a hit. Would recommend. 

The carne asada taco was pretty good too. I tried mine with the tomatillo salsa to add a nice level of spiciness. Tacos are about $2 each and about the size of a standard street taco. 

Service was great, food was excellent and will be coming back for more.
