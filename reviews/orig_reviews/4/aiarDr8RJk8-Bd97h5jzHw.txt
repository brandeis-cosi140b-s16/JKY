I've been searching for great mexican cuisine and I think I have found it. Chip and salsa are honestly the best I've had in awhile, always made fresh. The portions are generous, and presented somewhat nicely. Everything from the burritos, tacos, enchiladas and even tamales are great. I have yet to try the rest of the menu simply because I'm addicted to a few select plates. 

They really seem to know what they're doing here, as everytime I visit this place it is always packed. The decor is a little cheaply done though. 

Service is excellent and attentive. 

Price is justified due to the quality of the food and service.
