What a great place. We've been here once before when visiting Scottsdale a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it then too. Their outdoor patio is wonderful, service is great. Oh yea, and the food and drinks are outstanding. The guac is yummy (we dialed down spice because of young child, but still very good); the slow cooked BBQ pork tacos were to die for and the cheese quesadilla was surprisingly yummy. LOVED my mojito, and the specialty margaritas were good. 

Two thumbs up, will definitely visit again when in the area.
