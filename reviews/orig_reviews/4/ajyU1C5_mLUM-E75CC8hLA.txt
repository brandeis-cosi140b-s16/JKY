I was pleasantly surprised with this place after reading everyone else's reviews. My boyfriend and I first went to the bar first since we were super early for our reservation time. 

The service was great but the margarita I got was nothing special. It was the Chayo margarita and I honestly could not taste any alcohol in it at all. 

For dinner we moved over to the dining area where we got to enjoy dinner and a show when a group of older ladies decided to give the cock a ride. Pure entertainment!

The food was pretty great too! We had the chips and salsa and guacamole as starters since I couldn't decide between the two. I loved the salsa! It was very fresh tasting and just the right amount of spice. The guacamole was good too but nothing too spectacular.

For entrees we had the shrimp tacos and burger. I personally loved my tacos! My boyfriend said the burger was good too. We will definitely be back soon! Looking forward to trying out taco Tuesday's that our waiter recommended!
