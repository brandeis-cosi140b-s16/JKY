Lady J. remarked of the, "crappy atmosphere and decor."  I disagree passionately.

It's kind of dark.  Old carpet.  Wood panel walls.  Mexican rugs hung from the ceiling.  Random artwork.  Very small-town, very Arizona.  I loved it.

The service?  Great!  Our waitress and no less than four other employees were very attentive.  Refills were prompt and there were smiles abound.

The food?  Good, not great.  The salsa tasted a little like pizza sauce and my green chile was very runny - a personal pet peeve.  On the other hand, the rice, beans, and tortilla were exceptional.

Our meal was cheap.  I'd go back.
