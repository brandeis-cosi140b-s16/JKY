The salsa and beans are excellent, but also very easy to fill up on.  Menu selection is is large, and portions are good sized.  Ask to be seated by the window for great views of the strip.  Service is usually excellent, but can be spotty if it is busy.  Parking can be a problem, especially on the weekends.  Burritos are huge, fajitas come sizzling, and I recommend any dish with camarones -- you won't get cheated.
