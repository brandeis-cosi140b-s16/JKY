My daughters and I ate here today, the food was great.

We both got the Tres Hard Tacos, which was $5.99 each. My daughter got 2 barbacoa and one carne asada taco. She loved the barbacoa. I had one each of marinated chicken, marinated pork and carne asada. The 2 marinated meats were excellent... You could tell that they were marinated in citrus or something sweet like pineapple. The carne asada was pretty good, and had the grilled mesquite flavor.

The hard shelled tacos were regular size, not street tacos.

There is a nice salsa bar, with about 5 or 6 different salsas.

My only complaint would be the menu board, it is extremely difficult to read.. Either it was not lit up or items were so small they were illegible.
