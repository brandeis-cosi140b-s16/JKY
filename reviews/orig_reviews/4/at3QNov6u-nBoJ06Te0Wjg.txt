After being contacted by a manager and provided a sincere apology and gift card I decided to give this location another try. I picked up gift card around thanksgiving and didn't use it til 12/30. My nachos were perfection. Totally matched what I'm used to getting from them. I tried the florentine nachos and they were Devine. Great comeback nacho daddy!
