Any place that has excellent sangria and is sweet to my kid in her high chair is a success in my book!  I've been here twice--once for late night drinks with some girlfriends and another time for dinner with my husband and 16 month old.  It's rare a place can be a good fit for both but I had a great time both nights!

The food was delicious: You've got to have the street tacos for sure.  My favorite was the chili lime shrimp taco which has jicama mango slaw, yumm!  I also liked the jalapeno mahi and the pork.  The guacamole is mediocre and kind of small (well...compared to guacs the size of your head at other restaurants) so I don't recommend that as your app--luckily you have several app choices and the good ole' staple salsa hit the spot.  All the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  I'll keep recommending this one!
