Lunch today, first time dining there. Waiter was quite helpful. When I ordered the tuna tacos, he offered the recommendation for their house specialty then went on to tell me I could order one of each since there are two on the plate. I did and it was a great way to try different flavors. Both tacos had abundant large pieces of tuna cooked to the medium rare I requested. Waiter kept the ice tea coming.  Really nice lunch!
