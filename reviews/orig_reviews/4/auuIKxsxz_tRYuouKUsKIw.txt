Yes! What an amazing place!!! Came here for dinner with friends and OMGeeee, talk about a cool place!!!! I loved EVERYTHING about the place. The tacos are amazing, the flour tortillas are OUT OF THIS WORLD. Lime rice is delish. Also, the free chips and salsa are UNREAL!!!!! If you haven't been here, STOP here for some real, authentic tacos!
