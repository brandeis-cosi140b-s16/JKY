This was an unplanned Smunch venue as we gathered where we expected to find food trucks that were not there.  It was on several folks lists to try so off we went.  Walking in with a group of twelve we were able to secure 1/2 the patio.  Most of us had been to Gallo Blanco several times so we had some idea what to expect.  Otro is quieter.  General consensus was the food was just as good if not a bit better.  I think they have a bit more freedom with spices not being a hotel restaurant. I had the trio of enchiladas with rice and beans which were all excellent with the only exception of I didn't care for their interpretation of mole.  I had to take my rice and beans with me for lunch the next day.  Because we were starving by this point I had already eaten the enchilada with the verde sauce by the time I remembered to take a picture so I didn't post it because it looks funny.   Not everybody has found Otro yet so there was no trouble getting seated at midday on a Saturday.  Service was good the entire meal.
