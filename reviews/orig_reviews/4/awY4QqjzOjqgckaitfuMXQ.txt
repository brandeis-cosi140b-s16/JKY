Our new favorite breakfast and lunch spot. We had almost given up on finding a great authentic Mexican restaurant and we finally found one in our own neighborhood. Breakfast are excellent! We get the chorizo plate( best Chorizo we've ever had), Menudo, and the breakfast quesadilla. All are fresh, homemade and delicious! Staff is always friendly and attentive.
