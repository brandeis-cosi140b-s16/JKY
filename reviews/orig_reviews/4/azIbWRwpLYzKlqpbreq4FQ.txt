They do a great chicken fundido.  And the luncheon chicken fajitas are great also.  At $10.95 the luncheon fajitas are a deal.  A good portion of chicken breast tenders, peppers, tomatoes, and the onions... oh the caramelized onions.  Good chips and salsa.  Always great service.  The only occasional issue is waiting at the front to get seated, this can be frustrating.  But once you're seated, dig in and enjoy.  Its also nice that they send out the monthly BOGO mailer.
