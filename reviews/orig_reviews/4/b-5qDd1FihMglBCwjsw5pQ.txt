As an update, unfortunately I can no longer state that Kevin provides exemplary service.  I guess it should raise a red flag when someone asks you to rate them on Yelp.  Yesterday's excellence can be today's deterioration and letdown.
But the food is as good as ever, and arrives timely, which is great for me.  Almost all servers make a good effort ti take care of you, so occasional mistakes can be ignored.  I'm there to relax and enjoy myself, and if something isn't right, simply speak up!
