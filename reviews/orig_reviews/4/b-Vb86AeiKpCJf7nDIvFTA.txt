4.4 stars.

Almost forgot to write a review about this place.  We were browsing the Strip and ended up in the Venetian during their Winter in Venice showcase.  We were hungry but didn't want to spoil our dinner that was in a few hours.  So we all ordered the Mexican Chopped Salad of grilled chicken, roasted veggies, smoked panela cheese in a beautiful Sherry-cumin vinaigrette (4.5 stars).  Along with margaritas (4.5) and great chips, salsa and guacamole (4.5), we were satisfied.  Service was prompt and pleasant (4 stars).  A rather interesting setting along the "Venetian canals" under a simulated wintry-blue sky.  Mexican food in "Venice".  There's a first for everything.

Tally:
Mexican Chopped Salad:  4.5 stars
Margaritas:  4.5 stars
Chips/Salsa:  4.5 stars
Service:  4 stars
4.5+4.5+4.5+4= 17.5/4= 4.4 stars.
