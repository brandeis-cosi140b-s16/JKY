Cool place!
We stopped in for dinner, and while the place was kind of dead, had a great inexpensive meal (unheard of vegas). Those chips are damn delicious and nearly ruined my 3 steak taco dinner. Happy hour is pretty nice, 2for1 on bottled beer as well as 1/2 priced apps.

My buddy says this place is usually rockin on a thursday night, and really something special once Rehab starts up in may.
