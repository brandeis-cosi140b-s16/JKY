I've eaten here twice when in Vegas.  The first time I used a $50 food coupon and the second time was because I liked the restaurant and the food so much the first time!  I really wish I could remember what I ordered both times...because it was all fantastic...but the margaritas (pineapple was EXCELLENT) may have caused me to forget. ;)

I do know that the chips and salsa and the queso fundido were delicious.  The portion sizes were great and the waitstaff was very friendly.  The restaurant is easy to find in T.I. and it doesn't require you to be dressed to the nines...which was nice considering the second time I went I had just gotten off of a plane with no chance to change since my luggage was missing. :)  I highly recommend going here if you're staying anywhere on the strip!
