Everything was stupendous. The outdoor patio seating is cozy and comfortable - it's nice to see there is a place in Scottsdale that doesn't offer a "dog friendly" patio. I don't always want to be subjected to someones well dressed, stroller pushed, dander shedding, drooley "fur baby" while I'm enjoying a nice meal.  Service  from Erica was perfect - she is one of the best servers I've ever had. Friendly, helpful, perfect timing without lurking. She even took our late night coffee order with a smile on her face even though she had to get it from the restaurant next door. THEN there is the food. Oh my. Everything was delicious - first time in a while I didn't leave someplace with a box. The house rice, shrimp and corn tamale and chicken taquitos deserve special mention, but everything ordered was fantastic. The pineapple sorbet is actually served in a hollowed out pineapple. Tee hee! 
It probably says something when you're looking forward to your next visit within 24 hours of your first. Check this little spot out for sure.
No happy hour and pretty pricey wine options.
