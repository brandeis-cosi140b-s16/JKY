TORTILLAS.

You order anything that comes in one of their delicious flour tortillas here and you can't go wrong.

My absolute favorite is their egg and potato breakfast burrito. Eat it with their delicious spicy hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Oh how I wish they were open Sundays. It would be the PERFECT hangover breakfast.

I have had their bean burrito which is okay. I'm not crazy about their beans. I have also had their cheese enchiladas which are not that great.

My husband says their machaca beef is pretty good and their green chili pork.

One of my favorite things to do for dinner for the fam is to order a dozen tortillas, and containers of their beans, rice, and green chili pork to-go, grill or saute some veggies, set out cheese and sour cream and let everyone go crazy. Easy, cheap, and tasty dinner.

I can honestly say that sometimes I just crave their butter tortilla. Yep. Just a warm, soft tortilla smothered in butter and folded up. Excellent snack.
