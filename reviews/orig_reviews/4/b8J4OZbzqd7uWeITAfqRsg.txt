They have a Sunday Brunch here which starts at 11am and has bottomless Bloody Mary's, Mimosa's, coffee, tea, juice all for $12.50.  You cannot beat the brunch buffet, it has a good variety and each week it is a little different.

I love this place and I hope not everyone will love it as much as I did otherwise it will get too crowded and I won't get a seat.  This last Sunday they did have a good steady crowd and with the food being SO GOOD, including the dessert which I normally never eat, this is my favorite brunch place.  

I do not go every week, but every once in a while it is a great place to go.  The chips are good, the staff is friendly and like I said the buffet which has about 12 hot items and then a cold section, you cannot beat the price.  The beef is always tender, the chicken dishes are always good, the pork I don't eat but I am told it is good and the salsa they bring with the chips, one hot and one mild, it fixes everything no matter what.

I like it spicy and many times they will have a selection or two on the bar with peppers in it and I love to grab a whole pepper and just enjoy it, but be forewarned it will have a kick....
