My management team came in from Dallas took me out for lunch on my 15year anniversary at work. I've always heard good things about Carolinas and wanted to try it. So Carolinas it was. It was a bit unorthodox for my managers who usually eat at much 'nicer' places. But it wasn't long before they opened up and said that this reminded them of home!
I was impressed with the food, a bit disappointed that they don't have carne asada. I had to settle for machaca, which was good. My new office is located a quarter mile from here so I have a feeling that we will be visiting more often!
