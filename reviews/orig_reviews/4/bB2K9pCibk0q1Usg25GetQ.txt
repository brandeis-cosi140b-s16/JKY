This was a neat and unique upscale blend of a restaurant with an identity crisis. This crisis however led to a nice fusion of Mexican and Chinese cuisine. A quaint and cozy setting inside the cosmopolitan hotel and located on their second floor China Poblano has delicious food with my vegetable fried brown rice with chicken having an amazing combination of Mexican and Chinese flavor. The prices are very reasonable for Las Vegas. Neither the restaurant, the setting, or the food blew my mind, but I would eat here again. The service was good and the ambience was enjoyable.
