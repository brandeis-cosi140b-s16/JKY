Had the taco plate. Chicken tacos were beyond my expectations. Wow. Just like the best taco stands in Tijuana. The carne asada taco was a little thick and had a fat chunk in it. I def recommend the pollo tacos. 
You should dine in and enjoy the mural of the Tijuana border. It's a great mural I assume of a famous painting.
