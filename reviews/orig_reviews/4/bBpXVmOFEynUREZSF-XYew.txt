I've been to Verde about 4 times before, and most recently I dined here for lunch with a group of coworkers around the holidays.  The restaurant kindly accommodated our party of 12 at a large table in the back corner of the restaurant.  Service was prompt and the food was wonderful but the restaurant wasn't all that busy while we were there.  A few of us ordered starters like guacamole (it's fresh and delicious) and the salsa trio (also fresh and wonderful tasting), and I ordered a large guac to share with my end of the table but when the server brought it out she had split it into 3 bowls and spread it over the table and it really wasn't my intention to pay for guac for the whole table particularly after they ordered more on the other end and didn't get it split up for the whole table - just bad execution on our servers part.  Otherwise the food and service were great.  Most of us got either the Burrito Mojado or the Burrito Especial and a couple of folks got a few of the different tacos.  We also got the red sangria and it was absolutely one of the best sangrias most of us have had in a long time.  Overall it was a great meal and on par with the other meals that I've eaten at Verde.  I will definitely be going there again.
