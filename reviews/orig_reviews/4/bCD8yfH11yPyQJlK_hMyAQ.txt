They have yummy, fluffy fry bread that are huge! I like that you can get it with carne asada which I prefer from the standard flavorless ground beef that come in an Indian Taco in most places. The asada was flavorful. The ingredients were fresh. They also gave you an option of red or green chile sauce, and I opted for red on the side. The taco did not need the extra sauce but I tasted a few bites with it and enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. It would be bomb on some enchiladas.

I got take out and it also included some chips and salsa. You don't see that too often anymore.  Most places charge extra for these. 

I didn't try anything else besides the fry bread taco but I'm already excited to go back and try more items. So... Yay! I'm a fan!
