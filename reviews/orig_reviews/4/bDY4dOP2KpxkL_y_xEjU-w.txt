I would give it 5 stars, but we only ate chips & salsa. We stopped here however because we saw a sign for a $5 bloody mary. We went in to the bar & found ourselves being waited on by Brandon, whom had worked there for 5 years. He was super friendly & made us killer drinks as well as provided us with some good conversation & entertainment. He also gave us great information on where we should go out & where not to waste our time. He deserves his tips by far!
