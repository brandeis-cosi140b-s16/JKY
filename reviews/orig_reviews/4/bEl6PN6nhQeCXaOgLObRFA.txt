I like it, and so far I think it is one of the best restaurants in Summerlin which is quite aways from all the chaos and dream food of the strip. My husband had pumpkin salmon and I was pretty jealous because I played it safe with fajitas(which were good). I normally would rate this a 3.5 but they get a .5 for bringing good food closer to my parents house. Some days you just dont want to shelp over to the strip to eat.
