Carlsbad Tavern is a little...different. The food was great, don't get me wrong. The typical "Mexican" portion of their menu was small, but the food off of it was delicious and plentiful. We sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a cooler night, and I think that that took away from the experience. The outside patio looked awesome. The inside is, again, a little...different. Very much tavern-like, with bat replicas everywhere, and not very Mexican/New Mexican like. A Hoj Poj of a restaurant, if you will.
