Was in the mood for tacos today and decided to give Cien Agaves a whirl. I do not eat beef, pork, or shrimp so I can so often to be limited to pollo aka yard bird or an occasional fried cod but alas not here..they serve seared rare ahi tuna, ono (both grilled & fried), salmon, potatoes and grilled veggies w cheese.  You can get your choice of three tacos with vegetarian beans (black or refried) and rice for $12.95.  Not a bad deal at all especially in Old Town Scottsdale tourist haven..had a nice snowbird Canadian couple at a table near by..I was of course in a booth as I am a booth person.  Theirs were comfortable and the tables close enough and movable not to wear your tacos in your lap.  You have your choice of corn or flour tortillas, I opted for the corn which were light and perfectly sized to the ample portions.  Lots of Ahi no skimping, the grilled ono had a great seasoning with tamarind, lemon, garlic and chive...the veggie one was like a cheesy veggie quesadilla more than a taco, very savory but could have opted for more veggies and less cheese.  The avocado salsa has a guacamole texture  and was a bit too liberally applied on the Ahi but still nice and removable.  I had to request the spicy salsa and it wasn't very spicy and just one little dish between the two of us.  It did seem fresh and light w cilantro, but I did need additional hot sauce... Next time I am going to ask for a side jalape√±os as I need more spicy heat in my Mexican food but yes I realize not everyone enjoys crying during meals.  Overall a nice lunch experience, the restaurant was clean and artfully decorated with unique Mexican culture themed paintings for sale. Our waitstaff was courteous and attentive enough.  I will definitely go back and maybe try the salmon tacos or the big ass burrito.
