Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try while I was in Vegas.  The way to order is really confusing.  There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.  

The best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.  

Tacos El Gordo is right off of the strip so its really easy to find.  Parking can be a little difficult at times because it just gets so crowded on the strip.
