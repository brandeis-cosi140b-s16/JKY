A bit expensive for one taco...$2.50, but their salsa bar is amazing! If you plan it right, you could get a whole salad for free with this salsa bar. Ambience is just right, makes you feel like sitting in a small Mexican neighborhood with loud traffic nearby. Great for 2-3 people at a time, larger families or groups need not stop by...
