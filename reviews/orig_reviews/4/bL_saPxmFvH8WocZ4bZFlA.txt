Great Mexican menu with some interesting variations on the traditional meal. I enjoyed the bacon chicken fajita. It was superb. The meal of course begins with house chips. They served two options with the chips. I loved the fresh salsa. And it coupled well with the second option, a warm spicy dip. Service was fine. I love eating outdoors. The menu offers a nice beverage selection.
