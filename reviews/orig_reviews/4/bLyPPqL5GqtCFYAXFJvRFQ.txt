I was in Vegas for work and attended a week-long conference at Mandalay Bay.  I didn't plan out lunch very well and on the first day I ended up in the food court eating a Nathan's foot long hot dog and fries for $11 and I was pissed.

I was determined to find something better, and I had walked past this place called "Border Grill" while walking from the convention area back to my car in the parking garage, so I looked it up on Yelp.  It had good reviews, so I tried it out for lunch the 2nd day of the conference.

Pros:
-Food is good and authentic
-Seating is fast and they will get you out on time to get back to work
-service is fairly good

Cons:
-a little rushed
-expensive, if you're not paying attention.

As I was seated, the waitress said "Chips and salsa are coming, do you want some guacamole as well?:

I should have known enough to ask what it cost but I didn't.  I think they rely on most people assuming that it is free.  I was served a plate of decent chips and salsa, and then a huge plate of chips and guacamole.

I ordered the special smoked salmon bagel, which was very good.  In fact, it was extremely filling considering it sounds like a brunch item.

When I got the check, though, I saw the guacamole plate was ten dollars!  This raised my lunch from ~25 to about ~35 bucks.  Kind of a scam, if you ask me.

The waitress should tell you the price of the guacamole when offering it, I've never been anywhere that a guac+chips plate was more than 4 or 5 bucks.

I left a minimal tip (don't feel too bad for her, my minimal tip is 11%).  She should have told me up front what the costs were.

Anywyay, lunch was very good, certainly better than Nathans, and I would go again, but be careful about what you order.
