I love this totally unique place! All the food I have ever eaten here is the YEARS I have been coming here is always delish!
I love the fact that they have huge late night menu until 2AM every night! big nachos (my hubby's fav) and a giant ruben sandwich, yummy green chili chicken quesadillas and soups and burgers... and don't let me get started on the fries, lets just say battered fries are to die for!... you name it! YUM! Their salsas are fantastic...For dessert order the Prickly Pear Flan... so creamy! I love sitting in the bar booths, they are cozy and private feeling, yet you feel apart of the bustle. The patio is a rocking' place to sit. It has a giant waterfall that not only drowns out the street noise but gives it a totally unique and fun atmosphere! I enjoy coming here with my hubby for a casual dinner or even with a large group! Either way it is a good time!
