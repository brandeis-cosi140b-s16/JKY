This is an unusual and unique spot: high-end tacos with bizarre ingredients crossed with a bar which always seems to have Penguins games playing... 

The tacos are all served on flour tortillas from Reyna's in The Strip; the best tortillas in Pittsburgh, but I wish Yo Rita offered corn. Last time I went, I had a calamari taco which was too salty and an eel taco which was just right. The chips and salsa are good too. Decent beer menu, although I asked for an IPA in the bartender somehow managed to convince me that the Stout was really an IPA (it wasn't). ;-)

Other random notes:
1. I wouldn't really call this place Mexican -- it's more like Mexican inspired. 
2. It's extremely loud inside (just from people talking), and it's often hard to get a table as the place is quite popular.
