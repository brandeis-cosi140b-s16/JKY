This ranch style restaurant is beautiful with flowering plants and potted shrubs all around giving one the feeling that you are going over to a very wealthy friends oversized house for a festive occasion. Once inside the atmosphere is very much the same and quite pleasing. You could easily just walk about and look at all the cool decorations sprinkled throughout the restaurant or hanging on the walls. The back patio is where we chose to sit and was very cozy with the sound of a romantic water feature in the background. Nice.

Free chips and both red and green salsas were brought to the table as soon as we were seated. The chips were pleasantly fresh and tasty as well as the salsas. We shared an Adobo Shrimp Cocktail served in a fancy glass with a layer of cocktail sauce on top of a pleasant mixture of greens. I ordered the Seafood Tacos which came with a Shrimp Taco with a delicious Pineapple Salsa and a Grilled Salmon Taco with an Orange Mango Salsa. It also came with a side of your choice. My friend ordered a really large Chicken Salad with Mango and all sorts of other fresh goodies on top. It was so big she took half of it home for later.

Service was both friendly and prompt. If the weather permits choose the outdoor back patio vs the inside main section for the extra ambience or you can visit their smaller Taqueria restaurant next door when in a hurry or wish to get some great takeout. Enjoy!
