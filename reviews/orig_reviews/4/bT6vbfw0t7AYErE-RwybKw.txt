Not bad.  Not bad at all!

I think you kinda expect a restaurant like this to be more of a hangout place than anything else.  I mean, they offer margarita's with beer bottles stuck out the side of them!  How do you take that seriously?!

I can tell you how.  By the quality of their roja (roma) tomato salsa, which I could not get enough of.  Or their (Camarones) shrimp taco's, which I ate every bite of.  Or their black beans, which I never usually touch, that I ate half of (big feat I know!).

Although delicious, my pineapple cocktail probably could have been non-alcoholic with the amount of liquor included.  I might order a marg next time, or perhaps just a brew.  Or both, apparently!

Sure, maybe it looks a bit like they've replicated a Mad Mex, but it's a Burgh staple, how can you not?  Add in the huge rooftop balcony, toted s the highest in Shadyside, and I'm a happy little burrito.  I believe that means I'm wrapped in a warm embrace of delicious Mexican food and I'm happy!
