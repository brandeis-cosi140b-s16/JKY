Some of the best gourmet Mexican food in Chandler. While their chips and salsa are often middle of the road, their Shrimp wrapped in bacon is just exceptional. They offer plenty of substitutions if you don't like a particular item and their drinks are always spot on. The Grande is large enough for two people, while the Durango burrito is a sinfully delicious.
