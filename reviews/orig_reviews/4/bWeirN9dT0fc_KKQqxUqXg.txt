Love this spot in uptown Charlotte!  It is a little pricey.  The atmosphere is cool, the best is sitting outdoors on a nice day.  Their enchiladas are very good, but their shrimp tacos are even more delicious.  I wish they made their guacamole table side, that is something that could make the experience even better in the future.  They margaritas are small but strong.  Definitely would go back!
