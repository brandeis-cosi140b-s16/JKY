Now, I'll tell you I was a little skeptical.  A place that serves Mexican food and diner food.  Come on, now.  But, I had a 2 4 1 entree coupon via my new entertainment book, so a colleague and I decided to give Davids a try.  And what a cute little 50s style diner it is!  :)

We called in our order and walk over.  When we get there, we let the guy (maybe it's David himself) know that we phoned in our order.  And a minute later he brings out our Davids burger.  

Tasty burger.  Handmade burger I believe.  It was falling apart on us.  All in all, fast and friendly service.  Decent eats.  We'll be back !  :)
