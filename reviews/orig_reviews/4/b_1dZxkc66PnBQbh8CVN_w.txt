If you haven't been here yet, TRY IT! Almost everything I wanted out of a my food experience (and then some) was at this place. 

How I found it: Restaurant.com 
The Deal: I paid $10 for $25 worth of food. Pretty good deal :)
How it works: You have to spend a min of $50, so you are really paying $30 worth of food. If you don't drink booze, you can get an app, two entrees and a dessert for about $52.00 + tip. So meeting the min isn't hard. 

I had the Mango Guacamole, which I loved but It was REALLY spicy. I was actually almost crying at one point. 

Free Chips/Salsa

Salomon entree. Amazing

A bite of their vegetarian ques. AWESOME!

Dessert Nachos... Meh, skip these. They weren't great. 

The service: Really sweet girl 
The atmosphere: VERY casual. They had a live group of men playing music. 
The food quality: Extremely fresh and it came out quickly despite them being totally busy. It was a great meal! If you dont love Mexican food, still try this place. They also have a vegan menu. Its good for Vegetarians as well.
