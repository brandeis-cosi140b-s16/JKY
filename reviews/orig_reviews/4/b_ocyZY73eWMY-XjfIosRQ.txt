Ordered takeout from here the other night and I was impressed.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We added a change to our takeout order when we got there and they quickly fixed us up.  They have a cool outside area that seems like it would be fun to hand out and have a beer and a taco when they get it all finished up.

My Bean Burrito "Terry's Style"  was really good,t hey have very good tortillas and they have excellent guacamole.

I'll be back by when I am on that side of town.

Try:

- Bean Burrito "Terry's Style"
- Chips and Guacamole
