I'm sitting here just perplexed! I cant believe I haven't Yelped about Chino until now! Ive been coming here for years and years since its so close to my work.. what have I been smoking?! 

I don't have much to add but this.. chile relleno burrito.. you've never had a gut bomb until you've tried this one! Cheese stuffed into a green chile.. battered in crumbs then deep fried until hot and crispy then it's wrapped into a tortilla with more melted cheese.. who knew you could pack so much goodness into a burrito?! Mmm, goodness!
