Man, after an hour of walking the Strip checking out the freaks, whores, scammers and fat tourists like myself these tasty little devils hit the spot. Tried the asada, carnitas and al pastor tacos and all were good. Typical street taco tortilla filled with some way savory and succulent meats. Would've awarded 5 stars if they were $1 instead of $2. I am the taco terminator and yes homie....."I will be back".
