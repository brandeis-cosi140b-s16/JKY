After driving up to Scottsdale to see the Roald Amundsen Railroad car used in FDR's funeral, I got out my trusty Droid and Yelped the area for restaurants. The Spotted Donkey's reviews caught my attention.

 How could I not like a place that has photos of donkeys and burros all over??

The shrimp tacos for $13 were delicious and attractively presented on a long white plate. It looked beautiful. (photo included). 
HOWEVER, my partner said if she had to choose between this dish and La Salsa's Baja Shrimp Tacos, a lot less costly and just as tasty, she'd stick with La Salsa. 

The cheese enchiladas and salad with salsa/guacamole were outstanding. I was very full by the time I had polished THAT off.

Only a couple observations: They charge you an extra $5 for salsa and chips. Wish they would include it with the meal.

I was seated at a table that had a halogen spotlight that was boring down on me....all the while the AC was blowing cold air down on the table. I changed seats and all was well.

Our servers were polite and attentive and overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience....just real different from what we love in South Tucson.
