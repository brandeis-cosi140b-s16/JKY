Another solid Fox Restaurant Concepts establishment.  The FRC has developed a winning formula for differently themed restaurants.  Blanco is the Mexican outpost for this group.  Is the food authentic? No, but the food is good and I have never been let down from the numerous items we have had.  The chorizo, green chile and tomato cheese crisp rocks!  They also make a mean michelada...think bloody mary with lime juice replacing the lemon and a fine Mexican lager replacing the vodka.
