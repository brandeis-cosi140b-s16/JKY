Being from Denver and all the outstanding mexican food there and the short trip to sante fe nm. I am quite familiar with really good mexican and new mexican food, Carlitos was a welcoming surprise, tastes like i am home and the portions are enough for 2-3 people. Red or green chile, carnitas.....you name frito pie, wow..awesome...
