After seeing this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives I wanted to check it out and boy am I glad I did. I have been there several times for brunch on the weekends for the chicken-scrambled egg chiliaquiles and a breakfast burrito. Now the fact that you can have a margarita for breakfast on the weekend is great and the food is good. Friendly and fast service makes it better. Totally worth checking out.
