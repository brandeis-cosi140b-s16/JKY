This is probably my 5th time here. Ive had a good experience each time. But obviously some servers are going to better than others. Most are decent. I love the BBQ rib appetizer- its very tender, delicious and falls right off the bone!! Do NOT eat directly over your pants or you might have a BBQ stain on your jeans. Ha ha they have tacos, margaritas and pineapple infused tequila shots! Definitely a good place for some fun!
