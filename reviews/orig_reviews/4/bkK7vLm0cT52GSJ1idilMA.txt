Tortilla soup and the golden tacos (tacos dorados) are really good. We had lunch here and the food and service were really good. From the moment you walk in you feel the good vibes. Also, the chips and salsa are delicious and food is authentic Mexican I just wished they had the Mexican soft drinks like horchata.
