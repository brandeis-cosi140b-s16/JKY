Okay.    This is an update to my prior review.   Either I don't care for their "southwestern" food, or it's just not that good, but this time I tried the beef tenderloin served over pasta.    YUMMMM!! is all I have to say for the meat.    It was tender and flavorful.    Tender in that it did not have that strange consistency of beef that was of lower quality and tough, therefore, "tenderized" with I-have-no-idea what, which makes me wonder what it would do to my insides after I ate it.  Anyway, back to the review.   The pasta was not of the white, bleached to near non edible that most pasta is now days.    And it was cooked to oh, so slightly al dente.     Of course, the flavoring for the pasta was just about perfect as well.     I topped it off with a couple of glasses of their zinfandel.    I don't remember the vineyard.    I just remember it was #27 on the wine list.    My companion had some sort of chicken skewers with beans and rice.    I've had the chicken skewers before.   And beans and rice on the side is not something I'd write home about.   So I didn't taste it.     He seemed to like it so I guess that's all that counts.
