Friday night dinner with coworker.  We got seated at the front rail with a great view of the south Las Vegas blvd. The waiters was friendly and very helpful with ordering.  The food was typical Mexican fare with strong margaritas and an assortment of Mexican beers.  We had a great time and would comeback and recommend this to new visitors for the view drinks and food.  Check this place out. YELP SPECIAL.
