I stopped in for lunch with a girlfriend and the customer service and food were both equally great. We were greeted and sat right away. 

Our server was friendly, funny and made sure our chip bowls and water glasses were full. 

I ordered a combination plate with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada and both were really tasty. The taco had a large amount of shredded chicken in a crispy shell. Both of the tortillas were fresh as we could see a woman making them behind a glass window inside the restaurant.

My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and a huge portion was served on a sizzling plate. Equal portions of chicken and tons of veggies along side guacamole, salsa, beans, rice and fresh warm tortillas.

We were able to enjoy chatting and eating without feeling rushed or concerned that our food was taking too long as it came out fast!
