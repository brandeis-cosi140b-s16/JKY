It was a full house on Friday, but we snuck into a table, avoiding the hostess desk. Had a nice waiter who gave us free chips and salsa (the green is better) and then we tried the something off the $6 app menu. We had the taquitos, chicken, not beef, but the fact that only three of them come with an order is kind of a ripoff, especially when you are sharing. Basically, you gotta let you date have two and you are left starving after one measly taquito. Anyway, the beers are still three bucks and she had a glass of wine and champagne, both were five bucks. It's a madhouse on Friday and a decent people watching place, but a bigger bang for my happy hour buck is needed.
