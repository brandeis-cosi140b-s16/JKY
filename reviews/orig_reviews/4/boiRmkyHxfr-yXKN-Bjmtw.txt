Fun place to grab drinks in a prime location!
We went with the tequila flight as well as a pitcher and both were fantastic!
The service was great, knew everything about the tequila and made it into a real tasting, very nice experience. They have happy hour and specials going on, as well as all you can drink at brunch on the weekends.
The decor is great, they have a small outdoor seating area as well as tons of seating indoors.
Great stop while on the Strip.
