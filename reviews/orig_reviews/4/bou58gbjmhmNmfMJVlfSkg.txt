Pricey, but tasty! I love the guac and the enchiladas. Last time I was there I also had a pretty good margarita. I would eat at Vida more and give it 5 stars if it was a bit more reasonably priced. Last time I was there the host was a little snooty about my group not having a reservation even though the restaurant wasn't very busy.
