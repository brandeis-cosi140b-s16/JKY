Love Macayo's!  

Great food that is very consistent. Perfect chips. Creamy guacamole. 

Friendly service focused team!  Anthony, Jenny, and Chris all helped us enjoy our meal. 

Terrific menu with many options. 

There are a ton booths, but they are very worn out. 

The silverware is very cheap and thin. Be sure to use a knife rather than cutting with your fork. 

Love that it is a local Arizona family company.
