My wife and I love the food here.  The place is old, a bit run down looking, and I guess that is another reason we like it so much.  It feels just so authentic.  We split the fajitas often, and I really like the tacos, cheese enchiladas, guacamole and nearly everything else we have had.  The cheese crisp with guacamole on the side is crazy good.  Nothing like great tortillas to make everything taste good.
