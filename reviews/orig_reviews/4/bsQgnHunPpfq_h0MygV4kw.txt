This is stuff that is hard to get in SF.  On a business trip to Phoenix, I had the pleasure to try some truly good Southwest cooking.  For SF, it would be considered a true hole-in-the-wall.

Had the blackened cat fish and it was delicious.  Everyone in the party enjoyed their meal.  Nice local ambiance and yes there is smoking in the restaurant.

Would definitely go back.
