I love Cafe Rio and this particular restaurant is a lot closer to my house than the Eastern one.  It is also quite a bit bigger with a lot more room for parking.  And it's right next to Total Wine so you can get some delicious Mexican food while you are shopping for booze.

The service at this Rio was fast and friendly.  From time the of ordering to paying, I think it was about 3 minutes.  Everyone on the line was very nice and said hello.  I like good service, even at a fast food type of joint.  

The food was great just like at other Rios and it really hit the spot.  The tortillas at these places are just plain delicious!  I've already raved about the Sweet Pork Barbacoa and if you haven't tried it, you must!  The chips and guacamole were delicious as well and there was a ton of them.  Great deal for the price.  This is a nice in between restaurant if you don't feel like Taco Bell but don't really want to go to a sit down place.
