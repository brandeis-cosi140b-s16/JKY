This is my favorite Cafe Rio in LV. I was a little bummed today when I got a free meal and I didn't get my free meal call (which isn't a big deal) I jokingly said "awwww no free meal call?" (With a big smile on my face I was totally kidding too) the girl behind the counter says with an attitude "you really want one of those?" Then proceeds to roll her eyes. Everyone else was friendly and the good here is always great. I would've given it a five if it wasn't for the cashier.
