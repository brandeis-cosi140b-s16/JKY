I was dubious about a taco shop inside of a gas station, but, whoo boy!, I was surprised.  The place was extremely clean and the staff was friendly.  

But what takes the cake is the food.  I had their carnitas burrito.  It was stuffed with meat, beans, rice, guac and salsa.  The tortilla was warm and tasted like it was handmade; there was a perfect amount of rice in the burrito that it did not seem as though they were trying to save money by making a burrito made with filler.  

I will be back.
