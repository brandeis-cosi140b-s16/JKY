Cantina 1511 is one of my 'go-to' Mexican spots. I actually liked their old location on East Blvd much better ... the ambiance and decor made the whole experience better for me. I think there is more seating now though ... so shorter wait times trump the mediocre decor. 

Went back for my second trip to the new location this passed weekend ... make a reservation and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. On a crazy business Friday night at 7:30 ... i'm tottaly oaky with this. Our server knew his stuff, and our glasses were never empty. 

Chip and salsa are good, nothing extraordinary. Ordered the Crab & Goat Cheese Croquetas and was very impressed. I can't bring my self to ever try anything but the tacos for me entree, because they're so damn good. The Marco Polo taco never fails to disappoint (must be the jalapeno bacon!). I'll definitely be back again.
