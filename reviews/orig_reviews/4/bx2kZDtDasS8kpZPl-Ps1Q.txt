Saturday night dinner here at Yolo's only had us waiting about twenty minutes.

Typical mexican restaurant fair with street tacos, burritos and even gaucho steak.

Hubs got the gaucho streak which was ginormous.  He didn't speak much during dinner, so I know it was that good!

I got the grilled mahi mahi street tacos with a side of black beans, guacamole and pico de gallo.  It was ok.  They had this spicy mango salsa that complemented the fish just right.
