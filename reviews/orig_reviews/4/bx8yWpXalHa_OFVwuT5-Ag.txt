This place isn't bad. It's not the pinnacle of Mexican food, nor is it formal dining. It's just there, family owned and operated. My fiancee and I are regulars and after going there with her parents enough times they are now regulars too. 

My dad used to take me here a lot as a kid, 20+ years ago. So that has to say something if they've hung in there that long. Don't expect healthy cuisine, but then again that's not what I go here for. It's just regular, home cooked Mexican. Joanne (runs the kitchen to my knowledge & is the owner/co-owner) makes some mean grub. It hits the spot just right when you want some thing without paying over the top.

And please, if anyone else reviews this, don't dare compare it to a crappy chain like Chili's, this is way more authentic. This place is well above the par in food quality compared to these places. They are consistent too, which is hard to find sometimes. 

Pros: 
Cost is good, food is good, salsa is awesome. I particularly recommend the tacos, red mix burro and Gollo burro. The rice is good and the beans are pretty solid too. It is greasy, but that's okay with me. 

Cons: 
Kids. Lots of them sometimes, but what do you expect from a family oriented restaurant. Get there early Friday and Saturday nights, they are usually pretty full and it's not a huge restaurant.
