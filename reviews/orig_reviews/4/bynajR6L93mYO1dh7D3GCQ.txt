We followed the Yelp reviews to this place for a Sunday afternoon lunch. We were really pleased with the quality of the food and the amazing flavors they used in creating their dishes. If you're looking for massive burros for $5, you won't be happy here. If you're looking for creative dishes where you're disappointed you have arrived at the last bite and looking for more, then give them a try. I had outstanding skirt steak taco and my wife had the arepas. She is from Costa Rica, and she was impressed.
