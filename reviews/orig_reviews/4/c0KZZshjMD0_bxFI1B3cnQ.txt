I absolutely love this restaurant! I also get the Enchiladas Verde. Comes with fresh avocado and rice and beans. Such a fun spot to grab a quick lunch or have drinks wish friends! 

The only reason for the 4 stars is the location. It isn't far down Central but it isn't in the best of shopping centers.
