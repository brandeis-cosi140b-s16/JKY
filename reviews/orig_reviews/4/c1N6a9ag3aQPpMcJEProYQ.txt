This place is near, and I haven't been in til recently when one of my disabled vet friends suggested we go. 
I got the adobada burrito. ABSOLUTELY YUM.
They have the traditional "berto's" red sauce, all you can squirt!
They also have green sauce, pico and a chunky carrot/jalapeno/thai pepper (that one is 60 cents  but the others are free).
My burrito was a shave under 4 bucks WITH TAX!
It's a deal, Bob! 
The burritos totally hit the spot!!
The chile relleno burrito is a total champ that's done properly --- get it here, NOT at Super Burrito.
Value and taste are excellent and of course the burritos are piping hot and will survive the drive home. If you do the drive through and ask for the red sauce, ask for about 4 because the containers are small. Service is very fast.
I have returned there several times since but I don't have much more to say about the place other than it's better than any-berto's.
