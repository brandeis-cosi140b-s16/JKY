Don't let the appearance of this place put you off.  You'll know what I mean if it's your first trip.  The exterior (and for that matter, the interior) looks like a combination truck stop / diner.  However, just walk in the front door and prepare for very friendly service and very good Mexican food in a very clean environment.  Very casual, you'll probably seat yourself.  Start off with chips and very good, fresh salsa.  Margaritas are tasty.  We always start with the albondigas soup.  Crumble some tortillas in it and you're set!   I like the ground beef taco and chili relleno combo plate (comes with beans and rice).  The carnitas enchilada is also good.   Service will fall over themselves to help you.  Sometimes on a Friday night you might have to wait just a few minutes.  It's popular, but they seem to turn tables quickly.   Lots of return customers.  The young lady in the front will greet repeaters.  It's a fun place, and the food here actually has some FLAVOR, as opposed to something like Lindo Michoacan, which in my opinion is just almost flavorless!
