As long as you're not expecting Tex-Mex cuisine, Cantina Laredo works- menu has Mexican food staples like tacos, enchiladas, and nachos, but with a pretentious Tivoli Village location and upscale decor. Luckily the service is better here than other spots in the shopping center!

Placing an order for pickup was quick and painless- the 15 minute estimate was right on time, and as I waited the bartender made light conversation and offered drinks. They have a ginger-citrus concoction on special that I want to come back for.

The spinach enchilada is tasty- get over the fact that you're paying $10 for a single vegetarian enchilada, because this one is large and tastes really good. The cream sauce on top is obviously not vegan, and is a lot richer than most "vegetarian" menu items. But I'd get it again! The tortilla soup was just okay, but not something that stood out to me.

Location is nice, they have outdoor seating available for nice weather- not clear on whether they have a HH, but their tasty food and personable service will keep them in my lunch rotation.
