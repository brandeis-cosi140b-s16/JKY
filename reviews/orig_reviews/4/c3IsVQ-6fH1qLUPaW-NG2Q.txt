Great hidden Mexican joint.  We stopped in for a quick lunch on a Monday afternoon... We must have just missed the lunch crowd because the place wasn't busy.  We sat outside and I was a little worried it would be to warm but the outside patio had plenty of shade and was very comfortable.  Service was quick and friendly.  I got the carne asada burrito and it was some of the best carne asada I've had...the refried beans and rice that came with it were pretty good too.  The wife got the shrimp burrito enchilada style and she raved about it.  I'm definitely going back and would like to see what its like on the weekend at night
