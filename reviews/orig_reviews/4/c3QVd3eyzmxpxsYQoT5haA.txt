I freakin LOVE this place! Try the portabello mushroom mulitas - decadent and delicious!!!! Not too expensive either (for Vegas prices) and the food is so good that any costs are well worth it. I saw a bloody mary with chile infused vodka on the menu that I must try next time!! Great atmosphere, good chips & salsa and friendly waitstaff. I highly recommend!
