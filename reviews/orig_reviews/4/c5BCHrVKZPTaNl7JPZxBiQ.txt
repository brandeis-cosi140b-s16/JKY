Defintely will be visiting this place again!! Followed fellow yelpers there and is did not disappoint. Great fresh burgers at good prices. Any place that offers FAT or skinny fries is good in my book. I need to try those Chencho fries next, they look good. Only drawback is its on the opposite side of town and is really small.
