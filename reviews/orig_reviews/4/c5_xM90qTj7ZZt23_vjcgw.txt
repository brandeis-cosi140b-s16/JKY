How have I not reviewed this place? This one slipped through the cracks! 

Had the classic cheeseburger (a.k.a. "The Stand") and fries with a bottled water. The burger was cooked as ordered, and the fries were very tasty.  The staff was extremely friendly here and the place lives up to it's name with an old school ambiance and vibe.

After much deliberation and debate, I regretted not ordering a shake with my meal, and opted to get one on the way out.  They were quick to get it going for me and put it in a to-go cup for the road. I actually had to wait a bit to drink it cause it was too thick for the straw! 

We sat outside to enjoy the patio. It's a closed in area, but nice and clean. 

Overall: A
A classic diner vibe, burgers, fries and shakes and such.
