Really good food and the atmosphere is even better. Don't come here if you want a nice quiet dinner. If you want a festive evening with fiesta flavors in your mouth as well this is the place. We ordered enchiladas, a chicken dish I forget the name and an appetizer item(pic uploaded). All were great. Chips salsa and bean dip were very good as well. Service was spectacular even when they were super busy on a Saturday night. What more can you ask for from a Mexican restaurant?? Thank you lindo for being here.
