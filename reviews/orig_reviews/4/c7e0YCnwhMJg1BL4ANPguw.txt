The lines alone should show you how amazing the food is at this restaurant! My family loves to eat here. The food comes out and is served in a styrofoam containers which is a let down but do not let that fool you, because the taste is spicy! They have amazing different salsas to taste as well. Do not pass up on desert either, they have the best!
