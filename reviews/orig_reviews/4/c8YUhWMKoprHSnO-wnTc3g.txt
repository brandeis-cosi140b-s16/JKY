Been here a few times now and the food never disappoints. The fish, chicken or carne asada taco is a great choice as is the shrimp nachos. But if your looking for something really special go with the Filet mignon nachos, they are a real treat. Also tequila Tuesday are great, gives you a chance to try all kinds of different tequilas. Service is good, but not always consistent. Most of the servers are great but like anywhere there are always a few that throw the others off. Over all I really like this place and look forward to the next visit!
