Very cute authentic Mexican restaurant downtown Las Vegas. Stopped in for lunch with my sister after a little shopping on Main street. The hostess was very attentive and helpful. Wait time for a booth was less than 5minutes. The only reason why I am not giving my usual 5 stars, is that we had to ask for beverages, which took way too long, and we than had to ask for a waiter, as no one welcomed us as we had been seated for at least 10minutes. I'm sure they were busy, very understandable on a Saturday afternoon.
Menu is way too long! Too many things to choose from! 
But what we did order was very tasty and delicious. So, it was worth the wait. 
Would I go back? Oh yes, for sure! It was a fabulous lunch with great conversation and food.
