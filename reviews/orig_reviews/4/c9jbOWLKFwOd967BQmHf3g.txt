I have been going to Chino a few times a month for about a year. In that year, the place has gotten cleaner, and the food has gotten better. The staff is just as nice, and prices are still the same. 

Many of the 1 star reviews say that the place was a "shit hole" and dirty. This is true, it is a dive. And with dives you get a dirty shit hole. However, in the last year they have really turned around the cleanliness. So if you think it's dirty, then you would have been appalled last year.

Their food is good. Good. Watch Guy during DDD. He isn't as ecstatic as he usually is. That's because the food is good. You can get good Mexican food anywhere, and great Mexican is easy to find. You can get good Chinese food anywhere, and great is easy to find as well. But you can't get good Chinese, Mexican, Cuban, Jamaican fusion anywhere.

Seriously, the jerk fried rice here would put the cast of Cool Runnings into a nostalgic food coma. 

But sadly, even though the staff is excellent, the place is cleaner, and the fusion unique, the food is just, good. Some things can be bland (emerald chicken, white rice) and other things can be amazing (ruby chicken, black beans), but it's not all the best of its kind.

To really get the most out of the place, you need to try a few different meals. Find your combo and make it as unique as you. This place, while not Gusteau's, but it has it's charm. It is worth trying a few times, even if your first experience was bad.

On one last note, I am not saying anything about the menu other than get help from the great staff, it's freaking confusing at first.

Eat on!
