The food is above average and the location is great.  One of the best places to eat in downtown Tempe.  

I have come a handful of times over the past six months or so for business and it is always busy.  Sometimes too busy and loud for a business lunch.  Good ambiance to the place.  As mentioned, it has patio dining.
