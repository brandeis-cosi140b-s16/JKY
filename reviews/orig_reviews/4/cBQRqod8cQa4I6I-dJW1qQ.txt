Oh hell yes. Finally ventured over to Three Amigos, why haven't I been here before? It's magnificent. 

Vegetable tacos, howwwww do they get zucchinis so flavorful? HOW? And serving each taco in two corn tortillas? Amigo, you're talking my language, and that's the language of love. Rice and beans are good too, not just fillers to be looked over. The enchiladas al hormo were topped with an unbelievable avocado/cilantro sauce that I could not get enough of. The amount of food they serve for the price, fantastico. 

Also, they serve the best orchata I've had outside of California. For serious. I want to come back, every day.
