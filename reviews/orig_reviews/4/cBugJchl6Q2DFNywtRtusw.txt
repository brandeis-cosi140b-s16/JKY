Once again my love of Top Chef (masters) drove me to give this place a try. The food is on the more expensive side but we had a deal so it ended up being a great value. We went on a Friday night and was surprised to find only a few occupied tables. The hostess was very friendly and pretty much let us choose our table. She did, however, recommended sitting poolside and in hindsight I think the upstairs patio would have had better ambiance. Nevertheless it was still beautiful and extremely peaceful. The sangria was refreshing and added to the mood. For dinner I ordered the grilled fish tacos with avocado crema. The fish was delicious; very light and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the green rice but it was fine because the meal was also served with a tomato rice. I wouldn't say there was anything extraordinary about this restaurant but I enjoyed my meal and left completely satisfied.
