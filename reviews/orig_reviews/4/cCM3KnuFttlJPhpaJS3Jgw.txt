OMG did we drive a long ass time before we stumbled upon this place! I always wondered what Irish-Mexican food was like. Tired of driving, my mom gave the ok and I parked. One side was a bar and the other side was a restaurant. Relieved of that b/c didn't feel like having my mom dine with me in the middle of the bar. Awkward! Anyway, they had boucey, happy Hispanic men serving. Mom ordered the Shrimp fajitas, which came NOT sizzling (bummer). I ordered the black bean soup, came with a huge dallop of Daisy; and Mexican Pizza.. delish! It was a crispy flour tortilla with seasoned fajita chicken chunks and tons of onions and peppers. More dallops of Daisy please!!! Flan was to die for!

I didn't see any Irish food on the menu. I guess Carlos runs the restaurant; and Mr. Obrien covers the bar?? Lol. I was expecting corned beef hash burritos or something.
