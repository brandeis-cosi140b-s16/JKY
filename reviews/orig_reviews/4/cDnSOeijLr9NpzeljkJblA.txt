After coming here for the wonderful elite event, I finally made it back with a friend for happy hour. We got a couple drinks, a couple tacos, the green chili pork with chips, and the huitllacoche quesadilla. The tacos were tasty, but a little dry, and maybe not the most exciting tacos, but good. We were not fans of the quesadilla... not sure if that had to do with neither of us having had huitlacoche before, so I can't hold that against Barrio. The green chili pork made up for any other shortcomings.... this stuff was sooo delicious, savory, maybe slightly spicy, falling apart meat, cheese... it was great. It was even great the next day as leftover after sitting in my car for a couple hours... that's pretty impressive stuff. Prices at hh were reasonable. I'll be back!
