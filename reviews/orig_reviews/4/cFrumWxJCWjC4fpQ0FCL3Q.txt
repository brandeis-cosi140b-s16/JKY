I would give 5 stars but the service was a little off. The only thing I didn't like was the cramped seating. While I understand that the place is busy, it was difficult to enjoy the dinner when I had to keep moving to allow the people next to me to get up and down.

I loved the food, it was perfect. The tacos were awesome and the Guacamole was above what I could dream of. The flavors in everything were so alive. This has to be one of the best places in Scottsdale.
