Two words people...HAPPY HOUR.  Husband enjoyed two margaritas for just two bucks each.  My iced tea was 3.99.  Now who got the better deal?  Seriously, they were GOOD margaritas, and not chintzy on the booze.

  Can't attest to any food, but our stop-in-and-get-a-great-drink-deal experience was a very good one.  Bartender was very friendly!
