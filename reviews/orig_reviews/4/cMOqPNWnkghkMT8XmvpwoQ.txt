I had a great meal here. Hostess was sweet, our server Bria?, was great. Love the margaritas, chilaquiles, tacos. The mexican food was on point. I will say that I thought the shu mai was a bit on the salty side, even without the soy based sauce - the one hazard of Jose Andres' food, but I love salt so it's ok. Dian Dian noodles ( spicy ground pork with peanut chile suase) didnt really do it for me personally. We did the cajeta flan and tres lychees for desert. Love the play on the name, but really couldnt have a second bite of the cake. Will  definitely go again, try out some more small plates
