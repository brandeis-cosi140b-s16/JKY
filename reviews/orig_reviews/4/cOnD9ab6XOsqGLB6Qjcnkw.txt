One of my fave places to get my Mexican food fix when I was living out in Charlotte back in 07-08. My roomie and I loved their tacos and salsa bar. I always got chicken and steak tacos...yummers.
I remember it being kinda dark inside so I always opted for the cute little patio tables outside to sit and enjoy the fresh air and nice weather.
I think about this place whenever I get nostalgia for Charlotte.
