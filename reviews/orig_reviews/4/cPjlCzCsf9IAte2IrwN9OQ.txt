One of the things I miss most about living in Litchfield Park is being able to pop into Old Pueblo for some delicious Mexican food.  I usually stuck with the two crispy tacos which always came out piping hot and stuffed full of meat and cheese.  Their goat cheese quesadilla is pretty legit too.  

If you're craving Mexican and are in the area, it's a great place to stop!
