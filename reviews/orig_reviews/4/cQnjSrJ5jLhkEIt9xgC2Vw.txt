This restaurant is close to my office, so we go for lunch at least once a month.  I love that it's bright, with great modern decor, and the seating is comfortable.  Service is always very good.  The prices and portions are a average for the area.  The cuisine is a twist on Sonoron, but nothing extraordinary.
