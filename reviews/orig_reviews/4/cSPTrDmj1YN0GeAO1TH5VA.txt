I went to Rosita's place for the first time to celebrate national tequila day, most excellent! I have never noticed this restaurant, let alone eaten here before. The restaurant is a bit odd, with the waitresses wearing little costumes (I am surprised this is still a thing anywhere). The food, however was pretty tasty. I tried the horchata with booze... very sweet and delicious. Their margs are fairly standard, but large. For food, I had their wonderfully delicious cheese crisp (and trust me, I've had some bad cheese crisps elsewhere, it is possible) and a combo which included a taco and an enchilada. The taco was nothing special, but the enchiladas were tasty and had a nice spicy sauce on top. Portions were large and prices were small, can't complain about that. My friend got the carnitas burrito, which she didn't really love ( I didn't try it, so I can't really comment). I would definitely return here.
