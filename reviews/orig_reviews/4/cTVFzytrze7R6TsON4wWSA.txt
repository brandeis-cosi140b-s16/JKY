First time in for dinner before my sisters graduation. I really enjoyed the decor. The burrito I ordered was surprisingly larger than I expected although it was pretty difficult to eat but a fork helped with that. Only complaint really is the tight space and the music was way too loud. Almost had to yell across the table. Otherwise good, I'll be back at some point to try some tacos.
