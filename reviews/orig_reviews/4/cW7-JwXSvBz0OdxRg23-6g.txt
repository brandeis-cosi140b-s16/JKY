We tried Nacho daddy for the first time because we had a Groupon. Our server was nice although service was kind of slow for lunch time. I had gringos tacos 1 chicken and 1 beef they were pretty good the only thing I didn't like was that they use cheese queso instead of shredded cheese. It sucks that chips and salsa are extra we are used to eating at Juans flaming fajitas and chips and salsa are included not to mention soup is also included. I don't eat beans so I did not have them I only had the rice and it left a lot to be desired I had to cover it in salsa. The rest of the menu looks pretty decent so I'm sure we'll be back to try it again.
