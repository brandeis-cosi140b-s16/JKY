Looking for a quick, healthy and delicious meal? You can not go wrong with Braddah's.

Never eaten here before? The staff is super pumped to let you taste test the various meats, sauces and sides that they have. 

You can build your own bowl, burrito or whatever else your fantabulous mind can concoct with the fresh supply of beautiful ingredients made in-house everyday. You can most certainly tell this place has some Hawaiian influence and packs a flavor punch straight to your brain that you may feel all the way down to your toes. So wear flip-flops.

Oh and do yourself a favor... Get the damn Coconut Bark. Holy moly! That stuff could do anything from fight a poltergeist, save a failing marriage, straighten curly hair and even make your man put the toilet seat down for a year.
