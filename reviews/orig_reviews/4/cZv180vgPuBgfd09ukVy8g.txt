I was really, really impressed with this place. We walked in on our way back from north-mid strip to the Luxor for a bite to eat in the midafternoon. It appeared to be a really basic hotel type restaurant -- mediocre food for a high price. But we were hungry and had 4.5 hours until our 9pm dinner reservations. We just needed a snack.

The chips and salsa were really good (the chips came out so hot it hurt a little to eat them at first), the guacamole was good, and both the ceviche was good and the taquitos were fine. My girlfriend claims that her strawberry margarita was the best she has ever had. They use real fruit to make their fruit margaritas, so I suppose it's not all that surprising.

The prices were perfectly reasonable.  Vegas' latest trend appears to be the "sexy" mexican restaurant. This was not that, but it was tasty... surprisngly so.
