I'm convinced this place has THE best margaritas in Phoenix. I came here with some coworkers for happy hour once and discovered their amazing grapefruit margaritas. Then a few weeks later I went back for dinner and got their veggie quesadilla which was insanely good. Actually, it got really busy while we were there and our orders got misplaced so we waited about 30 minutes to get our food. We weren't in any sort of rush, so it was fine, but the server actually comped our meals which was unexpected, but totally awesome.

Be warned this place is TINY so if you've got a big group, prepare to wait. But trust me it's worth it. They also have a salsa bar in the back - my favorite was the pecan. Amazing.
