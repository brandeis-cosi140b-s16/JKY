We had the pleasure of dining here Wednesday night for a birthday dinner. The outside does not due the place justice. The interior is well decorated and has a great ambiance. The service was great, our waiter was very attentive and they removed plates very promptly. 

Regarding the eats, the rainbow chips and chipotle salsa was really good. I had the chorizo stuffed chicken and it was very flavorful. We also had the seafood quesadilla and the lobster enchilada. The quesadilla was delicious but the lobster enchilada was a little on the sweet side. For desert we had the sophapillas. They were so light and fluffy, one of my favorites. 

I will definitely make my way back soon.
