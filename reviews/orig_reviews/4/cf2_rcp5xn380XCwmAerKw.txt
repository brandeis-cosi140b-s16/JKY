Ever since I saw their sandwich featured on the Travel Channel, I have been wanting to try it.  Our recent trip to Phoenix finally made that happen.  My family got there before noon on a Sunday and we did not wait long.  On our way out there was a big crowd waiting so we were fortunate enough to have been seated in less than 10 minutes.  I have seen good reviews on their Aguas Frescas so we decided to try the Lime and Cantaloupe.  Both were very good and very refreshing, the lime reminded me of a lemonade slush.  We had the Queso Fundido with chorizo for appetizer, it came with chips, flour tortilla and pico de gallo and it was delicious.  The queso had the right amount of chorizo, a little greasy but that is expected from chorizo.  We ordered the Del Rey and Milanesa de pollo torta. The sandwiches were huge so half order per person was the perfect portion for us. The Milanesa de pollo was just ok but the Del Rey I really liked.  Avocado, chorizo, breaded beef, pork, ham, hot dog, omelet, refried beans and cheese all in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and there were so many different flavors going on.  It was great meal overall!
