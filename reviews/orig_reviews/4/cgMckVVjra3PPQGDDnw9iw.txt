If my friend hadn't suggested we eat here, I don't think I ever would've known to or wanted to try this place out, especially since it's located so far off the strip. The place is located in a small mall, where the you have to either make a turn in advance or make a U-turn, and to be honest, I was kinda "eh" about the place when we pulled up to the restaurant. Once I walked in though, the food smelled SO GOOD! and the workers were so nice and patient with our large group. They were so nice and very accommodating to us, which allowed me to have a great first impression of this restaurant and forget about their slightly tacky Asian themed business sign out front.

They have fusion items on their menu, and they have strictly Korean or Mexican. I tried their Bulgogi Cheesesteak with fries and despite how messy it was to eat, it tasted delicious! We also got Bulgogi Fries to share, which tasted alright to me, but in my opinion, it wasn't anything to die for. I like how you can request to add kimchi to any item we order. I should've added that in to my sandwich!

All in all, food was good, price was right, service was awesome :) I think I'd come back if I'm in the area!
