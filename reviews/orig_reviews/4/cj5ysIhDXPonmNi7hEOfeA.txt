The Spotted Donkey is a great restaurant at el Pedregal at The Boulders.  One of the most scenic patios in the Valley of the Sun with top notch cuisine.  Great margaritas and ice cold Negra Modelo (yum). We started with the shrimp ceviche that was cool and refreshing, filled with flavors of pineapple, red onion, jalapeno, shrimp and lime juice.  For dinner I had the Pork Tenderloin served over green chile mac-n-cheese.  It was wonderful and bountiful serving so I was able to bring some home for lunch today.  Great for date night, lunch or with the family.  Chef Esteban serves up his delicious versions of mexican favorites.
