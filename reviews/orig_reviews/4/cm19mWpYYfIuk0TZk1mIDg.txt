The first time I tried it on the strip I wasn't a fan because the food was somewhat cold and I tried the carne Asada fries and tacos. I am definitely not a fan of the carne Asada here. However, gave it a second go, and I tried the adobada. It was reallllly good.

Here's my second time in Vegas with my BF and we ate here twice. Ordering a whole bunch of adobada tacos. Their sauce is really good. 

One thing I hate is how packed it gets and having to swoop up on a table as soon as someone leaves. Thank goodness the nice ladies clean the table as soon as they can :)
