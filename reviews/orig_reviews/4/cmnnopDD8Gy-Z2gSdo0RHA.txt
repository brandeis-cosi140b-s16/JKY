It is said the chimichanga was invented at this spot. Full-on bar and dance floor, banquet rooms, and large dining areas. 

I cannot believe after several years of yelp*ing and many more than that Macayo'ing I've never written a review for Macayo Numero Uno.  

I like Macayo's.  Like an errant Military Macaw seeking the colpa of Cambopata, I peregrinate across the valley, West and globe, always returning for chips and salsa I hunger for, the dishes I love to eat, and in times of fat billfold and lack of will, the Chicken Poblano.  

Yes, we fly off to other eateries, Sonoran and otherwise, but always returns to this traditional spot where the family has dined and occasionally drunk for more than five decades.  

I think there's a half Macayo burrito in the fridge now, waiting for a microwave and a lunch....

So fly my friends, fly.  The food is time-tested, the service good, the Macayo's experience repeated across our valley and on to Las Vegas.  There are vegetarian entrees, old standards, and occasional new seasonal menu items.  And remember, the climate is warming and every degree over 100 means you get a percent off.  Macayo's #1 on Central is the hottest one around.
