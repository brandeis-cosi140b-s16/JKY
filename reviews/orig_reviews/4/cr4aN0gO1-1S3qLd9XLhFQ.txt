I have been to Cowfish which is nextz to Chuy's many time before. Each time I have said that next time I would go to Chuy's and this time I finally did. 

I loved the decor of the place. It has a relaxed feel to it and reminds me of home, California. Our waiter introduced , shortly after we sat down. And before I could look up we had water along with Chips and Salsa. The chips are great. Freash, crips, light and not greasy. Perfect. They make the tortillas by hand at their tortilla station so how could u go wron:on he chips. We ordered the Queso which was a little spicy for me but I enjoyed the flavor that I couldn't stop eating it. I had a Texas Martini to go with it. It would have neen oerfect but it had a little too much lime in it for my liking which left a little bitter rasye in my mouth.  I ordered the steak burrito which has a very spicy sauce on top of it but our waiter saw that thr queso was a little too much for me so he suggested anotherbsauce for me that was mild and complimented the dish very well. Iy was sooooo good. I had the refried bean with it, which taste like yhey make that as well. 

This place serves delicious food for reasonable prices. I will definitely return to Chuy's again and again.
