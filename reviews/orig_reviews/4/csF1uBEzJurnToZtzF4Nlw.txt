Mi lindo Michoacan es muy lindo.

Where else can you get an amazing view of Las Vegas as well as rich and authentic Mexican cuisine? Border Grill probably... But look no further because you have arrived!

There's nothing bad to say about this establishment. I enjoyed the food which consisted of Enchiladas, rice and beans. A bit costly to have in a weekly base - bi-monthly is more feasible.

For a true Mexican experience, I recommend having the mariachi play a couple of traditional Mexican corridos (powerful narratives/ballads). For a truer Mexican experience, I recommend 3+ shots of tequila. For a truer-er Mexican experience, I recommend making friends with a Mexican and have his/her grandma cook for you.
