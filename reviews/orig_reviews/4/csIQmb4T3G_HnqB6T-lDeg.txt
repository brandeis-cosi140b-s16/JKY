Food was delicious, service was even better. Lots of choices on the very clean salsa bar and not any petty charges for extras like guacamole or sour cream. I had the 4 street taco plate so I could try a variety of meat choices. The meats were quality, no fat or chewy pieces, all melt in your mouth tender! I will be back! Thanks, Chris, for your hospitality!
