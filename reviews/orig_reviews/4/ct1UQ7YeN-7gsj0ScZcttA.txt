Experience:  I had a groupon that included chips and guacamole, 6 tacos and two sides, so I brought my girl to check it out. 
We actually hit it during happy hour too, so our beer was a very reasonable price too!

Service: we waited for a few minutes before anyone greeted us at the door.  The owner or manager finally came over and seated us. 
He did apologize for the wait too. 
Our waitress was ok...she was nice enough, just not very attentive. She was pretty busy, so it wasn't the best service. I'm reasonable about being busy, but when your waitress is the only one in the restaurant and she's too busy, that makes me think it's poor management. 

Food: the guacamole and chips were good. I ordered the fish taco, shrimp taco and the crunchy taco that has mashed potatoes in it, and the cilantro rice for my side. 
My fav was definitely the fish taco. The other two were good, but the fish taco was great!  
I ordered a Tecate, but they serve it in a can. I sent it back, because I'm not a fan of canned beer. I feel like the waitress should have warned me. 
So, then I ordered a grey lady beer, and it was actually very good.  It was a witbier or white beer. It's my first time trying it and I was impressed. Nice and light and even a little citrusy flavor....perfect because I did not want to fill up on beer. 

Facility: this is a cute little casual spot with some outdoor seating too. Would be great to sit outside in nice weather during happy hour for cheap beer and $2 tacos!

Overall review: I am going to give this a 4 star, because of the lacking service. However, I do see me returning to this spot for more tacos and beer!
