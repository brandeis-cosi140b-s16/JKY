Would rate tacos at a B+, super tasty but alright for the value; rating the ambiance a A though, love the backyard space; staff has been probably a B+/A-, can't say I remember much about them being overly outgoing but I don't recall ever feeling displeased either. Been here a few times with friends. Love the overall feel of the place. :)
