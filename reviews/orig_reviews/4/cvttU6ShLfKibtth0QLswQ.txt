On my way to see pops, had some extra time and had lunch here. I ordered their steak fajitas! Since wife hates this dish!(the smell), and she wasn't with me!!! That's what I ordered! The carne asada steak was awesome, really loved this plate. Comes with beans and rice, both were good. Chips were ok, didn't really liked the salsa. But that's not why I came here for! Great restaurant, will come back again.
