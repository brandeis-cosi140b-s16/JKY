Lots of margarita's to choose from, and all are quite strong. They also have lots of other drinks to choose from and their happy hour even on the weekends was awesome. We ordered tacos and nachos that were spicy and tasty- the nacho's needed more cheese and we had to try to mix it as all the topping were only on the top handful of chips, they need to learn how to layer. 

Some of the happy hour snacks were interesting, the steak tostada's almost tasted like a caesar salad piled in a ice cream cone scoop on the tostada shell. It was tasty but a bit strange. However, it was great to see that for five bucks on the happy hour menu you get two of them, for six bucks you can get 3 tasty tacos. 

One thing that impressed me was the service, the place was packed and out table of ten eventually became a table of twenty, the waitress was obviously surprised but she remembered everyone's name, drink order and made getting separate checks a piece for cake. 

I will definitely go back and am excited to try more margaritas.
