The exterior and surrounding area may deter you from this place, but the food and service is excellent.  I tried one of the fish dishes and my friends tried other items on the menu and we really liked the food here.  It is conveniently located near the auto rental facility near Phoenix airport, making it a good place to grab lunch or dinner before heading out from the airport
