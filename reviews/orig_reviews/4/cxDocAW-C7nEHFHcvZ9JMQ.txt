If you are staying @ Bally's or someplace very close by YOU NEED TO STOP BY FOR HAPPY HOUR which is pretty much the entire time they are open. 

After unpacking, aka tossing my shit on the floor, me and several of my friends went down there for a quick happy hour before our dinner reservations. The service here is a bit slow, and seating is a serious problem. You must seat yourself, and majority of the time, this the tequila bar&grill is extremely crowded. 

BUT! This is a must go place for the following reasons:

(1) $1 Tacos, that are really tasty! You can get beef or chicken, and either ways, you'll enjoy that party in you mouth!

(2) $1 Margaritas! They come in 8oz portions which may sounds really small, but they actually decent. Not enough to get you tipsy decent, but definitely cheap! 

(3) $2 Tequila Shots - Need I say more?

This is no where you want to take a date, or have a nice dinner. Come here for happy hour and to get the night started!
