I can't believe I haven't reviewed Z'Tejas yet since I am a regular at their happy hour! Though I work super close to the one on Mill I visit this one the most since it's located inside the mall and seems to be more lively. I have always had a great experience when I eat here, I normally start with their infamous Chambord margarita and then order lots of appetizers to share among my friends. My favs have to be the catfish beignets... Mmmmm flaky catfish and crispy batter seasoned just right, it's so yummy especially when dipped in the sauce that come along with it. I also love their Tejas trio which comes with salsa, guac and their queso dip....I'm ashamed to admit that I've eaten that as a meal by myself before, lol. The queso dip is seriously addicting, you can just keep eating and eating until it's all gone. The guac and salsa or also delicious as well. Also a must try are their shrimp avocado bites, it's like eating individual nacho bites with shrimp...delish!! Oh and I can't forget their cornbread they bring it out with every meal, it's hot and extremely tasty with the honey butter that comes with it. The only meal I haven't tried yet is brunch and I am planning on taking full advantage of the "weekend fun bar" that has build your own mimosas when I finally make it out!
