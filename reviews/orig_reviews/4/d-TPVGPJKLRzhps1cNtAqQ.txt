Hubs and I went for a light lunch around 3 pm. Happy hour started at 4pm, and features some drink specials including $ for a 22 oz. Tecate and a taco. We drank a couple Dos Equis on draft, then my husband switched to PBR and I got a Modelo Negra. Not a lot of beer selection, but at a Mexican cantina, they have what you're looking for--Corona, Tecate, Dos Equis, Modelo. We split the nachos with steak, and they were wonderful! The best part about them, which I didn't even notice at first, was the grilled corn. So sweet and smokey, and nice addition to standard nachos toppings. We also had chips and salsa while we were waiting on our nachos to come out. I highly recommend. They come with two salsas, one red, one green. Both were fantastic, and whether or not it is, everything tasted homemade.
