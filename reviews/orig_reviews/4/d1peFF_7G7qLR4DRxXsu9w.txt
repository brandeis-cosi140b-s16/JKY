Taco. Tuesday.  Need I say more?  Several of their tacos are $2 a pop and $5 margaritas!  I strongly recommend the battered fish paired with a delicious cucumber serrano margarita (or 3).  Be sure to arrive early as the wait can be up to 45min/hour but well worth it.  THe staff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive.  Parking is also a bit of a struggle on tuesdays but I'm not sure about any other days of the week.  Patios are inviting and comfortable- in fact, I would prefer sitting at the patio rather than inside.  Will continue to come back to Joyride as a loyal and happy customer!
