I was not prepared for the assault on my senses when I walked into this place!  This place was crazy busy and apparently everyone was hungry.  I felt people were seriously throwing elbows.  The smells were overwhelming too, in a good way and it was freaking loud.   3 different lines, one for each meat.  I heard the guy in front of me order two kinds of meat from the adobada guy but when I tried he said NO!  Must be my face.

Per the suggestion of Yelpers, I went with the adobada tacos (aka spicy pork) and a carne asada muala.  The muala was pretty good but the entire time I was eating it, I kept wishing I had ordered it with adobada.  Not that the carne asada was bad, it's just that the pork was unbelievably good!  I agree with Misti Y. that the peppers and onions added absolutely nothing to the meal. Skip them and fill up on the delicious spinning wheel o' pork.  This place is not convenient to much of anything but was definitely worth the haul.
