I wanted to try a new place for dinner and am glad we found this one. Here It's worth it for just the drinks alone! This place used to be a Pizza Hut, but once you step inside you forget about all of that. Inside was very clean and they offer plenty of seating. You walk up to the counter to place your order and then they give you a number to place on your table. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. Our food didn't all come at the same time which seemed odd. The girl who took the order was very nice and offered me samples of their freshly made drinks. 

Watermelon Agua Fresca ($2.50) - Very tasty and refreshing. I couldn't put it down! They have many other flavors just ask for a sample to see which you'd like. 

Mini Taco Al Pastor ($2) - This has onions cilantro, salsa and a fair amount of meat. I thought the tortilla tasted good and the taco was decent. Not as good as some of the street vendors I have been to, but decent for the price and nice flavor. They also have tacos similar to "Los Tacos' that are $4.50 each, but come with sour cream, rice, rice, beans, cheese, salsa and avocado.

Rice and Beans ($2) - Sadly, they were out of rice. I said that it was ok and I'd just try the beans. They apologized and gave us an extra side of beans instead. I was hoping with a place called Frijoles, that they would have amazing beans. I just thought they were ok. They weren't bad. Just nothing wow and could have used more seasoning or something.

Chips and Guacamole ($3) - I love that they use fresh avocados here! The guac tasted great, but could have used a bit more salt. The chips were very good.

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.50) - Simple yet tasty from the first bite. The tortilla tasted good and it wasn't loaded with cheese, but what was there could be tasted and it was good. Simple can be very good sometimes! 

I'm glad we tried this place and look forward to coming back and trying more. The only downside, they have no salsa bar. They need a salsa bar!
