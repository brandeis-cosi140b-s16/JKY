Great Mexican food off of the strip. It's a short cab ride and was recommended to me by a local. There are a lot menu items to choose from, even some that are very traditional Mexican. 

I had the Carne Asada which was very tasty, cooked perfectly and with the homemade tortillas were fantastic.

Nora, the bartender, had great service and made a really good margarita. 

I would recommend this place to anyone in the Vegas area.
