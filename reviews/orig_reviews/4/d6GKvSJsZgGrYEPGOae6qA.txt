This is my favorite place for a big frozen margarita !  The margarita is soo good and with just one of the big ones you are good to go !  They have awesome guacamole and chips and salsa.  The ambiance and the music are great !  I had the special of the day which was an enchilada platter.  The enchilada was good and the cilantro rice was excellent.  The prices are a little high and it is not 100% authentic but overall this place is great.
