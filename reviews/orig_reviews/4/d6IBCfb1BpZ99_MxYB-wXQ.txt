We drove from Mesa & it didn't take too long on a Sunday afternoon. It was our first time so we parked right off of 16th Ave. but I would not recommend it because backing out is dangerous due to limited visibility.

Atmosphere:
There were paintings on every wall. Most of them are themed after Dia de los Muertos--the Day of the Dead which is the restaurant's theme. There was a small bar with about 4 bar stools. I would say maximum seating capacity is about 35 because & that is packing every table full & there is barely any room to scoot your chair out to walk around. The muzak reminded me of Jamaican music but my husband said it sounded "chips & salsa" music to him. lol

Food:
My daughters are picky & do not enjoy spicy food. Both of the enjoyed the burrito, the orig. quesadilla & the rice. The cheese was unique & flavorful. I am 42 & don't remember ever having eaten it before. Here is a bit about it (Oaxaca cheese  is a white, semi-hard cheese from Mexico, similar to unaged Monterey Jack, but with a mozzarella-like string cheese texture. It is named after the state of Oaxaca in southern Mexico, where it was first made) y husband said the 3 street tacos he ordered were DELISIOCO. In other words, if it had been served on a plate that was sitting on the floor he still would have eaten them. We also enjoyed the Mexican Coke & strawberry soda while my husband had a Corona with lime. For dessert we shared a slice of Tres Leche Cake (4 ways) which was topped with a bit of whipped cream, drizzled with caramel sauce & pieces of pecan. 

Overall:
The food was very good but I felt bad for them & the customers who left because there was nowhere to sit. I suggest they do what they can to buy out the business adjacent to them & knock out the wall to expand at their current address or, better yet (unless they have other parking I don't know about) relocate to a building with more parking & tables.
