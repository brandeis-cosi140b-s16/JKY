It's pretty much Mexican fare.  Everything we tried here was delicious!  We had nachos which was a pretty nice portion.  I ordered a chicken burrito that came grilled.  The prices were a tiny bit high but if they can consistently serve up good food I'd definitely be back.  They didn't even have a band there at the time I went!  Going back for a concert next!
