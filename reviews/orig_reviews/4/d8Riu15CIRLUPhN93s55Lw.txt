Dark lit, copper top bar (I think, it was dark), booze flowing and amazing comfort food makes this place a nice place for Tommy to go! Yeah, third person, so 1990's! Belly up here and get special happy hour prices on drinks and food! I usually stay clear of New Mexican food, but I have been here a couple times now and the flavors are amazing. Green chili, roasted peppers, garlic, smoked meats, fish, oysters, you name it, it's all amped up here. The heat of spice here isn't bad like most New Mexican food so don't be afraid and eliminate choices. Now I know some people aren't fans of the darker atmosphere here, but let your eyes acclimate and you'll see the warm inviting dinning room. Just be sure you don't drop your keys or wallet! JK. This place also has a great outdoor dinning and bar area in between the restaurants. Nice little patio to grab drinks and visit!
