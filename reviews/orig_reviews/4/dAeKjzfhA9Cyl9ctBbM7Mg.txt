I loved this place. We were looking to watch the wild card games somewhere and other places were packed so we ended up here. They had great music playing and an even better happy hour. The margaritas were buy one get one and the appetizers were all half off. The bartenders were really great as well, super friendly and outgoing. I'd definitely come back here again.
