Exquisite food and service. However, be prepared to spend some money. Lovely setting along with prompt courteous service made for a delightful evening. Table side guacamole, while delicious will set you back $ 15 - Don't bother with the shrimp ceviche...as there was not enough shrimp yet it costs $ 16. My favorite appetizer dish was the lobster tacos bursting with flavor...
