I'm so appalled that it took me this long to try this place but whew, finally! I love the concept, of course. The menu is not extremely extensive to the point where you get so confused on what to get. I opted for a simple Bulgogi & white rice because I was craving it but I also got to try their Bulgogi Chimichanga and Kimchi Fried Rice.

Nom! Everything was so tasty and unique. I really enjoyed my meal. Our server was extremely friendly as well. Tried to get the Fries to-go but she mentioned how it might be too soggy so she suggested the Nachos. Based on my cousins devouring it in minutes, I'd say the Nachos were delicious.

Can't wait to go back & try other dishes!
