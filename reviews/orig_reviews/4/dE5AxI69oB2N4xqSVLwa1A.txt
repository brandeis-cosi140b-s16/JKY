We came here two nights in a row.  One night to eat, the next night to dance. 

We sat at the bar and had excellent service!  All the bartenders were very friendly.  I had an excellent mojito and margarita.  Although the food was pricey, it was great.  I am from San Diego so I know what good Mexican food is supposed to taste like (not Tex-Mex people).  I had the chicken tacos, my friends had steak tacos and enchiladas.  However, the tacos were more like fajitas because they didn't come with the fixings, only a side of guacamole.  The chips and salsa were my absolute favorite!

We wanted to do some salsa dancing so we went back on Friday night.  Not much salsa but lots of latin pop, reaggeton, and rock en espanol.  Super fun vibe, Cesar, the bartender got on the bar and danced, and make sure you dress to impress (no tennis shoes).  I heard Saturdays go off!
