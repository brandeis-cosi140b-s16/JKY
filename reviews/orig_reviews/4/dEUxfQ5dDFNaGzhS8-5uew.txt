A great place for mexican food. First clue is you actually see mexican people eating there and not just in the kitchen working. We love getting the Jimmy fries as an appetizer, I highly recommend them! I usually order the carne asada taco plate. Super delicious, but you have to ask for limes on the side as they don't come with. They serve them with rice, beans and guacamole. All are awesome but the rice. I'm not a big fan of it, there lies their inconsistency. It's under flavored or not cooked all the way through most times. The service varies depending on the waiter. There's a waiter there who can ruin your dining experience with his rudeness and lack of urgency when you request anything. If you get Miguel what an amazing individual on the ball through your entire exprience. Also, if you ever have a party or function where you must bring food I definitely recommend ordering the Botana Platter. They usually only need about 1 hour to make it. It has small portions of their shredded beef tacos, chimichangas, rolled tacos, a bowl of beans in the middle and a huge bag with chips and salsa. So BOMB! Get the hot salsa and mix it with the regular sooooooo freaking good.  They also have banquet rooms if you have a big group.
