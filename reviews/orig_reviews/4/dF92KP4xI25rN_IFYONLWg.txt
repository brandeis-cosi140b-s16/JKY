Diablo's has become a somewhat meeting spot-usually the first spot we land on when we first arrive because the location is just so darn convenient and smack dab in the middle of it all. It has a great balcony with a perfect view of the strip and a pretty laid back on crack vibe if that makes any sense....The service is always friendly and attentive-busy or not. 

The food is decent and overpriced....but, I wouldn't really come for the food. Come for the margaritas and avoid the Prairie Fire shots if you want to make it through the night!
