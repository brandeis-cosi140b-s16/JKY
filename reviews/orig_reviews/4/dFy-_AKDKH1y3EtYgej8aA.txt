Love that Gilbert AZ is coming up in the world. When I moved to Chandler, 6 years ago, finding a decent local restaurant was a pipe dream! Now we have Postino and Joyride. God bless Craig DeMarco and Lauren Bailey for bringing us these restaurants. Love the hipster atmosphere, margaritas, fresh agua frescos, crispy fish taco, THE FILA SALAD, and don't event get me started on the churros. Btw, if you ask, they will bring you fresh caramel for the churros and you will pretty much think of nothing else for the next 3 days.
