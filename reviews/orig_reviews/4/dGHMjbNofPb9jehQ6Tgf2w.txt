#100...  Yes! 

I always have a great experience at the Carsbad.  Every time I've been there the food is terrific with a Southwestern flair and the service has been friendly and prompt.  It has become a favorite restaurant of my colleagues and I when we're in town.  

I've had everything from the Fillet to the Carne Adovada and they never disappoint.  Aside from the cuisine, another great attribute of the restaurant is the fact that you can sit outside on the patio and it has plenty of shade and/or heaters depending on the time of the year.
