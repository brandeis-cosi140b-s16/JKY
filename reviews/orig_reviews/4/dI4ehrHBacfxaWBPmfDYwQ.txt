This restaurant wins the award for the best fish tacos I have ever eaten! 

Had lunch here. The prices are on the high side, but the food is worth it. Had the grilled fish tacos that are made with a cucumber citrus slaw on homemade corn tortillas and served with black beans and both red and green rice. So ridiculously yummy and very filling. Should have stopped after two tacos, but they were so good I had to eat all three. 

The Watermelon Mojito, on the other hand, was a different story - very disappointing. It didn't taste like watermelon. Maybe if you closed your eyes and tried really hard, you could taste a very faint hint of it, but otherwise not really.
