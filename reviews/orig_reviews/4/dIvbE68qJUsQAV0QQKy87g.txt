We ate here after printing out a special on Groupon. My hubster had 2 cheese boygers, my son had a quesadilla and I had a cheese boyger too plus we ordered the chencho fries. It was the best cheeseburger I've eaten in a long while and didn't leave us burping up a nasty after taste like In n Out. The burgers here remind me of the burger drive-inns in Cali. The chencho fries were too salty for my taste but overall I can see why everyone thinks they are delicious. It was about a 30 minute drive for us and it's a good thing we don't live close otherwise we would be here all the time which could be a bad thing as I saw they had pastrami sandwiches on the menu and I bet they are fantabulous. Next time we go back, I will have to try it.
