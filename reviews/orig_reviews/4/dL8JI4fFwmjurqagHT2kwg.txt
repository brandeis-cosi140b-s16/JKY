I admit it.  I found this place through Man vs Food.  It did live up to the hype and not just for the tortas.  But first, let's start with the tortas.  I can only speak for the torta del rey and it was as huge as the one on TV.  The mix of meat along with egg, tomato and avocado was delicious and the taste very unique.  Something that does not get enough attention is their large selection of fruit juices and smoothies.  Since I couldn't decide between all the juice choices, I got a plain old pina colada.  It was really good - not too sweet.  My friend was more adventurous and got some drink named _?_eskimo_?_ - also very good.  Next time I go back, I will definitely try a fruit juice.  They had a lot of fruit in their fridge so it should be good.  Another plus is their 99 cent ceviche tostada.  It is a small tostada topped with shrimp ceviche and a slice of avocado.  Very refreshing and a great way to ease yourself into consuming a torta.  Lastly, the service was good and the inside of the restaurant was bright and clean.  There is no reason not to go back.  Remember to bring your appetite because the sandwich is quite filling.
