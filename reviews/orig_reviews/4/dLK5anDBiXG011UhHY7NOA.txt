I've been here twice for lunch and both times have been quite busy, however our service has been attentive and fast. The first time I got the two taco combo with rice and beans. I got the jalape√±o shrimp and a veggie taco. Both were really good, but nothing special. The second time I came I got the Vida chicken salad, which was a little blah. Nothing too exciting with this salad. Toppings were bare and the chicken was over cooked/ crunchy- please note this was a $13 salad and was a "signature item" on their menu. Woof! 

Other people I was with ordered the taco salad, which looked amazing, and the burrito which was the size of a small baby. They had no complaints. I would definitely order the taco salad next time. The chips and salsa are a plus here though and saved me from giving this a 3 star review. 

My advice- go to cantina 1511 over vida for 'fancier' Mexican.
