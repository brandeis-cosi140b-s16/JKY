I didn't think I was hungry until I got my burrito home from PHX Burrito House. I had one bite, of tortilla only, and I realized I would be eating the whole thing in one sitting. 

I ordered a burrito without meat, and added avocado. It tasted amazing- the tortilla was my favorite part, but they really did a great job with having equal parts rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, and avocado throughout. The salsa on the side was a nice addition to the flavor as well. My boyfriend got a chicken burrito and mentioned that the chicken was really tasty- not too greasy or dry. I do wish they had had tortilla chips. It's possible they do, but they weren't listed anywhere on the chalkboard menu that I saw. I didn't look too hard. 

Everyone was friendly, the service was quick, and the prices are decent. I have a feeling I'll be coming here for quick lunches and dinners a lot.
