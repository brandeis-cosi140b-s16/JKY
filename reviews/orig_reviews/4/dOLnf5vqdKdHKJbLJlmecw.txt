Oh yeah.. best little mexican place in these parts.  Breakfast burrito's ROCK!!

Very friendly staff, seems like family owned because I always see the same two ladies working.  

Their salsa is so good too, and you get a little salsa bar to play in too.  And they've got the best horchata I've ever tasted, but I'm a white guy so why listen to me... go try it yourself :)

Hard to see also but they have a back patio that could be good for small to medium sized groups.

Fail comes in when I want food on Sunday... no dice, closed on sundays...
