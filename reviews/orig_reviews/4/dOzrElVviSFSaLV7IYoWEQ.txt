This was my second visit with much improved service. On my first visit, right after they opened, the service was painfully slow. This time around was far better. I think they may still be working out a few issues but as long as it continues to improve I will be happy. The staff is super friendly and polite. Also the restaurant decor is nice and new and everything is super clean. 
On this visit I was anxious to try their margaritas so I ordered my personal favorite the Cadillac margarita on the rocks. It did not disappoint. In fact it was without a doubt the best margarita I have had on the west side. I would go back for that alone-the picture I posted should speak for itself. My hubby's eyes lit up when they places his ice cold beer in front of him.  Five stars for the drinks!
The food was good-is it the best Mexican food I've had? No, but it is definitely as good as the other "sit down" type restaurants in the area. That plus the drinks makes this my new go to place when we are looking for Mexican food and a night out. I hope their service continues to improve and the drinks don't change!
