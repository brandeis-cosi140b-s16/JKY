Beautiful new building. Beautiful presentation. Excellent service. 

Green salsa was delicious - if a little sweet - and had the perfect amount of heat for a wussy like me. Chips were good. 

I asked for the Squash Blossom Soup ($6) which sounded mouth-wateringly good, but they were out. I went with the Baja Seafood Tacos ($10) instead - one with shrimp and one with salmon. They were ok - I've had better at Rubio's. Fruit salsa - pineapple and the other was mango - was very good though! Unfortunately, both tacos fell apart and I had to use a fork. 

Husband got the Flying Saucer ($8)... looked fabulous and he said it tasted good. 

The price seems high for the amount of food you get so be prepared!
