Strictly reviewing as a restaurant.. This place is great, when I tell people some of my favorite tacos in Arizona are at El Hefe, they think I'm crazy. They have great choices and are reasonably priced on some days, but I go up on Tuesdays. My favorite is the duck taco, absolutely nothing wrong with it, texture, taste, and spices are on point.
