I really enjoyed eating at Macayo's Depot Cantina at the Tempe, Arizona location right next to Arizona State University! The atmosphere is very colorful and lively with a full bar outside and inside, patio seating, indoor seating, and TV's everywhere. The dress code is very casual and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone going out for date night or bringing the entire family!
