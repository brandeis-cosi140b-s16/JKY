Came in twice on a recent visit to Phoenix and both times were awesome! On the first visit, we ordered the Nachos Queso Blanco which were deliciously creamy and cheesy, and the Famous Guacamole, and they aren't lyin - it's famous for a reason! I was not a fan of the celery in the Ceviche we ordered but that is just personal preference. On the second visit, we ordered the Queso Fundido and the cheese was yummy and stringy and the toppings really made each bite pop! There is a reason we visited here twice and I hope to visit for a third time again soon!
