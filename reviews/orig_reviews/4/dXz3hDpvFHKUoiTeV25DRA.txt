Well worth 4 stars -- 5 star food. 3 star prices & speed. I loved Tacos Atoyac so I was really looking forward to this.

The Good - tacos & burritos were outstanding, brisket with caramelized onions & clementine, al pastor and turkey mole were all amazing. Kudos for having wonderful spicy pickled carrots at the salsa bar. YUM!

The Not So Good - At about $3 per street taco (2-3x the price of Tacos Atoyac) it's a bit overpriced. Won't stop me from returning, though. Also a bit slow (20 minutes or so between ordering & receiving), but I'll assume they're still working out the opening kinks.

Looking forward to going back.
