The ambiance is nice, lively but not too loud that you cannot carry a conversation. Highlights were the Albondigas soup and flan. Service was fantastic. Our waiter Enrique was attentive but not overbearing. Now back to the flan....must-have item. Delivered by Chef Paco himself, it was the perfect ending to our meal- creamy, sweet and delicious.
