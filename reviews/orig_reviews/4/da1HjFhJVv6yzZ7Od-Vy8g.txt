Finally visited this place for the second time and a star bump this time around....service was great, and food was great.

Here is the breakdown:
-Appetizer: Queso Flameado: This is very yummy...Even better than the first time because instead of 3 tortillas, there were 4! Highly recommended if you like melted cheese with tons of flavor (combination of cheese, mushrooms, tomato and a green chile sauce)

-Entree: Chilean Seabass:  Wow, this was so good.  When I ate here the first time, I wasn't a fish person.  This time around, I was glad that I tried this entree.  The fish was super tasty and the fattiness just melts in your mouth.  Was perfectly seasoned and steamed to perfection.  The jalapeno cilantro lime marinade was the perfect marinade for this fatty fish.  yum yum yum.

-Entree: Prime Filet Mignon:  Nice cut, but over cooked.  We asked for medium rare, it came  out medium.  If only this was cooked to how we ordered, Mundo may have received 5 stars,  but that didn't happen.  However, the sauce was delicious.  

-Side: Mexican Risotto : I asked our server which side is the most popular and he recommended this side...we were kinda set on this side prior to asking him for recommendation, but I wanted to confirm that it's good.  Indeed it is!  This risotto had poblano chile, corn and cilantro.  Was very rich and creamy.

-Dessert: Banana Empanadas:  Again, recommendation by our server and yet again, a hit at our table.  It's batter-fried banana with caramel drizzled on top and a scoop of creamy icecream. Was the perfect way to finish this wonderful dinner.

-Drinks: Alien Margarita and Mojito:  The margarita was very good with the salt.  My favorite part of it is after the server pour the tequila from a small 'Alien' glass bottle, the bottle is for you to keep if you wish.  The mojita was nice and strong.

Overall, a 4-star dining experience.  Ambiance was great, the service was great (thank god we had a good server), the food was almost perfect.  Highly recommended.
