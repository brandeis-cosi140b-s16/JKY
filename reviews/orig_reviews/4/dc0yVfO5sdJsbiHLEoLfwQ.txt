Met some friends for happy hour and WOW did we get happy!!!!!! Small bar area with lots of regulars. The margs are pre made unless you do a call tequila and they have some very good ones. The bartender knows how to mix a happy hour drink!!!!! She was funny and entertained us. Salsa is very good chips are fresh and mini chimi's are a great appetizer.
