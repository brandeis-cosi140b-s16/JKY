Have been to Vida 2x.  Both times everything was rocking.  1st time was for dinner with a gf right after it opened.  We both lived in Southern California so our expectations for Mexican themed cuisine are high.  The made to order guacamole was sensational & the portion was more than enough for 2 single ladies.  3 women could have easily shared it as an appetizer.  I had the 3 enchiladas with plantains & she had tacos.  Both were generous proportions.  We loved hte plantains, tacos & the enchiladas.  It was so good that I took my partner who also has a high bar for Mexican style food.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer, sandwich & tacos.  All exceeded expectations again.  All portions were generous.  The shrimp appetizer the waiter had thought was only 5 shrimp.  It came out & it was 15.  The garlic cilantro sauce was sheer perfection - a great combination of flavor.  I have been trying to copy it ever since.  All in all fantastic.  Have never had to wait for a table or sit at the bar.  Have been lucky enough to get there right before rushes each time.  Loving this place and easily my new "Mexican" go to in Charlotte.
