I have to give Nacho Daddy some credit where credit is due now. There's a new chef in town and you can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients and the food is much more interesting and enjoyable to my palate.

We ordered:

GUACAMOLE- Fresh and flavorful.

3 Kinds of SALSA- A tad watery and not enough bite for my liking. Didn't care for any of them. 

Side of White QUESO- The only thing that would make this cheese better is if naked Ryan Gosling was feeding this to me with his fingers while whispering sweet words in my ear.

ENCHILADA NACHOS- Not a huge fan of the red enchilada sauce they used, but overall still grubbed big time on these. Nice huge chunks of white meat chicken.

CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP- My partner in crime loved it.

Dessert Nachos/FRIED ICE CREAM- I was lovin' on the chocolate and vanilla tortilla chips! Delicious ice cream, too!

Not only was the food a huge improvement from my last visit a year ago, but the service was spot on, too. Our waitress was knowledgeable on the menu and offered up her recommendations and also made sure our cups were at least half full at all times. Just a doll. (Only small complaint was when I was walking to my car in my VS yoga pants the cactus bush was strategically sticking out into the sidewalk and scratched me below my belly button with her big ass bush! Ughhhh. Please trim ya big bush!)

Now I definitely don't think the food is five stars and is really closer to a three stars, but when you throw in the awesome service, cleanliness and UNLV on the tvs, I'M THERE.  Nacho Daddy does not suck balls anymore. He actually gave up ball sucking to make some nachos! Good stuff!
