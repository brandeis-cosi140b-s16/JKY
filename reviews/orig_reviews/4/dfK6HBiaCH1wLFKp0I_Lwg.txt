We haven't dined here before due to the mixed reviews.  Our family loves Mexican food, and while we prefer hole-in-the-wall taquerias, we'll occasionally dine at some full service Mexican restaurants.

We dined at Cantina Laredo tonight because we were with friends who wanted to eat there.  I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in to find a lively and hip bar and a spacious dining room filled with a good looking crowd. 

Service was very good.  Drinks were great.  Food was pretty good.  

We started with the table side guac.   Tasty but tiny portions.  The house chips and salsa is really good.  They give you both mild and spicy salsa.  

Several of us ordered the carnitas which was delicious.  They are on-the-bone pork ribs served with rice and a nice saut√©ed veggie mix.  

We'll return for sure.
