This place makes the best burrito. You can order it with pico de gallo, cheese, and hot sauce. The steak inside the burrito makes it so delicious. The restaurant is a little ways from the strip but it is worth the drive to eat here. The inside has tv with sports and tables and chairs. It is pretty small. The burrito again is the best though.
