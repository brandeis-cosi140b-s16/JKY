Good Southwestern food in huge portions.  My friend and I came here around 9:45 last night, and the place was reasonably empty.  One couple came in after us briefly.
The place itself is nicely decorated.  I love the open grill at the bar, and the smell of burning wood.  We ordered a couple martinis, gimlets, beer, and actual food.  The drinks were nice  and strong, the bartender has a heavy hand!  The food was delicious.  I got the carne adovada which was just perfect.  The pork was so easy to pull apart.  And who doesn't love a meal where you don't need a knife?  That means less effort put into eating.  My friend got the skewers and enjoyed them as well.  The presentation for them is a little nicer than the adovada, which is just meat thrown on a plate.
The bartender was great, asking us what music we wanted to hear on Pandora.  He still needs to watch The Hangover so he can understand why my friend needs to stay in Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  We just might have to stop in and see him tonight.

Word to the wise: be careful about getting drunk at the bar.  The bar stools are wobbly and I can see someone eating shit while wasted.
