Haven't had a bad meal or service yet and we've eaten here 6 or 7 times.

The guacamole is good. The cheese quesadilla, corn, short rib/avocado crisp, carne asada taco, short rib taco are all delicious.  The queso blanco seems to be made with processed cheese but I loved the flavor and texture so I didn't let that bother me.  Chips and salsa are tasty too as are the rice and black beans.

They have two outdoor seating areas which are really nice (unfortunately the noisy construction next door kind of ruins the patio on that side).  Inside is big and open with TV's that can be seen from every table.

Service has always been great, I've never found myself looking around for my server.  I dread the day the beautiful Borgata has been replaced with the 218 unit condo complex that will then overshadow this nice restaurant.
