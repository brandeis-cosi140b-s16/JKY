I love their salsa and chips! 

Best part of this place is the staff and the owners are so friendly and happy to see you. They appreciate the business and make an extra effort to make sure your order is prepared correctly.

Great local business.

4 out of 5 stars only because the interior dining area is tiny. There is a patio but it's a bit uncomfortable to sit out there when it's over 100 degrees. Also, lunch lines can get long since they are located so close to the ASU campus. Once school starts, I'm sure the lines will only get longer.
