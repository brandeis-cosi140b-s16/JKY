The tapas were all good, nothing really wowed us, we did try their tequila rice pudding and loved that they sugar carmelize the top like a creme brulee.  What takes this to 4 stars is the service.  We, like many reviews went with a Groupon, unfortunately during happy hour, I asked to speak to the manager and he agreed to put in our order after happy hour ended in the computer so we could use the Groupon.  That was A1 customer service.  After that experience we will return!  Thank you.
