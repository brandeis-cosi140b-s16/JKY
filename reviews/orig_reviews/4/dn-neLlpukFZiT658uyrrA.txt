"As gas prices continue to drop, 28 states are now selling regular gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. It's getting cheaper to pump two gallons of gas outside the station than it is to pump two squirts of nacho cheese inside." â€• Jimmy Fallon

Pfft, you know that quote is old.  Gas is expensive AF.

Joyride Taco House is my waifu's, Kazi H., favorite place for Taco Tuesday.  Although we have never gone together or even the same location, this place is great.  Happy hour is from 3PM-5PM and that makes my wallet and me pleased.  You can get tacos for $2 a pop, nachos for $6, and $5 margaritas.  They also serve beer too.

Food is great, location is amazing, and the staff is friendly.  Sit at the bar for the best service imaginable and check out all their nerdy artwork.  Joyride is a great place for a quick bite [especially during HH]!

I'm not into competitive eating, unless someone orders nachos "for the table."
