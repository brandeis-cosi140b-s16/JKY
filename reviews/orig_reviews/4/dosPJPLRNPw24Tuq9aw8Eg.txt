A Mexican restaurant lives and dies by it's chips and salsa.  If that is a decree you follow,  then Si Senors is alive and well in the East Valley.   Served with four dipping varietals including a refried bean dip, red salsa, green chili & spicy sour cream and hot, fresh tortilla chips, the beginning of this meal hits the spot every time!  One of my favorites is the chicken fajita platter ... the meat is moist, marinated and grilled to perfection. I just wish the margaritas were better ... I've learned to stick with beer, too bad.  Other than that, the food is always muy bien.  Salud!
