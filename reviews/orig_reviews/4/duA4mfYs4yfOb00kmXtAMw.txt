I ate dinner at El Pollo Supremo after reading about the place on Yelp.  I love grilled chicken and this place knows how to grill.  The chicken was lightly spiced and the skin had a red color.  At competing grilled chicken places the chicken is served luke warm, or cool.  This chicken was HOT and juicy.  The meat was tender and separated from the bone easily.  

The beans and tortillas were tasty.  Tortillas were warm and heated on a stove not a microwave.  Yum Yum!

Carne Asada stands for 'grilled meat'.  Usually a skirt steak.  Prepared by a skilled griller (I know griller is not a word but it should be)  the meat is tender, and juicy.  When prepared by an amateur it can be used for shoe leather, or cheap tires.  The griller at El Pollo Supremo is an artist.  Two folks could split a combo dinner easily.  

El Pollo Supremo is in a small strip mall.  Upon entering the restaurant you place your order at the counter and can take a look at the small kitchen where the magic happens.  The place is old.  The fixtures and tables are old.  Nothing wrong with old, it just sort of hard to keep old stuff clean.  The proprietors do a good job of keeping the place neat and clean.    

The reason for only four stars is their drink policy.  They charge for refills.  I can see charging for refills on Horchata but not Pepsi.  It's a minor thing, maybe I'm too cheap!  

You can leave your plastic at home, cash only here.  Don't tell the IRS!
