Had dinner here last night and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
The restaurant was busy so it was a good thing we made a reservation.

We  ordered:
Traditional Guacamole, Mixto Ceviche and Carne Asada Nachos
Guacamole was great.  A little small on the portion size but very tasty.
The Carne Asada nachos were great!!  Very tasty with nice portions of carne asada and other tasty toppings.
The Mixto Ceviche was okay.  Not the best and definitely not the best. Next time I'll skip this dish and try something else.

After the apps we ordered several different types of tacos.  
Pollo Tacos.. AMAZING!!!  Nice topping of corn and avocado salsa.  A definite must.
Carne Asada Tacos were also great!!  Came topped with some nice fresh watercress.  Not a typical topping for tacos but a nice compliment.
Camarones came in a great sauce.  You wanted to make sure to not lose a drop.
Pastor Tacos were my least favorite but I'm not a huge pineapple fan.  The pork was flavored great.
Mexican Corn...  make sure to order this side dish. It's messy but totally worth it!!

As for cocktails we had regular margarita, strawberry margarita, red sangria and some beers.  

Great night...  looking forward to going back.
