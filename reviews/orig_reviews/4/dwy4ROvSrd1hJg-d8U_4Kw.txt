This place is awesome! I first ate there ten years ago and not much has changed. There is never, ever, anything bad about seeing a bunch of old ladies in the kitchen cheffing up the goods.

My personal favorite is the green chili mix burro. Tacos were awesome, but as long as the green chili, beans, and the perfect tortillas remain, I'm a major fan. I like sitting on the picnic tables with my paper plate and my can of fanta holding it down. 

Bring cash. Be patient. I'd give five stars if they were open later. I've never seen them open on weekends. Anyone know if I'm going at the wrong time?
