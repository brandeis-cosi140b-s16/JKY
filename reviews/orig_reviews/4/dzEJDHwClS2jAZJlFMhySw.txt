Great food and even better location! Lots of different items on the menu but I ordered the beef enchiladas which came with 2 sides. Couple sides to choose from but i went with refried beans and mex rice. I asked for 2 flour tortillas on the side and believe it or not there was no additional charge, which i probably shouldnt mention because now they'll start charging because everyone will ask for them. The restaurant itself isn't exactly clean, the place has a high turn over as far as customers and very little staff to clean up the tables, plus its on Mill ave which is close to the college so that explains alot. The restaurant layout is you walk in order at a counter, sit and wait for your number to be called, go pickup at a window in the back.  Not confusing to me but saw several people walk back up front to the register for their food. The quality was good for the money, and food had plenty of flavor and spice and if your not a soda drinker you can get a combo w no drink for about $7+ tax. They also have breakfast tacos which sounded excellent. Beer is also available.
