I have no problem with choices, I happen to like them. Yes, there are a lot of items to choose from but the staff is happy to have you taste sauces and such to make sure you get what you like. I found the staff friendly and very accommodating and willing to explain how everything is prepared and how everything works.

I especially liked the beef short rib filling. It was delicious and melts in  your mouth. I thought the chips were a bit greasy and weren't really needed with the filling enchiladas so I will probably skip that next time. I also think I added too much to my enchiladas and so I couldn't taste everything distinctly. But that's my problem.

My one problem is that the place is called Enchiladas and Soup. I was really hoping to try both. Why not offer a one enchilada/cup of soup combo?
