Recommended to me by a coworker and it was on point!  The chips and salsa are great.  They have several salsas you can ask for, make sure to try the habanero and verde if you like a little more spice.  The chips remind me of Salsaritas...but better.  We also ordered a small queso and it was one of the better queso dips I've had.  The drinks are pricey but strong, I could only do one margarita.  The food is good, I got the grilled shrimp taco and skirt steak with rice and coleslaw.  My husband got the build your own combo with the same tacos and one enchilada.  I have to say the enchilada was the best.  Cano Fish taco still beats any tacos in Charlotte!
