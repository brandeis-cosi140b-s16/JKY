This place was easy to find but the parking is the worst in this area. I ended up parking along the street near the Y. I can just imagine how it would be on the weekend. We arrived for dinner about 7:30 and were promptly seated and offered water and chips. I ordered a margarita (I think) which was pretty tasty but the chips ... come on guys. I love chips and dip and the chips..... well tasted stale. I remember reading a review before I went and somebody else mentioned the chips not being so great. We actually asked the guy about them b/c we thought they were stale and he let us know that's how they are supposed to be.... they had made a fresh batch about 2 hours ago.
I tried the lemon grilled shrimp tacos with rice and black beans. They were pretty tasty although the beans were a bit spicy. Overall a nice atmosphere and nice area just be warned that you have to probably park in a neighborhood. I will be back to try more things on the menu.
