I have been complaining for years that there are no fast food mexican spots in vegas to go to after clubbing. Not till one of my friends said we should go try this spot. I was like there is no way there is a legit mexican spot in vegas and I do not know about it. Well I was definitely wrong. I ordered the adobado fries kind of like carne asada fries but better. It was pretty good in my opinion. The good thing is it is walking distance from surrender and xs! Definitely going to be going to this spot more often when I am vegas, because EARLS is just an overprices subway. Just saying.
