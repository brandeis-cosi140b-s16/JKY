My favorite Mexican spot in Charlotte.  I do have to say, though, that I liked their other location better.  The food, however, was still superb.  I could eat nothing but the guacamole made table side.  Since, I ordered the guacamole, I decided I needed to eat a little lighter than usual.  I ordered the small salad and a bowl of tortilla soup without chicken.  Both were exceptional.  I loved the tortilla soup and wish I could go back for that.  It had lots of ingredients and the cheese really brought it to a new level.  

Service was wonderful and accommodating.  Wish I still lived in Charlotte to keep going back.
