One of the few places that I have eaten at with friends then taken my family to later on.  First a word of warning, this place is dark...not dark like medieval, but dark like the lights are not working.  My grandparents had a bit of a time making their way through but the staff was very good about assisting and getting us a table near the door.    

The bar downstairs is very cool, if you get there and can find somewhere to sit.  I was enjoying it so much the first time I ate there that I didn't want to take the elevator upstairs when it was time to be seated for dinner.  The menu is varied and full of varied salads, meats, and pastas and the appetizers are just as good if not the best part of the menu. 
I am not a wine guy but those who were did their best to add several empty bottles to the collection in the wine racks on the walls.  They said that they enjoyed the selection and variety.  I enjoyed the selection of beer and tequilas.  

Give it a shot, but wear your headlamp!
