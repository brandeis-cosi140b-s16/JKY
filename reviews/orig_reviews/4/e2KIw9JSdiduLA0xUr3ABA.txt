I completely have to thank Yelp for this one. I work around the Scottsdale Airpark and I didn't even know this place existed until I did a little Yelping. The food is definitely on point with what the other reviews are saying, and I was very pleased.

When I got there for lunch, there was a line to the door. I was grateful though because I had no idea what to order. I'm serious too because that usually doesn't happen to me at a Mexican restaurant. Their special sounded great as did pretty much everything else. I decided to go with the delicious sounding blackened chicken burrito and an order of chips and salsa (kind of a must for me at a new Mexican place). The chips were pretty standard, but crispy and yummy, and the salsas were great! We were given a verde, a regular (red with lots of pepper flavor) and their version of a spicy salsa. I believe the latter had habaneros in it; it lacked a little in flavor but definitely packed a little bite. Overall the salsas were very good; I even threw some on my burrito. Speaking of that, the burrito was great! It wasn't filling like any of the Berto places, but instead, just right. In other words, I didn't feel too guilty about it. The chicken was awesome and the other fillings (rice, pico and chipotle sauce) brought it all together very nicely.

I've for sure added this place to my list of lunch spots. I can see why it gets great reviews, but I can also see why people are hesitant to boast about it. It's a well-kept secret tucked away in the depths of North Scottsdale that is becoming less of one day after day.
