2nd review Ever.  I'm on a roll.

1) Best Tortillas in Phoenix.  No question
2) Salsa is in the top 5 of Phoenix
3) Beans and rice......again....amazing
4) Low Low prices

So...... Amzing Tortilla + Amazing Salsa + Amazing Beans & Rice = Delicious 

Hell, even the flautas (we always get the Zarape Special) are crisp and thin.  If you're a fan of flautas/taquitos, you know that too thick of a tortilla is a downer.

This place is an easy 5/5....but.....enchiladas are a 2.  Sauce is good, not great.  Texture not right on the enchilada itself.  So, I can't give a mexican joint a 5/5 if there enchiladas are just ok.
