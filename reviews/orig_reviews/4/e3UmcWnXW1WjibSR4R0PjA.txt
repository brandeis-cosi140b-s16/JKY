I'm here to give the Tee Pee some love.  for far too long it has been demeaned, denigrated, sneered at and insulted by hipster and foodie wannabees judging it by what it never claimed to be, aspired to, or is today---- an authentic mexican restaurant.  THIS IS NOT THAT PLACE, PEOPLE!  Tee Pee is a culinary and cultural time capsule of a Phoenix that no longer exists.  it is a black-and-white TV in an age of HD split-screen.  It is Legend City (google it kids) in an age of interactive Gaming.   it's a ford  falcon with a metal dashboard and no AC in the age of Light rail.  You get the idea.

ALso, I happen to think the enchilada sauce and the hot sauce is brilliant.  deep-flavored and delicious. I always get some to take home. great.  I've never had a bad margarita there.  here's a cautionary:  the Chile Relleno is unlike any you've ever experienced before.  you may not like it if you expect a typical relleno.  it's a unique mutation that will have you wondering if the creator took too much acid in the 60s.  some people love 'em, some people hate 'em.  That's all I'm going to say about 'em..  I always sit in the bar (quieter) get the enchilada cheese and onions, crumble up some of the free chips into the sauce and practically lick the plate clean.  soak up the kitchy nostalgiaon the walls and in the orange naugahyde booths. delight in the old-school food.  But don't judge it by what it's not!
