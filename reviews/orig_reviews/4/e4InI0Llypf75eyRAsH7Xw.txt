I had the fish tacos and they were really great :).  We also had nachos for our app - it was the kind of nachos where each chip is made individually and has all the toppings on it.  I like this kind better than the pile of chips with random toppings piled on in places.  

Everything was really yummy - our waitress was pretty weird though - I don't really know what her deal was.
