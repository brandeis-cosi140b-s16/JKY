Wow, this place was surprisingly better than I expected. Great atmosphere with dim lights and a spacious layout. I liked the decorations, too -- pretty chic.

When my family and I came in, we were greeted by the waiters and big servings of tortilla chips with salsa in a cute little decorative saucer-holder-thingamajig. The chips were decent -- they weren't stale, at least, although the salsa serving was kinda small and the salsa verde was pretty runny.

As for dishes, I ordered the masa corn cakes (less than $10). They were delicious, and the presentation was great! There were only three masa cakes, but by the time you're done chompin' on those chips, you're going to be glad you ordered a lighter meal! I think they were perfect in terms of servings, and they're good for sharing. My sisters liked it a lot, too. I can't really remember how the other dishes were like, but I did think the food in general was pretty decent.

The only thing I don't like so much about this place is the PRICES. Yeah, some items are ridiculously overpriced, but, hey -- VIVA LAS VEGAS!
