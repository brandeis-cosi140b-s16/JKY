Best Mexican Food in Vegas in my opinion. Not much else to say. Salsa is the best around, although I do wish they fried their chips fresh to order so they are hot, not out from under the heat lamp. We have been in the past where the food wasn't on point, but it's only been once or twice in all the times I've eaten here which I'm sure is at least in the multiple dozens. We've had so many different dishes, kind of hard to review them all - but needless to say I keep coming back and will continue to do so for my mexican food fix!
