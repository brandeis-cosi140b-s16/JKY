This restaurant is situated in an awesome venue. The Clarendon Hotel is the obvious place to be when you are in Midtown PHX. Gallo Blanco's menu features some of the best-tasting food I have ever eaten! I recently went there on Valentine's Day. I was expecting to choose items from their regular menu, however they had a wonderful Valentine's Day menu to choose from. The meal was great and the drinks were awesome! I can't This restaurant is a "must try" no matter what! The only concern that I had was that the wait staff was a little on the dry side, but they did provide good service.
