I am a major fan of a family run business and it is quite apparent in the evenings that his boy is on the register while Rudy and possibly his wife is hard at work as well.

I love enchiladas and rudys enchiladas are just okay.  His sauces are delicious but the shredded chicken is not seasoned.  His chips are put in the fryer right when you order them which makes them some of the best I've had.  

I keep hearing how delicious his street tacos are so I will try those in the near future.

Yes, this restaurant has its flaws but the effort is there and it is apparent.  I like Rudy's!
