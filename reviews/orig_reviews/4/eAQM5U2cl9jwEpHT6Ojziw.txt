Salty's has a party reputation.  I had not ever heard a word about their food so I was nervous to give them a try, even with my Groupon...

They were good, really good!  We tried the nachos with chicken and had chipotle burritos.  The nachos filled us completely and we actually boxed and took our burritos home.

The Main Man ate his burro later in the day and thought it was tasty, he had no complaints even with the reheating.

I ate mine the next day and thought it was absolutely yummy!  So yummy that I wished for another one to eat the next day, and the next day...

Thank you to Groupon for giving us a reason and opportunity to try Salty's and thank you to Salty's for being a solidly tasty choice.  We don't go over by the mall often but when we do, Salty's will be a food stop!
