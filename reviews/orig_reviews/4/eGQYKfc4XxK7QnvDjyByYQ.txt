A friend of mine gave a speech at Toastmasters on whole the wall restaurants that he loves and this place, was on the list. I could not disagree because I, I love it as well. The chicken and beef is cooked above a real wood fire and it is delicious and the price, it is low, low, low! However, bring some cash, I don't think they accept cards. 

I'm not a huge meat eater so I usually don't get the chicken and beef combo plate but I do get the next level up on the chicken plate (I think three instead of two pieces, or some such situation) and then I save the bones for when i make chicken stock at home - as they are perfect for it having been wood fire roasted.

The beans here can be a bit on the salty side but love the homemade salsa and the pickled red onions - I generally pull the chicken meat from the bone and wrap it up in a corn tortilla (you can get corn or flour) with the salsa and onions, and it is wonderful! You can eat at the restaurant but many people get the meals to go and take them home, which is how I tend to roll. 

Look, this is not high-class dining but it is a solid example of the beloved hole in the wall and the people behind the counter, always friendly. I've ordered meals from here many times and will order many more - grilled chicken at a great price, try it out and share you what you think of the place. :-)
