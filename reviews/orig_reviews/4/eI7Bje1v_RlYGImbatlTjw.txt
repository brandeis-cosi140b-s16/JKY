We lived in Mexico for close to a year and therefore have some knowledge of its culinary delights. We stopped by here just to have some drinks and then decided on their Tortilla soup - which was outstanding and very flavorful. This is a place with a funky atmosphere - I think they call it a Cantina and justifiably so. We will be back on our next visit and sample more of their food. We liked it.
