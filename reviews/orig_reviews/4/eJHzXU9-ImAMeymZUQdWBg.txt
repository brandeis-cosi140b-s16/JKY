Have to thank my breos for taking me here with which I would probably have not found this place.  So i was given the disclaimer about this homemade salsa because there is an addiction withdrawal factor.  Holy smackanolies, this salsa was mmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
We killed 2 bottles of this heavenly salsa. 
Had the #1 lunch combo which was a taco, tostada and tamale.  All really good, authentic, and grubbin.  The tamale had a hint of sweetness, which went perfect with my horchata, mmmmmmm!!!!!.  One of the best horchata I've had also, not to chalky not to sweet.  
Service was great although we did get the vip tavo service, free guac and refills.  Lunch time crowd can get quite busy.  I believe this mexican spot was est in the 70s, but its definitely been a local favorite for a long time.  If only they bottled that salsa!
