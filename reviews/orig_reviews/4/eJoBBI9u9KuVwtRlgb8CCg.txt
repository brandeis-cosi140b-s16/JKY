Stopped in Macayo's in Tempe today after attending the Jersey Boys at ASU Gamage. The service was very attentive & our server got everything right and answered all our questions. The food was very good no complaints amoung the 4 of our party. The building is showing it's age though..could use some painting & updates. I do reccond this location for a good Mexican meal.
