Free chips and guac for checking in! What a great deal! My bartender Austin fully explained the menu. I ended up trying the the fajita combo! Great presentation and taste; although it is a bit pricy. This may become a regular lunch spot for me.

Only issue I had was finding parking. There is a chase parking garage a block away or metered parking in front. Parking validation would be great!

Have to say though,"I'm in love with the HEFE!"
