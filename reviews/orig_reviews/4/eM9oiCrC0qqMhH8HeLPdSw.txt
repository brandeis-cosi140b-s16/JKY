I thought this place was going to be a total gimmick when I saw the pics on Yelp.  Who'd have thunk it, my BBQ burger was one of the best I've had in the valley.  We also had a maple bacon shake and French toast fries - total sugar overload and quite delicious.  This place'll definitely wreck your health, but is quite good and I'd highly recommend to anyone seeking a gourmet burger.
