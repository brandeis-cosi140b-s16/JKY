Outside Ambiance was fantastic, as we sipped out margaritas and enjoyed the warm night ari!  we got the cheese crips and guacamole for a quick appetizer night out with friends and the guac was amazing with just the right amount of garlic!
we had a hard time getting a table on a saturday night (the wait seems to always be longer than they tell you it will be), but upon coming back on sunday, we were easily able to get a table outdoors.
