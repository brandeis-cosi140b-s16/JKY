As a native Tucsonan, I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food. El Segundo Sol does the Southwest justice. They offer the classics that you yearn for like queso fundido and elote, which are both must tries. Also their margaritas are good. And a good margarita is never a bad thing. Although the prickly pear margarita is sweet, sweet, SWEET I give them points for including it on the menu. 

The other reason (besides the amazing food) that El Segundo Sol is a place I love to frequent is the patio. OH, THAT PATIO. It is right off the strip and if you can get a table on the edge of the patio, people watching is a must. If you can't, which is likely for bigger groups and busier nights the entire patio is a dream. Lights, greenery, pi√±atas and great music makes for a fantastic meal and experience. 

If you are in town and not wanting to journey far from the strip, El Segundo Sol is a must.
