Yum yum! This place has me addicted to Al Pastor. I wish it was closer to my house. From lengua to carnitas, every type of meat I have put in my street tacos has been delicious. 

The restaurant itself is large and always clean. It is great place to grab a quick lunch. The first time I came here, I did have to have my friend explain the different lines to me as I was quite confused.
