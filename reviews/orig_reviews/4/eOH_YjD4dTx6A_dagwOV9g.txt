This place was good. The food had a lot of flavor. The guacamole was FANTASTIC!!! The server was very accomidating for our kids. He recommended some things that weren't on the menu for them and the kitchen followed through. The head chef even came over and made sure that the kids enjoyed their food ( which they absolutely did) and then got them complimentary dessert.  It was a little overpriced, but I would eat there again, just because of the service alone.
