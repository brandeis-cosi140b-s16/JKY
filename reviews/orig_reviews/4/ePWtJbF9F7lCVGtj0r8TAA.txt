Wow. We went on Tuesday, late afternoon, and the place was still rocking. They take Taco Tuesday to a whole new level. Great wait staff, food takes a while to come out, but it is delicious and CHEAP! Wonderful combinations, all the Tacos were stunning. Some a little spicy....but I like that!
Apparently they have live Flamenco dancers on Wednesdays but you better get there early if you want a table!
Nice outdoor patio area too
