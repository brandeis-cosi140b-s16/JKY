I've been here twice. Both experiences were nice as I was able to sit inside by the bar once and outside at twilight my second visit. The service was prompt and food was tasty. I lot of people think Mexican right away but this is more of a New Mexico built menu, hence the recipes use a lot of green chili. Drinks are always nice if you choose to partake. I recommend any of their margaritas--always yummy! I would not recommend Carlsbad to to large parties as their space wouldn't accompany such a group.
