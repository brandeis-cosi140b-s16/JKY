This was a lovely surprise in the world of airport food. We ordered one order of Carne Asada Tacos and one order of Fish Tacos. Both were very flavorful and seasoned well. Tacos seem to be one of those things that all restaurants think they can do, but this place really can make a good taco. My husband and I agreed that the fish tacos were our favorite of the two. Pricing seemed reasonable, especially for an airport location and our order came up without a long wait.
