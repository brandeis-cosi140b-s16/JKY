This is no where near my house, but worth the drive.

The food is great  the service always a bit lackluster, though you will never go without.  

The tortillas are TO DIE FOR.  Like nothing you have ever had.  You get a ton of food for the price and it is simply a no frills place.

You come here for the food plain and simple.  If you have never been, do it. at least once..but probably twice.
