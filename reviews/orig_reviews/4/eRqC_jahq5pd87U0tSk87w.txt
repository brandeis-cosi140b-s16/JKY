It was okay, i had nachos very very cheesey. This was my first visit and we'll i guess it wasn't my type of food perhaps i should've went with my usal mexican dish,  chimi, but i really just wanted a snack.  Our waiter seemed to be in a hurry and frazzled. The top portion of my nachos were whole chips but the rest were crumbs. I ended up using the chips we had at our table.  The salsa was good not too spicy, and our wait time was great.  Over all it was okay food probably would return but I'll go with my usal.
