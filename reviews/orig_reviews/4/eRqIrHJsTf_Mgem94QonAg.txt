Revo Burrito is a place that is close by 24 hour fitness gym off Camelback that is open late.  I went with a few friends here after a late workout. They have burritos, bowls, tacos, and more.  I opted for the healthy chicken burrito bowl, which was okay.  My friends had burritos and were really impressed by them.  I would have to say that the wide array of menu options was really appealing, and I want to go back there and try a burrito some time.
