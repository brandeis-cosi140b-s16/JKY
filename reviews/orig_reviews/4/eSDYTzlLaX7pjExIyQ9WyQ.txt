I've been going here for quite awhile, and have always loved the food! They have my favorite rice, hands down. So much flavor, it's addictive. 
 Tacos are absolutely amazing, plenty of meat, the chicken is nice and juicy. Just be careful when they ask if you want cheese, sour cream, and avocado; they fail to mention each of these is an additional cost, which makes for a very expensive taco. But still, so good.
 Burritos are very filling, I'm usually good with a junior size!
 Only thing I've ever been disappointed in here is the quesadillas. Extremely oily, and not much flavor. Other than that, this place is well worth the money, and much less of a wait than Tacos el Gordo next to it. 
 On a side note, the owner is a very nice guy, we always go trick-or-treating at his house for Halloween, he goes all out for the kids! :)
