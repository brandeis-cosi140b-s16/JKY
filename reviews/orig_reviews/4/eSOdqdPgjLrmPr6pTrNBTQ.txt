Cant go wrong with this place. I cant keep going to the same mexican place for dinner all the time so have to change it up every now and then. Valle Luna is about 2nd or 3rd on our list so oddly enough I had not reviewed it. All of their food is good, only downside is there margaritas arent the best.

Been coming here forever with my family and now with my own, My 1997 little league baseball team picture is on the wall which is always a good laugh. Thanks for the sponsorship back in the day!!!!!
