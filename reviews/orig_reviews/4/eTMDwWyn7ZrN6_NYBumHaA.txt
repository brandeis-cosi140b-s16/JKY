If you happen to drive a long way just to find yourself at the Barrio Cafe, on a Monday afternoon, and then notice the sign that says they are closed on Monday's, then I've got a great solution for you.

Head south-east my friend, over to Rosita's.  This is a great little 'hole in the wall' eatery.  I wasn't disappointed, and neither was the group I had in tow.  Their re-fried beans were so creamy and flavour-ful.  Yeah, that's right, I used a 'u' in flavour, because they're that good.

Next time I'm in the area, I plan on giving the frozen horchata with coconut rum a taste.

Be forewarned, the place is small, so if there is a group of cackling hens at the table behind you doing tequila shooters, it will make for a vexing dining experience.
