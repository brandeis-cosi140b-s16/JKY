My boyfriend and his family personally know the people who run this place and have been regulars here for years. Given that I am half Mexican (raised on Tex Mex and Sonoran Mexican food), I tend to be more on the picky side when it comes to branching out and trying different regions of Mexican food. So my first time here I was a little on edge... it's definitely a different style than what I'm used to.

This is not your generic Mexican food (Carols O'Brien's, Macayos, Chevy's, Manuel's), this is authentic. If you're used to spice and flavor complexity, this is a milder, more bland (not in a bad way) Mexican joint. They use more green sauces as opposed to red, and queso fresco (white, crubmly, look it up) as opposed to cheddar or American. For those who can't handle a lot of spicy - this is probably the place for you.

While it's not what I'm used to I really enjoy their food. The waiters really make you feel at home. It's a great place for a family dinner with options on the menu for everyone.
