Been here a bunch of times and while the food is awesome every time and I'm glad that I went there, the customer service is very random.  At times, the staff is friendly with a smile on their face and making jokes.  But at other times, they are rude, they make it seem like you are bothering them and they seem more concerned about talking to each other than to you.  Then you get down to pay and the cashier is either on it and understands what you ordered, or you basically need to spell it out.

So be prepared for great food with bipolar customer service.
