We like coming here though we are not regulars. You can get decent Mexican dishes in what I think of as TexMex style. My wife loves pollo fundido. I get a burrito. I enjoy the margaritas. Service is always good. Parking is normally easy.  There are lunch specials and then a happy hour so there are bargains most of the day.
