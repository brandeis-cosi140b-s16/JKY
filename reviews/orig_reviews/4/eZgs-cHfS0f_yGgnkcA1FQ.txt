I've been going here since the week it opened. The food is better than average, somewhere halfway between authentic Mexican and Americanized.

I love the salsa selections and the chips are good. The food is nothing spectacular but I will go here on occasion just to get decent Mexican food.

Try it, you might like it... many people do.
