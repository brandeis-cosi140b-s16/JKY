So many things  have been said that are very true. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. I read so many reviews about the Carne Adovada that I had to try it.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and the Adovada Sliders. The shrimp scampi was good... it sat on a bed of seasoned rice. Some of the rice was a tad dried out and hard but the flavor of the dish made it easy to ignore. The sliders were out right orgasmic...I don't even smoke and I would have said yes to a cigarette when I'm finished. There's not much more to say... if you like meat, you like pork ( I'm not normally a huge pork fan)and you can tolerate a little heat you'd be crazy not to try it.  The place is tiny but service is quick and pretty efficient. Plus I went during happy hour... Definitely got my money's worth.
