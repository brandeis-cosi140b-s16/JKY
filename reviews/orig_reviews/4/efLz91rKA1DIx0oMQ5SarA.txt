This is a small Hawaiian Mexican fusion restaurant. Based on service alone this is a five star restaurant. Drew was beyond awesome, he was friendly, charismatic and knowledgable about the food. He explained to us the process and gave us some suggestions. The food is very good! The restaurant reminds me of Chipotle but with a Hawaiian flair. You pick from a burrito, bowl, salad and 3 tacos. You can then pick your meat from Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish and Grilled Veggies. After this you can pick your normal add on such as rice w seaweed, brown rice, beans, sour cream, etc
I was very happy and satisfied with the price and taste of the food. I would totally recommend  this place! Especially for those who love Mexican food but want to try a spin on it!!!!
