Delicious! I love nachos and this was the first time I've had the pulled pork variety and it was plentiful and delicious. After salting the guac, it was great--fresh, rich, creamy and very flavorful. I had the carne asade, which was very well-seasoned and my fiance had the enchiladas. We left full and satisfied, having eaten way too many nachos and guacamole. If I'm ever in that forsaken part of AZ, I'd be down for making a pit stop at this spot.
