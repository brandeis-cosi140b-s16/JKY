Don't let the location scare you. It's literally right next to Sapphire's Gentlemen Club front entrance lol....but this restaurant is not "seedy" at all. They also share the same parking lot.

We had dinner on a Monday evening. Locals discounts are not 50% anymore....it is now 25%. Reviews said getting a reservation can be difficult because they are always busy...but I guess it really depends on whether or not it's a holiday weekend or if there is a big event is in town. We were able to call in for a 7pm reservation with no problem....and we called around 6:15p.

Service was great...they were very attentive...the waiter and bus boy kept our drinks and chips/salsa full all night. Speaking of salsa....oh my. Addicting!!!!! Once you start, it's really hard to stop yourself from eating the entire first batch. They give you 3 different kinds of salsa; roasted, mild, and habanero. I can take spiciness...but the habanero slowly creeps up on you! Before you know it, half of my water is gone. But the flavoring was sooooo good though!!!!!!!

We ordered the beef enchiladas and the seafood enchiladas. Each comes with rice and beans. You can modify your sides if you like. I'm not a cheese fan but mmm...their cheese just melts in your mouth. Our entrees came out fresh and full of flavor. We were very pleased with  the quality of their food.

Chef Paco even personally came out to meet my boyfriend and I. The flan dessert was out of this world. Not overly sweet but just the right amount to satisfy your dessert cravings. It was made from his grandmother's recipe. The flan tasted like it was made right in Cabo San Lucas. You can taste the authencity...none of this artificial flavorings.

Can't wait to come back soon!
