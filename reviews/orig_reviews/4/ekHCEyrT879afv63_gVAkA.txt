I returned yet again to ISLA.  This time with a large group.  I was quite impressed with the service.  Normally when you are in a group the service suffers.  They did a good job keeping up with all of us, and the food was very good as well.

While it is not the best mexican food ever, it is becoming one of my favorite mexican places in Las Vegas.
