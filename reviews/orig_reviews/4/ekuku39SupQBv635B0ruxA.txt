Kiwi margarita, chips and salsa, and taquitos were so delicious. The wait for the dining room was forever so my husband and I opted for a high top at the bar. They were only serving appetizers tonight but we didn't mind. 

My kiwi margarita was delicious. Made from real fruit! The salsa was on point. Taquitos were super yummy and so was the guac they were covered in. 

My husband and I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of the menu. 

I will update my review after I see more of what they have to offer.
