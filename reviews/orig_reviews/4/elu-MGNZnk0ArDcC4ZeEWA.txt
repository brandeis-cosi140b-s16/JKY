This place was lovely!  As an out-of-towner, it was the perfect place to go for a local experience.  You must get there very early to get a seat, but they do have a new place outside to wait, if you have to.
The guacamole was a treat - what with them making it for you at the table and including pomegranate seeds!  I ordered their "specialty" - some sort of pork dish which was ok...a little dry for my tastes.  I actually was kind of disappointed by it.  But, other than that, I give this place a solid 4 stars.  Cozy and sweet.
