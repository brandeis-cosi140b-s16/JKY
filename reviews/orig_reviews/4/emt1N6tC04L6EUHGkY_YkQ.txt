This place is delicious. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little pricey, but hey... It's in a casino. And it's more a fusion Mexican joint rather than a place like tacos el Gordo that's legit. But my bf and I started with the traditional guac and their garlic salsa... Amazing and a lot! We had to order more chips. The corn elotes are super yum and we had the espada swordfish tacos on recommendation of the server. They did not disappoint but I would have liked to try the pastor tacos... Just wasn't hungry enough. I am not a tequila drinker so the white stripe and cheeky cheeky boom boom drinks were amazing and fresh. And the agua frescas are mouth watering. My bf had a variety of tequila drinks and he liked them all but thought the classic margarita was still the best. Someone next to us had the pollo a las brasas which also looked delicious and must have been because they sucked them down to the bone. Will def come back.
