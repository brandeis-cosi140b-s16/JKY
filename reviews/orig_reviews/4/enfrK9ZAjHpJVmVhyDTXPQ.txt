Wile staying at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay we stopped into Hussong's~ it had a fun casual atmosphere and the staff was friendly and attentive. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful with the questions we had about particular items. He was also very efficient juggling between the larger parties and the smaller tables so no one was over-looked. 

We both had the taco's (5 mini soft taco's per plate) which were very satisfying.
I had the ribeye taco's and, although hey had a great flavor,  the meat was pretty tough- guess I should have stuck with the chicken.  I loved their mango habanero guacamole which I could have made a meal of in and of itself with their chips that were just right -- lots of crunch and light on the salt! I also enjoyed a jalapeno cucumber cocktail that was very refreshing although I had a friend tease me about not getting their famous Margarita which they claim to be the original creators~ just another good reason to go back besides all the delicious looking plates that past by us as we were eating. 

This one is certainly staying on our radar!
