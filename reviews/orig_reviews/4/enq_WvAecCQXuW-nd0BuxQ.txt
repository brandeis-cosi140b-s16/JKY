Cabo Fish Taco in the NoDa section of Charlotte is an enjoyable place to eat.  Not only is it close to New Life Theological Seminary where I work, but they consistently have great food and great service.  I could make a meal off of the salsa and chips; it is fantastic.   My personal favorite is the Southwest Chicken Wrap, I rank it the best in Charlotte!  This time of the year you can choose a fresh summer fruit cup as a side, an added bonus.

The restaurant is always busy and can sometimes be a little noisy, not the place to hold a business luncheon and parking is limited.
