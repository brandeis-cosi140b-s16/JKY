My second time trying this place and both times have been delicious. The first time I ordered the short rib taco, chicken taco, and street corn. The meat on both tacos were a little dry but a good size. I love street corn and was happy with all the toppings they included: butter, cotija cheese, green onions, mayo, and a chile powder. 

The second time I ordered the burger, fries, and chips and guac. I absolutely love their burger! I got it with cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted jalepenos ($.75 extra charge) and it was one of the best burgers I've ever gotten at a drive-thru! If you get the burger, you MUST get the fries because they are freshly cut and seasoned to perfection. Be prepared to be full afterward, also. The guac is different; there is corn mixed in, which gives it sweet and tangy flavors all in one. I liked it! Definitely love this place but would get the burger over the tacos.
