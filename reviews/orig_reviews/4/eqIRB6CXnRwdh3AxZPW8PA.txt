Out of all 3 Lindo's in the valley, this one wins with the view.  Unfortunately it is also the busiest location and they have a tiny parking lot, so expect to park in the office lot across the street.

Back to the view, they have large glass windows which look out onto the entire Vegas skyline.  The restaurant sits on top of a small hill within an already elevated part of Henderson, which provides the best view for a price in town!

Food wise I can't taste a big difference between all the locations, but I still prefer the original DI location for its classic feel.

You can easily fill up with a $15 combo plate here and the food will be very consistent!
