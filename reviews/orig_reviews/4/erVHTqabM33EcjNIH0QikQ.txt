I was in Phoenix for business, it was a beautiful day, and I was in the mood to sit on a patio. I stopped into Blanco and was able to get a seat at the bar outside. I ordered a white peach and hibiscus margarita, it was incredibly delish and refreshing!! I also ordered the marinated chicken, the chips and salsa were dress. The tacos came with black beans and rice! It was all tasty! Similar to what I was expecting, but service was great! Food was really really good! I could get used this life in the sun!!
