This place was a clusterf@*k when we checked it out at 1:00 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  I guess we sort of beat the post-clubbing crowd, but even then there wasn't any type of organization to the lines. I found this spot on Yelp because I was looking for a late night eatery that won't cost me an arm and a leg in Vegas.  Yes, Tacos El Gordo fit the "affordable" bill, but I just wish they had signs for each line that was semi-forming inside the restaurant.  The tacos were certainly legit -- they had the typical carne asada and steak, but also served innards like stomach and tripe and brains and tongue.  The servers were friendly and fairly quick.  I enjoyed the tongue taco the most.  I'll probably be back but not during their peak hours, which is anytime between midnight and 4:00 am.
