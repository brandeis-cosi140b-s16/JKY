Went here on Sunday evening around 7:30.  It was not busy and we sat on the patio.  The guacamole with crab was great and so were the tacos.  We had the pork and the short rib tacos.  Highly recommend the short rib tacos.  Others on the list looked great as well.  The service was great.  We will return.
