"Paco's Grandma's Flan"=Worth the flight from Seattle.
I think they are really trying to make an impression. The food is great. This coming from a dude who grew up in the San Joaquin and knows what is and is not good Mexican cuisine. The place is off strip and was extremely slow on a Saturday afternoon in January. I had the carnitas torta and it was very good. It was not awesome until I added the pickled veggies on the side to the sandwich. The carnitas is sufficiently mild and flavorful that the light seasoning is probably the right approach. However, it just didn't fire all the cylinders for me until the zing of the pickled veggies (I think it was carrots, jalapenos, Anaheims, onions, and coriander greens) was added to the kit. I appreciate slow-cooked flavor and subtle fatty mild goodness but for a torta you may as well go all in. Jesse was our server and he was awesome. He took responsibility for the place and owned the experience. Congenial, professional, personal, and honest. Jesse was a lot more than I expected from the establishment connected to one of the world's largest stripper joints! This place is not to be missed. We walked there from the strip which was about a 15 minute investment just in getting there. Worth the walk and the exercise helped to ease the levity of "Paco's Grandma's Flan" which was, in all honesty, the crowning work of everything we ate while in Vegas. Get down to El Dorado people.
