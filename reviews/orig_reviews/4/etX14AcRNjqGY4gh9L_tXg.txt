I've been going to Richardson's since 1995.  Yes, I have.  That was 1.  before the place burned down,  2.  when they had a separate pizza menu with 25 delicious zzas that they served until 1 a.m.   3.  they had a short-glass full of loose cigarettes at the bar that patrons could just help themselves to  4.  when they'd serve free appetizer bites to folks around the bar  5. you could park your OWN car, and enter through the secret door in the back, and 6.  when the staff weren't jerks and appreciated the customer.  That's the part that gets me about this place now.

The food....great.  It's unique.  Try finding anything else like it anywhere, except New Mexico. I dare you.  Portions are ridiculous. You pay for it, but you can spend $20 easy for dinner at Red Lobster.  And this is no Red Lobster.

The atmosphere...great too.  Music is usually spot on. The place is comfortable. I like the no-windows thing, especially in the summer....it's cave-like.

The staff....jackasses.  Look, I know there's a line out the door, but you're still in the hospitality business.  So quit making me feel like i've got some-nerve asking to eat here. Get over yourself.  It's your jobbbbbbbbbb.......

I will say this, the cooks are some of the hardest working folks I've ever seen.  They are machines, and work magic in that tiny kitchen...somehow never running into one another. So, bravo cooks, keep it up.

So, go.  Just don't expect to feel welcomed.
