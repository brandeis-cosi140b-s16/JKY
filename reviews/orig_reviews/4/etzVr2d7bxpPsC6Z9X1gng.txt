My husband and I were out for a movie and dinner Friday night and decided to eat someplace different . Yes, even we get stuck in a rut and we wanted to try our luck here.
For a Friday night we were pleasantly surprised that restaurant wasn't jammed packed and with a lengthy wait but we were seated quickly near the bar.
Our server offered drinks and we got them in a flash with chips and salsa. The green one was refreshing and very yummy.
I had no problem finding vegetarian options, which I find is usually the case when we dine out. I LOVE black beans and was happy these are on the menu.
I ordered the Veggie fajitas, I know so "typical" but I was in a playful mood and they sounded so darn good. My other half was perusing the menu and a bit shy to order fish (his favorite by the way) since most places over cook it or serve it plain and dry. Salmon is his to die for food and so it was this evening.
We had about a hour or so before our movie and the food arrived quickly so no worries there!
My husband dug in rather hesitantly into his fish and I into my aromatic sizzling vegetables. I was munching down when I realized there was no sound coming from across the table.
Haha.. he was thoroughly enjoying his fish! He said there was flavor and that the fish was cooked to perfection. Moist and not dry at all. The sauce he said was delicious.
Coming from him that is a Gold Award :)
We had enough time to finish our margaritas and make it on time to our movie without breaking a sweat.
The decor is colorful. There is a central area that reminds you of a courtyard . It was pretty busy there the night we were there and the bar looks very friendly. We see there are lunch specials and the Happy Hour has some tasty looking tapas style offerings so we will definitely be coming back for HH.
