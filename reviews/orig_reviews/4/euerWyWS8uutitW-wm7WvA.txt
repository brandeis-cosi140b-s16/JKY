My husband and I call Z'tejas "old reliable". When I don't feel like cooking and/or we need to meet for lunch near our house and don't feel like thinking too much, old reliable it is. 
We really enjoy the burgers, the chipotle mayo is tasty and the bread has a hint of sweetness. Unfortunately, there have been times were the bread was stale, not often but enough to remember.
The shrimp tostadas, fish tacos and tortilla soup are very good as well. The Chambord margarita is delicious and I like the pomegranate-ginger 
margarita martini drink, the ginger-sugar rim is very tasty. 
I have eaten at different Z'tejas locations and they are pretty consistent. 
Service is usually good, never had anything worse than waiting a bit longer for food or our bill.
