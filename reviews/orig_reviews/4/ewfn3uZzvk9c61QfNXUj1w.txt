I am a woman that likes lime in her Mexican Beer. I mean, a LOT of lime. Gallo - you scratch me where I itch! They fresh squeeze lime juice and when mixed with your tecate, you are in heaven!

Aside from the best beer in town, they also have amazing fresh squeezed watermelon & lime juice and iced coffee. The best news of all is that the iced coffee is $1.25 and I heard they order from Cartel in Tempe!

I have been to Gallo twice now. The first time I tried the veggie tacos and took a bite of the veggie torta. Both were seriously to die for. Over the weekend I had the huevos rancheros for brunch, and those too were out of this world! They also have a tomatillo sauce that is super good. 

Not only is the food and drink amazing, but the prices are awesome too! I had breakfast, iced coffee and two beers for $17.  (I did hear over the weekend that they will be raising their prices soon, which sucks, but I would be fine paying more because the quality certainly justifies it!!)

Even better news, you can get all of this POOL SIDE at the Clarendon pool! Ummm... you really cannot go wrong!

I have no complaints about the service. The menu is small but varied, so as a hotel guest I feel like you could eat there a few times during your trip without feeling worn out of the taste.

I am super stoked that Gallo is now in Clarendon, because I will spend my weekends delighting in that delicious Tecate while I munch on some $2 veggie tacos poolside!
