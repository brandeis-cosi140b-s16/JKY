Great food, service,  and environment!!! Their Micheladas are the best. Their food is very good and authentic. We ordered the ostiones preparados, ceviche, and a vuelve a la vida. Everything was delicious and our server was very attentive. If you're okay with a mariachi playing while you eat,this is the place to enjoy great food and music in Vegas.
