I've been to T&T on two separate occasions. The first time was "meh" but the 2nd time I really enjoyed the food. The atmosphere is really nice - I love the inside of The Luxor. Everything is a little pricey, but come on, it's Vegas. Our server was good - very accommodating. I judge a good server based on whether they get all pissy if you ask them for separate checks. He did not and actually did it with a smile. Drinks were good - get a margarita! 

Also get the #1 Alambre Tacos. They were so friggin' good I wanted to run into the kitchen, give the chef a hug, and steal the recipe. They have steak and bacon. STEAK AND BACON!! SOO good. Evidently it's the "#1 Taco is Las Vegas" and I take them at their word.
