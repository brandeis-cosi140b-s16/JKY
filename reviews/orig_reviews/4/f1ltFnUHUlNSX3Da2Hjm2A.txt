First of all guys, if you wanna see a menu of Tequila do check this place. White, Gold, Aged - all types are there and yeah - you can get your fresh margarita made out of them if not interested in having it neat.
Best salsa - it's fresh, spicy, tangy and tempting. I am from India and let me say Yeah its TANGY !!

Tacos as per ur wish, soft, crisp , etc etc. awesome service and a must at the South Park area.
