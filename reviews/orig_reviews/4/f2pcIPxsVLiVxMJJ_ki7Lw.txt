You can get drinks on the lawn while you wait for your table at this family friendly location.  If you ask really nicely they might serve you appetizers there too if you just want a snack and some drinks.  The wait gets to be pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays, so you want to make a reservation if possible.  We had done happy hour before coming here so we ended up not being hungry enough to get any food - I'll have to try that next time.  I love the color scheme here - bright and happy.  Casual to casual-dressy - perfect for jeans and a cute top or a sun dress.  A bit hipster too.

Our drinks were good - I don't remember the name of the one I had but it had lots of cucumber and was delicious!
