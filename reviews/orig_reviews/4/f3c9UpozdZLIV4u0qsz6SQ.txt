This place was clean and the food was good. It is very affordable considering where its located. I mean come on 7 bucks for nachos as an appetizer and it could feed 3! To me that's a great deal. The fajitas are pretty cool..they sprinkle tequila on them and catch them on fire at your table. Overall a great experience.
