Not bad for our first place we ate at on our trip. It was seat yourself when we went, lunch and just when happy hour started. Coupons for buy one get one free drinks floated around to all the tables and our waitress was very attentive. We both got tacos, Charlies tacos and chicken tacos would recommend both although Charlies tacos had a little more spice and flavor to them. Great prices for a quick bite don't expect to be waited on hand and foot it's a casual more bar atmosphere. All in all would recommend and if staying at flamingo again, would come back to for a nice quick lunch. I'm giving this place 4 stars, for what it was it was good, not the very best I've ever had but I would recommend if you're walking around the flamingo and want a bite.
