Loved this restaurant!!  

We have been searching for a yummy Mexican restaurant in Vegas for a long while, and we came across this one during this past trip.  The best part for us, was that this restaurant and its staff really understand gluten free, which is an absolute necessity for my husband, who has celiac disease.  They had a gluten free menu available for him, and YES, the chips were gluten free (fried in their own fryer)!!  This is actually very rare back here in Chicago, so it's nice to see Vegas stepping up!

I ate the fish tacos...pretty darn tasty, although a little rich for me, so I couldn't  finish them all and there were only two.

My husband had the gluten free, enchiladas verde and he was in love. 

I think the best part for the both of us was the amazing guacamole, made fresh at the table.

Oh...and one more thing...we found that the service at the restaurant was wonderful.  Never an empty glass, always patient with our many dietary questions.  Overall, top notch!
