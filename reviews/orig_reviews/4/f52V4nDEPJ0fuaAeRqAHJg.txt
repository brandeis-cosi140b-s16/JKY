Went there for brunch for my aunt's birthday this place was great. I got the wagyu skirt steak and got my eggs poached. It was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the eggs were just right. My grandpa had the pancakes which I suggest trying because one bite and i was hooked. My mother got a mexican twist on eggs benedict which worked really well with jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffins and pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon  My aunt got the steak omelette which looked good but I couldn't try since I'm allergic to avocado. For dessert (like we needed it) we got the tres leche cake which was good but for me had a not so great after taste but maybe it was because of the other stuff I ate. Over all it was good and will go back again for dinner. On a side note my mom got the bottomless bloody mary which is totally worth it since one is $9 and the bottomless is $20 and it had to be the biggest glass of bloody mary I've seen so be prepared to get a lil tipsy early in the day :)
