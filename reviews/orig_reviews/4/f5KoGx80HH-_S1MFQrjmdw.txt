Arriba has been through a lot since I last reviewed it. The original owner passed away and that must have caused some chaos in the background. However, the quality and service here continue to shine. We are regulars--I hate to admit how many times I've been here, but I have an app on my phone that ever-so-helpfully keeps track and tells me whenever I visit.

Some things have actually improved since my last review--the food seems fresher, so there might have been a change in the strategy for pre-cooking certain items or ordering produce. The quality of presentation is also somewhat better. When things come out, they are piping hot and very well arranged. The table salsa is also better and more fresh tasting.

I still can't give Arriba the elusive fifth star because they continue to present themselves as a microbrewery despite the fact that 2 of their 3 microbrews are consistenly "broken" or otherwise unavailable. The one that is working is a skunky brew that tasted like bleach the last time I had it. Whoever they have on the premises doing the microbrews needs to get a new career. So, stay away from those.
