We stayed at the Cosmo a few years ago and have wanted to try this place ever since.  We walked up at about 6 on a Sunday night. They said they could seat us right away at the bar.  After a long day of traveling we were ok with that.  The bar stools are wooden so a little uncomfortable.  We started with the chips and salsa which are fantastic.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita and my husband ordered a coke.  The margarita was some kind of "air" margarita so it was different but good.  For our entrees we ordered the "when pigs fly" which are pulled pork type dumpling rolls, carnitas taco, another beef taco(can't remember the name) and a beet salad.  Portions are a bit small for the price.  That's the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  It was all delicious and service was good!
