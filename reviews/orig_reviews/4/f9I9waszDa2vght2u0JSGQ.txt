Love. If you need pretense and high prices with your Mexican food, Juan's will completely disappoint. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a fast, tasty meal with super friendly service, you've found your place. And dirty cheap, at that. 

Better yet, if you can't find what you want on the combo menu, you're just too damn picky. I have never been to another Mexican restaurant with so many combo plate options--whatever you want, you'll eventually find it on the list. 

Helpful tip: Drinks, weirdly, come in sizes even for dine-in. The "medium" is pretty much a bucket, so save your dinero and don't go any larger.
