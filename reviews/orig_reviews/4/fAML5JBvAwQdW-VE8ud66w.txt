Norm R. sent me an email back in May suggesting I check this place out.
Since it's in my neighborhood, I'd been driving by and waiting for it to open.

I was able to get in the first time in June. We stopped in for a snack (my cousin had just arrived from NYC and was hungry - but we didn't want to eat too much, as we had dinner reservations in a few hours.)

We did a fair sampling of the menu. My cousin had enchiladas, I had tacos, and my sister had a salad. I honestly don't remember who had which protein in which dish - but between the three of us, we had a nice variety.

All of us were content with what we had, and none of us had a difficult time navigating the menu.

Everything was fresh and tasty. Not the most amazing food I've ever had - but it's quick, fresh and affordable. And I think it's a few steps above Chipotle in both flavor and personality.

I've been in a couple times since then, and have always been happy with my selection. The food always hits the spot.

Good stuff! Just hoping they expand to soups - plural. I'd like to see more than chicken tortilla offered.
