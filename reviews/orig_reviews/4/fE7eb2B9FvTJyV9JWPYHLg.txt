I cant pronounce Rokerij but you don't have to be able to pronounce it to enjoy the amazing food.  Rokerij like everyone on here prob. explains has their own full menu + Richardson's menu.  Both menus are amazing in their own right also side note according to the server in just over a month Richardson's will be reopened directly next door, so look for that to finally happen.  Things I love about this place?  The atmosphere is amazing upstairs and down (downstairs is a underground cellar like bar, super cool i posted a picture a while back they serve a full menu as well), you really have to see it to understand how cool it is!  Taking in the restaurant from the outside is kinda strange its really closed in looking (no windows which is normally ok.. if your at a strip club) but once your inside its really calming and pleasant.  Now that you feel comfortable inside we can talk about the food which is equally as amazing.  Richardson's menu is heavy on the garlic so if its not a 1st date go nuts because its worth it, actually F it if she doesn't like you because you like good food then drop her/him.  The Rokerij menu is less heavy on the Mexican food side, its more Americanized burgers, steaks, fish.  I had the mahi-mahi with pineapple salsa and it rocked my taste buds(in the most positive of ways), the fish was cooked perfectly as well as blackened, I recently had eaten fish in San Diego as well as New Zealand and this fish was just as good if not better quality, very impressive.  Another thing they do is cool is you can get these "small plates" 1 for 9 or 2 for 17, it goes on its basically a bunch of tapas like tacos, ahi tuna, prime rib sliders, scallops, steak tartare, etc.  I love tapas and for social settings its a great and delicious idea.  Overall 4 stars for now because i need to eat more items off that tapas menu to upgrade this review, something im looking forward to taking advantage of next time
