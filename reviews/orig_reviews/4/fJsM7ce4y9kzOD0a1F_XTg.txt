So I was in Vegas for the weekend (Electric Daisy Carnival 2011)  and was hungry for some real GOOD mexican food like they have in TJ. So I yelped and found this place. It seemed to be raving with good reviews so I went there.

I got one carne asada taco and one adobaba taco. Many of the reviews said the carne asada taco was flavorful and delicious when to my dismay....it wasn't THAT good as I thought it would be. The meat was bit different than it was over in TJ and it definitely was bland. The guacamole didn't help it at all so I was saddened.

However the ADOBABA taco....WAS to die for! I loved every bite of it so much that I went back for a second one. Trust me, if you got adobaba tacos, you will not be disappointed. It's spicy and just perfect for your tastebuds.

I was going to get the carne asada fries, but after trying the taco, I wasn't going to get it and besides it costs 10 dollars to get it. o_O

Just get the adobaba tacos, do not miss out on this-

I'll come back to this place when I'm in Vegas the next time!
