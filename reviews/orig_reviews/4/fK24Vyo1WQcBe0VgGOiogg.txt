Ii wanted an authentic fast food taco experience and finally found one. My wife suggested we go to the Las Palmas in Brookline (Sunday-noon) and we did. I knew the food was going to be a treat was when we discovered we were the only English speaking people at the taco stand!  Everyone else was speaking Spanish and we were the foreigners!  The owners were very nice and explained the different meats they are cooking. It was wonderful that I was able to select myself was toppings (dozen to chose from!) to put on. Next time we are bring two chairs and a table to make it a five star experience.
