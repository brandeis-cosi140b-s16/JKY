Great Mexican place in Cave Creek. Authentic atmosphere. Food is reasonably priced. The hostess on the other hand is not so nice! Don't ask for outside seating! She'll put you in your place for you being dare enough to ask! I was made to feel like I should be grateful for even getting a seat inside!!!!
