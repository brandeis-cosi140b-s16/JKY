I am not really sure if some of these other folks just hit the restaurant a little early in its inception or perhaps it was just a bad day?

I had a great experience at Revo!  I did not encounter all of the signage, infact I was greeted by what I can only define as a very modern twist on traditional Mexican decoration (pinatas, maracas, etc.).

Overall I would highly reccomend Revo to anyone looking for a good meal with homecooked goodness inside!!

The only thing I might change would be the over compensating wait staff... checking once or twice is cool, but six times was a little much.
