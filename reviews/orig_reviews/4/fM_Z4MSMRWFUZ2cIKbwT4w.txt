Overall, I liked the food and my Mexican craving was satisfied. The fresh peach margarita was really yummy and I appreciated the free chips and salsa. Our server was really friendly and kept the drinks coming. I was okay with the music, but it was really loud. It was loud enough that I could barely hear my sister across the table. They had a DJ and an MC that gave out free shots of tequila to people who were celebrating things. It wasn't cheap for sure, but I thought the prices were reasonable for Las Vegas (more expensive than your hometown, but not ridiculous). I would come back.
