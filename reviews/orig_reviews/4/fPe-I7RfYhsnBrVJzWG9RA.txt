the breakfast burrito is delicious and big!  It will not disappoint.  I love the local, personal feel of this little shop, but I really hope they are doing well.  The past several times I've been, they haven't had any permanent signage up, and I worry that people drive right by and don't even realize that there is a great little restaurant there!
