I like it here....
Went here with a group of friends ans i ordered the red sauce chiliques, not as flavourful (i prefer the ones at La Poblana) but it was a solid meal. My friends all got either pozole or menudo and all seem happy with it and keep in mind most of us are from Mexico and Peru!
I also LOVE, I mean LOVE the fact that their coffee is Del la Olla!! My favourite! I had 4 cups! 
Service was excellent! We were a big group and were seated pretty fast and our waiter was super nice and accommodating. Even took like 20 pictures for us with everyone's cameras. Not a single order was messed up or wrong. Great Great service. 
Definitely going again when in Vegas. It'll be a permanent go to spot!
