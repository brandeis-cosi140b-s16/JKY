I had the adobada torta with the and the fish taco. Torta was amazing, however I think it could have used a bit more meat.  The fried cod taco I think cost too much, however the fish and sauce are delicious, just not worth the price and my corn tortilla fell apart.  Good service in a shopping center restaurant. maybe come back to try the desserts.
