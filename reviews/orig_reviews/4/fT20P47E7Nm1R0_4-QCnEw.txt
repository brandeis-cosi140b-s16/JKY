Tried their take-out the first time, it was great - good food, fresh meat, and big portion.

Went there for lunch at the second time, very good food and it was cheap too. BUT, never order the spicy beef burrito - accidentally ordered it since the waitress spoke Spanish to me and my co-worker(time to study spanish now..), and we both got caught in this spicy dish. Couldn't finish the plate, and stomach did not like it. 

But in one word, good Mexican food. If you happen to be in that area, worth to go.
