Came here after a long hike to refuel and left very full!  Leticia's is a solid Mexican place to stuff yourself silly.  I'm not a Mexican food expert, but everything I had was yummy.  Some may quibble at the lack of authenticity or "overpackaging" (regarding presentation and decor), but the atmosphere is fun and the food is good.  On my visit a couple of days ago, service was a little bit slow, but waitstaff were still nice and fairly accommodating.  Portions are large, prices are mid-range (i.e., not cheap but not wallet-breaking), and the free salsa and chips are really quite good!  Try the meatball soup for something warm and differently delicious.
