After spending a splendid afternoon strolling along Mill Ave, my boyfriend and I abandoned an idea to go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Rural instead opting for America's. And Boy what a great decision! 
The beers were cheap, 2 bucks a bottle, and the limes were fresh! You order inside at a register and when your order is ready someone brings it out to you. I ordered a carne asada Vampiro to share. The customer service was great, not afraid to talk with customers and describe the dishes. 
3.75 for the Vampiro, which is basically a tostada piled high with fresh ingredients. It was delicious!
Added bonus America's serves an Horchata iced coffee. Dream come true!!
