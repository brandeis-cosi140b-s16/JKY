I recently returned to Phx from Portland "bad Mexican food" Oregon.  Thank god for La Condesa.  I am lucky to live near by and plan to enjoy their Oaxacan Black Mole tacos on a very regular basis.  Salsa bar is inspired.  My only complaint -- and perhaps I haven't studied the menu thoroughly -- I'd like some salad to cut the incredibly rich food.
