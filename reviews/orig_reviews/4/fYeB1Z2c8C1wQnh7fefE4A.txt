I've always liked Dos Gringos and it was on our "pub crawl" a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday I just returned.  Funny fact:  You can bring a baby into most any bar in Scottsdale, but Dos Gringos will put up a stink (it was 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon - not even a night-time-party-time - and they said the baby wasn't allowed.  One of the girls we were with hunted down the manager and told him this was America and it was the baby's god given right to be in a bar (yeah, it was hard to keep a straight face).  Long story short, the baby was allowed in.  Once we were in, other kids were already in there too.  If you're going to let any kids in, I would think babies would be your safest bet.  All they care about is breast milk and naps.  They're not going to be sneaking drinks.  

Anyway, I love Dos Gringos' Mexican Moonshine, I love that you can sit outside and relax and I've never actually had anything bad here, so four stars it is.
