They have the best server here.  Seriously, if serving was a sport, there would be scouts trying to steal this guy away from this Arriba's.  I wish all servers were exactly like him.  He puts great thought and attention into his suggestions.

Aside from server of the year, Arriba's is a my favorite of the Garcia/Macayo type of Mexican food chains.  The food tastes fresh and it seems like there's some thought behind the menu, not just the typical meals.  It's not my first pick of restaurants but they have cheap margaritas!
