Great service! I appreciate the attention given to us by the staff. It was a little dark in there (ambiance), but the waiter and manager gave us flashlights so we can read the menu. Everything came out quickly - chips and dip and water came out within a couple minutes of our being seated. Started off wih the Rigo Margarita. I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking, so that got me tipsy in a few minutes. The menu had a good selection of dishes - not your typical Mexican restaurant menu.  I settled on the Torta de Pierna (Roast Pork Mexican Sandwich), served with a heaping helping of french fries -  the first time I've seen french fries in a Mexican restaurant! I ate everything on the plate. Lol, the busboy even commented that I almost ate the plate! Good sandwich. Veruka ordered the Beef Chimichanga. She only ate half then said she was full - geez, I can't take this chick anywhere! ;-)  At some point in time,  I want to come back to try the other dishes on the menu.
