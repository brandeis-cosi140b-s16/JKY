Tubbs is a great spot for Tex-Mex (not authentic Mexican food), and has a great salsa bar. I would recommend getting a margarita from the menu, but not their traditional one because they have so much more to offer. The Frito burrito never disappoints, and the service is always excellent. Be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends, but you can head to One Barrel for a beer while you wait!
