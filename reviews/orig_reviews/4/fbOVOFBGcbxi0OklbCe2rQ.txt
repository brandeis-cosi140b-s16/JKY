Excellent all around... Loved the old school atmosphere , seated right away (was Mother's Day) nice friendly service ... Texas Margarita was SO good (just wish it was bigger) Finally , BEST Mexican food I've had since moving here from SD .. Big portion (I coulda shared) .. When we got the check I even got a rose for Mother's Day :) the only reason for 4 star is I think the Margaritas could be bigger. Otherwise it's a great place and I WILL be back.
