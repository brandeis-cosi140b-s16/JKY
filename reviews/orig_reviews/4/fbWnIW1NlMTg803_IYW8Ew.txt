I don't usually dig Mexican food so I wasn't too thrilled when my husband suggested we give this place a try. He was suckered in by the large glass windows and the restaurant's location, perched high atop a mountain overlooking the Vegas valley. (The view did NOT disappoint, by the way! It's a great place to take out of town visitors to impress them with a stunning view). 

The restaurant is large and spacious. The hostess was super friendly, and you walk in right by the open kitchen. The menu is large with all sorts of interesting and creative dishes (I got a chicken breast cooked with sweet peppers and topped with cream and it was amazingly tasty). I also asked if I could have veggies instead of rice and beans and they said no problem and were very accommodating! All dinners come with freshly made flour tortillas (sooooo yummy), rice & beans (or a vegetable medly of mushrooms, onions, zucchini and peppers if you ask), and a pretty dang good cup of soup (tomato broth with noodles). Another big plus is that they serve Pepsi products. Nothing's better than a fizzy Diet Pepsi on a hot day!

The complimentary corn chips, salsa and bean dip were nothing to write home about, but we managed to gobble down almost the entire basket. The food really is "Mexican gourmet" as advertised. The ingredients tasted fresh and the options inspired. There are also standard items for picky eaters (tacos, quesadillas, fajitas). 

The best thing about this place is the service! We had TOP NOTCH service, better service than we have had in some of the fancy places in town! I kid you not. We never had to ask for anything or needed anything. It was amazing. The service here is something that really surprised me but it will keep me going back!
