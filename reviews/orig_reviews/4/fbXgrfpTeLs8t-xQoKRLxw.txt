Oh how I miss the Crab Enchiladas in Verde (green) sauce!  One of my favorite Mexican plate of food anywhere.  They have the best chips, salsa and hot bean dip to snack on while waiting for your entrees as well.

*insider Tip*

If there is a wait for the restaurant, walk into the cantina and seat yourself.  It never fails for me...there is always at least one booth available immediately to the left of the cantina entrance (a bit hidden.)  I also think the service is much faster in the cantina as the waiters are in there often getting drinks for the restaurant customers.
