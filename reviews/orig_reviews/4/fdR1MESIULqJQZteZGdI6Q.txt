Love this little spot in Phoenix. Saying you went to Dick's Hideaway is almost like bragging that you know how to get there. It's tucked away in this little strip mall and it has maybe 3 tables and a bar you can sit at. Went for breakfast and we had the huevos rancheros and the meatloaf. We were so full and had food leftover. Nice place to take a gf/bf for brunch.
