Love Blanco!
We went during happy hour and sampled many items. Blood orange margaritas, hibiscus margaritas, guac, nachos, requires- all were excellent...and half price!! We had a cute little waitress Chloe who was sweet and very attentive.
Saw no pretentious, snotty people as mentioned in previous reviews, just happy customers and employees. Thanks Blanco!
