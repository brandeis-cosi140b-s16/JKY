We came here CInco de Mayo weekend and this place was rockin! We ended up eating indoors, away from the festivities because we were looking for a quieter dining experience and let me tell you, the food, service and atmosphere are great!

They have well over 100 different kinds of tequila and a margarita flight where you can try four of your choice, which is actually a great deal.

Here's a tip, get the enchiladas done Christmas style. They mix the red and green chile so you don;t have to pick just one! Your taste buds will thank you (and me!).
