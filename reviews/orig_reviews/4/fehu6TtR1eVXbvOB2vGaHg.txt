Great Mexican Food!
They have a Big Menu, including fresh made Tamales and Breakfast!

The prices a little higher, but you get full service, and you get what you pay for.
Portions are generous! I couldn't finish my meal - and I'm a big guy.

They always start you with Fresh 'out of the oven' Chips & Salsa - which is Awesome! 
I enjoyed the Chicken Burrito served enchilada style, with green sauce.
My bride had the Chile Relleno dish with a Taco.
Both were Really Good!
The only negative was the Taco. We were expecting a 'East-Side' street style Taco, but got a pre-formed shell stuffed with the goods. 
Would have been 5 stars, but the taco dropped them to 4 star.

I have been here a couple times, always for (work) lunch, and this time was just as good as my other visits.

I will been coming back again, and I would recommend it to my friends.
There's lots of seating and Full Bar.  Margaritas...
Just skip the tacos - go for the more exotic items, you'll be happy.
