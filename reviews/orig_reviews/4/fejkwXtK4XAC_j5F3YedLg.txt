We went here for lunch after I read about it in Sunset Magazine. I liked it a lot. The corn was d'lish, as was the Carne Asada Burrito, though it was a tad small for $5.45. (They offer a larger one for $7.95) I guess I'm spoiled living in San Diego where I can get a Carne Asada burrito for super cheap! But I have to say the meat here was wayyyy better than most I've had at home. There was not ONE SINGLE bit of fatty gristle in my burrito. 
And the burrito was simply made with only a few ingredients (meat, guac, pico de gallo, and onions) so I could really taste the smoky goodness of the meat. I liked it a lot. In fact, I liked it so much I went there twice in one weekend! 
Try the corn with cotija cheese - YUM! And also make sure to drink one of America's Margarita's. I liked the Tamarindo but my husband liked the Jamaica.  Heck, try both!
