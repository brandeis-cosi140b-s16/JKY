Loved my night at the Mission. It was a warm, March night. Expect a wait, we were on the list for about an hour, but no worries, we went to a nearby bar for margaritas. 
Sat on the patio, it was a mellow scene outside, much louder and darker inside. 

Get the table side guacamole. It was one of the best guacamoles I'd ever had and watching the guac chef whip it up from his little cart was pretty fun. (Disclaimer: I am highly partial to the avocado and would probably eat them rotten.) 

Steak tacos were delish. So simple - steak, avocado, lime in corn tortillas. The chicken were good but not our favorite. 

Mojito was delicious although they added fizzy water which isn't my favorite. 

Service was great. Would definitely return here for another night.
