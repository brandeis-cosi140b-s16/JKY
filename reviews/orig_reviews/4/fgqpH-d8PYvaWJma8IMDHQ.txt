Happy to live so close this Carolina's, it makes a great option for dinner when I don't want to cook. It's one of the few "fast food" places my family will order from these days.

They have the best homemade tortillas and refried beans.  I like that they have Diet Dr. Pepper in the fountain and my husband loves the horchata drinks, both are self serve.  My favorite is the Oaxaca burrito, my husband always orders the beef tacos, and the kids order burritos.  The tamales are good as well, sometimes better then other times.  You can also buy their chorizo by the pound and the tortillas by the done which we do and make breakfast burritos at home. 

The location is easy to find at the 101 off Peoria.  We can feed our family of four (2 teenagers) for right around $20 with drinks.  Just remember they are closed on Sundays!
