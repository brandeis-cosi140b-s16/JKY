One of my all time favorite spots in Phoenix. I grew up around the corner from this resturant and I could not get enough of their delicious, fresh chips and salsa, chicken taco baskets and cheese crisps. Even now when I come back to Phoenix its always on my to do list.The place hasnt changed much in the past 15 years you can always expect decent priced food a little on the indulgent side ( greasy) but the chips and salsa and margaritas never dissapoint. Its a family place that I will always adore!
