This is what Chevy's wishes it was but never will be...
We were tired of the buffet and steak house places so we walked across the street from the Wynn and ventured in here.  What a wonderful and pleasant surprise.  First let me get it out of the way, this place is pricey, entrees are around $20 and margaritas $10 and up.  But the food quality and portions more than make up for that.  We first went with the chips and salsa, you get 3 salsas, a classic pico de gallo, a green one and a spicy red.  All were fresh and delicious and the chips are the thick homemade kind that were oh so good.  We then ordered the queso fundido (with chorizo) and that thing was huge and very good.  It includes some mini handmade corn tortillas that go well with the cheese.  My husband also ordered the tortilla soup which was hearty and tasty.  I went with the shrimp and steak fajitas as my main dish and my husband had the chicken enchiladas.  I must say I typically don't care about rice but this rice is awesome, so incredibly flavorful topped off with pico de gallo.  The margaritas we had were very good too, the big stick one was yum.  This place is decorated very nice too, it almost made me think I was in the Mayan Riviera.  I also like the private tequila dining room, very nice for a large dinner party.  This is a good option for Mexican food on the strip and I would return again.
