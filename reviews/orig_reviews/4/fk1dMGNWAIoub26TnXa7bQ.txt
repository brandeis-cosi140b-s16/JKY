this place is cute and quaint and you forget that the menu items are numbered. we've been here a half-dozen times and their food never disappoints. 

normally we have the fish tacos or vegetarian burrito. both very tasty and very satisfying. house margs are 5.50 for a small and more for a large .

the menu is pretty extensive and you can get pretty much whatever mexican food your're in the mood for.

plus, it's so close to us!
