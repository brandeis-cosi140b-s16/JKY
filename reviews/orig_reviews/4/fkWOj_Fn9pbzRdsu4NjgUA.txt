This place opens at 9am and I am hungry, so we head out for some good Mexican food.  The service is great, considering we one of a couple of tables, this early, not too many people here. 

I get my order in for a combination plate, I think it's called Patzcuaro, it included a chile relieno, one tamale, Green chicken enchilada and sour cream with onions.  The chips and salsa are very fresh, the chips are warm, the salsa and bean dip is very spicy.  And they offer a refill!  We get a small cup of soup, with noodle, hot but needs a little kick, so I add some of the salsa on the table.  The food comes out pipping hot and the cheese all melted the way I like it.  A very good meal.

The food is fresh, the service is great and they are open early.
