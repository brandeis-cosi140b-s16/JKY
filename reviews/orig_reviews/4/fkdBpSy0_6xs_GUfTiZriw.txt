More Salsa, MORE! Is what I wanted, and this is why I brought 2 more coworkers here today for lunch.

This time I was smart and park on the side of the building making it much easier to get in and out.

We arrived just in time a line quickly formed behind us.

Ordering took some time as there was someone who was new and quite flustered at the whole process.

Today I tried the veggie tacos. As with all of their tacos they came as two corn tortillas. Inside was a small amount of grilled vegetables including mushrooms peppers. The items were very well grilled which I liked but it may be a bit too much for most. The Tacos were quite small but to enlarge my meal I only ate the inside tortilla, and then made a salsa, Jamaica, bean and rice burrito with my outer tortilla. 

The chips today were much much better; however they were a bit salty.  Today there were a few new salsa items, including a saut√©ed onions and pepper chutney that was great. 

The salsa bar itself seemed to be a bit neglected in the lunch rush with many of the trays sitting empty and many of the little signs missing the salsa that should have been under it.  It was nice to have the fresh crunch of the Jamaica at the salsa bar.

One of my co workers loved his Mayan tacos, and had a lot of fun with the salsa selection. Another coworkers mole` tacos were not her favorite, considering she is from Mexico I will take her word for it.  

The storefront became notably small as the tables were  filled and we all kept bumping into one another's chairs.

Will I be back?  Yes.  Am I in a rush to go back? Not really the salsa bar gets it the stars as the price is a bit steep.
