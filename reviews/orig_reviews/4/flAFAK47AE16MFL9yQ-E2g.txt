This visit brought 9 of us in for dinner, thankfully with reservations! 
Jordana was a wonderful waitress, very attentive & knowledgeable about the menu & tequila.

Tortilla chips - Warm & lightly salted, with not ONE, but TWO salsas! The staple red salsa & my favorite: the verde / tomatillo. Again, Jordana kept the chip bowls filled.

My kitty margarita had just the right amount of tequila & "bite" to it & was in a reasonably sized glass.

I decided to go with the shake down shrimp taco & gringo beef taco. I'm not a big fan of beans or rice, so thankfully Jordana said I could substitute other sides. I went with the BBQ buttered corn & a double helping of the chipotle citrus slaw.

Shake down shrimp taco - lightly breaded & seasoned nicely. The shredded cabbage made a nice compliment, as did the pico de gallo. 
Due to my overloading on chips, I was unable to finish the beef taco or corn. I took this home to the boyfriend & he loved both. :)

Dion L. - resident foodie! :) also wanted us all to try the chimichanga, which was AMAZING! Luckily, 4 of us shared bites of it. It was full of flavor. Dion & I commented that it tasted like something yummy from the fair.

The atmosphere was cozy & warm, it didn't necessarily have a "theme" that I could tell, although their were a lot of warm tones of brown & amber. The music was rather interesting...jumping from rock to country every other song. :D

Overall, I'm pleased with my trip to Paco's.
