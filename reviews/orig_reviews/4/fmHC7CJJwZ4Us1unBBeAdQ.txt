Texas visiting this weekend.  GREAT patio. OMG loved every bit of being outside.  The food is really pretty good but the tastes here are a smidge different than Texas.  I like my food spicy. I had the green enchiladas that were just wonderful and the black beans were NOT bland.  The salsa and guacamole are wonderful here.  Beer ice cold too.  Would come back again.
