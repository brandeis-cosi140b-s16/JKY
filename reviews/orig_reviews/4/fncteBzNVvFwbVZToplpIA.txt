I went to ASU for my undergrad and have eaten at Oregano's MANY times, yet I never noticed this place right next door!

I ate dinner here on Friday night about 8 pm. The restaurant seemed pretty empty inside and the patio was only about 60% full so there was no wait for a table. I enjoyed the chips and salsa they provide. For my entree I ordered the gaucho steak tacos with a chopped salad as my side. The chopped salad was pretty good - just your standard iceberg lettuce with some tortilla strips and an avocado slice on top.  The tacos were better and had lots of guacamole on top which I loved!  My only complaint was the steak was a little tough and stringy (got caught in my teeth a lot). 

It was a nice, quiet, laidback place to enjoy a relaxed meal of above average quality food. I would come here again!
