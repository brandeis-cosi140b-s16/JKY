Mercadito is an upscale Americanized Mexican food, a genre we regularly enjoy.

When we first found Mercadito on Yelp the review was 3.5 stars, so we put it lower on the list. After all, Vegas has so many great restaurants!

But boy was I wrong. I totally should have tried this place earlier!

Their chips and guacamole was ridiculous - super fresh and had so many ingredients in there including sweet potatoes and... bacon! mmmm

Then the fish tacos and shrimp tacos... these days we only order seafood tacos whenever available, and theirs were simply amazing. One of the best Americanized tacos I've ever had.

And when we finished and asked our server a box... he brought us a fresh bag of chips! A kind of service unheard of before.

If you're in doubt, go for yourself and find out... price is a bit steep but totally worth it.
