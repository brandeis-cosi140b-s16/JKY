We stopped in at Serrano's about 2 weeks ago, on our way home from work. We had heard good things and couldn't wait to try it. I had a chorizo taco and my hubby had a burrito. I was excited about the cinnamon cheesecake chimichanga, so I only ordered one taco. The meal was excellent! Hot, prepared fresh for our order and served up quickly to go. We loved the sauce and salsa bar and took little samples of about 6 different types home. All were delicious and we agreed with an Hispanic friend that the refried beans and Mexican rice are excellent. We found the price to be no more than any other place in the area (even on a budget), and it definitely was fresher tasting than a traditional 'fast food' joint. We can't wait to try it again!
