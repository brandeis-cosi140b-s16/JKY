I should be out running right now and not writing this review, but with Urban Taco fresh in my mind and belly I thought I would crank it out. Place is near my new fav bar Linger Longer Lounge so that's a plus! Okay, it's a Thursday night and I have been drinking for about two weeks straight so this was a food only mission. My gal and I ordered up some chips and a grouping of salsas. All but one of the salsas were shockingly thick. But don't worry, these salsas will get any mariachi band up and trumpeting. Roasted corn, avocado crema, green chili w/ cilantro, cucumber and roasted tomato/poblano. Usually there will be a salsa that falls flat. Not here, all are loaded with flavor and with the thin chips are a must! Wow, I could really use a pacifico beer. No, stay focused and dry!! Next on the list is two street tacos. Pork belly with potato? What, can you mix that shit? Hell yeah, and to my surprise it was a mashed potato. Unreal. All I can say is unreal. My second choice, the short rib. Moist (hate that word) short rib with some greens and sauce. Delicious! Now the gathering tables will leave you little room for your thighs and the service can be a bit dodgy, but they are very friendly and appreciate the business.
