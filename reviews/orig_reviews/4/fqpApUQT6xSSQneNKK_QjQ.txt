Don't let her looks fool you Las Glorias is awesome! Sure she is located in a run-down strip mall but the food is delicious!

Piping hot chips are served with salsa and a yummy bean dip. Big, cheap margaritas and great specials on combo plates. I got the 2 burrito plate and had one left over for lunch the next day. The carne asada and pork are both excellent.  I have to remember Wednesday's - DOLLAR Tacos!!!!

The servers are friendly and the d√©cor is tacky. This is a great Mexican place.
