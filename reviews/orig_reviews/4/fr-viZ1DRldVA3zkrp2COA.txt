I love good food and I am a very finicky diner. I've introduced many friends to this hidden restaurant. 
However, I was very disappointed when I tried ordering one of my favorite dishes to find it is no longer available! Costillas Verdes, was a delicious combination of fall off the bone ribs, green salsa and cactus. It was among the most authentic items on the menu. Now it's gone!
Please bring back this rare authentic delicious food item. The restaurant did not replace the Costillas with anything even coming close to comparable.
