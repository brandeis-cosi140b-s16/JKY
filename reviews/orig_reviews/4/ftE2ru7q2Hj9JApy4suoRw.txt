Just moved here and this was Mmy first non-chain restaurant in Phoenix. Loved the chips. Loved the squirt bottle of red sauce on the table. Yummy smokey flavor. I want to marry that sauce. My flauta was a bit overcooked, but tried other peoples dishes and they were great. I'm craving the green tamale right NOW. Best of all was the service. Very friendly. Definitely coming back.
