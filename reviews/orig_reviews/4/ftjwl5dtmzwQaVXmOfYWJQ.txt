Took out this afternoon to try some dishes and were really impressed with everything we ordered.  Believe it or not, the pot stickers with corn sauce were amazing and the crab cakes were excellent, too.  For entrees, I had the Roswell Reuben which was really tasty (with pastrami not corned beef) and my wife had the blue corn enchiladas which she thoroughly enjoyed. We also tried the chicken fried chicken which was very, very good...so we will definitely put Carlsbad Tavern in our restaurant rotation.

Thanks again to Check Please Arizona for calling our attention to a restaurant we probably wouldn't have tried without seeing it reviewed.
