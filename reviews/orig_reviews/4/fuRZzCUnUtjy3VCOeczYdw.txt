The ribs in the prepared foods area are a standout among lots of great items. Mexican spices dry rubbed into ribs is fantastic. The Rotisserie chicken gets a similar treatment. 

I miss the Pro's Ranch operation however, hence the missing fifth star. The former eat-in area had a salsa bar with chips. Now the salsas are behind the counter meaning a wait if you need more, or forget to ask when picking up the meal. And no more Ranchie the Bull greeting at the entrance, or Ranchie hats.
