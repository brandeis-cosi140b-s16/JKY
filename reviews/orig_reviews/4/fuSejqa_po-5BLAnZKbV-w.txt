We dined at Toro's Spanish Kitchen on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was not very crowded. The dining room offers a choice of high top and regular height tables. Also, several patio tables with umbrellas. 
Our server was friendly and helpful. Service began with a basket of bread. Orders are submitted to the kitchen electronically table side. The orders were delivered fairly quickly. 
The Angus Sliders (3 to an order) were tasty and have a smoke paprika flavor. If you look at the inside of the burger it may seem to be under cooked but it is actually the paprika that's mixed with the meat. The Sizzling Chili Shrimp (5 to an order) are very good. Use the bread to soak up the sauce, YUM.  Sweet Piquillo Peppers stuffed with Crab Meat are delicious. They come 2 to an order and are served in a tomato sauce. This is another winner.
A pitcher of White Sangria was reasonably priced and had a nice fruit flavor. 
The menu has a good variety of items which calls for a few return trips.
Toro's Spanish Kitchen is a nice addition and adds variety to the dining choices in the Summerlin Community.
