We drove 30 minutes to try this place out, it was busy when we arrived and I have to say for a restaurant that was featured on TV, this place really needs to expand and get a new space! People love you so you guys deserve it. The kitchen was backed up 35 minutes which was a bummer since I couldn't order  the French toast Frys to go after we ate. I just wanted them for dessert but they were too backed up!

All in the all, the burgers were good. The menu is unique and I definitely enjoyed mine. Will go back but only if I'm in there the area!
