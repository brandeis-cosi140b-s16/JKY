The ambiance is very cool, very quaint and adorable.  I love the feel of the potted plants all around outside.  My favorite of this place is the salsa!  A very simple chips and salsa but they nailed it- just the right kind of spice and flavor, very good.  My second favorite part is the selection of condiments/sauces that they bring to your table.  My husband is a huge condiments fan, I can't wait to take him here.  I didn't go full 5 stars because our server wasn't the brightest- couldn't hear me at all and didn't get my order right.  However, everything was really tasty and very reasonably priced!  Total bill for a friend and I with drinks was less than $40.  I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family.
