Hidden gem in Las Vegas! I would not have found this place if it had not been for another conference attendee who mentioned it to me. I went with a group of 5 and we had an amazing time. The server was full of personality and made the experience very enjoyable. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made quite a few suggestions on items that we would not normally have ordered. Most of the group ordered the street tacos, but my friend got the pollo rostizado (which was amazing!). The chips are hot and fresh with yummy salsa. We also ordered the guacamole, which is made at the table (highly recommend). I actually may go back tonight....and with all of the awesome restaurants in Las Vegas, that is saying a lot!
