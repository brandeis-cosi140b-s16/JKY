I went to Gallo Blanco last night with a group of 8, and, overall, I was very happy!  The food was fantastic.  I had the guacamole, smoked elote, a carne asada taco, a shrimp taco, and the tres leches cake.  I loved everything, but especially the elote and the tres leches.  The tres leches was topped with ice cream and strawberry sauce, and it was some of the best I've ever had!  I tasted a friend's shrimp and grits, and that was quite good as well.  I'm from the southeast, so I'm picky about shrimp and grits, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was!  I also had a glass of sangria, which was alright, but it was pretty sweet, and there was more fruit in the glass than drink.  That was disappointing.  The service also was not fantastic.  I understand serving a larger group can be difficult, but there were 20 or more minute time spans where we never saw our server.  We were sitting in the lounge area, and the server basically told us that she kind of forgets about that area...not exactly what we wanted to hear.  She was nice and got our orders correct, but I would have preferred a little more attention, especially since we were a larger group.  My only other complaint was that it was rather warm in the area where we were seating, and there's nothing more uncomfortable to me than trying to eat while you're sweating.  Having said that, I really enjoyed the meal, and I will definitely go back.  With everything I ate, my check was under $25 for happy hour!
