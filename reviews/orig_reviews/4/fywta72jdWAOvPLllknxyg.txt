Though it's a little bit off the beaten path, this was one of the first restaurants I was taken to upon moving to Charlotte, which says a lot about it, I think. Smack dab in the middle of NoDa, CFT is worth checking out if only so that you have an excuse to check out the funky neighborhood its nestled in. 

But the food and drink are worth it, too. As the name implies, try the fish tacos. My girlfriend's obsessed, and they're prepared the same way they are in Mexico--lightly battered, served with cilantro and all the fixins. Very fresh and very tasty, and not too expensive at all. The other food is standard mexican--nothing too transcendent, but it's all very good, too. I love the drinks here, and they sometimes have margarita specials which are worth checking out. 

As for its environment, we love this place. It's small and intimate, so we love a date night here (clearly we're not alone). Definitely a good plan: go check out a gallery opening and eat here before or after. Or grab a romantic cocktail on your way home from some art-buying. Tres classy.
