Affordable delicious tex-mex in the area. We had the grilled tilapia - it was one of the best pieces of fish we've had in a while. Also had the chicken with spinach artichokes and mushroom - this was pretty good as well! Good happy hour prices and free cornbread before your meal- overall really good!
