Ok it feels wrong to add stars for this reason, but I'm doing it anyways. As my coworkers have a borderline obsession with this place, I'm learning to adapt. I'm on a loose sort of "diet" (very strong word), I'm really trying to avoid Mexican food joints as they are very hard to eat semi-healthy at. 

As I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call "diet".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire). Some of the best grilled chicken I've had in awhile... yay for a mexicn place that has something on the menu not full of lard !
