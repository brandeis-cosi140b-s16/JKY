First off I will say I am a New Mexican and have lived in NM most of my life so I came into this place thinking I was going to be disappointed. Well... I was wrong. Blue Adobe knows how to make some killer New Mexican dishes. I had there Carne Adovada enchiladas which were excellent. The Carne Adovada was tender and cooked to perfection. Chips and salsa were also really good although there chile and salsa could of been hotter it was still good. The only thing I was disappointed with were there margaritas. There silver coin margarita was weak and not worth the 10 bucks.
