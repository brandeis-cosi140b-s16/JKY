Just had a mid-day lunch at Modern Margarita. Great Place! I am not one to write a review about a restaurant, but felt compelled for MM.

Nice place to go for lunch! My wife and I sat outside on the patio, which provided us with a nice view of the whole establishment. Attention to detail is obvious, with the natural wood colors, and concrete countertops on the bar.

I was curious about the Hot Mango Margarita, so I thought I would give it a try. Yeap...It's spicy!. But really good. Worth a try. We both enjoyed our food, (Pork Street Taco's and Steak Salad) and the presentation. The service was friendly and attentive.

After going for lunch, we now want to go back from dinner and drinks. The day time vibe is cool, but I bet the evening is even better. 

To the owners...nicely done. We look forward to coming back and spreading the word! Thanks for opening in City North. It's nice to see businesses opening up in this great location!

GRACIAS!
