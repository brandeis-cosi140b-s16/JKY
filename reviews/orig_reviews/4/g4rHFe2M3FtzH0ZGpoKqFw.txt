Extreme dim lights ,people everywhere and good smell coming from the tiny kitchen.
   
   Apart from the crazy designs they have on the wall;i did keep starring at them until i was there and i think most of them were dragons or atleast looked like them.

    I ordered the Golden tofu and i love it for two reasons
a.It is tofu :D
b.it had biscotti texture on the outside

Woah!! Biscotti filled with soya who wouldn't love it?? I definitely do!! I went to this place twice and i ordered the same thing.Not my fault!! *Keeps a sad doggy face* they do not have many vegetarian choices .

   But it is  a great place to go hang out with friends and try talking.Note the point TRY TALKING.That's because they play the music so loud like a club,therefore by the time you are out of the place you have lost your voice or your ear drums.But don't worry you shall survive with the yummy food :)

   wow!! This all explains the name MAD Mex :)
