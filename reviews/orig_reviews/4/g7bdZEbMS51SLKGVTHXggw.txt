Excellent food and good service!

Went for lunch with a coworker, who had never been here before. Both of us enjoyed the salsa and very unique tortilla chips. Wish I had ordered the made-at-the-table guacamole. Prices were very reasonable (especially for downtown Phoenix).

Both of us ate more than we should have. The servings were huge and dee-licious! Way too full to even think of ordering dessert. More reason to return!
