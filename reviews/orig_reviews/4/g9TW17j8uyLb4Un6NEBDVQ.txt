Setting:  It is the racially most funniest place I've been to!  And I mean that in a good way.  The ordering system you'll have to get used to, but even that was rather fun.  The seating area is not restaurant-like...it's more like a hall with rented chairs.  Bathrooms are not-so clean unfortunately.  They have lots of funny stuff for you to look at on the walls.

Food:  Amazing pollo diablo!  Spicy and garlicky, just the way I like it.  Prices are very decent.  They all go in a foil bowl, which doubles as a to-go plate for peeps on the go.

Service:  Awesome folks.  Very helpful.  For rookies like me they were willing to fill out my order form for me.  But I did it anyway...just to see how much I can screw it up.  All in all, good times.
