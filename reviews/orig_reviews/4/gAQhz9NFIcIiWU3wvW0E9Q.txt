If you like street tacos, these are some of the best in town.  This is a hole in the wall taco joint with a limited menu with a major emphasize on the street taco.  I recommend the asada and al pastor tacos, they are both very flavorful.  I ordered 3 tacos at $2.00 ea. and was completely filled up.  Give them a try if you are in the area (Thomas / 32nd St.)
