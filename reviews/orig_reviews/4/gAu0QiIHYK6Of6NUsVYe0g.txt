Me and my sis ate here back in November after seeing it featured on Rachel Ray's Tasty Travels. I ordered the Mole Enchiladas w/ Chicken. They were delicious and very filling. My sis ordered a chicken tamale and shared my rice and beans. The chips are excellent and we both loved the beans they give you to dip your chips in. It was a nice touch. Will definitely be coming back.
