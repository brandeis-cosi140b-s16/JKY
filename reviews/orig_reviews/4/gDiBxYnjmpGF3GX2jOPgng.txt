1) The pomagranate/grapefruit margarita.  Pink grapefruit cuts the sweetness of the pom perfectly.

2) Camarones Taco was delicious.  Shrimp had a tasty chipotle sauce (ok, I'm pretty sure it was chipotle).

3) Delicious chips and salsa.

Fast service on the patio at rush hour.  Misting jets to keep it cool.
