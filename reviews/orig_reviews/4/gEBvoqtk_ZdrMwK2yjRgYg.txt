An airport shuttle driver recommended this restaurant, as it was fairly close to the Thunderbird School of Global Management, where I was headed for the week.  Though, in reality, it feels like nothing is close to anything in Phoenix.  She said that she sends people there regularly, and she gets good feedback from those she sends.

One of the things I loved about it: it's not just another Tex-Mex restaurant pretending to represent the cuisine of this vast country called Mexico.  Their menu features dishes from all around Mexico and unless you can't break your non-adventurous self from burritos, then you'll probably experience something new and delicious.  

By the way, our party of four did not experience any of the others' comments about poor service.  The young woman who served us was prompt, cheerful, courteous, attentive, and was happy to take a group photo of us using my phone. She was even rather easy on the eyes for us four men.  I'd recommend the place.
