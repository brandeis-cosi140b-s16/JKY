My family has been coming here for 17 years and we have NEVER had a bad meal or service. Their hot sauce and chips are amazing. Try the chunky hot salsa too!  You never run out of chips or salsa because the wait staff is on the ball! The chicken they use for their food is delicious. They cook it with tomatoes and green chiles. It's a totally casual hole in the wall restaurant but they make very good Mexican food.
