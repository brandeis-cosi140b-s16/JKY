Went there with a large group of people with last minute plans and was thankful to still
snag a table without reservations on a Friday night. We came right before happy hour was over and decided to get margaritas seeing it is a Mexican restaurant. The drinks were great... And cheap! Very rarely do I think you can find fulfilling drinks that aren't overpriced in the market square, but this place has them. They paired great with the homemade chips & guacamole!
