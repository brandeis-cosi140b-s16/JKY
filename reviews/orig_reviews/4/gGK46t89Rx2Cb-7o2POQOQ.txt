Im really glad this new location opened so close to my house! Were big fans of the wings at the original Loco location, and now we dont have to go all the way to Scottsdale for them (like its far, but I digress).

This location is about twice the size (inside) of the Scottsdale location. It was clean and theres a variety of different places to sit. We chose the bar tops in the corner. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We had our Loco staples: the salt and pepper wings (so, so good), and tacos. I actually tried the shredded pork taco this time as opposed to the steak one I usually get and I was not disappointed.

Loco has some great daily specials (taco Tues, wing Wed, etc) and their happy hour specials are great.

Im sure this will become a Mill Ave staple.
