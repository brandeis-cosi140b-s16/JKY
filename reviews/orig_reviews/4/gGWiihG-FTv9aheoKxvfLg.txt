This place is simply good food at a great price.  I love their authentic chicken tacos and the salsa is wonderful, but some of their other dishes are just OK.  The atmostphere is nothing special and they don't serve alcohol, so don't expect a whole lot more than a good meal and some awesome chips and salsa.
