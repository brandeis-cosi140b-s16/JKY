What's better than a margarita? A big Azz margarita and I had two. 

The interior of this location has a great loft feel and is breezy, chill and laid back and has plenty of room for every one.  The house was packed on a Sunday at 6pm but I was still seated within 5 minutes.  My eyes lit up when I saw on the menu  Kaya's Yucatan Black Bean Dip!  Whomever at Madmex put that on the menu kudos to you Sir or Madam.  

So for my other two dips  I ordered the, Tomatillo-Avocado, and the pico de gallo.

The pico de gallo was dry and way over peppered the whole thing tasted of pepper and not much else. 

I am trying to clear off my calendar so that I can get back to Mad Mex for some more tequila and good eats! 

Listen pals get the Black Bean Dip!
