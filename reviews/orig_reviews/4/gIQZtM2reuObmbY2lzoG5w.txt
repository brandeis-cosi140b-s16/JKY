The food here is fantastic! The tacos were fantastic! The salsa was great too. It is a very nice hole in the wall with fab food. 

Special mention goes to the steak verde taco-phenomenal! 

As stated before the service is ok, the neighborhood is rough but the food makes up for it. I'm just not sure id come here after dark.
