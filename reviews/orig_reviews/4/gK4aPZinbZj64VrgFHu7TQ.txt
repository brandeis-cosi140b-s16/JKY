I loved this place! The atmosphere is fun and exciting. Ok, for all of you complaining about prices...really? You expect to spend $1.50 on a taco in the cosmopolitan? Seriously? This is not the place. The prices are not outrageous for Cosmopolitan prices. You pay for location.

Must haves:
Salt Air Margaritas!!!! These were divine. The salt foam is interesting in a good way. Our table could not stop ordering them.
Sui Mai! Small, but DELICIOUS and they have gold flakes. Come on!
Gaucamole - spicy, but exceptional quality great with tortillas or the chips
Queso Fundido was good, but not over the top delicious
Viva China taco
Scallop Ceviche! These come out as little scallop shooters on half limes. You shoot the scallop and squeeze the lime with the spices on it. SO GOOD. Along with the margaritas these were our favorite of the evening.
When Pigs Fly - Great pork buns, better than most dim sum I've had. Not too much bread.

Meh:
Lobster taco - didn't care for it
Porkbelly taco - too much sauce!
Ten Treasure - too little flavor compared to everything else

Overall great place even just for a drink (margarita) and a snack. I would love to come back and order the scallop ceviche again!
