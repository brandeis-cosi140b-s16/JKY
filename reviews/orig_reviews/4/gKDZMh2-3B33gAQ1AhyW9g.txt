I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. I've gone twice with the first time being my boyfriend's birthday dinner and the second just a dinner out with friends. I would agree that the service here isn't stellar but nothing horrible enough to write/complain about on a review. 

Pro's: Great patio and indoor atmosphere, great tortillas (I've had the cheddar cheese and red pepper), good food

Con's: Weak margaritas (for the price), limited indoor seating and limited menu

Overall, I had a nice time both experiences and would recommend to others. I would like to go back when the weather is cooler so I can experience the patio.
