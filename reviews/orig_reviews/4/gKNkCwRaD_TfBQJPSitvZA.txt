First, let me say that they have great customer service. Everyone serving us was super nice, friendly, and helpful.

Prices are a little expensive, and some portions are a little small, but even so, it's all full of flavor and deliciousness. All in all, this place is pretty solid. I think this would be a good place to come with friends for some after-hour drink and food specials before getting your night started.
