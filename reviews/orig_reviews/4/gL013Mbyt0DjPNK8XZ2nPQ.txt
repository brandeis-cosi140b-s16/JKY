My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night. Reading reviews on yelp, decided to check it out. I was very impressed! I loved the theme! I can see why some people may be thrown off but it totally worked for me. The environment was kind of "night life", I loved it! I wouldn't recommend this for a family dinner, at least not at night on the weekends. The drinks were delicious as was the food. I recommend the Tamarindo Margarita! Prices were reasonable. I suggest making reservations because it gets packed! I think service lacked because of how busy it was. It took us like a good 20 minutes to get our waiters attention to pay our bill. On the other hand the hostess were very nice. Other than that, I really enjoyed dinner at this place. Will definitely be giving it another visit.
