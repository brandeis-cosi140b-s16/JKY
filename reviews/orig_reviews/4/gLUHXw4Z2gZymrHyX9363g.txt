I was in Vegas for the week end with a group of friends. 

After a few disappointments with other restaurants, a friend recommended this restaurant place is nice and bright, the service is fast and the food, oh the food, is just right on. 


What a great experience we had in this place. First of it was Monday morning, most of us hungover (really hungover) It was a group of 12 with out resevations, and they had no problem seating us in a few mins. i thank them for that.

I had the puerco en salsa verde (pork in green sauce), the meat was tender, the sauce was spicy but not overwhelming, rice and beans were good.. Other people in my group had different dishes and I got to try a couple of them. The carnitas was really good. camarones a la diabla, just good. Guacamole is really good too. 

The drinks were great. 

I wish we had known about this place from the beginning and maybe we would have come here everyday. 

Casa Don Juan, good service, nice place and excellent food.
