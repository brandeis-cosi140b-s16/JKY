Went here for the first time for Taco Tuesday during Happy Hour! Meaning, they have 6 different tacos to choose from that are only $2 each AND margaritas, mojitos, and pitchers of beer for only $5! 
They give out chips and salsa to everyone, which were pretty good. I ordered 2 crispy fish tacos, the standard taco, and their blood orange margarita. Boyfriend ordered a crispy fish taco, the standard taco, the pork adobada taco, and their joyride (a standard) margarita. 
Both of us liked their crispy fish tacos the best! I was happy with my blood orange margarita. Not too sweet but still some fruity flavor. Boyfriend always gets classic margaritas, and he was satisfied with theirs. In comparison, his didn't seem as strong as mine in terms of tequila. 
The total of our meal came out to be $24, which is cheap considering we purchased alcohol! 
The service was good. It was Cinco De Mayo when we went, so we thought it might be busy. The place was pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait to be seated! They were very quick to bring us chips and salsa and take away our eaten chips and salsa and grace us with a new basket. Very friendly. Also, the atmosphere is very fun and retro; very colorful! 
Overall, we would definitely come here again for Taco Tuesday and Happy Hour! We really like fish tacos, but I don't know if I would pay $4.25 for a single fish taco that isn't very large. Margs were good, food was good, and service was good!
