Come here on el cinco dia del mes for all day happy hour specials! 2 frozen margaritas (the mango and Big Stick are so good), 2 carnitas burritos and 2 (free, given out by marketing girls) double Espolon tequila shots for $23. Say what?! Yes, it was cheaper than two drinks at the Encore pool.

Top that off with a lively Mexican band and cool bartenders and servers and you've got the best pre-big night out deals on the strip!
