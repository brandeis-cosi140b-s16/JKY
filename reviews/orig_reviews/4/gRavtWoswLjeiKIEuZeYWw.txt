I haven't been to La Tolteca for several years but yesterday we were down the street at the Children's Museum of Phoenix so we just had to go.

What can I say? These guys make some awesome everyday! There's no Mexican food any better in my opinion (including all those 'bertos places) on this side of the border. Huge portions, great prices and there's so much other things there to compliment the food.

Other then the food, there's a grocery store in there as well as some other stuff you can buy. I got a kick out of the 3 foot loofahs. Not sure what you would do with one, but they were interesting to play with. Cadie (my 2 year old) and I had a loofah sword fight.

I kinda want to buy the tortilla making stuff and try my hand at home made tortillas. Maybe I will next time I'm there :)
