i hadn't been to valle luna since i was a kid, but we went here recently and it was so great. 

i mean, it wasn't like amazing mexican homemade food, but it's pretty darn good for what it is. 

their salsa is amazing. so amazing. the chips are warm and salty. the bean dip is pretty great. 

for a meal, their chicken fundido is awesome if you're feeling naughty. 

i had the fajitas and everything was fresh, not pre-made. you know how i have a weird thing about pre-made food. nope, not here. they were even able to cook my fajitas with water instead of oil which was a bonus for me because i make crazy requests like that. 

we sat on the patio and enjoyed the water fountain. all in all, it was good and i'd totally go back.
