My husband and I come here once a month as a treat.  I love the authentic Mexican cuisine this place offers.  Everything is fresh when it comes out from the kitchen.  We have never waited long for our food.  Great service and great prices.  You get a lot of food for what you pay for which is worth it.  The Chile Relleno is fantastic.
