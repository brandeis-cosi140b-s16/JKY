The tacos are a real treat, especially the al pastor chicken tacos. The beer menu is a bit slim but still palette pleasing. Don't skip on the salsa side station. There's some good stuff going on there. The service was great, very very helpful in explaining everything. All in all I will be coming back again and again...and I'll be bringing more people along with me.
