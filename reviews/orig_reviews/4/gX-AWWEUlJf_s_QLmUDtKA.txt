I probably wouldn't come here nearly as much if I didn't live right down the street. In all honesty, the food is pretty mediocre. 
However, I've found a solution that works pretty well for me: get really drunk, then eat. Four stars for Prickly Pear margaritas and being able to stumble home. 
The flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame. 
And Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice. 
If anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day. I still haven't tried their brunch yet but they had me at Chocolate Fountain.
