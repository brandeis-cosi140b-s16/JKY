We loved this place when it was at it's McKellips location...the atmosphere was unique and a great place to take out of town guests. They had an awesome patio and a private backyard area for private parties...in fact, this is where my husband and I got married! 

We wish they didn't move so far away, but we do go their on special occasions. Even though they did a good job replicating their McKellips location, it just isn't the same since it is in a strip mall versus the private setting it had on McKellips. the green salsa is to die for and worth the drive!
