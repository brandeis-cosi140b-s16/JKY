Stopped for a late dinner around 7:00p.  We're told it would be 15 minute wait closer to 30 minutes.  Greet staff was friendly and helpful. Wait staff was very attentive, even staff who weren't our waitress, checked if everything was ok.  Ordered enchiladas and chimichanga ,both were excellent.  Waitress checked on us two or three times as we ate.  Prices of dinners were about 12.00 with margaritas, it was around17.00 per person.

Overall,  great food, great ambiance and exceptional staff.  Highly recommend.
