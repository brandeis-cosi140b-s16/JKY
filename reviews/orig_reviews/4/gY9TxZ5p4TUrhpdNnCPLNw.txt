I love this place, I've been here many times for lunch.  #1, they have excellent salsa, when you look around and you see who else is sharing in your dining experience, a lot of repeat customers who know that the quality of the food is up there with the best.  The Salsa is fresh and HOT!  #2, its authentic, having come from a family of restaurant entrepreneurs in West Texas I know all about Mexican food, how it's made and whether something is fresh or not.  Let me tell you, this place is legit.  #3, the service is always fast and friendly.  The only opportunity they have is with their Huevos Rancheros, im a fan of Rancheros but their Ranchero sauce was heavy on the tomato sauce and onion, I felt needed more complexity and adding in some Hatch or Anaheim long green would have made the sauce better.  Other than that, I highly recommend the tacos, chimichangas, flautas, enchiladas and Menudo.  You won't go wrong with this place.
