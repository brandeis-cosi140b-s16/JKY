The food here is SO good!  The burros are excellent!  And the prices are just right.  I spent one week in Phoenix on a business trip and this was THE BEST Mexican food I had while there, and I ate Mexican almost every day.  The place was a little dirty looking but if you can overlook that, the food is so worth it! I can't wait to get back to Phoenix to go back.
