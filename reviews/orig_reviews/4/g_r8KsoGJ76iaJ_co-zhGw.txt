I had the fajita combo and found it to be better than I was expecting.  The ingredients were fresh and hot off the grill.  Our first waitress was great! We had a 2 year old with us and he was being kinda fussy so without asking she brought him some things to color.  Then her shift must have ended because it seemed like we were forgotten about with our drinks not being refilled and the check taking forever so when you go don't be in a hurry.
