I wish that it wasn't so far from the strip & that lines were so darn long but seriously the BEST tacos I've ever had. 

If its your first time here, it could get pretty confusing but there are 3 separate lines for different kinds of meats so make sure you read the signs. You line up and then order once its your turn. Guess what? Guacamole is FREE. Well... I wouldn't call it Guac, its more of just avocado but still! Other places would be charging you $1 or more for some guac. I would definitely pass on the carne aside fries, its missing a bunch of pico. 

After you get your order, you pay. About $2 for tacos is a bit on the pricey side since i'm so used to taco Tuesday but they were worth it!

So we ordered 12 tacos and a large order of carne asada fries and were given 4 small sauces... when we asked for more sauce they said 1 sauce for fries and 1 sauce per 4 tacos. Not sure how they came to that conclusion because my sister loves putting sauce on everything, but they wanted to charge us $0.50 for each additional sauce. No thanks. 

Horchata was decent. 3 tacos definitely wasn't enough for me because they're small so I would recommend getting 4 or 5. Also DO NOT GET THE FLOUR TORTILLA. The corn tortilla tasted amazing.
