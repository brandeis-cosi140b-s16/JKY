While eating there in 2012, I had dim sum (sui mai) and a few tacos - and all were delicious. I had originally went to try the 20 vegetable fried rice, as advertised on the Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," but never had it because of all the other temptations. While in LV 2 weeks ago, I went back and tried their famous friend rice this time - and it was fantastic! I highly recommend it! Not a huge fan of their salsa, but everything else I've ever had has been great!
