Considering this place is RIGHT ON Las Vegas Blvd, they're surprisingly well priced.  There was a girl out front handing out drink coupons, so we decided to give it a try.  The menu is typical American fare, and it's tasty.  You're definitely not paying for just the ambiance and people watching here.

My only complaint is that our server might have been a touch slow with our drink refills.  Other than that, I was happy with my meal/experience.  I'll definitely go back during my next visit to Sin City.
