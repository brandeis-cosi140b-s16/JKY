Second time I've had dinner at Canonita at the Venetian.  Great location right along the "canal" with the gondolas going by.  Excellent margaritas and awesome sangria.  Highly recommend ordering both and sharing.

Our table had an assortment of food and all was great.  Good spot for vegetarians and vegans as well.  Honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Smart staff will gladly assist you if you have dietary restrictions or just need help picking something.
