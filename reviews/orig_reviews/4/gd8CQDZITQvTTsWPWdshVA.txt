Stopped in for a bite to eat around 9pm on a Thursday without reservations. The place was packed! We got seated at a table on the patio a few minutes later. 

The service was interesting -they do "team" serving there, but we were told by 3 different servers that Amanda will be over shortly. Kind of weird that we didn't see Amanda until 20 minutes after we were seated. If it truly is a "team" service than don't mention a specific server, it was somewhat confusing. The service also seemed a bit slow at times, but everyone that interacted with our table was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu.

Table side guacamole was amazing! We had it made medium done up with a whole lotta fixins! I had the Kale salad with shrimp for dinner which was good, but a little too much kale -the plate was filled with it! If you like sweet the Coconut Strawberry Mojito is delicious!! Bread pudding for dessert was really tasty too! 

All in all, I think The Mission is a great place and worth checking out!
