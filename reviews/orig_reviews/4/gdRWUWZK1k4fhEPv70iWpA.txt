This place looked pretty shady walking up, not the best neighborhood. I had faith though because there was allot of positive reviews on yelp. Mi patio did not disappoint they gave my party of three two bowls of chips and everyone their own salsa, then when we were almost out of salsa a refill lady came by, I've never seen this before at a Mexican restaurant but I think they should all do it. That being said I didn't really need a refill on one just for me, but my sister did. I had their carne asada burrito and it was very good, the meat was flavorful and tasty. The vegetables inside were good and it was an all around good meal. The next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make a point of going back.
