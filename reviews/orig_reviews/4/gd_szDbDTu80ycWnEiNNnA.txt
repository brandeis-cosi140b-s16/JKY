After living in AZ for almost 6 years, I finally made it to Los Dos. It was worth the wait. The salsa that comes with the chips is as hot as everyone says it is. 

My Wife and I had no problem with the staff. Everyone was helpful and our drinks and chips were never empty for more than a minute. 

Our dinners were great. I had the Green Chili Beef Plate and my Wife had the 2 taco combo. We both enjoyed everything. I plan on coming back.
