My favorite food is Mexican and this place offers some of the finest I've tasted. I came with my family and we're all from out of state. You'll find a lot of choices here and if you don't speak Spanish, you might get a little lost. However, the sights, smells and staff are fantastic. I ordered the super nachos to share. The meat was succulent and delicious, the guacamole was some of the best I've tasted and there wasn't anything skimpy about any of the condiments on the plate. The chips, too, were crisp, salted to perfection and fresh. I only wished I had more room in my tummy for all of it. I also ordered the Milaneso, not realizing it was a sandwich. I wish I had known that because I would have asked for it without the bread. But, it was a delicious cut of breaded beef with melted cheese and loads of iceberg lettuce. My mother ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were scrumptious. I would go there again any day and probably would be there regularly if I lived in the area.
