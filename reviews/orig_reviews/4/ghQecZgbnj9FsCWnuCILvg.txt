This place allows you to select how you want it. You can have it as a burrito, or a bowl, tacos that are soft or hard, and even a salad. This place is great for a light, quick, simple meal that you know will be as natural as you can get it. And if you are watching carbs, this place can be a nice option. 

Today I had the Carne asada burrito. I wasn't watching carbs this week, so I enjoyed the big stuffed burrito with extra chips and salsa. It comes with rice, your choice of beans, (I like black beans), you choose your meat, I got the carne asada, it's usually tender and seasoned well. I like the mild salsa, reminds me of pico de gallo, then I add the cheese and sour cream. That's a pretty big burrito!

What I like about this place is its commitment to quality, their products are natural and fresh and I know that eating hear makes me feel more healthy! (even if the burrito has way too many calories).
