Good food and a fun atmosphere! I loved the feel of this place. I like that you order at the counter and your food is brought out to you. We stopped in during lunch and they had about 5 lunch specials, which is a decent selection. I ordered the green chile burrito and it was okay. The meat was tender and juicy, but only half of my burrito had meat. The chile was okay, but overall it was bland. My husband got the asada torta and really enjoyed it. He said the asada is some of the best he's had. All in all, we'll try this place again.
