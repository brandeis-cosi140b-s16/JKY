The service here is consistently good.  They have margarita specials during happy hour, and the margaritas are pretty good.  There are 8 flavors of margaritas.  It's easy to sample the different kinds of margaritas because they do flights for their margaritas, which allow you to try 3 different margaritas.  The beer selection here is good too when you're not in the mood for a margarita.  There are a variety of tacos to choose from, and you can mix and match tacos when ordering multiple tacos.  My personal favorite is the chipotle braised beef taco.  It has a lot of flavor and a bit of a kick.
