I've been wanting to check out Barrio Queen for a while and was not disappointed when I came in for Taco Tuesday. I parked myself at the bar and ordered a Victoria (which is my favorite Mexican beer) and some guac to start.

The avocado in my guac was not mashed but was actually chunks of sliced avocado. I don't know how I feel about that but that did not stop me from finishing it off with the awesome chips accompanying.

Their list of tacos is vast and pretty cool. They're $3.50 each or three for $10 (they're $2.50 on Taco Tuesday) I had the Carne Asada, Pescado and the Suardo Azteca. All three were delicious by the Suardo Azteca was my favorite with Carne Asada, Chorizo and Bleu Cheese. AMAZING!

There were so many more tacos on the list that I wanted to try but after these three and the guac I was full. The bar was full and the bartenders were very busy but friendly. 

They also have burritos, enchiladas and tortas on the menu. So I have to come back and try other great looking stuff on the menu. But I definitely plan on being a regular on Taco Tuesdays.
