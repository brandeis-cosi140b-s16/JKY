Jalisco Cantina is not notably different than when the place was called SuperMex, but I enjoyed SuperMex, so that's a good thing. 

The one minor peeve I had with SuperMex, was the serving of whole, round fried tortillas that you had to break up into pieces, instead of being able to enjoy pre- cut chips. This has been rectified.

My one peeve in the restaurant's current incarnation, is in the naming of a dessert, which is not truly Fried Ice Cream, but a big ball of ice cream concoction that falls short of greatness, only as a result of being covered in corn flakes that must turn nasty when frozen, because they taste stale. If they fixed this one issue, or even applied fresh cornflakes prior to serving, I would consider going over just for dessert. 

Their salsa, burritos and fajitas are among my favorites of any Mexican restaurant's. I've sampled a variety of their dishes, and found consistently delicious entrees with savory, well-seasoned sauces. 

On the sides they have a decent, but not thrilling, guacamole, and the standard, but competently prepared beans and rice. Instead of the usual, try the green rice sometime. It is something special.

Jalisco Cantina is good value for the money, offering quality food,  along with nice, frosty margaritas, a dimly lit, comfortable, and overall pleasant dining experience.
