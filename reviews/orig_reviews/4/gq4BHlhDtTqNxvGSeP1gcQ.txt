I guess I should start with a review of this restaurant considering it is one of our regular spots.

I've had a lot of different things here, may I suggest you use some common sense.  Eat the Paco's Tacos, if a business is going to put their name on a food item you'd imagine it'd be good.  These are some of the best tacos in town.  I mean come on, slow cooked beef? Thanks.

The carnitas (pork tips) are good in the respect that they have them on the menu where as most gringo-centric quasi-Mexican restaurants skip the tip.  Really the best carnitas in town are Taqueria Mexico on South Blvd near the Arrowood Rd intersection. The ones at Paco's are good - so try them if you haven't had them before.  You cannot be a respectable Mexican place without delicious pork, it just isn't authentic.

Fajitas are good, we'll get combo fajitas as a common take out item and split them, plenty of food for two.  The Guacamole is excellent I just don't like it when it's prepared table-side as someone who has spent a lot of time in the service industry I would NOT enjoy doing that, makes me feel like a shmuck.

Only real complaint was that up until recently they didn't have a spicy option, they have homemade habanero salsa but it's not spicy at all.  They added the Green El Yucateca which is one of my favorites, I was going to have to start bringing my own in.

The bar is great, they always have something new to try on tap while keeping Shiner Bock available year round.  Tequila selection is excellent.

Last and final thought, don't slouch on the salsa verde.. it's better than the red.

Oh and by the way I've never had bad service there, like every other restaurant on the planet if it's dinner or lunch rush (ie, you are eating between 11.30am-1.30pm or 7-8pm) it's going to be busy, all the other sheeple had the same idea as you, so order a drink, enjoy some salsa and relax, nobody forgot about you.
