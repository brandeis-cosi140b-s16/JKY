What a good little Mexican restaurant! 

I had almost given up on finding even half-way decent Mexican food in the west valley. After reading the Yelp reviews, hubs and I decided to give Don Pancho a try on a recent Saturday afternoon.

We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful cashier. You order at the counter and then the food is then delivered to your table. She explained the menu well, made great suggestions and helped us feel right at home. Hubby played it safer with an enchilada combo, I opted for the recommended #12 Combo of a soft corn taco filled with asada, a sopa with carnitas and a maiz quesadilla with pork al carbon, all served up with rice and beans and a giant fountain drink or fresca or horchata for $9.99 (also included corn chips drizzled with beans and served with their red salsa)! What a fantastic deal! 

My food was delicious. Well prepared, fresh ingredients, seasoned just right. the salsa bar was full of yummy salsas and condiments which were just right for topping off my big happy plate of Mexican goodness. This is simple home food done right. Several times friendly employees checked in with us to see how we were doing. 

The best adjective I have for Don Pancho is happy. And we'll be back!
