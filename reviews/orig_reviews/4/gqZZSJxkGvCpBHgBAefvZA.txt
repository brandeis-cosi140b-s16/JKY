Being consistent is a key, went again after the review written below and this time I ordered the Taco's Al carbon and they were a little tough so I take a star away from my original evaluation because I want it to be the same every visit.
If you ask me to go back....Oh yes.
Mexican cuisine - Let's start with our waiter, Javier awesome job and his interaction with us (4) was great. The top shelve guacamole was made at the table and was good and the food was very good.. There had been some changes to old items on the menu (good changes that enhanced the product).  New menu items which I choose to try which I enjoyed..I'll leave it up to you to choose your new favorite food.
