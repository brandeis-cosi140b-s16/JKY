Overall? Mostly awesome. We came about 6pm on a Tuesday night. We went to the bar as we were still waiting for another to join our group. We had heard good things about the house margaritas so we decided to try them. Hey, only $6, so not really a risk. Then...OMG....who uses Cuervo in their house margaritas?! They were perfect with the house made sour mix. It was also Mexican Beer night with 1/2 off all said draft beers. We each tried a few that the very friendly and personable bartender recommended. All good. Our bar tab for 5 beers and 2 margaritas ended up being about $20. Not bad at all.  Finally our 3rd guest arrived and we were seated right away. (Quite a rarity, I've heard, even on a weekday night.) The other 2 had the BBQ Mahi tacos and I had the Wahoo. All excellent. The only other place I have had such good fish tacos was in San Diego. Now, it was obvious that the rice and beans that the tacos come with were pre-plated for some time. This is just fine because they tasted great and it's probably the reason our meals arrived less than ten minutes after ordering. Overall a great atmosphere, average service and well above average fish tacos.

-Side Note: The "Corn Salsa". Interesting and Unique. I'm not a fan. It's not bad, just not my thing. I prefer a spicier, more tomato based version. I wish they gave a few options.
