This is a very fun, creative, and healthy way to enjoy enchiladas.  While the setup does have a Chipotle-type feel, the ingredients are more unique.  I especially liked the oven element to warm your tasty enchilada.  My biggest complaint, there was not enough parking and seating was a challenge.  Notwithstanding, I will go back!
