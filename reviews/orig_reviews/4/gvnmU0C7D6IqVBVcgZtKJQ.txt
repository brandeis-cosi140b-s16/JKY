Salsa bar was great.  Some of the salsas were extremely hot and kinda wish they would label the heat index somehow.  The tacos and horchata were fantastic.  Two young guys as the servers who were extremely friendly and helpful. I didn't realize the quesadillas were fried which I didn't like.  I am not sure if it is listed on the menu, but that really is a slight complaint.  

I would go again and just stick to the tacos
