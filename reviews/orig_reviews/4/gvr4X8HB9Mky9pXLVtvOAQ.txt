The warm tortilla chips with 4 different dipping sauces are the best part. One of them was sour cream based with jalapenos and some other spices. It was just delicious. The food was great and margaritas were really good. The only thing is they didnt have a bar area to sit at, so its a complete family restaurant but they do have happy hour. 
Prices are reasonable, waiters are friendly and every meal comes with a warm sopapilla which again was delicious. I was visiting AZ and a coworker recommended this place to me. I'm glad he did. Will definitely visit again when in Arizona.
