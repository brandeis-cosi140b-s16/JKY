I love guacamole and The guac here is suuuuper good, highly recommended. The menu is also very Gluten Free friendly. They serve their tacos on delicious corn tortillas. It's common for corn tortillas to be dry but these were very soft. 
   The staff is also very nice. Very knowledgeable, receptive and attentive to questions and allergy concerns. 
   Craft beer?? Yessir. Quite the nice little selection of local craft beer.
