This place is like a fancier version of Roberto's. I ordered the carne asada fries, and at first they looked small, but I was definitely full after I ate them. The service was great, especially for the type of place that it is. They forgot to put the avocado that I asked for, and the lady was not at all bothered when I asked her about it, she was actually quite nice about it, which I appreciated. I hate when employees make it seem like it's your fault if they forget something. Overall, it's a great place to drop in for lunch.
