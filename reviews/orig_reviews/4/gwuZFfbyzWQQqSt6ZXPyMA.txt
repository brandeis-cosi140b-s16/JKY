good fun atmosphere in the hipster hard rock hotel in las vegas! chips and salsa to start was excellent when we sat down. portions were great - not too much but you definitely did not leave hungry. we got some guacamole to start and it was very good. the pitcher of sangria was solid and they gave us to-go cups so we could enjoy our sangria even after our meal was cleared. 

the name alone is a draw - even if it does conjure up juvenile giggles every time you suggest this place to eat.
