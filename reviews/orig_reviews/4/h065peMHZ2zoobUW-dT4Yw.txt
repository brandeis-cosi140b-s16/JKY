I had 1 carne asada taco, 1 flour quesadilla, and a horchata for ~8. 

- Great flavor! LEGIT. 
- Carne Asada has some fat on it.
- Quesadilla is a little small, yet filling. Very cheesy. Comes with big peppers and green onions on the side. i loved the crispy tortilla on top.
- Fast pace, slightly confusing for first-timers, well for me xD
