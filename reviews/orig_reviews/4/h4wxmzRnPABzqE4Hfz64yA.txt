Outside patio and bar is a great atmosphere.   I had the strawberry mojito it was amazing!  They had a happy hour going on for $6 apps we tried the calamari which was delicious and the guacamole which we thought was just ok we're kind of guac snobs though nothing compares to my homemade :).  The rest of the meal was great we shared the chicken burrito and the mexican cobb salad both were delicious!  Definitely huge portions so worth the price!  Vety attentive and friendly wait staff as well which is always appreciated.
