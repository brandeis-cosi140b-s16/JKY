Good cheap Mexican food. Nothing fancy and nothing that will knock your socks off...I mean, c'mon, this is AZ. There is lots of competition for Mexican places, so this place would be top notch anywhere else, but here, it's the best in the area for price, taste, and convenience. It's where I go for good Mexican food when I don't feel like driving to sketchy parts of central or south Phoenix (Carolina's, La Santisima, etc)
