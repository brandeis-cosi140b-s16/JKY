For a Mexican place in a mall like setting, I expected something average, but boy what a pleasant surprise.  Vida Rocks.  The chips and salsa are good (check), the drinks are good (check check), and the enchiladas and tacos are tasty(check, check, check).  There are many great sounding items on the menu, and the combos are a great way to help you sample several different items.  Ricky the water was super efficient and very friendly.  Oh, and they are open late weeknights for a good late night meal option.
