Went again tonight with my sisters and we shared a few tacos... great service, the waitress was super friendly, and although she was the only one there was attentive.  We ordered a burro to go, and she packed it nicely with a bag of chips.  We finished out this meal with some flan, and having had what I thought was great flan in Mexico, I was pretty impressed!
