The Ribeye tacos were very good.  But make sure you look at the paper menu to order it has more detail about the food.  Just a different type of Mexican food, always looking to try something new.  The desserts looked really good, but I was too full to eat!  Should have tried something to go.  Also had a taste of their potato soup, it has green chilies, very good.
