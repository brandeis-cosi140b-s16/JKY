Went on a whim based on a friend's recommendation.  This is not "tex mex" but upscale food with Mexican or New Mexican influence.  Prickly pear margarita was excellent, the house salad that came with the entree was good, the jalepano ranch was not at all spicy, but had good flavor.  I had the steak and the portion was huge.  After eating an appetizer (chorizo spinach queso) I couldn't even eat 1/2 my entree. :) the twice baked potato in the green chili was cool and it isn't a sweet potato :) the atmosphere was laid back and decor was cool.  The outdoor space is another restaurant? All in all a good meal and experience.
