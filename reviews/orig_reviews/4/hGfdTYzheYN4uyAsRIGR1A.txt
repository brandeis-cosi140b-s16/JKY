Last night we sat on the patio under beautiful desert trees sparkling with blue lights.  It was the perfect casual dining experience!  Monday's feature from the bar is 2-for-1 house margaritas and they are light and delicious.  They also brought plenty of crispy chips and salsa.  My three friends all had the taco plate and were surprised by the volume of food.  Those tacos were huge!  I had the stacked enchiladas "Christmas style" and much preferred the green sauce to the red.  The service was very competent and we will be back again soon.
