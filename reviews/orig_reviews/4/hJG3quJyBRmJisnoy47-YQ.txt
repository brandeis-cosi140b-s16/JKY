Don't look for a sign, as there isn't one. This place is dark and tiny, but the portions are huge. We had the Eggs Benedict Adovada and it will be both our breakfast and our lunch! Service was excellent, as was the coffee and orange juice. No, its not a cheap breakfast (go to a Denny's ya cheap baatard) - think of it as an investment in your day!
