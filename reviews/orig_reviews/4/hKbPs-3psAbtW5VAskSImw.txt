Ok, so my brother has lived in vegas for years and this was one of the first times that I was able to get out there and see him and spend any sort of length of time there as well. Also, his girlfriend just finished culinary school so we were definitely interested in going to a really good restaurant, especially one who's chef is of the ilk of  Jose Andres. The food was better than just "good" the drinks were very tasty, and there was a wide range of selection in regards to how daring one might want to be. The dumplings and the pork buns definitely stand out and the top favorites as well as the guacamole. Most at my table happened to prefer the chinese selections that we had made but really, everything was very very tasty overall. We went for a lunch so that we could walk everything off later and the place was almost empty. Although, we were probably eating much earlier than many who visit vegas. The meal was expensive, but it was well worth it. I will say, that while the drinks were good, I think that they were overpriced based on what you are able to get in the area for less. However, overall, I am a fan and would enjoy going there again for maybe a slightly smaller meal (we definitely over-ordered since we were so excited about all of the options!).
