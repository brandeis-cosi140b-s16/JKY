I came here for lunch. The meal comes with chips and Salsa. The chips are light and crunchy and the salsa spicy and tasty. This is the best chips and salsa I have had in Charlotte!

 I ordered the steak burrito which came with charro beans and green chili rice. The chunks of steak was really tender and flavorful. The burrito came with some type of brown sauce on the top and the sides. I think it's some sort of beef broth sauce but it had a nice surprising spiciness to it.   The Charo beans were good and I'm not usually a big fan.  I am well pleased  with the meal.  The portion was big for a lunch selection. It's big even for a dinner selection.

The service was ok. The server did his job. I just didn't think he wanted to be there. He wasn't rude or anything.  Just my opinion.  Everyone's entitled to a bad day.  I will be back.
