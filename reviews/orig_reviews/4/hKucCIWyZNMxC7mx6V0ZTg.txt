I love and adore Vida! It is very cute and the architecture is amazing. The location is prime time as well! 

My fave meal is the Shrimp Quesadillas =) Yummy to my tummy. And the table side Guacamole is KILLER! I eat here at least 4 times a month. And typically it is for lunch, To-Go due to my schedule. 

The service is typically exceptional. I only had one bad experience where a host basically called me a liar to my face about a reservation. However, management took care of me and I am not sure what was done with her but I haven't seen her since. 

Go here if you want a delicious meal!
