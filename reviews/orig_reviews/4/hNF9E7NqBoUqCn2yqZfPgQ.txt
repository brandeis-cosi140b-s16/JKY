This place is awesome! I saw it on google maps as my husband and I were driving by and I knew as soon as I sad the name that I wanted to try it out while in the area.

Our server was very friendly and helpful, which automatically earns two stars in my book. 

The chips and salsa were fantastic! The basket of chips was a combination of corn tortilla chips and flour tortilla chips. We both filled up on those evil calories before our meals arrived.

I read a lot about the tamales and our server raved about the spinach enchiladas so I ordered a combo with the two. The tamale was ok, but to be fair I've never really been I to them. The spinach enchilada, however, was the best I've ever eaten, and as a vegetarian I've had a lot. The sauce was yummy, the creamy spinach filling was incredible and the sliced almonds on the top  made the whole thing even better. The husband ordered the Nuevo Mexico enchiladas and they were, in his words, "hotter than the blazes of hell". Good, but we had to stop at the Safeway next door for Tums.
