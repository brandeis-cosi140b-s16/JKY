The sign at the entrance caught our eye. Not much of a looker from the outside but when you get in, it isn't that bad. Nice Mexican restaurant. For breakfast the $4 meal and 99 cent bloody mary is a great deal, though I advise you step up to the $2 bloody mary, bigger and better. Had dinner here once and loved it, five of us and it came to about $90, not bad for Vegas.
