Great margaritas!! We were there right at open (11am) trying to cure our hangovers. The hostess had a separate print out menu for vegetarian options which made is super easy. I'm the type of person who has trouble making decisions, luckily the bartender (super hot tattooed girl) was great at making decisions for me. She guided me towards the classic margarita (soooo delicious!) and the enchiladas. The beans and rice are not vegetarian, but they accidentally ended up on my plate so she got me this white rice, which was alright, but the enchiladas were really good. It took a few minutes for them to correct the wrong beans and rice, which meant they actually remade the plate, yes! Their chips are thick and the red salsa has a bit of a kick, salsa verde was good too. Overall great service, we stopped in for another margarita before we headed to the airport, they are just so good! The bartender was very friendly, we will definitely be stopping in on our next trip to vegas!
