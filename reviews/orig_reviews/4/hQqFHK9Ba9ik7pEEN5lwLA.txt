My wife and I came here for a late breakfast. They let us choose between either the breakfast menu or the regular menu. Even though it was breakfast, they started us off with chips and salsa. They all tasted fresh and home made. The chips were just right and, although not spicy, the two slasas were also good. They brought a red salsa and a sweet green salsa.

We starte with horchata to drink. My wife ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo, which was bigger than she expected. She said it was really good. I got the machaca plate (shredded beef with peppers and eggs mixed in.) It came with a side of hash browns and a side of refried beans and fresh tortillas. It was all very good.

There was a minor issue with one of the tortillas, but they handled it well and the owner/manager came to our table and apologized and gave us a discount, which was unnecessary, but very appreciated.

We both appreciated how clean and new everything felt and the service was excellent.

We will definitely be back here. I am looking forward to trying the lunch or dinner menu next time.
