Tasty, fresh food - a little fancy, but definitely delicious!  The place itself is really well done in lots of colors - kind of like Happy and Trendy bonded.

Rather indifferent service both times - everything served in a brisk manner, but a little lacking in friendliness.  I didn't care, since I was there with my own friends, but it's worth mentioning :-)

We've somehow only come here when it's pretty dead, so the atmosphere felt a little odd, but overall, it seems like it would be even better with a healthy crowd.

The guacamole is lovely, as are the fish tacos - everything is fresh, fancy, and in small portions.
