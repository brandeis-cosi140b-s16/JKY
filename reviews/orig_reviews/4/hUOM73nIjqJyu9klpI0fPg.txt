This is a favorite, crave-worthy spot. Perfect for vegetarians and carnivores alike. If it's still on the menu, the asparagus tempura is the best! I also enjoy the beers on tap, the selection is small but quality. Most of the time I've gone here has been week nights or Sundays so I haven't really had to deal with a wait. This place is also so affordable (unless you start drinking, of course that will add up) If you get two vegetarian tacos you can be at about $10 plus tax and tip. I'd say two tacos is sufficient for a person with an average appetite...with the endless (and delicious) chips and salsa you also get.
