The Jamaica agua fresca is FABULOUS!  Sooo refreshing on a hot Phoenix day.  I usually get the Crazy Potatoes, which I love for their mesquite smoke flavor.  Great patio and I'm sure the rest of their food is tasty just based on smell alone!  Always busy (a great sign) but they move you through very fast.  A gem right in my own backyard.
