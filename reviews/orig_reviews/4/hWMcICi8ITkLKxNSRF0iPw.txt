My boyfriend and I ended up here because I mistakenly thought it was part of the $20 food & beverage coupon that you get for the Luxor/Excalibur when you stay at one of those casinos.  That's what I get for not reading the voucher all the way through!  All the same, I'm very glad I made that mistake because otherwise I would have never thought to go to Tacos 'n' Tequila for breakfast.

We were there during the Sunday Mariachi Brunch.  I ordered the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the albondigas.  Both dishes were wonderfully flavored and the portion sizes were more than sufficient; however the real star of our breakfast were our micheladas.  Hands down the best micheladas we've ever had.  A perfect blend of spicy and hearty.  Gave us just the pep we needed to start our day in Vegas!

The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and we were even serenaded by the Mariachi Band.  They were taking table-side requests and my boyfriend asked for "Guadalajara" because that was the song his dad used to sing all the time when he was growing up.  They did a great job and made it all a lot of fun.

I would have given this place 5-stars except for two small things.  1) You have to pay extra if you want eggs in your chilaquiles.  I know chilaquiles can vary from place to place, but it's been my experience that eggs are the main staple of the dish so it seemed odd they weren't included.  However the dish did include chicken, so it was still very filling, but I did miss the eggs.  2) No menudo.  I really wished they had it available.  The albondigas was tasty, but to me when you're looking for a really good hangover breakfast, you just can't beat menudo.
