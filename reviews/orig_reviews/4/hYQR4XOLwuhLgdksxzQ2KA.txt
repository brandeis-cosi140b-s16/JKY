Came here earlier for week day lunch special.  I ordered chicken burrito with green chili source and requested to put the cheese aside instead of on top of the burrito (it overruns the Green chili flavor). I chose the whole bento bean instead of refried bean for healthier reason. It was a great delightful lunch!
