My favorite for Mexican in Las Vegas! Been to the one near the strip and on Flamingo. What I appreciate is that the recipes are truly Mexican... not American-Mexican. The menu explains each dish and the spices in detail. The hand-made tortillas really make a difference and the wait staff continually ensures your complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip are always full!. Had the Chipolte chicken and it was tender, spicy and smoky. Our son ordered the lemon chicken, something I probably would not have ordered.... that is until I tasted it! Fantastic! The guacamole they make table side can be customized to your preferences and they even put jalapenos on the side for us who like it spicier. Very accommodating. Live music in the bar at the one on Eastern, and the waiters do a  mean happy birthday at both locations accompanied by guitar!!
