Small hole in the wall place that I wouldn't have noticed, but my old apartment manager told me about it. The carne asada here is amazing, and I don't even like carne asada. Tacos are incredibly cheap, so I haven't tried anything else yet. The service isn't bad, and it's a lot cleaner on the inside than you'd expect.
