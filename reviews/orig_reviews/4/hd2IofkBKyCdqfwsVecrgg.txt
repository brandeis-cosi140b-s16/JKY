Limited menu, but good drinks and great service. Our server, Leah, was lovely.  She really made the experience.

House margs run about $12, but they are tasty.  Doubles near $15.  

Menu doesn't seem veggie friendly at first, but they are very accommodating. Rice and black beans are vegetarian. 

Good option to wait out a late flight or get a bite before you head out.
