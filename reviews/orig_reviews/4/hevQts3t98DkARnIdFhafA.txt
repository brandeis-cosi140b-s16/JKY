What sets this restaurant apart from its competition is it is larger, cleaner and offers a help yourself salsa bar that includes warm beans, sliced cucumbers, multiple salsas and spicy pickled carrots. My wife and I each ordered our usual al pastor tacos that proved to be equal or better than any in town.
