Their chips and salsa are really great, different than the standard fare with a smokey flavor. I love the bean burrito, it has whole pinto beans with a lot of flavor. My husband gets the chorizo stuffed chicken dish and he loves it. One word of advice to the owners... Aesthetically the interior needs a facelift. There is visible wiring behind the wall mounted light fixtures and the giant round light on the ceiling is ugly. Just needs some freshening up. But I go there twice a month... Good food!
