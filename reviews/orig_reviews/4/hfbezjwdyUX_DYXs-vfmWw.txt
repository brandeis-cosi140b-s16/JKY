Got here 30 minutes before closing on a Friday night. Lots of food for not much money and very tasty stuff. The interior is not that great and it feels a bit like a dive, but a dive with very tasty food. Maybe a bit greasy but their chicken is unlike what you get at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to.
