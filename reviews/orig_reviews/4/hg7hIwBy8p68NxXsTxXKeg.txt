The chimichanga with sour cream and guacamole was pretty good.  For the price, it was great.

The buttered flour tortillas were really good.  Frankly these are about as good a tortilla as you'll find anywhere.

The side of beans were ok.  I've certainly had far better.

Not especially a fan of their salsa.

They have both coke and pepsi products...so that's good.

Overall I'd say good.  Not the best, but good.  I guess it all depends on what you come here for.  Some things (tortillas and price for instance) are as good as you can find.  Other things (beans) are just average.

Going with a 4 but because of the drive I have to make to get there its somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5.
