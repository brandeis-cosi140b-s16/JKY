Was walking to another place for a late breakfast when I saw someone walk out of Dicks Hideaway, when I asked them about it he said its his favorite place to go. So i wandered in and was not crazy about how dark it was and the seating was odd...like a bar. (it is a bar)  But was intrigued by atmosphere so I stayed. Besides it was dark enough to hide the fact I had no make-up on. ^_^.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with green chili, that was months ago and I still think about that dish. I would go back anytime.
