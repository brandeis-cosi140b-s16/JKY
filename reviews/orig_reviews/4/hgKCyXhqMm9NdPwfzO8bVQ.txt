DELICIOUS BLOOD ORANGE MARGARITA! A little on the sweet side, but so good.
The bartender was attentive and nice, even while he had a full bar and restaurant to attend to. Hostess was super nice and friendly.
Great decor, free chips and salsa! Does that even happen anywhere else in Scottsdale?
We split the Short Rib and Avocado Cheese Crisp and it was so yummy. Us two girls wanted a light lunch and were actually stuffed and couldn't even finish it. 

I will definitely have to make it back at night to sit outside and for happy hour!
Great FOX concept!
