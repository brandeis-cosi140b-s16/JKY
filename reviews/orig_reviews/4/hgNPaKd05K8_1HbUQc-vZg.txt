Pineapple Mojitos! Yum! Just what I needed on this hot day!

I was actually there in early June and found a coupon on Restaurant.com. I was worried that they would give me second hand treatment, but they were just great!

The shrimp tacos were wonderful! The drinks! Yum (as stated above)! The service was pretty good.

All the servers are dressed in beach style and all were pretty friendly and helping each other out.  

Definitely worth giving a try.
