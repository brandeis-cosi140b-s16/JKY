Beef empanadas were super delicious, and probably will return for them. Normally, the one empanada would have been enough for my lunch. However, I have really been wanting to try this place, so I also ordered a chicken arepa and a side of guac. Both were just average. Arepa probably would have been better if it had more time to cool (I burned my hands trying to eat it) and if I hadn't already scarfed down an empanada. Overall, I ate enough for two people and had a soft drink for about $12. Not bad. I will be back to try carne asada fries and margaritas.
