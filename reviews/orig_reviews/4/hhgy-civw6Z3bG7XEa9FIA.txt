This place is excellent.
I ordered an appetizer of chips and salsa.  The chips are just chips, but the green salsa was so good. And they bring it in this huge basket. Way too much for a single person to finish.
I then ordered fish tacos.  They bring you three of them, with rice and beans.  On the tacos are cabbage and avocado.  Nothing better than avocado on fish tacos!  Excellent, excellent!!  They did not overwhelm the tacos with too much salsa.  The rice: moist and delicious.  The beans were covered with a nice, thin layer of cheese and very good also.

Service was prompt and friendly.  I had a great meal here and will definitely be going back.
