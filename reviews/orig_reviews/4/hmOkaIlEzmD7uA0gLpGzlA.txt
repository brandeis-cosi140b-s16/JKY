Nice small restaurant for street tacos. Had the carne asado tacos which are fresh and tasty.

The thing that stands out here is the salsa bar with the different varieties of salsa to choose from. Fresh and home made with a great opportunity to experiment and sample all kinds.

Very small place with old tables and dawn of the dead motif if that is your thing. Service is good but they dont have much to do with you. The parking is limited and may need to park along a side street.

You order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Simple and easy

Recommend to try their tacos if you want real tacos and something different
