This is the more authentic mexican restaurant in Wickenburg between Anita's and Ranchero.  People LOVE the thin bean dip that is served with the salsa and chips.  I dig it as well.  My favorite dish here is acutually under the appetizers.  I get the wax peppers stuffed with a shrimp and wrapped in bacon and they drizzle some sort of soy sauce over the top and they are seved with sides of rice and beans.  Their carne asada is pretty good as well, topped with diced raw onion, cilantro and fresh key limes.
