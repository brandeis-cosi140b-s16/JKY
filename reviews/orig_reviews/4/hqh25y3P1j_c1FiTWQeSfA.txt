3.5 stars.

Food here is pretty solid.  I've had Korean in LA (which is much better back home, and I'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something I can compare to), and the food here is a pretty decent.  I think the spicy pork is pretty good here, and the bulgoigi was just 'ok.'

Bulgoigi Tacos $2 -above average-The bulgoigi tacos were pretty good.  They came out within 5 minutes of our order.
Spicy Pork tacos-$2- above average-Same as above.

Bulgoigi fried rice $9-slightly above average-Pretty good.  I wished they gave a little more bulgoigi though.  Had some trouble tasting it.  I think it might be ok to pass on this if you aren't in the mood for fried rice.

Bulgoigi & Spicy Pork-slightly above average-The portions on this dish are massive!  Big enough for 2 people to share.  My only gripe was the bulgoigi was a bit over-cooked.  I enjoyed the spicy pork.

Tips:
-Complimentary chips w/ your order
-Where's my kimchii at??!?!  I would've liked a complimentary side of this :P

Overall a solid choice if you are in the mood for Korean.  Like I said above, 3.5 stars
