Ok I gave this place a try again and definitely liked it more the second time around. My friends love this place so I had to go again. I probably had a bad first experience because they didn't have the fries. But this time they did and we got it with adobado (probably spelling it wrong but am too lazy to look it up right now haha) and it was so good! My friend and I killed the fries. We came after ebc so we were hungry and ready to eat! Definitely disappointed that they don't have orange bang anymore and still think the line structure of this place isn't the smartest but I would come back again when I'm in Vegas.
