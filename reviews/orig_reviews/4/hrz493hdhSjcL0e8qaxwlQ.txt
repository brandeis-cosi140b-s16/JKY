Little else can be said about KoMex other than get here as soon as you can. The flavors and the textures are a party in your mouth. 

Come really hungry because you're going to want to "overdo it" and order way more than is reasonable for a party of your size. 

You'd be wise to only look at the "Fusion Specialties" section of the menu. Our bellies were so happy:
- Bulgogi nachos - hot damn! These might be my 'last meal'
- The four hot sauces available on the table:  unique, not too spicy, flavor packed (you're going to want to put them in your bag/purse)
- Fusion wings - extra crispy, only slightly spicy and slightly sweet - perfect to share
- Fusion flautas - YUM, everyone seemed to be ordering these, so we did too
- Fusion enchiladas - also yum, although we couldn't tell which enchilada was which meat (we ordered the combo) 

If you're visiting Vegas and have a rental car, this place is 120% worth a visit. 

I'd dish out five Yelp Stars if it weren't for the woman who was our waitress - who aslo seemed to be the manager. She had a bit of an attitude that put us off and also constantly yelled at the other staff (in front of customers).
