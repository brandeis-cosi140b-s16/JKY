Airport restaurants have never been my favorite. Always overpriced but what the heck. Looking for breakfast and saw breakfast burrito. This place is within the Terminal 4 A wing gate just past gate A4. 

Wasn't expecting much but the take-out line was short so I ordered the matcha and egg burrito. Very surprised. The tortilla was hot, thin, and down right good. Matcha was tender and juicy but just juicy enough so that it's not dripping down your arm while eating it. The eggs were very good too. So I really loved my morning matcha breakfast burrito. 

Yes a little overpriced but everything is overpriced at airports. Food good. Service fast. So if your looking for a quick and good breakfast burrito, I recommend this place. Enjoy and happy flying. I sure am.
