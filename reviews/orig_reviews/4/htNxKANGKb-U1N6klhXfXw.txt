Didn't try any of the food, I stopped in for a documentary that they were showing "Huicholes: The Last Peyote Guardians."  The atmosphere of this place is great, and the staff is extremely friendly!  I asked if they had coffee, which they didn't at the time but didn't hesitate to start brewing some right up!
