I wish there were 4.5 stars because there is nothing that China Poblano did wrong at all to not deserve the full 5 stars.  However, I have a special place in my heart for Jaleo since I have now been to three of them.  

This place was awesome.  The decor is super casual and friendly.  There are some cool displays throughout that attempt to define the fusion aspect of the restaurant.  In Chef Andres own word's "we must build bridges not walls with our differences".  There are a various array of choices from both Chinese and Mexican small plates.  

The setas taco, the lengua taco, and the silencio taco arrived at our table in such a rapid succession I was instantly transported to a blissful world of flavorful bliss. The sea air margarita was so light and refreshing I had to marvel at its creation.  No doubt about the true genius behind the cuisine at any of Chef Andres's restaurants, but this one feels as though they are really trying go the extra mile. 

The staff was so down to Earth and friendly.  They know that their menu is unusual and are more than willing to work with you to figure out the best choices for your group. The manager even stopped by our table and asked us how everything was going and if we needed any help with anything.  This was not done in the lame, corporate makes me do this at least twice per hour, kind of way but in a way that really showed how dedicated this staff is in creating an excellent dining experience and memory.

I have been a fan of Chef Andres for years, and will be for years to come.
