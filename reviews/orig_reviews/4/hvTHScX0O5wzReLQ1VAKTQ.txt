This was not my first time at Blue Agave. We went a few years ago and weren't really impressed. The Yelp deal helped me try it out again and I can honestly say I am pleased with our decision. Everything was great!  They have an awesome menu with some items that seemed slightly different than your standard Mexican restaurant choices.  We were very pleased with the food and service. We'll be back.
