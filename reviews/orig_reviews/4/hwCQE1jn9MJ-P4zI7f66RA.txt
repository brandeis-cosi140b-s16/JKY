Delicious food but stupid restaurant organization and layout. There are 4 different lines you have to get in depending on what protein you want. Doesn't make any sense after waiting 15-20 minutes in line just to be limited in what you can or can't get. Frustrating experience!

But damn it, the food is bomb. The tacos, quesadilla, and the cam-something fries all hit the spot. I would happily eat here again now that I know how to work this system.
