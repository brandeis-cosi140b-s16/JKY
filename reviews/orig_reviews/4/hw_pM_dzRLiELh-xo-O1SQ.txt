I live by the Roberto's at 1101 Fort Apache, but I like to go to this one because their food is much tastier. They also get your order right the first time. I like salsa and the salsa at this Roberto's is exceptional. The red sauce has a smoky flavor that is delicious - it's spicy but not too spicy. The green salsa is the best I've had here in Las Vegas. Compared to the Roberto's near my house, there is no comparison. My husband usually gets the beef chimichanga and I get the rolled tacos. Our daughter gets enchiladas. All are very good. They also have a salsa bar with fresh lemons and limes.
