Was introduced to this restaurant about 7-8 years ago when they still had their A-frame place on Charleston. We used to go there for lunch & have the tortas which were yummy! Have still been going since they moved and still pleased with the food :) Good authentic Mexican food and nice ambiance in the restaurant.
