I eat lunch here sometimes.  The chips are always a little on the burned side and need tons of salt.  I've learned from experience that this just goes better with the salsa there.  Besides, these chips are real.  Not some gigantic bag of factory chips laying on some heating tray in the back.  They killed those tortillas this morning, in boiling oil.  Seriously, the first bite not capture your imagination but you'll slowly find yourself wondering why you can't stop eating them.

They have daily specials, my favorite of which is the chicken mole which is Thursdays I believe.  I'm also a sucker for Friday's chille relleno.  If I'm there on some other less glorious day, I'll opt for the cheese enchilada plate or the Clare burro.  Try the ice tea.  It's got cinnamon in it and it doesn't taste a thing like Lipton's.
