Holy cow this bar is out of control. People come here to party like it's their last day on earth! I like to bring people here from out of town. They're always amused with the beergaritas and shocked that people like to party like it's 1999 on Sundays. I love El Hefe because they have a great happy hour but I can only handle this bar in small doses. I'm not a fan of not being able to walk without my drink spilling and getting bumped by random bitches with big purses.
