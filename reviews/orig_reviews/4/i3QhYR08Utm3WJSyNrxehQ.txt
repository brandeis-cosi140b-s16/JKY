My daughter and I were in Vegas for the WPPI convention and had purchased some restaurant.com coupons and this was one we had purchased. It was a little difficult finding the restaurant not knowing our way around town. We called and the hostess was very helpful giving us directions. We both thought the nachos were the bomb and our burritos were big and just as delicous. I would recommend Coconuts
