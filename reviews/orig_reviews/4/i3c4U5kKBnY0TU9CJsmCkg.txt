Went here today for the first time.  It was really good & for sure this is going to be a new regular spot for me to go too.  I ordered 3 things...Bean & Cheese Burrito, Chicken Burrito and a Chicken Quesadilla.   I gave my husband the Chicken Burrito which he said was "excellent" and better than Chipolte, which he loves!   I got the chicken Quesadilla without guacamole & it was delicious!   I ate the whole thing.  The bean & Cheese burrito is saved for later as I wanted to get two items in case I didn't like one.  That was just "ok".  Next time, I will definitely order the quesadilla again or maybe try the tacos.  The only thing I can say which was weird was the red sauce was tasty but kinda thick & came out in big lumps... not really a "sauce".  Not sure if it was a fluke or if it's always like that. ?   Anyway, the restaurant seemed really clean, organized and the staff was really nice & the environment seems welcoming.   I would give it 4.5 stars if you can give a half star.  If the bean & cheese burrito was a little better & the sauce I would have given it a 5.   I noticed lots of people ordering those fresco drinks & I will be ordering one of those next time as well. I am thrilled I found this new local spot!  Go there if you haven't yet!!!

I am back to edit my review.  Went again tonight.  The "sauce" was perfect. Have no idea why it was lumpy last week but I am leaning towards a 5 on this place.  How do you give 4.5 stars?  Anyway, I am going to go couple more times and solidify my star rating once and for all for this little gem. 

Also tonight I got a strawberry fresca drink and yes, it is pretty good.  Seems a little creamy-- in a nice way.   Refreshing for sure! I think it's fresh juice so healthy is always great!
