Out of all the Javier's locations in the US this one is my favourite. I asked the waiter which pork dish he recommended, and I could not have been happier, because the Carnitas (Carnitas Fresh natural pork prepared Michoacan style. Served with refritos, guacamole, salsa quemada, cilantro and warm tortillas. - $27) was Awesome!

Atmosphere: Possibly the nicest designed location. It is in the Aria at City Center. Very cool interior, with intimate booths. The private room for large parties looks awesome.

Food: I really enjoyed mine so much that I ate too much. I tend to eat lightly at one time, and am a big box the rest to go fan. In vegas tho you ain't carrying to-go boxes around all night.. haha.

Drinks: Margaritas rocked! I only had 1, but wanted more *pants like a dog*

Staff: Professional, friendly, great.

Would give 5 stars, but others at my table were not as wowed as I was by their food. We had plenty on our plates to share around. Hearty, but not excessive portions.
