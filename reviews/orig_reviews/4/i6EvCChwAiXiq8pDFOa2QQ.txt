The food here is super fresh and delicious! They let you try all of the meats before you pick your meal. Everything is made to order like at Chipotle but with way more flavor and variety. 

When we arrived we were STARVING, like DYING of starvation. No exaggeration. And of course we just happened to walk in after a group of like 9 people and they totally clogged up the works. After us was like four or five people so they became very quickly overwhelmed by the sudden rush of people. When we went to eat our food in the dining area, almost every table was covered with dirty dishes. I guess the people who had come in to eat didn't understand you're supposed to clear off your stuff. 

Other than the service hiccup, I would definitely come back to eat here. The prices are great too!
