Went here a couple of times on a recent trip to Scottsdale.  Had great service and good food both trips.  I recommend the queso and chips but I was a little underwhelmed by the salsa.  Also, the margaritas were a little on the sweet side.  As a comparison, I absolutely loved the margaritas at Rehab Burger.  

Would I go back here again?  Absolutely.
