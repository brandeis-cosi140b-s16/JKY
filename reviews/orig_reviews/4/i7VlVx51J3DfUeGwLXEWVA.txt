4 stars for Pittsburgh.  Competent service, good drinks.  I don't love the theme-ed-ness or, for that matter, the food.  But they have lots of great specials and the California salad with lime cilantro dressing is one of the best salads in the 'Burgh.  

If you don't like the noise, go for lunch, especially a weekend lunch or early dinner.  Other locations are fine too.

FYI, vegetarians, the dressing has cheese in it.  And it's so good, I bet it's actually real parmigiano reggiano, too, or close to it.
