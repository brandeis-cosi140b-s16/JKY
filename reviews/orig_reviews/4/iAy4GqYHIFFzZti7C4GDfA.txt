Funky little place attached to a hotel. They start with complementary chips and guac, which were great. The guac is a little different with some citrus fruit in it - but it works. The tacos were very good, especially the carne asada. It looks like they have a great happy hour and patio as well. Service was spot-on. Would love to go back.
