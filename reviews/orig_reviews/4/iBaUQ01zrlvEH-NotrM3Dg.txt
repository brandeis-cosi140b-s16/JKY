I'm originally from New Mexico, so when most places here in AZ say they have green chili on the menu, it's usually pretty weak. But man oh man Carlsbad Tavern has the real deal! I chose a green chili burritto stuffed with carne adovado and it was spicy in the best way. It was a huge portion so I was able to take half home for later:) My boyfriend tried the Food Network acclaimed Habenero Burger, and seemed to love every bite.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and the decore makes you feel like you're really eating in a cave. We sat inside, but the outdoor patio was just as awesome with a running waterfall I'm sure helps cool you off in the summer heat. 

Great menu, great beer selection and nice service. Highly recommended if you're up for some spice or a drink in a cool location, definatly not your typical "Scottsdale" bar.
