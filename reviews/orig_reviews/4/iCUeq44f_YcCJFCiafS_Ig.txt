For seafood and Mexican lovers you can't go wrong.  I've never gotten something here that I didn't enjoy.  I always get either the seafood enchiladas or the seafood quesadillas and they are to die for.  Their margaritas are fabulous.  I also got the Javier's ensalada w/ shrimp before and it was so good.  The service is hit or miss.  If you're on a time restraint you may want to go elsewhere.  Also, they don't split checks.  Excellent food with just OK service.
