I enjoy going to this restaurant often. It's a sit down for dinner type place, and the menu is quite extensive. I try something different every time I go, but the fried ice cream is something everyone should try at least once. The person I dine with enjoys the Tamales, but they are a bit pricey for the meal. The daily specials are worth the effort in price, and the lunch menu can't be beat for the time of day. 

I do caution people to understand the waiters. It's a touch and go topic, some of the servers are attentive and quick to refill a glass of soda, where-as others can't be found regardless of where you sit. It really just depends on the day and time.
