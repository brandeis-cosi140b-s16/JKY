We returned again after the owner reached out to us to apologize about our previous experience there. This time around, our server Eric was wonderful. He was very attentive and friendly and everything came out quickly as well.

Between the four of us, we ordered drinks (great margaritas!), the trio chip appetizer, tacos, and sopapillas. All of the food was very good.

The prices here are excellent. Our total bill was very inexpensive for all that we ordered. This is a fun hangout spot!
