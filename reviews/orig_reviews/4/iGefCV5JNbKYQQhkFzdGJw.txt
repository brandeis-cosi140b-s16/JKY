Scene: Sunday night after a San Francisco Giants win, noisy bar crowd, policeman stationed near the entrance

I regretted not coming for lunch, which I would suggest, if you'd like a calmer ambiance. Request the back patio. The policeman's presence was curious, but I learned later he was there to watch for rowdy patrons, due to Scottsdale's bar scene. After a shade in the front patio hit my head due to the wind, I moved to another table in the patio.

The table side prepared guacamole looked great, but is quite a large portion for one. A server said I could have a taste, but didn't follow through. My server arrived, who was quite pleasant. He suggested items for vegetarians and his favorites.

He agreed on my choice of the Shaved Kale Salad. It was a generous portion, easily shared, with a delicious blend of sweet and savory, due to blood oranges, goat cheese and marcona almonds which compliment the kale. He told me the guacamole is only one size. I then chose the Roasted Organic Butternut Squash Tacos, since they are handmade. I was concerned about jalapenos but it's not a spicy dish. Beautiful presentation! Bite size tacos contain sweet butternut squash offset by a tasty mixture of spices.

I wanted dessert, but don't particularly like bread pudding, and chose it due to other Yelpers' compliments. I couldn't photograph it due to the darkness of the front patio. The pumpkin is quite subtle. It was disappointing that the ice cream had melted, and the small piece of bread pudding was almost submerged in the sauce, which created a mess. I mentioned this to my server, but he didn't offer anything else. I would choose another dessert. 

The cooking at The Mission is quite refined and inventive, due to the chef's creativity. The restaurant is very busy, in addition to the bar, which overwhelms the staff. Try visiting for brunch, lunch or on a weekday night, when one could enjoy the delicious food in outdoor patios.
