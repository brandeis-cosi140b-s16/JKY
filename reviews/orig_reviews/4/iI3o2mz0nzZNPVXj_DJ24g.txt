I can see why people love the tamales, but they weren't 'my cup of tea.' Instead I was very impressed with the section of their menu that focused on spicy items. I ordered the burrito with inferno sauce in it. Finally, something that would sting and linger. I like this place a lot and so does everyone else in my family ( immediate and extended).
