After a tequila class the wife and I stayed for dinner and I enjoyed my experience very much. We ordered the family style tacos where they deliver the various ingredients needed to build your own tacos. You get to choose from a variety of proteins and they all come with beans and rice for your taco building pleasure. 

I enjoyed the taco's very much but I would have enjoyed it if the proteins were a little more packed with flavor. I felt the flavors were more subtle but still very good. If I had one complaint it would be that the plates are too small. I'm not sure if everyone receives the same plates we did, but we only had these clear rectangular flat plates that weren't even the width of the tacos we were building. I, of course, was spilling rice and beans all over the table as the plates was not efficient enough to catch the falling foods from my tacos. 

Over all I really liked this place. The Tequila collection is extensive and the decor and over all feel of the restaurant was awesome. If you are in the area please stop and have a real margarita and taste some of the best Tequila you will find anywhere in the burgh.
