Open air concept adjacent to construction at Red Rock casino! Fun lunch! Attentive staff very well versed on menu and ingredients. Stiegl from Austria is a must enjoy again beverage but I'll pass on ordering ice tea here again let's just say it's a tad reminiscent of cough syrup... Order Stiegl instead!!!  Tacos are small in scale but the ingredients are KICK ASS no doubt about it!  Mahi Ceviche..... PERFECT!!! To go order included a coupon!
