I am going to name two things that are musts when you stop here, but above all, there is one ultimate reason. There can be only one. 

The Prickly Pear Margarita. House. Prickly. Pear. Syrup. Ambrosia, straight up nectar of the Gods. And ye be warned, they make 'em potent. Don't let that adorbs cactus glass and that beautiful fuchsia hue distract you. 

Also, that second thing. Churro bites with house made chocolate dip. Because if I learned one thing from my Labor Day Weekend trip to Arizona, it was that Arizona = Churros. 

There's also really cool bartenders here who think Californians are hilarious for some reason. Yes, we say hella. Yes, I did pack entirely San Francisco Giants branded items on this trip. DÃ©cor is also on point. Blown glass bottles adorn the bar area and my bestie and I were transfixed by the bulbous red lamp covering that mirrored our faces.

All in all, Joyride is an awesome stop for specialty drinks. I have never tasted anything like that before, and doubt I will again. Can't speak to the dine in options, but they looked tasty. The interactive menu that they have online is pretty sweet. Check it out!
