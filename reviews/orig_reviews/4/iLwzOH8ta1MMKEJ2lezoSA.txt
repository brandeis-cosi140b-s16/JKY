Nice find in the area. Taco Bar with so many options it made my head spin but the chicken hit the spot. 2 hot chicken and 1 mild. Perfect. Ordered the Nacho's  which was no more than chips with cold cheese, beans and a meat of my choice. very disappointing with the super tacos. I will be back and want to try the burritos but be assured the Nachos will not be on the menu.
