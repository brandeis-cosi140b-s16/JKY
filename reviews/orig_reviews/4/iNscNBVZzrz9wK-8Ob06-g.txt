I have been here three times in the last year and each time was excellent.  I've sat outside, inside at a high top table and at the bar.  Service was great no matter where we sat.  They have a good selection of beers, bottle and tap.  But the winner here is the food.  The roast pork tenderloin was spicy and flavorful.  Good sides as well (risotto and veggies).  Dinner salad was very nice, more than just a bowl of lettuce.  House dressing was the best choice (jalapeno ranch), cream but with a bit of heat.

On a previous visit I had the seafood pasta special which had tons of seafood and a VERY spicy red sauce.  I enjoyed it, but if you want just ask and they will tone it down for you.  Customer service here was excellent.  Wait staff quite knowledgeable on the menu, willing to explain what's hot and what's not, give recommendations, and just make it an enjoyable experience for you.
