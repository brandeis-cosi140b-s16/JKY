Have been for dinner as well as brunch on the weekends.  Just bare in mind that the menus are quite different.  Only a few a the items from dinner are offered at brunch. Food has very unique flavor combinations and all of it works! Atmosphere is loud and trendy.  One thing I don't get is the need for them to give impression of false exclusivity and demand.  The first time we were there was for an early dinner around 5:00pm.  When we walked in, we told the hostess we would like a table for two.  She didn't ask if we had a reservation, but instead insisted that the only seats available were at the sushi bar because they had so many reservations.  Fine, no problem.  However, in the hour that we were there, the majority of the tables remained empty.  They obviously make a habit of this, because a friend said the same thing happened to them.  Don't know why they feel the need to do this, but it's very annoying.
