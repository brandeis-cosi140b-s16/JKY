This food is amazing! My family went to try Komex last weekend because we love Mexican food, and we love Korean food. We heard about it from Las Vegas Weekly magazine. We tried the Bulgogi rice, bulgogi nachos, and the teriyaki chicken. The Korean flavors are the best! They have a Korean spicy sauce that is to die for! Not spicy! Just perfect. The only complaint would be the service. For a first timer it is a little confusing because you really don't know if you need to seat yourself or if there is a waitress. Well, we just sat down ourselves and a waitress did show up. It was busy so I understand...The food outweighs any problem with service. I would recommend this to anyone who wants good food!
