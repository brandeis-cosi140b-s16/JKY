I went to Z'Tejas on a recent business trip to Phoenix.  We were looking for something a little nicer off University and Z'Tejas fit the bill perfectly.  My friend and I arrived and opted to sit at the bar.  

Drinks / Appetizers:  The bartender was prompt and we were lucky enough to arrive at 6:59 and the happy hour closed at 7.  We ordered 2x of their special margaritas (the strong ones), the shrimp mini-tostadas and the tuna appetizer.  The drinks arrived promptly accompanied by the homemade cornbread (amazing) and were a fantastic mix of flavor and alcohol.  Normally with frozen margaritas they go too strong or not strong enough, these were perfect.  The sesame tuna sashimi was good as I would expect it to be, however the shrimp mini-tostadas were the star of the appetizers.  The pesto was fantastic and they went quickly.  

Main Course:  We both ordered steak fajitas and they came out sizzling as they should.  I prefer a little harder char on the steak, but you couldn't deny the flavor.  They were good enough to feel confident about ordering them on a regular basis, however don't expect them to change redefine what you want in a fajita.  They were what you'd expect from a nice restaurant.    

Desert:  We each started with a 3rd margarita each (which we later were told was the limit because it equates to a 1/2 bottle of alcohol) and ordered peach cobblers.  Be warned, these warm cobblers are ENORMOUS and unless you have an empty leg, or severe case of self loathing, I'd order it to share.  

Overall thoughts / impression:  The restaurant was exactly what we were looking for when we walked in off University.  It was a nicer mid-tier restaurant experience in what is typically a collegey area of town (ASU is right down the street).  The Happy Hour is noteworthy in that drinks / appetizers were 1/2 off and if I make it back to Phoenix for work or fun I'd definitely attend again for that reason alone.
