Really awesome tacos here. I ordered the black mole and the conchinita pibil tacos. One of each and a steak queso. I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in 

The mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious. 

The horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.

the salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.

I'm buying a bike just to ride here.  A lowerider bike with two 20's in a trailer. So I can rock all the way there.

for now condesa....you are in my top 10.
