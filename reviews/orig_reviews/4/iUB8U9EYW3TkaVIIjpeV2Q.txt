The type of cuisine at Carlsbad is officially considered 'Green Hash Chile New Mexican Style.'  I know this because we asked the bartender as we sat pondering the menu.  This was my first visit to Carlsbad Tavern, and it will not be my last.

I went with a house salad and will agree with Rick S in recommending it with their jalapeno ranch dressing.  Either it was really good or I was really hungry, but I digress!  For my entree, the lobster enchiladas were completely satisfying - especially once they brought out a side of guacamole per my request.  Jared had the carne adovada plate.  (I guess he gets that every f-in time he goes there; i don't think he's ever had anything else!  Guess he likes it!)  No desserts or drinks this visit, but I'm sure we'll be back for more... although the mints on the way out were great!  (And for those curious about the price, our bill was $36 before tip).

We noticed they serve a Sunday Brunch - Bloody Mary Bar as well... sounds good to me; especially once we move to Old Town and won't have to worry about drinking and driving!

Friendly attentive service at the bar, and many more menu items I am excited to try.  Until next visit, Carlsbad Tavern...
