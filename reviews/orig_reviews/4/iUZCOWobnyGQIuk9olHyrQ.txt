This place just has a really good happy hour. I usually just stick to appetizers when I go but with free chips and salsa all night, I don't need much more. Their happy hour goes from 3:00 to 7:30, fantastic considering happy hours seem to be ending earlier and earlier now a days. 

There are plenty of HDTV's around to keep me entertained, so I'm gonna guess it gets really busy on Sundays during football. 

This is just a good place for pretty cheap drinks and decent Mexican food.
