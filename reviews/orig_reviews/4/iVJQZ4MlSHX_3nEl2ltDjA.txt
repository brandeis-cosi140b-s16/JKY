We stumbled on to this place and decided to go in. It was pretty quiet because it was between breakfast and lunch which was nice. We ended up getting the Mexico City tacos and the Baja fish tacos and I have to say that the food as delicious. The service was incredibly friendly, and the margaritas hit the spot. One of the guys fixed our margarita which entailed adding more tequila, so I'd definitely recommend this place! The guacamole was very tasty and they had a nice smokey chipotle salsa.
