Of the high end Mexican restaurants, this is my favorite.  It's not an inexpensive restaurant but the quality of the cheese, meats and veg is certainly a cut above.  The atmosphere is more upscale than a typical Mexican restaurant and the barkeep does a mean margarita.

Additionally, I love their chips and salsa.  They have an excellent salsa with light portions of meat in it which is delicious.  I'm a fan.
