If you had told me before that I would enjoy a mix between Panda Express and your local Mexican joint, I'd a laughed. But between the Jade-red chicken, jerk fried rice, refried beans and snicker-doodle cookie, I couldn't imagine a better lunch. The food settled well, and I'll be back again soon! The staff was enthusiastic to help me when they heard it was my first time there, too.

What's even better than the food was the fact that I looked around and saw business men in suits and ties in a part of town that was beyond sketchy. They're definitely doing things the right way, and attracting people from all over the valley.
