I give 5 stars to the food, al pastor, carne asada, the corn!!! barbacoa, the tacos and salsa are some of the best in Vegas.  

I need to take off a star for the lines.  This place is chaotic if it's busy.  The lines all mesh together, first time people have no idea where to stand.  I feel like you gotta work to get your food here.
