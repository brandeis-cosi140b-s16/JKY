We went for lunch and had great service. We ordered the special hot sauce which is haberno. Its very hot and tasty. Wait to get something to drink before you taste. I had the Chicken enchiladas which were good. We had some shots of Tequila. Our server told us all about the tequila and it was very smooth, but not high priced. I will definately be going back and enjoying another meal.
