This new restaurant is off the beaten path (right next to a strip club, I mean like share a sidewalk next door) but inside the place is charming. 

The food was good, local, organjc, non gmo. 

We had a group of 6 people everyone had something different and all enjoyed their meals. 

Made at the table guacamole is yummy but grandma's flan is delicious!!!!  Normally just kind of eh about flan but this had lovely flavor and texture.

Check this place out!!!
