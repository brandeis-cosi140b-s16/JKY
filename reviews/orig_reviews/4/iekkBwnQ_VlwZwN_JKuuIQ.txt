Staying at the Luxor this week and had this on our list of places to eat since it is so conveniently located inside the Luxor. 


The waitress was super nice and friendly. I ordered the chicken enchilada which was delicious. My friend odered the beef burrito and loved it. The portions are large and worth the price.The cocktails were pretty pricey and small. I got the watermelon cocktail and my friend got the lemon drop, they were tasty but sour. We were amazed when we were offered to go cups for our cocktails. Vegas virgin here! The tables are way too small, but the decor is pretty awesome resembling cut out paper designs. I wouldn't go again, but I'm glad I tried it.
