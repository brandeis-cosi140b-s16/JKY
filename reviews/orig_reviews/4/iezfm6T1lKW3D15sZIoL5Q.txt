Such a fan of this restaurant. I have been for brunch, lunch and dinner. Each time I have visited, I have had fantastic service. I love the style and ambience of the restaurant. I love the location and how it was actually a mission at one point. I don't think they missed a mark anywhere with this restaurant. When the food, service, and ambiance are all in sync, you have yourself one fantastic restaurant on your hands. My recs would be the table side guac, shrimp tacos, street corn, grilled prawn salad, and the peruvian clam soup!!!!! I am in love with that soup! You can't go wrong with anything though! Oh and the margaritas are top notch, especially the Primarita. It is more expensive but so worth it! I also love the red sangria. 

The curros are also mind blowing. I can go on forever about this restaurant. It is one of my favorites in old town! Hands down!
