I went here with a group from work for lunch. Everyone seemed pleased. 
I had the Carne Asada Tacos and they were wonderful and just what I expected. Grilled steak cheese and pico de gallo. 
The side I chose was the fried plantains and they were GREAT. A lot of people said they were greasy but they were no more than could be expected for being fried. 
We also ordered the Guacamole. It was wonderful! Just like I had made it in my own kitchen. It was a good size for 6 of us so if its just you, you might want to not order a meal or just wait for another time. 
The service was good, not exceptional but not bad either. 
I want to go back and try the margaritas.
