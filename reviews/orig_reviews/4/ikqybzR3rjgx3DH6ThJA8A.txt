On a whim (and because we were hungry), we decided to try this place, especially as it was recommended by a relative.
We went for lunch and sat outside. So nice not to have to brave the snow that others around the country are having to deal with.
The waitress was very helpful and she gave us some great food suggestions. 
Two of us had three tacos each and the third member of the group had a burrito. We were all very pleased with our choices and we all cleaned our plates.
I had a Negra Modelo on tap which was perfect. 
Our waitress could have been Penelope Cruz's double (well, maybe when PC was a few years younger). She added a little extra zing to the meal!
Definitely a fun place for lunch in the sun.
