The food was amazing! Especially the tacos. We went for Taco Tuesday, so the tacos were all $2, but would otherwise be $3-$5 dollars each which is an expensive taco, if you ask me. The chips and salsa were good too. The service needed some improvement because there was only one guy working his butt off and our waitress was nowhere to be found, but the food was worth it.
