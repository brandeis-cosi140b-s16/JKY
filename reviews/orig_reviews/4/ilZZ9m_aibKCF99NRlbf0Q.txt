My fiance had been begging me to go to Chino Bandido with him.  So, last weekend, I  finally caved.  It's a Mexican-Asian Fusion restaurant.  I had the Jade Red Chicken, which was really good, accompanied with just some plain, steamed white rice.  He had the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla with the Machaca and Jerk Fried rice.  He loved everything on his plate.  Overall, I'd say the restaurant was what I expected.  I'll probably get take-out next time though.  The seating is cafeteria-style, and the tables and floors weren't clean.  :/  That was kind of a bummer.  The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable though.  It's worth your time to check it out. =)
