I didn't have high expectations for such an unusual type of fusion food, but I thought SumoMaya was great.  We mostly had Mexican cuisine (ceviche, tacos) all of which was excellent.
I deducted a star for our somewhat pretentious server, who didn't write down our order and then forgot two of our dishes.  I reminded him, and then he only brought one of them, then had our table cleared and asked if we wanted dessert.
We said no, and as he was walking away, a waiter walked towards our table with our salad (the missing dish).  Our server whispered in his ear and sent him away.  Did he really think we didn't notice/forgot?  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and ask if we still wanted the dish.  Some maturity and grace, rather than trying to save face, would have gone much farther.
