I really loved this place!  Visting LV a local friend of ours took us here.

were were immediately served chips with excellent salsa that actually had some kick to it!  not only that, refried beans were served along with them too..very nice touch!  I had the tacos al pastor...the were ok and not served with the traditional pineapple, onions and cilantro.  Bf got the seafood mariscos..he liked it.  Friend had chicken tacos in hard shell..they looked good and he finished them so thats a sign.

all in all it was a nice experience and very nice to be off the strip. 
Oh if anything go there to check ou the shrine of creepy clown figurines, dolls and puppets...very odd
