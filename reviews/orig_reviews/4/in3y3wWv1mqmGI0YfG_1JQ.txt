Went to the Mission last night for dinner with my husband and friend.  We LOVED the tableside guacamole!  Definitely worth the trip for just that.  Based on the other recommendations we got the pork shoulder tacos.  They were good, we weren't crazy about the sauce that came with it but we substituted the salsa they gave us for the chips and used that on the pork.. yummy!  The atmosphere is really nice, but it is loud inside.  Great place to check out.  Would recommend it, especially if you are in the Old Town Scottsdale area.
