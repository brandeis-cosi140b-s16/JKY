Bar none, they have the best Fajitas in town...and I've been to literally every other mexican restaurant of note.  Always a nice atmosphere and service, too.  We literally drive about 20 minutes out of our way just to go here when we get a hankering for fajitas.

I've had friends order other dishes and it looked pretty run-of-the-mill and they were not particularly impressed.

I would give it 5 stars on Fajitas and 3 on the other stuff, so 4 averaged.
