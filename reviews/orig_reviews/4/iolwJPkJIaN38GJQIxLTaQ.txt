Okay, so it takes a bit to get food but if you have a talkative group you won't even notice. The waitresses are very nice and attentive which I like. The food I ordered a chicken enchilada with a soft carne asada taco.. It was amazing. I ate it very quickly not only because I was hungry but because it was good. 

The only reason why this place did not get 5 stars is due to the wait for food.. Other than that I will definitely come back!
