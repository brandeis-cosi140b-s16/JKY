Fairly new to the Gilbert restaurant scene and it's only been open for a few months, but this place is pretty damn good. I've had a lot of New Mexican food...IN New Mexico and this place would fit right in.

If you're in the know, this place is similar to Weck's and even does the Christmas style. Portions don't seem large, but are deceiving. I can barely eat my entire meal and usually question if it's going to be enough food.

Service is friendly, but the place is pretty small. Definitely feels like a down home diner with great food. Give it a try! Prices are really good and food is way better.
