I was really sad when Republic closed because it was a place I would frequent often for brunch. However, I will go on record to say Taco Y Taco is worth no longer having Republic. I love Mexican food in every form of the word and I am never disappointed when I come here. The street corn and Al Pastor are my favorite by far. My only wish would be that they would give the place a makeover because their attempt at decor is just cheesy. The space has great bones and the potential to be a very chic place. But for now as long as the food stays how it is I will absolutely come back, time and time again.
