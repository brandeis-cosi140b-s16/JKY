Very tasty tex-mex like Mexican food. There are three levels of salsa and I love the hottest one which is actually spicy! The white queso is creamy and delicious! The nachos are huge and all different and unique but all tasty. The tostada nacho is my favorite. The enchiladas especially cheese, ground beef and pork are delicious. The chimichanga and street tacos are all great! 

The margaritas are fabulous all different flavors are tasty! Plus if you get a frozen margarita (the alcohol content is stronger)


If you want the best service make sure you ask for Kim!!! She is awesome... A nacho hell yeah!!!
