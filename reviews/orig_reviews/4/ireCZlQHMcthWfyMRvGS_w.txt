Whopping portions and exemplary service combine with excellent-tasting Mexican food to make Pedro's a Mexican restaurant worth your drive and money.

Regular customers fill the seats which reflects the excellent service.  Chips and homemade salsa are delivered almost instantly after being seated, and the entrees are delivered quickly.  I had the 3 mini beef taco, tostada, and tacquito combo (picture is attached) and it was enormous and very tasty.  I was hungry and could only eat half, so it could definitely be enough for two people to split.

Part of what brought me here was the buy-one, get-one coupon in the Entertainment Book.  So, even though my combo was normally $12, it averaged out to $6 after the coupon.  

On the downside, the place is pretty tacky and the building is outdated.  But, I'm willing to overlook it once I realized the quality that they serve.  In short, Pedro's is arguably one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!
