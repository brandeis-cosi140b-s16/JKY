When they tell you the conchinita tacos are hot they are not lying.  These are Man vs Food HOT but delicious.  All the tacos I had were very good.  The fish were fried just right, the short ribs and mole were both very juicy.  Would definitely return... But will probably stay away from the conchinita myself.
