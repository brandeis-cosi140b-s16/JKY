Had lunch at Frank & Fina's with some friends on a weekend.  To start, we had the chips and salsa with an order of queso fundido.  The chips needed salt, the salsa was thin but had good flavor.  It was a typical restaurant salsa.  The queso fundido was a large portion with lots of peppers on top.  It comes with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  It's a little difficult to get out of the bowl, we all had to use a knife, fork or our hands.  This can occur with this dish.  Despite the issues, it was a good version of queso fundido.

To eat, I had the Tampiquena, a thin ribeye steak COVERED in peppers and onions.  You can barely see the steak there is so much vegetation.  It is served with rice, beans, a cheese enchilada and your choice of flour or corn tortillas.  It's quite a lot of food for $13.95.  The steak is seasoned very well as are the vegetables.  I highly recommend taking some bites with the enchilada.  The steak is very thin, so I don't know that it can be cooked to medium rare, but even thought it was cooked more than I typically like, it was juicy.  This is a fantastic, and very filling meal, and one I will absolutely order again.

Service was attentive.  We had a nice long lunch and required lots of refills and they were brought promptly.  Also, we talked for a bit after we ate, and the staff never made us feel like we were overstaying our welcome.
