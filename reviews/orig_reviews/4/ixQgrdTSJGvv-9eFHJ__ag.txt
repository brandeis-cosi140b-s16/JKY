love the atmosphere of the relaxation of Hawaii ... the foods are great n fresh.  i love eating at chipotle but this is different & has more choices. the meats products are a bit salty but favorful.  the sauces are fresh n good.  i love mine spicy, n theirs are pretty clean cut spicy choices. i will totally eat here again.
