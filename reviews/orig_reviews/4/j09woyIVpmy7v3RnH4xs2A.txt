So on Friday night I flew into AZ to get some well deserved party times with some good friends I haven't seen in a while. One of my besties told me that he LOVES these tacos here. So after about 3 hours of hype we decided to venture to this Little place (which turns into a club after 10 pm) 

I can say the chicken tacos on corn tortillas are amazing, the chicken tacos on the flour tortillas were easily forgotten. The service was good, friendly and prompt however in the time span of 3 hours we had 4 different servers. So it was to say the least a bit confusing towards the end of the night. 

Tacos + Shots + Beers + Dancing + Great friends = GOOD TIMES 

I will be back - if i remember how to get there!
