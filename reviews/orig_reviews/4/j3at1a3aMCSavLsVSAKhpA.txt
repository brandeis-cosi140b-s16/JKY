Happened upon this place while waiting to watch Zumanity @ the NYNY. I was actually pretty surprised by this place. It has a nice atmosphere and really decent prices for an in casino restaurant. The chips and salsa were perfect and the carnitas tacos I had were moist and juicy. Everything served hot and fresh with great ambiance. The beans were pretty tasty, and something most restaurants mess up. If your on this end of the strip its not a bad place to stop before heading to the club.
