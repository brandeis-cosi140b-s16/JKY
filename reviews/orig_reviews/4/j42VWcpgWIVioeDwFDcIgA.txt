So I was not in the mood for Mexican but I went with friends.  The chips and salsa was yum and then the salad was SOOO dang good.  Had the chicken quesadillas which is listed under appetizer, but is really a full sized meal.  I couldn't finish it all, which if you know me, you know is highly out of character.  Make a reservation -- it's in the casino and is pretty busy at all times.  Even with our reservation, we still had  to  wait about 10-15 min to be seated.  Attentive wait staff, accommodating to special requests.  Friends had the fajitas that came out sizzling hot and they were very happy as well.
