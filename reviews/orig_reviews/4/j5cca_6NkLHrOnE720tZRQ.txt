Pretty good food. I only eat one dish there so I can't say much of other items. Staff are pretty friendly. I've been there only one time and had bad service. I did find a hair in my dish the last time I was in. I've been there's over 20 times in the last two years. There sent many choices in San tan so this is definitely a keeper.
