I went there for the 1st time tonight and am totally going back! Firstly, I ordered the Tamarind Margarita (really good) and the shrimp ceviche (wow!). My friends who ordered the tacos were not as impressed and did not seem as taken with this place as I was. Others ordered salads and said they were ok. 
The feel is rustic with a Hoboken NJ/downtown old Manhattan feel.  It is a very cool place with good service. 
It is a fun environment and I will be back!
