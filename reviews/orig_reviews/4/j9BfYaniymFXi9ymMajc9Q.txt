Lots of reasons to go to F&L's:

1) Food is made fresh. Yes, it takes time to make food from scratch instead of heating up pre-prepared dishes. So, sit back and enjoy your drink and the chips and salsa.

2) Special orders are happily accommodated. I wanted the the rolled enchiladas but with veggies instead of the other options (beef, chicken or spinach). The waiter (actually the manager since our waiter was busy) happily accommodated my order as well as giving me the option to have either or both of the green and red sauce (the red is better).

3) Huge portions. Yes, I'm small but I have a big appetite. Lunch at F&L's held me over until 8 p.m.!

4) Warm sopapillas. Warm, deep-fried bready goodness with lots of honey. What more could you want?

5) Location. Nestled in the midst of galleries, boutiques and other retail stores. I'd suggest starting your day at F&Ls so you are ready to spend the rest of your day in the surrounding area, only to break for the 5 p.m. martini.
