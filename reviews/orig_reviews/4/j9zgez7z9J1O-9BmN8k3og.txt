I ordered the carne asada fry bread loaded with green chili. It was so fresh and the fry bread was perfectly cooked and crisp. I have to say that I was disappointed with the fat pieces that were in the carne asada. I hate when restaurants do not take the time to cut that out. Next time I will be getting pork green chili fry bread and a Navajo taco. It was so good and they were fast and friendly. I heard that the breakfast burritos are amazing. Oh and one more thing...they make their tortillas homemade too and they are so light and fresh. 

I live in Central Phx but I will be making many trips to this place again!
