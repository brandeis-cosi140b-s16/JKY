Ive been coming to the Barrio for many years. The food items seem 'different' at different times. (Guacamole is always different...chunky, smooth, raspberries, cranberries, pomegranate...).
I have found that the filet topped with crab cake is probably one of the best in town. My husband loves the Mole here.
The deserts have never wowed me, however, the tequila and margaritas are always strong and worthy!
Bring your credit cards....its not cheap!
