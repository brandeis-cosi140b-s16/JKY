Located inside the Aria Hotel, Javier's is on the casino level.  The restaurant is Mexican inspired, and the decor is beautiful and inviting.  It was extremely crowded on a Saturday Night so reservations are highly recommended.  The bar was packed, but luckily our group had a table.  I ordered a delicious strawberry margarita.  For the entree, I had the taco plate with two shrimp, and one chicken tacos.  The entree comes with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream.  The portion size was sufficient.  Someone in our party ordered the ceviche which was TINY.  The plate was children's size.  All in all, Javier's had delicious food, for an expensive price.  Most drinks are in the $18+ range and the main entree's are in the $40+ dollar range.  The service was average, but I would return again for the good food.
