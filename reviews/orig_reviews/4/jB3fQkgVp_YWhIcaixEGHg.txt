Pretty darn good. 

Las Vegas is lacking in quality Mexican food, but this place is all right in my book. Not the best, but definitely worth checking out in town.

They have a good variety of salsa, all you need to do is ask for some more options. Some of their breakfast / brunch specials are pretty delicious and you can add an alcoholic beverage for not too much more money. 

It's a safe bet in a town with a severe deficiency in Mexican restaurants.
