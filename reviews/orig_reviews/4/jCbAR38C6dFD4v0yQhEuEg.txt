I have been to Nacho Daddy twice now in the last 3 days.  I came back for a 2nd visit because my first experience was so good.  Both visits I ordered the Cajun Nachos which I thought were phenomenal.  The nachos come with a lot of meat, and the spicy cajun sauce is delicious.  I also really enjoyed the bottomless chips and sals.  The salsa is made with a lot of cilantro which I love.  

The staff was extremely friendly.  My 3 year old son flirted with all the waitresses and the hostess..lol  Service was pretty good overall.  They allowed us to call ahead our order and it was at our table 2 minutes after we arrived..AWESOME!!!!

The ONLY reason I did not give a 5 star is because the prices can be a little expensive.  I am used to paying around 7-8 dollars for Nachos and with my drink I ended up paying $15.  It is worth it though.  I also like the atmosphere.  They have enough TV's to watch sports, and they typically have some good music playing as well.
