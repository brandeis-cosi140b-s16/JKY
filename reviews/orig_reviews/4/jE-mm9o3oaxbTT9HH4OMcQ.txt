The enchiladas are great!  Read a few reviews and decided to try them today. They make the enchiladas right in front of you in a pizza type oven. Soo good!  Also had a sangria which was also very good. We ordered the soup just to see and weren't impressed - the veg in it felt like it had been in a crockpot for days. Everything else was amazing tho and will definitely be back
