We go to Vegas several times a year. The first time we went to the Border Grill, we weren't too impressed.  Can't really remember why, but this trip we gave it another try. It was great. Loved the outdoor seating as we had just walked over from the pool -- we didn't want the standard pool food. I was very excited about all the gluten free selections and my fish tacos on corn shells were wonderful!  We will definitely go back on our next trip.
