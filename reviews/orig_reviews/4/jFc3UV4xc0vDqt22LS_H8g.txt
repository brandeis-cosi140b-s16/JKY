If you are catching a Spring Training game in Peoria, this is a great place to cool off or warm up with a margarita and a few Coronas. I have been making the pilgrimage to Peoria for 10 years now and Salty's has become a routine stop for the past several years. You can get into batting practice for some player autographs around 9:00, then to Salty's until the the game starts at 1:05. They open at 10:00. It is also a hopping place for post game, especially when the home team wins. I especially like the adirondack chairs and palaypas in the sand, up against the practice field fence. And there is plenty of people watching opportunities.
