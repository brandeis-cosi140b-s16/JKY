Great steak meat, the street tacos were great. The retried beans have a hint of chorizo in them which I love because that the way my dad makes them.  They give plenty of guacamole but if you like it spicy ask for extra jalape√±os on the side then the pick is very flavorful and fresh. 

Fresh that's a great way to describe the food.  

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the traditional rice while the favors are 100% on point it's not the regular rice like you make at home. Wish I could give 4.5 stars. 

Also, great decor inside. Very clean and on point. Will definitely be back.
