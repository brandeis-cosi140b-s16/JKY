I had the carnitas soft tacos and wifey had the crunchy chicken tacos. Both delicious. Although there was only one server she did an amazing job serving the outside patio. She kicked ass and made it enjoyable for a great lunch on the patio. Will return soon. Oh and the house margarita's are fresh and left me with a buzz yeaaahhh
