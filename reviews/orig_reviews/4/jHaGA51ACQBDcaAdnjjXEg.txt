As seen on Triple "D"

Great tacos, loved all the unique flavors. 

The #1 Carne Asada: Great flavor like home, tender and flavorful.

The #3 simply called "Pastor" no El: Made with brown beer-citrus braised pork with grilled pineapple salsa was killer. You tasted all those flavors and it mixed well!

The #9 Texano: A slow braised hickory barbacoa pulled pork with yayo sour cream (not sure what it included but it was fab), this was mmm... gud! 

The #10 Bombay Chicken: Saut√©ed in yellow mint coconut curry (OMG) and tamarind chutney (can u add more unique flavors please!), was simply mind blowingly (if that's a word) different. 

The #11 Shanghai: I picked this because of the name alone, but was it ever a surprise!
This was a wasabi steak (shudd I continue?), in Chinese preserved black bean sauce (Hmmm... think about that), with napa cabbage slaw n wasabi crema (again I don't know the exact ingredients to this was but sweet momma of tacos it was great!). The flavors just sang in my mouth.

My wife and I loved the great prices too.

The down side was no refills on drinks, its all can or bottles, so it get's 4 stars.

Other than that we're coming back if we can before we leave town.
If you like flavor and something different, don't be a La-La, check it out meng!
