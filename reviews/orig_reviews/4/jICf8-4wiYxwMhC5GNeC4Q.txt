Saw this place on Man vs. Food and thought we'd give it a shot.  Wife had the Cubano torta and I had Alambre con pollo with peppers and cheese.  Both were very tasty. Good thing we ordered the smaller ones, as they were filling for us.  The large ones would have been too much for us lightweights.  For beverage we had two different licuados, similar to a milkshake, but not as thick.  I ordered the pineapple and she ordered the strawberry.  We ended up swapping, as we liked the one the other ordered better.  Very yummy and would go again to try something else.
