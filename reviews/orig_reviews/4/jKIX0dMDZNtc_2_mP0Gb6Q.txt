I feel pretty comfortable saying that this was the best Chinese-Mexican food that I've ever had.  I opted for the combo bowl and that enabled me to enjoy both the Chinese and Mexican flavors with every bite.  I now know that re-fried black beans and Jade Red Chicken are a natural combination.  The Emerald Chicken was also very good, as was the pork fried rice.  

For those of you who haven't been to the Bandido before, the ordering process isn't too difficult to grasp.  Not only will the employees hold your hand while you order, they're also eager to give you samples of many of the dishes.  This way if you aren't sure if you want an Egg Foo Young in a burrito or Chinese BBQ Pork in a quesadilla, you can make an informed decision.  

The combo was really too much food.  Nevertheless, the complimentary cookie for dessert was a good way to end my Chino Bandido experience.
