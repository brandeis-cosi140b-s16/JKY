I am a fan....of their happy hour! I had heard good things about Sam's and this was my first visit. I arrived just after 6 and sat at the bar. I ordered their Grand Canyon Margarita from their happy hour menu...mmmm sooo good! The mixed chips (sweet potato chips, seasoned corn and flour tortilla chips) were unique. I can't say I was a huge fan of the sweet and spicy seasoning on the chips, but the salsa was good. I ordered my dinner from the happy hour menu too, the carnitas cheese crisp. This was a huge flour tortilla covered with cheese, shredded roasted pork and pico de gallo, served with a bbq sauce on the side. I passed on using the bbq sauce, I felt there was plenty of flavor without it and only occasionally found myself using the salsa provided with the chips to add another layer of pep. I enjoyed the atmosphere and as a frequent solo diner I was comfortable eating here.  [free chips and salsa, 2 margaritas and the carnitas cheese crisp, under $20 including tip.]
