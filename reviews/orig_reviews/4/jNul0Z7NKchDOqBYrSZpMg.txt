Visited this place for the first time, and was very happy with my food.  I loved my chicken mole taco, and my mahi mahi taco.  Portions were huge and I ended up making two tacos out of each that I bought.

Mexican food is everywhere here in Phoenix, but this one hit the spot with great flavors, and an awesome fresh salsa bar.
