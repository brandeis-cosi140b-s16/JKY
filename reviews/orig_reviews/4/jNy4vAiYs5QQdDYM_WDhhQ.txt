We enjoy this place, so we keep coming back. I appreciate that everything is made fresh here - they make their own tortillas at a counter where you can see them at work.

The flautas are a tasty appetizer - be sure to spread the sauce on each bite!

One of my favorite dishes here is the quesadilla (see attached photo). We've also tried the Mexico City Enchiladas and a few other dishes, and always the sauce and the freshness of the ingredients made it tasty and delicious.

The margaritas are a little small, but that's okay if you're a light drinker.

And the location is relaxing, with the gondola boats floating by the railing.

This place gets super busy at peak times, so we try to go at off hours to get a seat without waiting too long.

The service is pretty good - most of the wait staff have been friendly, so we'll be back.
