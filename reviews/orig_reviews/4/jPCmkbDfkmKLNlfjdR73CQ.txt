I always make sure I bring my family here or anyone else that comes to visit. This is close to where I live and the best I've been to in my area. Im a usual...out of all the times I've been here I've only had a rude waitress ONCE...and I've been coming at least once a week for over a year. I take my three kids there each time too. Im a Mexican who likes authentic Mexican food. So this is where I go. Margaritas are good too. Never had seafood but everyone who has had it says its really good.
