I admit that my friends and I only came here because of the deals the Cosmo was running with, I believe, a free Salt Air Margarita, which was a really weird thing to drink.  Not bad, just really weird.  The guacamole here is among the best I've ever had, honestly, and I speak as a native Californian, so that's something resembling a qualification.  However, that was the extent of our exploration of the menu, so I can't really comment on the rest of the food, but at the very least, those two options worked marvelously.

One thing to note is that our waiter came off as irritated or something.  My friends and I agreed that there was something very off about his demeanor, and none of us were drunk enough to be particularly belligerent or judgmental.  He didn't actually DO anything wrong, per se, but he lacked any sense of charm or friendliness that one would expect from a waiter.  Oh well.

Seriously though, try the guac.
