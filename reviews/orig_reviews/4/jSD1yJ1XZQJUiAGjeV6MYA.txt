I had a very yummy lunch yesterday. I opted for the pork adovada? I think that's what it was called. very tasty. my friend ordered their spinach salad w strawberries and pine nuts and that looked super tasty. 

I have two complaints:
the ceiling and the seating arrangements. 

The ceiling is really yucky and the air vents are surrounded by black stain. it makes you wonder when the last time they cleaned the filters to make the air stain the ceiling like that. and all of the crusty yellow spots crumbling away? ew. 

The seats, way uncomfortable!!! really old chairs w no tush cushion and no booths. I think it's time for an upgrade!

and lastly, it would be nice to see some more friendly lunch prices- we split the bill down the middle and it came out to $16 each, that's a bit high. I won't be returning for lunch but I would go again for dinner...maybe. when I think about sitting in those awful chairs i give it a second thought.
