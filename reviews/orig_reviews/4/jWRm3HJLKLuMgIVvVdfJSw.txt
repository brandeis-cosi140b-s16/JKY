Came to Cantina Sunday night to satisfy my craving for some good ol' Mexican food. I was NOT disappointed. From the minute we sat down we knew it was a good decision; at 930 on a Sunday night this place still had a good crowd, which I can't say I've seen at any other restaurant around, given they are actually open on Sunday nights. 

I agree with pretty much everyone else's review about the prices - more than you'd probably want to spend  for dinner, but worth it all at the same time. And if you are having a hard time parting with your cash just order a patron margarita and it will suddenly, rapidly, get easier to cough up the dough. 

I won't repeat what's already been said, but I will second everything Jason L. says about the two kinds of salsa you are presented with when you sit down. Our server could tell we were hungry and she replenished our salsas without us even having to ask. Maybe she was just afraid we'd bite her arm off given the speed we were eating at, but either way, she knew service. 

I asked for the tofu & veg fajitas, and then my fiancee ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and I couldn't take it anymore - I switched my order to the chicken & shrimp fajitas (yes, I am struggling and teetering on the line of vegetarianism and carnivorism - and I had to give in here). I was so happy when my food came out - everything looked so fresh and juicy! (note: this statement may be influenced by the fact that the only other place I've ordered a fajita from in the last 3 years was Chili's, and yech, not so good there). But anyway, the fajitas were delicious! And very filling. Save this place for a special occassion if you are worried about the prices, but definitely go!

PS - visit their website and turn up the sound, and tell me you didn't shake it.
