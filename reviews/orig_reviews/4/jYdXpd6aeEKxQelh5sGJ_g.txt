Total hidden treasure right here! Great post-hike/other strenuous activity food place. Food is so delicious and affordable. The chips and salsa - I have to watch myself or I eat too much before my actual meal comes, so tasty. It's a hole in the wall type of place, so not much to look at, but the service is friendly. And you might miss it using the address in Google Maps, it's just past where maps tells you the place is on the right. 

Seriously, if you're ever in the area, def hit up Miguel's!
