I base a lot of my opinion on the chips and salsa the mexican food restaurant sets down in front of me.  I LOVE their hot sauce.  The salsa is standard, but the hot sauce is delicious and I crave it (I live in SD so I don't get to Los as much as I used to).  

Their cheese crisp is also a treat.  They do it right there with fresh tortillas and a crunch instead of the flimsy crap other mexican food restaurants try to sling at ya.  

I will say that it's standard catering to the gringo masses mexican food, but it at least has more flavor than other bland restaurants I've been to (I have yet to find a decent mexican food place in SD)

I LOVE their shredded beef taco.  That's all I ever order.  I also love the restaurant itself.  I would recommend to those looking for decent mexican food in a nice atmosphere.

Parking tip: Use the parking garage instead of searching for street or lot parking.
