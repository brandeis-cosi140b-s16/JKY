A truly delicious burst of authentic Mexican cuisine. I had been searching for an authentic Mexican joint in CU and this is the place. 

What I liked:
The food was fresh, delicious, and portions were generous.

What I didn't like:
It was a little warm inside. The margarita was mucho expensivo. The total bill for 2 people was 35 dollars. More than I would normally pay for Mexican food but because the quality was so amazing I will have to come back to this place.
