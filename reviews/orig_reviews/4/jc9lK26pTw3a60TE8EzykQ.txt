We had a wonderful meal with a large, diverse, and (I'll admit it) demanding party at Gallo Blanco.

The food was fantastic: truly memorable guacamole, lovely, innovative salad, yummy home-made tortillas, varied, delicious salsas, and artful tacos.

Most memorable was the staff--Steve in particular--who was no-nonsense, down to earth, and also totally accommodating and charming.  

Pretty sure I'd be a regular if I lived in Phoenix, and I would def. love to stay at the Clarendon, which looks like a lovely, quirky boutique hotel.

More please!
