Living in the neighborhood, I used to come to Barrio at least once a week.  I didn't eat every time, though.  I couldn't.  I would ruin my taste for anything I made for myself at home.

The only issue I had with Barrio was the lack of space.  I literally had to shout to get my voice over the roar of the crowd.  Everything is packed so tight, I had to dodge waiters with trays and other customers coming and going while attempting to eat without turning myself into a cyclops with the fork.

When it's too crowded, I would often sedate myself with a tasty sangria from the bar.  But heaven forfend if you'd like to sit there.  Nope, there just happens to be at least 15 people packed into a 4' by 10' space, waiting for tables.

The food and drink is delicious, but I took away 1 star for feeling like I was in a NYC bar in downtown Phoenix.
