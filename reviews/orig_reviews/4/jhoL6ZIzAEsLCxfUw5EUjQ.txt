This particular Arriba's is always dark. I have been here twice and the service is good, the chips are addictive and the food is yummy. Although I have never come during happy hour, I hear that there 99 cent margaritas are pretty good. I do know that their steak tacos and very well seasoned and delicious as well as their nachos. So if you are in the area, stop by and try during happy hour. Maybe one day I will finally make it. Also, turn on some lights!!! lol
