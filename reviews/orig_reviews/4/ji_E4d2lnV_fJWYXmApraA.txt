This is a burger joint that also has mexican food...stick to the burgers and you will be fine. The patties are fresh ground and not frozen. Went with a group and 4 of us had burgers one had tacos. Burgers were great the tacos were ok. We had fries and onion rings, both were good. Not the best burger I have ever had, but for 6 bucks i have no complaints.
