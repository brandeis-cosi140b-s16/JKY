This place is pretty awesome.  I've been twice, and have been satisfied both times.  It's cheap, clean, authentic?, mexican food....Yum.   First time I went I ordered way too much...two tacos and a burrito, i finished probably half.  The burrito was ginormous.  The second time I went with  my girlfriend and ordered 2 enchiladas.  The enchiladas were cheap (like under 4 bucks) and good.  

The people at this establishment are very nice as well.  Order lightly, the portions are huge.   Nice hole in the wall.  Thanks YELP! for letting me know about this one.
