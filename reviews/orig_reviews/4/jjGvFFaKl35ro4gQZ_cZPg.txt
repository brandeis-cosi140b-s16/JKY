When  I return to Scottsdale I  really enjoy returning to Cien Agaves. The atmosphere is fun and vibrant. The waitresses are all hot. They have a great deal on  taco Tuesdays. They have a wide selection of drinks. I really enjoy the blackberry mojito and the perfectly Arizonan yet exotic prickly pear margarita.

The service is quick and you get chips and salsa before the meal. It's a great place to  meet friends and have a  pleasant evening when you are in Old Town Scottsdale.
