I have been watching this restaurant slowly go up since I drive by it every day after work. The building has a very clean and modern look and so does the inside so it has caught my eye. Since it finally opened up recently I had to go try it. 

I went there last night for dinner and got the Green Chile Pork enchilada and the Short Rib enchilada. They were both quite good, but the Short Rib enchilada was especially delicious. I also got the guacamole on top for an extra dollar, which was given in a very generous portion and was a creamy, smooth guacamole. There are also various toppings you can get such as pico de gallo and a creamy sour cream among other things. I also must mention that the flour tortillas are made in the restaurant and were extremely good. 

The restaurant is clearly in it's soft opening and some kinks need to be worked out with the food assembly line. Also, since the enchiladas are put in an open fire oven in a clay-like dish, the dishes are extremely hot when you go to eat your food so beware. Furthermore, these dishes are put on metal trays for carrying your clay dish to your table and the metal trays get a little toasty from the heat of the dish. This could be better thought out and may not be the best way to serve these fire hot clay dishes. I'm thinking something like a cork or wooden tray or put the clay dish in a cork holder or something of the sort. 

Despite the kinks, I will definitely be going here again and will be recommending it to friends and family.
