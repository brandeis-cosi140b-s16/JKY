Wow, what's up with all the negative reviews? First of all this isn't a "Mexican" food restaurant, it's Southwestern, which does include Mexican, as well as Native American and Spanish, with a mix of Louisiana flavor thrown in . The food is colorful, flavorful and spicy. (What us southwestern boys like.) 

The cornbread served hot in a cast iron skillet is a nice touch. They have a huge selection of tequila and an assortment of drinks. The chips are salsa are always a great way to start. I've been here many times and I try something new on every visit. I've never been disappointed. I tried the the Citrus Flanked Steak last night and it was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. I really wanted to get the Ancho Fudge PIe (made with almonds and pecans and pinch of ancho chile) but I often feel too fat so I skip dessert. 

The service is friendly and decent. Z'Tejas is one of my favorite places in downtown Tempe.
