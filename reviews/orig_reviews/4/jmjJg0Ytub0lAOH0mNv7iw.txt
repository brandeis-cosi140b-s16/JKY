This place was recommended by a friend and we loved it!

Ordered 1 beef head taco, 1 tongue taco & 3 chicken tacos.  3 Carnita burrito & 1 tongue butrito. Also ordered 3 small rice & beans.  Totaled $57!  It was great I could feed 5 people with damn good food- tender meat & great flavors. 

tip: watch out for the add ons.  Tacos & burritos general just come with meat & tortilla.  If you want cheese, avacado or sour cream it is $1 extra.  Same with beans..It would be extra.  Also keep in mind, when you order side of beans/rice to go...It comes in small Drink cups and the beans will spill. 

Taco $3 each..add sour cream & avocado $1... total $4 for each taco. You have to order 2 since one would not be enough.  It is good but I would say that is not one $ sign prices.
