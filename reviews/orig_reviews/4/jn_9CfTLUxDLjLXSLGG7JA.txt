We went on a Friday evening and we really wanted to sit outside to see the lighting storm. It was windy, a bit of dust blowing, but I was surprised that the manager said It was OK. Also, we got in at 6:57 and the waiter didn't see us till 7:03 but still have us happy hour prices on our initial order. We got out fill, satisfied, and the bill was nothing to shed years over. It's sincerely not Mexican food. The hottest hot sauce they had was Chalula  which is a joke, but i would recommend this place to a friend. I'll just remember to bring my own hot sauce next time ;-)
