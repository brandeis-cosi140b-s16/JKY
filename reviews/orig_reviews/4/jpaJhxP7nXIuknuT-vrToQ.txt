Hands down, this is my FAVORITE place for Mexican food, it's unfortunate that I live in Chicago and we don't have one out here.  I have visited this location 3 times and the LA location once.  I prefer this location over the LA location (I wrote a review on that one as well).

My last visit was a few days ago and we received great service & great food once again.

The chips and salsa are awesome - they give you three kinds upon sitting down in the restaurant.  The food is great, the drinks are great...overall this place is great.  I have no knowledge of other Mexican places in Las Vegas but if you're looking for some good stuff with a good atmosphere, it's worth a trip to the HRH.
