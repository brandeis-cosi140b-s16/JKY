One of the most unique places I've been! Very interesting setup, lots of outdoor seating wrapping around a pond. Food was great, I got the pollo fundido and my father ordered the chicken fajitas. Both were great and good portions. Our server was definitely less than impressive but that didn't ruin our experience. I'd definitely come back!!
