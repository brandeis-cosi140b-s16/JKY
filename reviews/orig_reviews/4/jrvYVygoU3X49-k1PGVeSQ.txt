Great NM-style food.  I think I've been to nearly every location, including the original in Springerville, and this is the best.

I've been here many times and had only one iffy experience at Los Dos: the food was mediocre and (gasp) NOT TOO SPICY when we went several months ago.  But don't worry, we just went again a few weeks ago, and all is well.  I ordered my usual cheese enchiladas with fried egg on top and enjoyed a Bohemia beer to help wash down the hot salsa and spicy enchilada sauce.

Yes, I will return.  And I recommend the same for you.  Just remember that on busy Friday/Saturday nights, you can expect to enjoy several margaritas in the courtyard as you wait to be seated.  They take no reservations and this is a popular gem in the South Mountain area.
