Went to this place a few times. Jario is a ROCKSTAR at working the line and getting everyone exactly what they want with out making us feel rushed! Management has great customer service skills and even if its crazy they cracks jokes to the customers waiting in line. Cashiers could smile a little more and be just a tad bit energetic while we pay for food but hey what do you expect from a fast casual place right.. Food is pretty tasteful considering the prices- Sweet Pork with Salmon in a burrito(Non Enchilada Style) is my pick.
