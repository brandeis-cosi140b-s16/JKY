Keeping this a 4-star but if I was rating the Mexican food it would be a 3 star. Just come here for the Asian. Dan dan noodles are a must. Fried rice also delicious. Pork buns were tasty.

I seriously would come back and eat those noodles every day though. They are a must try!

And despite being a little buzzed our servers were extremely friendly!
