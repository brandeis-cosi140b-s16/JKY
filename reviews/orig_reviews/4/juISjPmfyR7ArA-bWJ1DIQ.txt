Stopped by for lunch today. One of those days driving around asking myself what's for lunch today? 
I walked in around noon and the place was jammin. Almost all of the tables full and a line to the door.That was good cuz it gave me time to study the menu. I decided to try the steak with the red sauce and added guac and sour cream. The buritto was very good just a little messy, which is not a problem for me. The steak was very tender and almost melted in my mouth.
I want to go back soon try try so many thing, mostly the stuffed sopapillas. They brought one out to a table next to the take out line and it looked really good....next time for sure!
