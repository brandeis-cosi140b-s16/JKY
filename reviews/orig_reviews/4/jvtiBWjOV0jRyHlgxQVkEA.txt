We are lucky enough that this is our neighborhood spot...it feels like half the people in there are regulars every time we go. Above average quality for super cheap prices, I am in love with their tortas! ONE WARNING: the tamales are not very good, avoid them here. everything else however is great, you will be wwaddling around full for an afternoon
