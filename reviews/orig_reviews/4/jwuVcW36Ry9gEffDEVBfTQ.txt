Fantastic.   I was skeptical based on some reviews.  We gave it a shot for Valentine's Day. 

I don't enjoy paying for chips, but in combo with queso and guac it's not so bad. The guac is amazing and the salsa bar was ok. I do however think a salsa bar would have more than 4 options, right?  Doesn't a bar make you think there are multiple choices and by multiple I mean more than 4?  

That being said, our tacos were great.  I hate sweet potato fries, but being an adventerous eater I tried them.  I LOVED them, it was the sea salt and the made to order piece that did it, I'm sure.  

Thursday all day happy hour is a deal. I recommend the prickly pear on the rocks, peach frozen and the cherry frozen. 

Service - attentive courteous and knowledgeable about the food and menu.
