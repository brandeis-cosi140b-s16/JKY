Guy Fieri definitely knows his food!

I had the three taco plate- carnitas, fish and pastor- all incredible. They were a bit small but the flavors were big.

The cashier also convinced me to try the imported mexican apple soda. I was skeptical but she told me it was her favorite so I had to get it. When in Rome, right?! It complimented the tacos well and I felt as if I had just stepped over the AZ/Mexico border to get some authentic street tacos.
