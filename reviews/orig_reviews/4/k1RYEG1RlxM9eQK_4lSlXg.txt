So I tried Los Taqitos for the first time today after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives like so many others, and I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican places. So far this is the best one of it's kind that I've found in my 2 years of living in Phoenix. I got the 3 tacos, rice, and beans combo and it was really delicious. I got 2 carne asada and one chicken and although both were good the carne asada takes the cake. The tacos were fairly small but the plate was more than filling. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and he said the meat was kind of dry but the meat in my tacos tasted really good so that may just be a matter of personal preference. All in all 4 stars and I'd definitely go back!
