Tried this restaurant our first night at NYNY. Very relaxing and enjoyable on the "courtyard". Our server Mimi was very helpful and attentive even with a full house. Great chips/salsa. Cadillac Margarita was great, house Margarita was okay. We both enjoyed the fresh guacamole appetizer. The food was enjoyable and filling. Very good for the price.
