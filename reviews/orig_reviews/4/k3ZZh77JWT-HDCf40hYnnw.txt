Came for happy hour on Thursday and then lunch on Friday. Happy hour was a great deal with $5 margaritas that were strong and tasty. Had some nachos as well. Appetizers were $3-5 during happy hour. Lunch was also great. I had the chicken fajitas. They were expensive at $18 but very high quality. Not a large portion maybe 1-1.5 chicken breasts. The rice was also a surprise hit! Fast friendly service. No free chips and salsa but that was good for the waistline. Get a restaurant.com gift certificate to help lower the cost.
