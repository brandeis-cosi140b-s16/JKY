Ohhhhh man, that enchilada-style bean & cheese burrito.... I want another one, but probably not for at least a few weeks after the last one -- it was huge. This place had been on my list to try for quite some time, even after I had done the initial scouting and was waiting to develop an appetite for the awesomeness I was promised. I love that the menu is short and sweet and the food almost overwhelming -- both unassuming and carefully prepared in jumbo size. It was just about all I had hoped for, lacking only in unicorns and rainbows, and I love that it exists despite its terrible curb appeal and total lack of ambiance.
