As people have mentioned, you can drive by without seeing the place but it is not hard to find as it is on a major street.  Parking lot is small but it does not have that many tables so it is adequate. The ambiance is what you would expect from such a small place and somewhat minimal. The wait staff was very personable and greeted us right away. We were there during a 'brunch' time so all the dishes had eggs even though it was 2 pm. I am not sure if we could have asked for an alternate menu or not but decided to be adventurous.  The salsa was different but interesting and it grew on you the more you had! The food was good (not exceptional IMO) but was more expensive than I think it should have been but it seems Las Vegas has completely moved away from the 'cheap food to get them in here to gamble' idea and all the food places have done the same (the famous $5 foot long at Subway is $7.50!!). I certainly would recommend but be aware of the prices.
