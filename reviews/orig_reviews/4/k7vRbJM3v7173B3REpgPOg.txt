Great family run place.  The friendly owners took their time explaining the menu and let us sample before we ordered.  It is a very unique counter type restaurant with a smallish seating area that seems to be setup for takeout.  But make no mistake, this is not fast food.  

I ordered the green chile burrito enchilada style with chips and guacamole.  My folks had an order of tacos, red chili burrito, and a green chili burrito.  The owners also gave us a side of rice to sample.  All items where hot and very fresh.  The ingredients were high quality and extremely well made.  It's pretty easy to see that Rito's is a labor of love for this family.  

Please also note that this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've set foot in.  You can see into the kitchen and it is literally spotless.  

I look forward to returning.
