Very nice upscale Mexican restaurant~we sat in the bar and we enjoyed lunch.
   The guacamole made table side was real good, could have used a little seasoning overall we were pleased. 
   Kurt had the ceviche and the ahi tacos, all very good and were appetizer portions very fresh & flavorful. I went more traditional and had 2 enchiladas, one cheese the other beef with a pretty spicy dark red sauce served with rice & beans.
    Very nice spot in Tivoli Village, easy parking, nice outside area to drink/eat! 
 We live in Henderson so quite out of the way for us~ however if your in Summerlin near Rampart check it out I think you'll be happy you did.
