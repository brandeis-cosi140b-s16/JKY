This is a COMPLETELY different experience than the Carolina's on 91st Ave and Peoria store. This location is clean, well-kept, looks new, and has a good vibe inside of it. The food was even better here. Everything at this location seems to be on a higher level. 

I wanted to get Huevos Rancheros, and it's not on the menu. Isn't this blasphemy? I would say so. Settled on the Enchilada, Tostada, Taco combo. Delish. 

Everyone has raved about the tortillas, and they really are all of that, and then some. 

This is THE place in town to get quality FAST Mexican food. Worth the little detour from the Bertos brothers.
