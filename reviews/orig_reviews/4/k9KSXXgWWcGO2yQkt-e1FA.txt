I had a chorizo and egg burrito, my friend had a carne asada burrito, and I had a medium drink, and it was all less than $10.

That alone makes me like this place.

The fact that the burrito was pretty good sized, and extremely tasty, makes me love this place!

It's not in my neck of the woods, but I may be training in the area for another week. If so, I intend to stop in and try the nachos.
