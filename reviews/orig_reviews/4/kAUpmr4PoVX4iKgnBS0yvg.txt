I've been wanting to check this place out and I was finally able to! I got the bulgogi burrito and my friend got the bulgogi fries. They both were extremely delicious! I thought that the bulgogi burrito was actually sweeter than I preferred but it was still very good. I couldn't finish it all to myself so I was able to eat the other half the next day. I wasn't expecting it to be a sit down restaurant either. But the service was great. They greeted us upon arrival and out server Karina was awesome! She was so nice and was checking up on us regularly for more water, napkins, etc. I will definitely come back to try some other items on their menu!
