Memorial day weekend and this place was awesome!! Best bang for your buck after a hard day & night of partying... We got there about 3:30-4am on a Friday night/Saturday morning and it was SLAMMED with lines out the door!! Be ready to wait cause people are ordering 5-10 items at a time because drunk hunger and affordability. Just be ready to know what to order and "STAND IN THE CORRECT LINE"!! Enjoy....
