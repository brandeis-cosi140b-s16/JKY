Eat here!  

One week before I leave charlotte for most of the year and I FINALLY got around to eating at Three Amigos...and I was so happy!  I'll be in Arizona for the next two months, and I wonder if I'll be able to find more authentic mexican fare than this.  Perhaps more authentic, but more delicious, I don't know.  

The table chips and salsa was just how I like it, the salsa kind of watery and the chips hot and salty.  (I don't like chunks of salsa, I just like to coat the chip with salsa flavor as opposed to actually eating the peppers or onions, which don't agree with me.)

I didn't try the margaritas (I was driving) but I kind of wish I had because I love them. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Entomatadas, which is "3 tortillas hand made with cheese and Mexican sausage, lettuce, tomato and sour cream served with rice and beans" (according to the menu).  It also came with some cut up avocado.  The enchiladas seem to have been covered in red sauce, and the enchiladas are only filled with the sausage, and sprinkled with a bit of cotija on top, and finished with a drizzle of sour cream.  It was all buried under lettuce and tomatoes so I'm not entirely sure WHAT it was but I am sure that it was G-D delicious and I gobbled it all up.  The rice wasn't like any mexican rice I've had, being full of peas and carrots and corn like Chinese fried rice, but it was really good.  I wasn't a huge fan of the beans (I still ate them all, though, because I am a fan of beans and cheese in general.)  

Service was good, the room is pretty small.  The 'La Belle Epoque' painting in the women's bathroom was amusingly out of place, but kind of endearing.  

EAT HERE!
