I took a break from the books, and came down here for a quick dinner with some friends. 

It's quite a distance from my home so it may be my first and last time unless I'm in the area. It's worth a try and the 15% discount with a check in is generous! 

My favorite dish is always the table side guacamole and in route here I was looking at reviews and it seemed to be a house favorite. Well ours sucked! It was so bland and the avocados didn't taste like they were ripe. I was so disappointed. A friend order horchata and the server brought two instead of one so I tried it and it was a fail as well. It was watered down and a waste of calories. The server hardly spoke English and it was frustrating so I didn't even bother to voice my thoughts of him forgetting the salt to our guacamole or the watered down drink that ended up on my tab as well. 

We obviously order a fajita and well this is the best part! It took the 1 star rating to a 4 star rating instantly! It was delicious and had the right amount of seasoning! The caramelized onions and steak mix was a great portion for more than one. The tortillas, rice and beans are authentic Mexican flavor! The presentation was neat as well. 

The manager stopped at our table as well which is always a plus in my book! 

It's like a one time to go spot I suppose atleast it was for me. Maybe it'll be worth another try but not the drive.
