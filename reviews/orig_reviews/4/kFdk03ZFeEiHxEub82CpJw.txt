#2 Rosita's is another place that is always busy! Rosita has great fresh tortilla chips and salsa, a mole that is to die for and a chili relleno that has to be the best in town. The atmosphere is so so and the crowd is not as friendly.. Service is good and the food is affordable like it should be! Stiff Margs too!
