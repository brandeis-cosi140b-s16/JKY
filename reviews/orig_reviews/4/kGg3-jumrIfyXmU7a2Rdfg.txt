My dad and I came here after a round at Papago.
Yes I came here because it was on DDD.

They lady behind the counter was super cool and gave us a bunch of samples before we ordered. My dad wanted the macheca before the sample and wanted it even more after. He said that this was the best place ive picked. Its not the best but it was really good.

I ordered the jade red chicken in a quesidalla and the jerk chicken in a burrito and i also got the refried beans.
I really liked the jade red chicken and i would order that every time. I wouldnt order the jerk chicken again.
It also came with a cookie that is like a churro in cookie form and it was great also.
