This was a perfect end to first day in Vegas last time I visited. 

A friend of mine had a conference at the Venetian (she is a teacher) and her principle generously allowed her to bring a friend. This lucky girl got to tag along (be jealous). The principle and his wife took my friend and myself out to dinner here our first night in Vegas. 

From the outside it looks like your standard mexican food type of place. However, there is something about sitting by the canal  that really transformed the experience for me. I didn't feel like I was eating at a chain place or even a run of the mill hotel restaurant. 

I had the slow cooked pork wrapped in a banana leaf. This was my first time ordering pork ever - and it was delicious. The portions were generous, and the cilantro lime rice was perfect. 

A very nice relaxing experience. I was truly able to relax and focus on the company I was with.
