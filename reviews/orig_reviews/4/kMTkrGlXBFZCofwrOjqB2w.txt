Good selection of sea food items. Nice selection of craft beers and wines to complement your meal. Clam chowder can be an entree if you are looking to go lite. Many items are deep fried so ask your server what is and isn't. Great service by Mario. Strange to see heaters on a patio in Arizona but they felt good for our afternoon meal.
