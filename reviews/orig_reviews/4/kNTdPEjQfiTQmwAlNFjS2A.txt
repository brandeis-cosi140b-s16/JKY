It really is the best Mexican food in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is quaint, the service is friendly, and the food is phenomenal.Been searching for the best Mexican spot and I think we found it... the food had large portions and the live band was cool.. The pricing is affordable and although our waiter was useless the bus boy was great.. we are new yorkers so we know good service.. TABLESIDE GUACAMOLE IS THE BEST!!! & peach margaritas come with real peach slices, it's the best snack place!! Fish tacos weren't life changing though.Tableside guacamole that is so good. Ceviche was one of the best I have had. I thought the food was all good. Equivalent to lindo michoacan. The service was friendly.Bonito Michoacan really is a diamond in the rough out here on The West Side. It may not seem special on the outside, but the food inside is worth the drive.The enchiladas here actually do have taste. The chile relleno is also a good choice. I could even tell the salsa was homemade.It's good Mexican comfort food here, and the food shouldn't be disappointing.great mexican place good service, homemade tortillas, freh table side guacamole, good music, good margatitas! I am very pickey when it comes to Mexican food due to being of Mexican decent and enjoy finding the "real thing". Bonito Michoacan is The Real Thing.....love the food, atmosphere and the people. It's a great place to eat or just go and have their delicious margaritas.
