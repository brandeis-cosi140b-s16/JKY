Wish I could say better about the food-3 out of 4 dishes were not good. My burrito was huge and tasty. The drinks and service was excellent. "Carlita" the cashier/waitress/bartender was awesome! She made the place. $4 for caddy margarita & $3 draft Modelos tasty & a price can't be beat. 
Stick with the drinks and burritos. Stay away from the sopapillas and the posole. Also, keep in mind this is "new" Mexican, despite the numerous Mexican items. Go for the food, stay for the service, come back for the drinks. Enjoy!
