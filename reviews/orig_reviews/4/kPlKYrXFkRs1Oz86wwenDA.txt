Love having nice neighborhood restaurants fill this corner!

We've been here 3 times...lunch, dinner and happy hour.  Food consistently good, although they put alot of cheese on everything.  Beautiful patio to meet friends and enjoy a margarita!  

It was a little loud when we went for dinner on a Friday night, but I guess that's a good problem for them...it means they are full.  We'll keep this in our monthly rotation for sure.
