This place is pretty legit. 
Owned by the same people as Tacos El Gordo with a fraction of the crowds. 
Similar premise, though the lay out is a bit different. 
Grab a tray and head to the station that has your preferred fillings, be it cabeza, tripa, lenqua, barbacoa, etc. Tell the guy behind the counter how many of what you want (1 carnitas y 1 lengua taco por ejemplo), he'll chop it and plate it. Take your goods to the register, grab a drink, and then prepare to load up on salsas!

Seriously. Their salsa bar is STACKED! Dayumn guuurl. 
So much win.
The roasted jalape√±os are especially awesome. 

Why not a 5-star rating? My carnitas were just ai'ight. Carnitas are my holy grail of porcine taco/burrito filling and they need to strike the right balance between crispy on the outside and juicy tender insides...these carnitas were a bit on the waterlogged side when I tried them. 

It'd be a 4.65 star rating if I could give partial stars, because everything else was great. 

I'll definitely be back to try some of their other options, like the tortas and burritos!
