I thought this place was delicious and priced fairly. Service was great, as was our food. My favorite thing, however, was the hostess. Some...older....gentleman proposed dining with my friend and me, and would not leave us alone. The hostess saw what was happening and swept us away. She put a reserved sign on the table next to us so those gentleman couldn't sit there and ruin our dinner. Perfect!
