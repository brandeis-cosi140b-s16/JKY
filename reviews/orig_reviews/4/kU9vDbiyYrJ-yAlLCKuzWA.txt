I had the carne asada torta and loved every bite of it!  The meat was so tasty, and the sandwich was pretty filling (although it was so good I could have eaten another and just suffered through being really full).  My friends and I also had the guacamole, which may now be my favorite guacamole.  It had a great kick to it with a lot of cilantro...yum!

We got there around 1:00 in the afternoon, and it wasn't crowded, but I'm guessing we were there after the lunch rush.  Parking did seem to be a pain as the spots in back were pretty limited.
