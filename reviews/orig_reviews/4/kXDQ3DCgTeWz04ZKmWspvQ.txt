Two weeks after visiting San Diego I'd been craving real Mexican food worse than I'd ever craved Chipotle previously. Came here with my buddy from SoCal to try to dwell the pain.

Carne asada burrito and horchata were quite good. Had I not been enlightened by the bliss that is San Diegon Mexican food, I'd probably give this 5 stars. 

Neat atmosphere, you can see the whole kitchen from the "bar" area and it's in what appears to be an old house. I'll probably be back soon.
