Best fish taco's I've had in a while. Grilled Fish tacos are fresh and with little bit of lime juice and Mr.Lee's special sauce they are like heaven. Tacos are about $2/piece and they compliment $2/beer perfectly. If you want to grab a quick grub that's somewhat healthy than I would highly recommend this place. Also, the bartenders are very friendly.
