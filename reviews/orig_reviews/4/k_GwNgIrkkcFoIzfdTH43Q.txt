This place really is a hideaway.  I think we drove by it twice before calling to discover it's in between the mart at the end and the hardware store.  Also, it's pretty tiny.  Just a bar and 3 1/2 tables.  It looks like they did have a small place for groups when you walk in on the right.  The place was super cozy and inviting and the service was great.  One of the servers was a fellow gaucho so instant connection, obviously.

Food:

ROASTED GARLIC PLACE- A MUST!!!!!!  This dish is crazy good.  Sure a lot of garlic is never amazing for the stomach, but it's well worth it.  The plate comes with a huge roasted garlic, sauteed peppers covered in 3 different sauces smothered in melted cheese, and all on a flour tortilla underneath.  It really was the most amazing thing.  Also this is SUPER FILLING!  

Blue, red and white corn enchiladas and Carne Adovada-  Both of these were nothing amazing and awfully hard to follow after the garlic plate.  We both agreed that for main dishes we enjoyed our food at Carlsbad Tavern the previous night.  Maybe it was because of what we ordered.  A shrimp quesadilla to me was foreign and not super enjoyable.  The rice was ok.  And everything seemed really greasy.

Also the play list was AWESOME.  From Rolling Stones to the Band to Tom Petty, I absolutely loved the music and in general the atmosphere of this place.

Overall, I almost wish we had stopped with our negra modelos (on tap!!) and the roasted garlic place.  Everything was still good but not as amazing as the garlic plate!
