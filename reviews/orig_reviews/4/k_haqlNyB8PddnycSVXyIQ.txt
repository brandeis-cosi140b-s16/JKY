The first time I went to Fajitas was before the Internet was around and long before Yelp was invented. I think it was 1988. I don't live in the Valley any more, but I try to get by Fajitas each time I return. The food is as good now as it was then.

Bottom line, the place is called Fajitas - so order the damn fajitas!! Don't waste your time on something else on the menu... I usually get the shrimp Fajitas and they come with a solid pile of guacamole, sour cream and cheese. The tortillas are homemade and delicious. The chips and salsa are good as well. Maybe a little mild on the salsa, but that's better than too hot in my opinion. 

My visit last week included good food and good service. The prices are a little high if you get the 1/2 lb fajitas but you may well have enough to take home for a snack later on.
