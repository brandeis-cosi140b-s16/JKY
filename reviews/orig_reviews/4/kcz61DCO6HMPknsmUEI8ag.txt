This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. We love their adobada. We like Serano's machaca plate too, but this is juicer and more spicy.  The service we had today was great. We came in at 4:00 on a Saturday. Dorothy was our server, and she's very nice and attentive. The manager came over twice to check on us. I think his name was Francisco. It wasn't too busy because we missed the dinner crowd. We mentioned to him that we thought three reviews on here did not do the place justice, and he gave us a dessert card! Come try it. We will be back for sure, maybe for our next run to Costco.
