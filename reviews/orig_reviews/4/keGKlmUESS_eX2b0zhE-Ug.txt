This is my fourth time here.  Obviously I like it.  That being said, the service today left me wanting.   I believe they lost my reservation, the one where I asked to sit outside.  My party of three had menus on the table for almost 30 minutes.  They forgot to make our appetizers and noticed, when the bill came, they even forgot to write it down.

All that being said, the food was wonderful.  I had the chicken mole and guacamole.  Very good.  My guests had flautas and sea bass.  It looked very good, and they loved it.
I would go there again.  Maybe just a bad night.
