A great place for a weekend brunch. For about $30 per person it's all you can eat. You choose from their brunch menu and they bring you tasty selections. All you can eat so they keep the dishes coming til you tell them to stop. Also bottomless mimosas for $10. The food is great, Mexican with a twist. Very flavorful! Try the brunch so you could try a little of everything! Never had a problem with service however, the restrooms are outside the restaurant and quite a walk if you've got a broken foot like me.
