A classic. I've been to this Carolina's location a few times now and each time is better than the last. I would recommend the 3-way burrito- green chili, bean, and red chili in 3 sections. It's delicious. Honestly, you can't go wrong with your order- everything is made fresh daily. It's counter service and basic chairs/tables so don't expect anything fancy. Sip on some horchata if that's your thing, they have several flavors. Prices are reasonable, I think I paid $8 for the 3-way burrito, a chicken taco and a medium soda. Not bad, and a lot of food. Head over early to beat the lunch rush Mon-Fri.
