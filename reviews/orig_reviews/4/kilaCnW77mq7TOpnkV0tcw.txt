If you're looking for a more chic/upscale Mexican place and not wanting to deal with the strip...

*Great Mexican place for Vegetarians

The service was very good and prompt. They tell you about the specials when they give you the menu - they had 4 additional options that night.
Favorite thing about this place - Margaritas. They use Agave, silver tequila and lime juice...so simple but it's my favorite. 
The salsa and guacamole is ok. The salsa doesn't have a special taste nor did the guac. I love spicy guac or to have the option at least. 

For dinner - 
Sweet Chipotle glaze shrimp tamale. LOVED this! I loved the spiciness of the red sauce. Very good sweet/spicy mix and very creamy corn for the tamale.

Skirt steak - Anytime I can get arrachera, I will do so. This was a very good dish with a side of sauteed spinach with onions and jalapenos. I'm not sure how long they marinade it for, but arrachera usually has a ton of flavor in it. This one was good and tender, just not as much flavor as I'm used to. 

My friend had one of the specials - Pan seared scallops on a bed of rice pilaf. It also was very good. The scallops where very tender and not rubbery tasting like a lot of places around here serve. 

Overall, I liked this place a lot. I think it's a lovely modern setting for a nice date or a small group of people with good food and drinks.
