Latin cuisine meets French with a twist. My husband and I are visiting Scottsdale all the way from Bed Stuy in Brooklyn and we were really pleased with both the service and quality of the cuisine we experienced at The Mission.

We started with the cheese plate and the duck confit empanadas. Both were good but the cheese plate stood out. They took something simple and elevated it with the addition of salty & spicy peanuts and rich honey which was absolutely marvelous.

For the main dishes we had the pork shoulder stuffed with chorizo and fresh made tortillas and the Grouper. The pork and chorizo was amazing but a little heavy so I think the portion could have easily been cut in half. The grouper was nice but the small crab cake that came with it melted in your mouth and outshined the fish.

For dessert we had French press coffee and churros. One word....YUM
