Last night a group of 8 of us dined at Lenero.  The only reason why i am taking away 1 star is because I made a reservation for us to sit by the window and our table was not set up where we had discussed when I made the reservation.  If I could only take away 1/2 a star I would but I can't give a perfect rating because of the mixup so 4 stars it is.  

After that everything was great.  We started with drinks, mostly beers on tap.  I am not a beer drinker but they have a hard cider on tap that was very good.  

For appetizers we ordered the guacomole and the queso fundido.  Both were absolutely delicious.  I could have made a meal just out of those two if the others would have let me hoard them.  But as they were so good I was forced to share.  Which was good because otherwise I would have missed out on the Swai fish entree.  Oh wow, that was so good!  Swai is a very mild white fish.  They cook it wrapped in tinfoil so it steams and stays completely moist.  A nice mix of veggies is cooked in the foil with the fish too.  I ate every bite.  For my sidedish I picked the charro beans.  They were so good that I took them home for leftovers after stuffing myself with appetizers and the Swai.

Our waitress then offered us complimentary slices of their chipotle chocolate cake.  The first bite seemed a little ehhh.  But then with the second bite the chipotle kicked in and it was a very nice finish to a lovely dinner.  The cake was not overly sweet which was good and the kick of the chipotle was a nice warm surprise.  

For now Lenero is only open for dinner but they plan to open for lunches soon.  We plan to be there when they do.
