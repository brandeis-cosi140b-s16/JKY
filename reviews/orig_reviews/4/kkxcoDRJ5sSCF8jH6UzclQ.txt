This is not just another store front taco shop.  It has quality and variety and value.

I stopped in here on a rare rainy day for lunch and was shocked by the long lines at 11am. The phone was raining with call in orders and the line grew. This was a good sign.

There is the over head menu full of the usual Mexican taco burrito total fare, and s small black board with specials.
 
I overheard the lady in front of me asking for a veggie burrito $.3.50 (a black board special) and to get it toasted.  I decided to do the exact same and added some chips for $1.
  
The burrito was great filled with beans, peppers onions and more. The toasting made it quite hot and added a extra crunch to the tortilla I could have lived without. 

The hot sauce was still hot from cooking, a decent Smokey spice note and very thin, I really liked it. The chips came in a small paper  tray not much for $1 but they were good and thick.

Despite the crowd seating was decent with many 4 and 2 person tables in the long narrow setup.

There is a small soda fountain with the usual. And a free spiced carrots that were great, mostly spice not vinegar! 

I will be going back to try other items.  Casual fast and decent quality.
