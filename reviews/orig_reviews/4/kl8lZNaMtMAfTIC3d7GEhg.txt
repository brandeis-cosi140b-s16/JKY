i always love trying new restaurants when i come home to pittsburgh, and a new taco joint definitely caught my interest.

unlike some mexican joints, yo rita doesn't offer 5,000 different options/combos. the menu has 1 page of appetizers/starters and 1 page of tacos. these 2 pages combined with the daily specials is your complete menu.

however limiting this may sound, i promise you it is not. my friend and i each got 3 tacos because there were so many we wanted to try. it turns out 3 each was 1 taco too many, but you live and learn.

we had the chorizo, calamari, chicken...kinda forget what else, but everything was really good.

In short - small yet interesting menu, great drinks, good price-point and a great place to eat before you bro' out on the southside.
