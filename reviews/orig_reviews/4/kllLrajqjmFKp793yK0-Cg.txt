I've been looking for a good taco shop since the day I moved out here and I finally found it here at Taco y Taco. It's only my third visit here and I can already say that Taco y Taco is "as good as it gets" when it comes to their tacos. At Taco y Taco, you place your order at different stations.  Tacos, burritos, bowls, corn on the cob, quesadillas...yes, they got them all that here.  I've had their nachos and quesadillas in the past and thought that they were pretty good.  But it's all about their tacos and I have them as plain as can be. Chicken taco with nothing on it.  Asada taco with nada on it.  They're so good that I don't need anything on them to satisfy me. These tacos are fresh, tasty, and very, very good.  And on top of that, they hook it up and their restaurant is clean.  If you haven't been here, then you're missing out.
