Just had the Encha Burrito....I did take out tonite, wise decision because as usual it was busy. The Encha is a Green Chili Burrito served with rice, beans, chips & salsa. I'm a sucker for green chili anything so the decision was easy. Everything was tasty. Portions were solid, again, San Tan Valley is lucky to have a place like this. I have actually been here 2 other times since my first review but am finally catching up. So, skip Taco Hell and try Moreno's.
