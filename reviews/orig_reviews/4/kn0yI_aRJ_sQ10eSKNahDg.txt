Took the family from Tucson, and we are all very picky when it comes to Mexican food. It's hard when you're Mexican and come from a family of Mexican restaurant owners. 

Red sauce=no bueno 

Carne asada= bomb 

Salsa= good

Beans= good

Rice=ok

Tortillas=bomb 

Carnitas= eh...kinda dry

All in all, we will return. Staff was super friendly and on their game!
