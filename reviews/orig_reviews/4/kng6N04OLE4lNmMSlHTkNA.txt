Taco meal. Delicious Beans and wonderful Al Pastor Taco- Pork marinated with pineapple... A must have- Wonderful suggestion by waiter Joe!     They weren't very busy but it was delicious!  They seem to have a busy phone order business which makes me happy that this small business will thrive.   Joe informed us about Wednesday through Friday 4 to 6 pm Happy Hour 1.50
Tacos and 2.95 beer (Dine in only).
