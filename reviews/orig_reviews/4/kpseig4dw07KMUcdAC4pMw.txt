Its a bit different from what most people think of when eating burritos.  Not a bad thing at all since the food is tasty indeed!  This is the first time I've had New Mexican food.

The portions are large.  I had trouble finishing my meal let alone the side I foolishly ordered.

My only complaint would be that since the food is a bit different than expected, some pictures might have been helpful.  Some people think that is tacky, but I think it can be warranted at times.  Also the tin trays give the impression of eating a pile of food from a trough.
