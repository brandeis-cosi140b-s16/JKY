So after my first meal in the new SodaSopa district of Southpark at SumoMaya, I must say I am quite pleased. Being a Yelp reviewer I was seated immediately and the server pretty much blew me.

Now down to brass tax:

Korean Beef Tacos = Major win

Pork belly eggs Benedict = equals a slightly lesser win (kind of like that time I dunked on a midget) not my finest moment and yet, oddly satisfying.
