This is place used to be known as Super Mex. Let me tell you, since they changed the name, and added new items to their menu, this place has gotten way better! In short, Super Mex was good, but Jaliscos is GREAT!

My husband and I are regulars here. The wait staff have gotten to know us over the years, and we are always greeted with a smile. The dining area has a darkened atmosphere, and the long booths offer a bit of privacy when you're dining. 

The menu is expansive and offers a taste of true Mexico. The shredded beef tacos are a must-order as they are bursting at the seams with juicy, succulent beef; and are finished off with lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of cheese. My only wish is that they were bigger... Haha!

The chillerellenos are also delicious. They are fried to perfection, and every bite is oozing with cheese. I'd suggest the two or three items combo plates so that you can try a little bit of everything on this splendid menu!
