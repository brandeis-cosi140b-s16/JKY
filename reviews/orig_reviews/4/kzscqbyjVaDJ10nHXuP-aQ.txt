Went to Los Dos Molinos yesterday and I was impressed with it. Although, as some Yelpers have said the service is SLOW, especially when it was 2:30 PM On Sunday. It took a while to get our food and even a while for someone to take our order. However, our drink order was taken care of right away as soon as we sat down by a busboy. It was OK. I wanted to try the Prickly Pear Margarita, but at $7.25 for a small one, I thought better of it and ordered a soda (ONE Free Refil for $1.75). They did provide really good chips and Red and Green Salas which are HOT. Just how I like it.
After we had finished the chips they had asked us if we wanted more chips. I asked if they were free and the waitress said it would be $1.00 extra for chips and $1.00 for salsa. That really irked me :(. But, we ordered and I had the Pozole with Oregano  Chile Pequin mix, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a lime in there. It was $10.50. The Pozole Bowl came out and it was a fairly good size. My wife had the Carne Adovada chimichanga and that was pretty good. Since she chose the Rice & Beans with it it was $12.50 instead of $10.50 for just the chimmi. Hers was good as well and spicy. 
**** TIP **** If you "Checkin" to Los Dos Molinos on yelp you will receive a free cheese crisp with or without the Green Hatch Chile (We got ours with the Green Chile). It just shows up immediately on your phone if you do and you show it to your waitress and thats it. You get it for free. Just thought id point it out to my fellow yelpers out there. All in all the food was wonderful, the service was a little slow but since we had nowhere to go on Sunday it didn't really matter, but it might matter if you are going to this place for an hour luch as we were there for about 1.5 hours so that could cause some people concern. I DEFINATELY will be back for the NEW MEXICAN cuisine (NOT Mexican) and the Spice. If you don't  like spicy this is NOT the place for you. If you like it HOT this definately should be on your list of eats!
