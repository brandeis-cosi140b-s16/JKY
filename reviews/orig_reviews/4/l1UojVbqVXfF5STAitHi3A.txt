Hi Werner!! Yep gotta give a special shout out to the newest bartender on his first day  working at Rokerji. He was awesome and he spoiled me and Soraya rotten. :)

This is cute but small little place. As I was walking up, two different couples instantly said, I hope you have a reservation as they were walking away. Uhoh... this can't be good. I called Soraya who was in route to ask if she had made reservations.. hmm nope. Crap. So when she arrives, I sucker her into going downstairs since everyone that went down, came right back up. Lo and behold there were two seats at the bar. Hmm interesting that no one saw that lol. We hoisted ourselves up and was immediately greeted by Werner as well as the rest of the bar staff. We ordered our wine a bottle of the cupcake wine, which was delicious and it was half off seeing as it was Monday :). We also ordered the prime rib sliders, brie toasts, and the tacos. The people next to us had commented on how hot the tacos were and was wondering if we could handle the heat as they said they couldn't. Don't get me wrong, they were spicy, but I make things way spicier so I was use to it. Soraya well not so much lol.

The tacos, sliders, and brie toasts were so good, The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the au jus to dip it in was num yummy. We also ordered the flour-less chocolate cake that was more like a sinful fudge. Delicious. We even got to move over to the fire place to continue chatting it up and enjoy our wine and dessert.

I will definitely be back, especially if Werner is working. :)
