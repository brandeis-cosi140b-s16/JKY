Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte!  Servers are always friendly and the food is always fresh! The guacamole is excellent, the free chips and salsa are the best around, and I have never had a dish I do not like.  I have tried the chicken tacos, the chopped salad and the chicken tostada salad, all are great with tons of flavor.  Their sides are amazing too... my two favorites being the mexican rice and the slaw. 

This isn't your hole in the wall Mexican restaurant... definitely a little fancier and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.

My only complaint keeping it from 5 stars is the prices... definitely a little overpriced in my opinion, but that won't keep me from going back.
