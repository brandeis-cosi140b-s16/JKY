While in Scottsdale for the first time today I consulted Yelp for a recommendation on an inexpensive spot for lunch. Frank & Lupe's popped up with three stars and since we wanted Mexican we thought we'd give it a try. What an unexpected surprise since three stars did not do this place justice. The service was friendly and prompt, Miranda was our server. The chips and salsa were excellent. My margarita was perfect, and the chile relleno was yummy and authentic. My friend had the huevos rancheros and said it was as good as "grandma makes". Ask for a side of poblano sauce, it's wonderful on everything they serve. This is definitely a great Scottsdale restaurant.
