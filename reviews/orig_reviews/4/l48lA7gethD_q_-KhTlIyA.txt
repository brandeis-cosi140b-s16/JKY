If I could hire Jose Andres to come and cook for me every day, every meal ... I would.  We stopped in here for lunch one day.  Homemade corn tortillas are a definite WIN for me. 

The service was a bit on the slow side and the pace of food coming out was a bit weird, but the food was fantastic.  We even went back two days later for a quick lunch.  My favorite things there had to be the carnitas taco (with a homemade pork rind on top) and the guacamole (medium heat).

Definitely a fan, but their service could improve.
