These are my favorite tacos/tostadas in the LV Valley. Authentic LA style street food at its best. The ordering lines are confusing and a bit chaotic but once you have your food, it's well worth it. Love the chicken Vampira tostadas best, crunchy & flavor packed goodness. Excellent salsa bar with both black and pinto beans for you to serve yourself which makes it reasonably priced to me. No meat added to the beans is a big plus. Rustic & so delicious, not to be missed if you're a fan of this type fare. Quesadilla was the best we've ever had.
