I have been going to Mango's for years! The food is great! The service is great as well! I have never left Mango's feeling disappointed or ripped off! Everything i have gotten there has been great! It can get really croweded during the lunch and dinner rushes, so if you are short on time watch out! They also ONLY accept cash, i think they just started that just recently, a friend had to spot me last time because i didn't have any cash, so make sure you bring cash!
