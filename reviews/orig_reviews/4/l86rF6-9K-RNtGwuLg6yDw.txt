The food was amazing! We ordered the Chorizo cheese fondue appetizer to start. I got the jalapeño margarita and my fiancé got a regular one! The drinks were tasty but way to much ice! It watered the margarita down :( Our entrees were the shrimp tacos and the carne burrito. The burrito was excellent but the shrimp tacos were average. My warning to all is the location of this restaurant. It is connected to Sapphire strip club and well you do not see anything because of the separate entrances it is a bit intimidating parking and finding your way first time.
