My wife and I had a very good meal at Rancho De Tia Rosa.I had the chicken fajitas which are a little different then your traditional fajitas.They do not come on a sizzling plate.The vegetables are grilled into large cubes with a nice char.The chicken was flavored nicely with a paprika tone.It also has re fried beans with Spanish rice .My wife is a vegetarian so there are not as many dishes to choose from.She had some spinach enchiladas with black beans and a corn salsa. It was very taste to her.We went on a Friday night about 5:30 pm and waited about 20 mins.This place has indoor and plenty of outdoor seating.Be prepared to wait. It will be worth the wait.
