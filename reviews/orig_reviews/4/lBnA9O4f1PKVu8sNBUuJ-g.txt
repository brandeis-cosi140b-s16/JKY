Oh mill street, you have so many bars to hop but I think this one is the most interesting one. One, because you have a patio and two, there is an awesome firewall outside the patio. Must check it out. And some securities there are pretty funny. That is only if they are cool with you. Hey, remember to check in! They currently have a check in for a free margarita :)
