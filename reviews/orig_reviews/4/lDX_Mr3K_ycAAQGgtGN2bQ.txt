Mostly submitting a review just to throw my vote in.  Previous reviews give a good picture of the atmosphere, which is something I enjoy there.  My father wanted a steak and the nearby Texas Roadhouse had an hour wait so we went to Abuelo's.  He was able to get a steak, I was able to get mexican food.  My wife and kids all had something they enjoyed and everyone wins.
The spicy salsa (they had two salsa's) is very spicy and even tho I enjoyed the flavor and the burn the spicy salsa brought.  I believe it to be the cause of some heartburn I had later.  Small price to pay.
