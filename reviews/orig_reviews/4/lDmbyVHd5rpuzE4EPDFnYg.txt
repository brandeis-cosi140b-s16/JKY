Wow, very amazing place! Great to just sit, relax, and enjoy people-watching/the gondola singers. Waitress was nice and gave excellent suggestions, and this is what we ordered:

Chips and guac: Bf wanted side of guac for his burrito, and waitress suggested getting this ($8) as it comes with chips, salsa, and a big tub of guac rather than $6 for a tiny dish of it. She was right...salsa is AMAZING! Guac was plenty flavorful with a slight kick, and the chips were light, fresh, and salty yum! Not oily or heavy at all :)

Chicken burrito: Yum. Came in a big plate with rice, lettuce/tomatoes, and black beans. Wet burrito...very filling and flavorful. It was a wonderful dish.

Ceviche sampler: Came with a different type of tortilla chips...thicker and flaky with some seasoning. The crab-shrimp ceviche was AMAZING and the lemon added a zing to it. Ahi tuna/mango was very good as well, but you really need to mix it in the sauce otherwise it has a slightly fishy smell. The fish ceviche was okay, but rather plain and the oil really threw me off. The sampler as a whole was not bad though.

I think the bf and I found a new restaurant for us to be regulars at! Very relaxing atmosphere, good food at a decent Vegas price....what more can we want? Only thing is that for happy hour, the well drinks (whiskey and coke for instance) comes in a super tiny cup...may not be worth it.
