(Lyrics - Epic - Faith No More)

Can you taste it, see it, try it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it until you eat fast
And it taste so good, it's like the nectar of gods

It's so good, it's so fresh, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet
But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet

At Blue Agave Mexican Cantina....

Gotta say this place has had it's ups and downs!  This time around was definitely on the up side.  

I visited after a Fun Run across the street with RoadRunner Sports.  The place was packing with runners, but they were prepared!  Chips and salsa on the table were great!  Is it just me or do we all gauge Mexican restaurants by their chips and salsa!?  Needless to say, chips and salsa here was excellent -- not too spicy, but not to bland.  I ordered the Carne Asada Rice Bowl for my main entree.  Overall a solid meal for any runner.  Packed with rice, cheese, lettuce and tender beef.  Again, no need to add the spice.  This dish had enough kick to it!

The ambiance was similar to a sports bar, but of course with some Mexican flare.  The service was on the ball that night and in the end a definite revisit is to come! - Enjoy!
