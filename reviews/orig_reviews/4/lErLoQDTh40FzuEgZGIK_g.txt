Some friends took us out for dinner on Friday night, as we planned an upcoming vacation to Mexico.  

As others have said, don't let the mini-mall appearance/location stop you from going in.  Great food - I had Chili Rellanos and they were unbelievable- truly authentic.  Maybe the best part was desert - Sopapilla's were so tasty and my husband, who is a chef, said it was one of the most perfect flans he had tasted in years - creamy, no bubbles, and just great.

Service is friendly, and might be alittle slow when they are busy, but the friendliness and food make up for it.  And they are so helpful - such as gettting extra sauces, and explaining them.  We will be back.  It is also good to know they are open for breakfast.
