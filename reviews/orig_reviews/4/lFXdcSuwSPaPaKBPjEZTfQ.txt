The BEST homemade horchata EVER!! You have to try it! Everything here is clearly made with attention to detail. The cuisine is fresh and authentic!! And the prices are unbeatable. I had the carnitas burrito. It was fresh, tasty, and filling. My tummy and tastebuds were definitely satisfied. I would come here regularly if I lived in the area.
