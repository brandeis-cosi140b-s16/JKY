As far as the good is concerned, it was excellent. Make sure to order extra guacamole as it isn't very big and has a layer of lettuce at the bottom to make it look fuller. The lobster enchiladas and chile relle√±os were awesome! The only negative thing about this restaurant is how dark and loud it was. But, we were in Vegas so I cannot complain about those things when all else was so great!
