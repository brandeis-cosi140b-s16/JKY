Carolina's is simply great. They have Jamaica flavored drink in the fountain dispenser (it's red, it's tangy and it's delish), the creamiest refried beans you've ever experienced (lard-a-rific), hot ginormous fresh flour tortillas that melt in your mouth, chorizo that makes me buy it on impulse and freeze it for Carolina-free Sundays or long trips, and hot sauce so good it makes me crave it fortnightly. Oh, and if you've had a variation of the rolled tacos (flautas) at any of the local "-betos" in the Valley, you must try the Carolina's version...you'll never go back. But, my favorite thing on the menu is the astounding bean, potato and cheese burrito. The very definition of perfection.

Sure, it's in South Phoenix down the street from where one of my childhood friends grew up (and the original Food City), sure it's always crazy busy so you sometimes have to park up the street and wait in a line that extends the end of the restaurant. (Uh, Saturdays and anytime around lunch time during the week are especially busy.) But, I'm sorry, in my opinion you haven't eaten Mexican food in Phoenix unless you've come here.
