Not your standard joint with the greasy walls and greasier servers. This place is very clean and caters to the modern experience

Excellent sangria, amazingggg skinny margaritas (so the regulars have got to be the bomb), and highly recommended 'Mexican' food.  Ceviche and cheese crisps were good but not stand-out. Highlights were still the main courses, the green chile pork enchilada in particular.
