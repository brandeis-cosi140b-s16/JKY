It's probably just as good as you've heard. I had a peach lemonade (free refills!) and the vegan tacos which are pickled cabbage, black bean, quinoa, and some other stuff. You could get cotija cheese on them if you feel wild.

Everything was fresh, like the faces behind the counter. So young! 

The place is kind of small, and probably not suitable for a group bigger than four. Only the inside seats are air conditioned so for the summer you might wanna go at a slower time. The prices are reasonable, you could definitely have some fun ordering a la carte here. 

Next time I'll try the elotes.
