Went here on Friday for an early dinner around 4:00pm and while there were only a few people in the place at that time the service was fast and attentive. Were served chips and salsa that were really good and we had not even finished them and our dinner had arrived. I had the chicken fajitas and they were tasty. The flour tortillas were a bit lacking as they were real fluffy and pure white like you by in the grocery store, not like authentic tortillas I get elsewhere. Wife and daughter had burritos and both said they were very good.

Only one complaint...a young kid in glasses would walk by our my table on his way to help other customers, or just walking around the restaurant, and would ask "how are you doing sir?" every time he passed. Sometimes he would do it to drop of chips to the table next to us and then turn around and ask me again less than 15 seconds later. I bet he asked me 20+ times while we were there and finally I got upset and snapped "we're STILL doing fine and I'll let you know when we need something".  He wasn't even our waiter so we had him doing it way to much and then had our waitress checking on us.

Other than that one small issue we enjoyed our dinner and will go back for sure.
