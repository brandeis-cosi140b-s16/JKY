This bar is a great neighborhood hangout especially to watch a game and that's exactly what we did tonight. Yea it's loud, busy and crowded in here, but it's a bar...to drink and watch sports at! 

We sat at a booth with a couple friends and even brought out baby, placed him in a high chair. I was actually surprised to see quite a few kids here tonight! 
The chips and salsa was great...warm chips. The chicken tacos were fresh and my favorite was the strawberry Mojito.  All in all, it's a fun local place to be casual and to meet up friends.
