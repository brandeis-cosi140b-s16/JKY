As you can tell, I ate my way through Las Vegas last weekend. I'm lucky enough to have friends that are locals and can share some of their favorite places with me =) 

I had dinner here this past Monday...started off the meal with a pitcher of Mango Margaritas (3 people had 2 glasses each). Then we ordered the Sampler platter - one order can easily feed 2 people. It was a great selection of the beef kabob, chicken skewer, tacitos, quesadillas and sweet corn tamales. And let's not forget the Mexican corn...holey moley, guacamole! This corn was OFF THE HOOK! I've never had Mexican corn before...grilled, with a slathering of Mexican cheese, butter and some other creamy concotion...wow...a little salty, but delicious all the same! 

While waiting for our food...we snacked on homemade tortillas and a trio of salsas and gazed upon the funky decor of pimped out bicycles and funky art that gave the atmosphere a fun and comfortable vibe.

We finished off the meal with some flan...honestly...I've eaten MANY flans before and I always say that my mom's is better. This was the first time (Honest to God) that I said, it was nearly as good, if not the same, as my mom's recipe. That's telling you right there how authentic this was! 

Kudos to Pink Taco!!!!

Another thoroughly enjoyable meal...thank you!!!
