First time here and I was really impressed with the quality of food.  My husband and I both ordered the Standard with cheese. My husband added the butter carmelized onions and I had everything on it. The meat was really tasty and the sauce that they add to it gives it extra flavor.  We also ordered the fries and they weren't soggy at all. Cooked perfect.  We got a chocolate shake and this was seriously one of the best shakes I have ever had. It was so delicious!  My husband and I shared one but next time I will be getting my own.  I would make the drive just for the shake.
