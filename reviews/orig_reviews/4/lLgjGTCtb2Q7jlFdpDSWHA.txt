Great food and amazing service!
After Rehab Sunday, we were burnt, exhausted, and thirsty! 
Our amazing server brought us two pitchers of water hahaha!
Anyway? Back to the food.
The guac is expensive (9'dollars omg!) but soooo good.
Like any other Mexican place you get complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa is also amazing.
You HAVE to have a Pink Taco. The slices of avocado elevates the taco to a whole new level.
I wanted something filling so I got a sandwich, which comes with French fries and my stomach almost fell out! Beyond filling.
Really love the place and everything
