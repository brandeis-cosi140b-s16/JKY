Went in for lunch and let me just say that the food was AMAZING! Asked our server Nicole what she would recommend and she was nice and recommended some great items!! FISH tacos with grilled Ahi Ahi was fantastic. Fresh, moist and the Baja slaw was a great side dish. It made the dish. Had the fried ice cream and was also fabulous.

The service was friendly and fast and would definitely go back!
