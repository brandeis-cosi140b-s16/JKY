I, for one, am glad to see this establishment so close to where I live (I've been a couple of times already).  I am definitely glad they took over the old Phat Burrito/Scoops place to bring us some Latin street food.

I will admit, I kind of thought this place was going to be some sort of Chipotle/Moe's/Qdoba - type of place.  I am so glad that it is so much more than just burritos, salads and tacos.  I have really been more about trying the street food part of their menu.  The two best things I've had on the menu have been the pupusa with grilled veggies and the veggie empanada.  The pupusa has a great corn flavor and the grilled veggies make a divine filling.  Add some of curtido from the salsa bar, and it becomes magical.  The gorditas had a great crispy shell, and the chicken on the inside was flavorful and moist.  The tacos autenticos and arepas are all right.  The seasoning on the steak is pretty delicious, but in my mind, I suppose it needs a little more than just the onions and cilantro.  I tried the tacos autenticos with the fish, which was pretty decent as well.  The taco salad is good, but it is a little weird that it has rice in in.  However, the rice and beans are quite tasty.  My only disappointment here is with the guacamole.  It was quite bland the day I had it, which made me a very sad Ana.

Everyone I've met is so nice and this place has a decent amount of seating (possibly equal to or a little more than Three Amigos).  They also serve margaritas and beer, so WHEE!

It won't be long before I'm back at this place again.  I hope it does better than its last two predecessors.
