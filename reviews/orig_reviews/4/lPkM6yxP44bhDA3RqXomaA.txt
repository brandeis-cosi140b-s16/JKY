kind of random for a mexican restaurant to be at the venetian...its definitely unexpected but a very nice surprise. i love that its right on the canal because you get to people watch and listen to the people singing on those boat rides. we were seated right away, our server was nice- he forgot to bring out water though, food was good, a bit more on the pricey side but expected. i ordered the pork tenderloin- very juicy and seasoned well. my friend ordered the ahi tuna- it was tasty but a bit on the salty side, she couldn't even finish it. we ordered the lobster and calamari cocktail and some chips and salsa for appetizers...both were really yummy. a pitcher of the pineapple infuzion margaritas were also ordered...they were really good. it provided a nice buzz as we left to go watch mystere. =P good experience over all. i would definitely come back...ooh and they have happy hour!
