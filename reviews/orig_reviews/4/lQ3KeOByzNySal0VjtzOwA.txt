More of a 3.5. Came for a quick lunch as a Luxor guest.

Our server was excellent. Forgot his name, but he was rocking an awesome stache.

He brings out our chips and salsas, and while my sister and I had trouble deciding what drinks we wanted, he saw our 2-for-1 Dos Equis deal and simply suggested we take advantage of that. Very glad we did, as I enjoyed the amber ale and cost $7 for two. I loved the chips and salsa. The chips were nice and warm and not stale at all, in which I'm used to at some establishments. The tomatillo salsa was good and tangy, but the other one was much tastier with a nice roasted flavor.

I opted for the $13 torta special (carne asada) and sister had the veggie tacos. As she ordered that, our waiter was super awesome and asked her is she was a vegetarian. As she was, he noted that the beans were indeed not vegetarian and offered to double up on the rice instead. That was super helpful, as the veggie options listed in the menu make it seem like it is all indeed vegetarian.

I really enjoyed my torta. Bread was warm and perfectly complimented the carne asada. Flavors were good. Sister thought her tacos and rice were okay and somewhat bland.

Prices are definitely steep. Wouldn't mind coming back, especially if there are deals and specials going on. Superb service though.
