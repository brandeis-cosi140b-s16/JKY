It has been ages since I have been back to Tacos El Gordo and I always wonder why I don't come more often. 

The tacos are delicious. I always end up with adobada, no matter how hard I try to order outside my comfort zone. Everything else looks amazing, but when I'm starving for tacos, this is my go to meat. Since there are separate lines for each meat, it's best to come in a group and plan your ordering accordingly so you and your dining companions can split up and tackle the lines more efficiently.
