This restaurant and bar is a great place for dinner or just meeting friends.  The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant.  Despite crowds, the service is excellent.  And the staff are friendly.  The kitchen area is actually surrounded by the bar, so if you're alone, sit at the bar and watch the action!

Sadly, I have to give only four stars as the pork chop I ordered was almost raw.  I ordered medium.  Even the fellow who picked up my plate commented saying, "Wow, that is a little under done".  Reheating meat ruins it for me, so i just ate a few (delicious) bites from around the edges of my chop.  The quality of the chop was excellent, and the seasonng was very good as well.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfect.  Had the wedge salad to start, and that was very yummy too!

Anyway...  My chop was so undercooked that it should have been taken off my bill.  I did eat a few bites, so maybe a free dessert?  All I got was a thank you and a bill.  On my only previous visit, the food was really excellent, so 4 stars it is.
