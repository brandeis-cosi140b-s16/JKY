Best carne asada tacos and burritos not in Mexico.  Only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the price. When you are used to paying $1 per taco in Mexico, the prices here can be a little high.  Actually, a lot high.  Also, this location has some type of sewer gas problem that makes it smell like a stinky bathroom whenever you walk in.  That never makes you feel too confident about the food.  If they fix that and lower the prices some, it's a guaranteed 5 stars! :)
