Went for lunch today - great food and great service. I love fish tacos, and have had them from all over, these were very tasty. Loved the bbq and thoroughly enjoyed the black black bean and rice on the side to give my tacos more filling. I was surprised (pleasantly) how full of fish they actually were - which is another reason why this place gets a great review. I highly recommend trying this place if you enjoy fish or shrimp tacos!
