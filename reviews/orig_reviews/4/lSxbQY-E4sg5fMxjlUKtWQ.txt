My standard order: carnitas tacos don't forget the sour cream, guac, cheese upgrade ($1.50, a must).  The shrimp, octopus, oyster cocktail with chips. SO YUMMY. SO FRESH.
My husband likes the al pastor tacos, with upgrade of course.
My cousin likes the burrito with rice (complimentary) plus the upgrade of course ($)

The Sahara location is their second location. I prefer the first location's carne asada it is top notch. This location's carne asada is missing the special spark. That's why I stick with carnitas at the Sahara location.

Tip: this place is like In n Out, when the lines long, you are probably better of going through drive thru!
