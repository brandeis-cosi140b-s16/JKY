This place is a trendy and super yummy little place. It reminds me very much of LA and West Hollywood. This is not a good place for large groups... they can put a few tables together on the small patio outside but unless it is one of the few nice days of the year in Arizona, you won't be comfortable. Also, the wait can be really long. Ask them about an app you can download on your phone and you can put your name in at a restaurant and they are one of them. I forgot what it is called. The wait will very likely be 1-2 hours wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Brunch there is fun too though!
