For some reason (it was our choice) we sat outside in the middle of June in the early evening.  But I cannot hold the Southwest temperature against the restaurant.  We arrived with a large group and no reservation, and we were easily accommodated on the patio.  My friend and I split a avocado/pineapple salad (those are the ingredients, not the name) and a glazed chicken dish.  Neither were particularly "Mexican" but it was quite good.  Most of the group ordered margaritas, and even the picky margarita drinkers were happy.  

To sum up, I would go back!
