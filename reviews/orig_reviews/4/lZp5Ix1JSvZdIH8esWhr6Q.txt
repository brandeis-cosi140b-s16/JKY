Food was great. I ordered the Parrillada plate and had them add shrimp for 2.00 more. I will never do that again. 3 little shrimp for $2.00. Way to much. The waitress talked to the owner and all he did was shrug his shoulders.  Everything was awesome tasting though. Steak very tender. My boyfriend and I will be back.
