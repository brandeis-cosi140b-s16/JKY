Went here w/ a group of ladies for lunch. Free chips/salsa are provided and the ladies ordered their blanco queso, which was just OK.

I had the shrimp/crab ceviche which was amazing! I tried my friend's street corn, which was also very yummy!

A couple things on our order came out wrong,  but the waitress was nice and quick to make it right.
