guacamole, filet mignon torta & churro dessert were all AMAZING! 

a friend from work recommended I check out her aunt's original restaurant and man I'm so glad I did! I treated a friend for an early birthday dinner on Friday night and we both were completely satisfied! the staff was nice & helpful, the food was delicious & we didn't wait a long time for anything. it is a bit pricey but worth it!
