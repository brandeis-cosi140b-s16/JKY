Top Notch Mexican food right here! Thanks Yelpers! I went here because of the great reviews. 
I don't even remember the last time I actually ate a burrito. I typically stay away from them because they're a sloppy mess that are difficult to eat, and not very enjoyable. 
I decided to give one a try here. If there was a place to eat one, I guessed it would be a place named: PHX Burrito House. 
I went for a Carnita Burrito with refried beans, and while I waited for it, I enjoyed the BEST tortilla chips I have had in Phoenix, and some of the best I have had in my life. Super fresh and crispy, not greasy, not over-salted. The Salsa was fantastic as well. Little chunky, little spicy, great flavor. I was also treated to a small bowl of the Famous Pork with Green Chiles. Super tender pork with a delicious green salsa.(They also have a burrito with this)
The burrito came out and it didn't disappoint! They don't try winning you over with an enormous burrito, they put all of their love into a medium sized perfectly rolled bundle of goodness with a nice firm tortilla. The Carnitas were great, rice was delicious, creamy refried beans. And how does one judge a burrito? Well, I cut it in half and each half held together until it was gone! Most places fall apart after a few bites! 
Its a cruise for me, but a place I will definitely visit when in the area. 
STOP going to those Chain-o-Berto type places and eat REAL Local Mexican Food instead!
