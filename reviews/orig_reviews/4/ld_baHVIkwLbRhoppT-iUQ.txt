Excellent customer service and excellent food! Our server was great even though the hostesses seemed a little behind. It was senior night (50+) and the special is either buy one get one free or, since there was only 1 senior at our table, 50% off his entree. I had the Fundito which was very rich and pretty salty, but was still delicious! I also loved the interior set up of the restaurant, and can't complain about the view of the lake right outside! The only thing I disliked about Valle Luna was the salsa.
