I wish I was more into the food scene because the illustrious Dan (of so many other reviews) was in the kitchen the evening we visited and I could have been all hot shot with Jenny and been like, "oh yeah, that's Dan back there." But I'm not so that's that. 

Now the food at Mucho Macho Taco is good. We had 50/50 tacos and brisket tacos that were both on par. The red salsa was decent but the green salsa ('verde' as it is often known) was creamy and excellent flavored. The star of the show, however, was the chicken quesadilla. Not too greasy and full of cheese -- dip that baby in that salsa and stuff your face. 

Glad we finally tried MMT -- will definitely be back to try out more of the menu.
