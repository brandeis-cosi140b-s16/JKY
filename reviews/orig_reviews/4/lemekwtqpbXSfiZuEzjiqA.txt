A friend and myself saw a show here last night (The Von Trapps). The staff was mostly friendly, but more importantly security was friendly. This place feels cool and trendy and the drink prices were comparable, not cheap but not expensive either. We shared a carne quesadilla and it was perfect and delicious. The space is pretty small, but it works. It basically just looks like a bar and restaurant when you walk in until these doors in the back open up and then you see the (small) ballroom equipped with a raised stage, bleachers against the wall, a full bar, and more bathrooms. Good sound too! There are like 4 or 5 metered parking spots right in front, but aside from that, there are two public lots with $5 pay boxes. Cool place.
