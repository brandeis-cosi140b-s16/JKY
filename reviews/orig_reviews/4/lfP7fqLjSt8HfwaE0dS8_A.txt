Carlito's Burritos turns out amazing New Mexican style Mexican food.  They offer both red and green chile both of which are full of flavor and compliment everything on the menu.  I've tried the tamales, the posole, the green chile stew, enchiladas and the breakfast burritos.  All of which were incredible.  The food is fresh, flavorfull and very reasonably priced.  The service is excellent and they make a great $3.00 margarita.  Carlito's is a wonderful local place that everyone should check out!
