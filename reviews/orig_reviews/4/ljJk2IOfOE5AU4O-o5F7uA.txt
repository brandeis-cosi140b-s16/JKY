Stopped here after an event at the Mint museum. Since I was with the kiddo's we ordered the nacho's with beef, along with mahi mahi taco's for me. Nacho's were immense and loaded - big enough for four people! The homemade queso was great, btw. 

Fish taco's were ok, but I've had better in CLT. Overall vibe is great here, service was average.
