since the nascar cafe closed down i was afraid there wasn't anymore monster food challenges in town for the mightiest of eater to go to. Tequila Bar and Grill has a Texas 3lbs challenge which is not just a burger but an ultimate BBQ bacon cheese burger, 3 lbs burger filled with the regular burger ingredients, a bunch of bacon, and drenched in BBQ, so it has a pretty good taste. finish it all in 30 mins and get a tshirt, photo on wall, and best of all its free instead of $35. i wasn't able to try it the last time i was here because i wasn't ready. but give me a few weeks or a few months and i think I'll be able to round up some worthy challengers to join me. 

if you're not up for a 3 lbs burger they have a huge menu with huge portions at OK prices for the strip. beers for $5 most places on the strip are at least $6. margaritas and mojitos starting at around $7, a 128 oz fish bowl margarita for around $20, a lot of Mexican, nachos, quesadillas, taco salads, chili, soup, BBQ chicken and ribs, pulled pork sandwich, desserts, and breakfast. 

i think they have $2 tacos, Tequila, and draft right now.
