Here's what happened... I blacked out, got punched in the stomach and left with a few dollars less in my bank account.

It sounds terrible, I know, but it was my fault for eating too much. There were way too many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I ended up getting the Del Rey. That sandwich is F-ing loaded! I mean, I'm all about excess sometimes with my food, but this thing has almost everything that you could want from a Mexican joint overflowing in between two halves of bread. Ya only live once though so I went for it, and it was very delicious! I've seen a similar torta on No Reservations in Frisco, but never knew that there was one in the valley. I'm glad I got to try it! Now, because of Man vs Food, most people will only go for the Del Rey. I would like to vouch for the quesadillas there though; they were also excellent! Their salsas are great as well, I just wish they had tortilla chips to go with em! Oh, and did I mention the agua frescas?! Amazing! 

It's a great little spot and I'm very glad that a tv show can help out local businesses the way that it does. I'm going to be moving a lot closer to Los Reyes, so I'll probably be in there more often in months to come.
