Overall one of the best Mexican places I've had in Vegas.  Since re-locating here I've had some problems finding a good value when it comes to meals.  Lindo has become a "go to" place for me and many of my friends because of the portion size and affordable price.  I normally get a simple combo plate for around $15.

This place does not try to be fancy and flashy which is another reason I'm attracted to it.
