First things first - the margaritas are delicious. Simple and classic, they are the types of 'ritas that have you downing 3 before you realize it. They are smooth and tart and refreshing. I haven't tried it with any other tequila on their HUGE list, but someday I'll know enough to do that.

The snacks are also very good, especially the onion rings and pork tacos. I want to roll around in that spicy aioli they give you with the onion rings. Amazing.  Also delicious - the chipotle salsa. Perfect amount of spice.

the only thing i can say is less than stellar is the education on the tequilas. I'm sure they are just getting their bearings, but I appreciate a good lesson on liquor, and with this much to choose from, I definitely need guidance. I'd bet they'd get a lot more upgrades on those margaritas if they were able to recommend a few other tequilas from their extensive list. 

But this has become my favorite place for a chill drink after work. The vibe and decor is awesome, so i highly recommend it for happy hour!
