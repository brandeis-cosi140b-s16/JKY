Such a hidden gem right on Indian School Road...nice expansive patio (that is pet friendly too) and a nice dining room.  Our server was great - engaging, fun and helpful with decisions.  I started with a sangria and the queso dip...not a bad way to start the meal.  For my entree I tried the salmon and my husband had the swordfish.  We were both pleased with our meals and liked how the fish was paired perfectly with the right sides.  We were so full from dinner that we didn't save room for dessert, but sounds like we need to come back and try the churros...they sound amazing!
