El Diablo is El Nutso busy!  Right in the middle of the strip, this tourist trap is kickin'.  Just to watch an NFL game at a cool place, I parked far at Monte Carlo valet and walked over.  If I didn't get there when they opened, I don't think I would have been able to sit down.  The place really filled up and got crazy.  The menu is small and limited, but drinks are aplenty.

I ordered steak nachos, they were huge but expensive ($18).  The male bartender was great and really responsive (even though it's busy), and the super deluxe and beautiful waitresses are nice and friendly (think of those sexy girls from Tarantino's "From Dusk Till Dawn", but these hotties are clothed), which is always a welcomed distraction from watching a Rams game, even if they've been playing better of late. 

The place really is cool.  At night, I didn't go back inside, but walked by it's hell-like flames and it looks fun, and even more and overflowing El Nutso.
