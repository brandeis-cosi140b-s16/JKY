I have had a few issues before at Baja Joe's, but I'm seeing some positive changes. It is great when the owner steps up and makes changes to improve on issues and complaints. I have been back to Baja Joe's and the new bar manager and the owner improving the service. It seems like they are moving in the right direction. I have to compliment David and the staff for my late Sunday evening visit. It was late and they were obviously cleaning and getting ready to close up. When sheepishly asked if we could still enjoy a beer at the bar, they were very friendly and welcoming us to stay. Like the positive attitude changes.
