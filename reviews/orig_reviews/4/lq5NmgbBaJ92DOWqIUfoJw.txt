We found Casa Don Juan by accident looking for hangover food/drinks off of the Vegas strip.  We got very lucky landing here!  The chips/salsa/beans that come to the table free are so good, so was the bloody Mary and the pineapple pina colada.  

It has great outdoor seating which we sat at to enjoy the sun, inside the restaurant was pretty cold at the time.  My sister had the chicken fajitas and the portion size was huge, and she loved them.  I had a platter with pork tamales YUM! a beef taco that was ok and a fried pablano pepper stuffed with cheese also very good.  We ate everything and it did help cure the hangover.  Definitely tasted like authentic Mexican you can only get on the West coast.
