At the time I had lunch here, there was a foursquare checkin offer for a free plazero corn for checking into Mandalay Bay shops. Let's just say that my quesadilla lunch + my free corn had me in the food coma necessary to snooze away the rest of the day poolside so I could party the night away. And my lunch tab was under $10.00! More money for the slots and cocktails! Oh yeah, the ingenious "open face" chicken quesadilla allowed me the freedom to pluck off all the tomatoes prior to folding it in half to eat. I'm a fan of lunch at Hussong's (eventhough I didn't have one of their world famous margaritas)!
