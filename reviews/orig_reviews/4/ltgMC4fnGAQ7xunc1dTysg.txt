Always busy, family atmosphere, great food. Complimentary chips, salsa, and beans to start. Guacamole is a must buy. On weekends have a dessert table set up for cash purchases. Fast service, attentive waiters, and good is delicious! Neighborhood is a little rough, so be safe while parking and going in.
