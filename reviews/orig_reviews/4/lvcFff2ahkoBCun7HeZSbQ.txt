Ya know, the first time I came here a few summers ago, it was great. BUT, the last time I ate here it wasn't that great. Maybe it was the time of day, or the month, but my chips were stale and the waiter was a smart ass. Going back to both experiences, my tacos were always great! I've tried just about all of the tacos and I love the queso. Try to go when there is a crowd...the food is better and guaranteed fresh. I'm guessing the cooks get a lil lazy when there isn't a crowd...hence the stale chips. haha.
