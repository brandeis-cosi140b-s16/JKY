I live a few minutes from La Fonda and tried it for the first time last night and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. From the outside it doesn't really look like anything special, but the food was great and the service was good. I really enjoyed my topoppo salad and their salsas are delicious! I wasn't thrilled with my margarita, but that was my only qualm. I'm happy to have found good Mexican in my neighborhood!
