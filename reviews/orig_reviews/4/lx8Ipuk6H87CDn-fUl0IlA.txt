The people that brought  you Postino's, Federal Pizza,Chelsea's Kitchen  have done it again!  

We went on a Sunday at noon.  We had excellent service with numerous servers checking on us throughout the meal. I'm a New Yorker, husband is a Londoner and we really get crazed when the service isn't good and this was not the case!  Service was top notch!

The tacos were terrific. I  had Grilled Shrimp, Baja Fish and Ahi Tuna and loved them and I'm not even a Mexican food lover.    Hubby had Carne Asada, Shredded Beef and I think Chicken Tinja and he thought everything was delicious. 

The music was great - Cat Stevens to Prince to Sting and not too loud like Federal Pizza.  The interior is a well designed cool urban space.
