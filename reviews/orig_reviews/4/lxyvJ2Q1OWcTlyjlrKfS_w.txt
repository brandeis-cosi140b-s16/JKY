My first time today! I was really excited to finally make it. Upon arriving the building sets itself apart with latin murals, and a modern entrance.

The staff are very welcoming and proffesional, we were seated immediately. 

I got the torta cochinita pabil, and my wife got a torta that has some pablano, chicken, onions, goat cheese. The pork had alot of flavor the onions and peppers were good. Wish I had some cilantro to go with it. My wifes was ok, she didnt eat much of it. We both got the spicy fries for the side, comes with a chipotle ketchup. This was good! Its spicy, it lingers a while with amazing flavor and heat but it never gets to be too much heat, its perfect.

The atmosphet is really nice. A mix of upscale dining/cafe/latin art. Its blends well!

The service was fantastic, havnt had good service like that in a while!

I wanted to try the horchata and some desert but final cost was already getting steep for me :(

Over all it was a good experience for me, not so much my wife, not sure if or when I will go back but its certainly worth a first visit!
