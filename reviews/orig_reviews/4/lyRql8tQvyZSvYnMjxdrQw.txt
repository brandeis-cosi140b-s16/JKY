So I had no clue what this business was going to be. I had received adverts for it but thought it was some sort of mexi fast food.  I knew it wasn't going to be that if they moved into the old firefly building.  Decided to go on a tuesday and had the chicken tacos.  I'm GF and the chips/tacos were brilliant. Happy is hours are from 3-6pm each day and they have a brilliant Vegan menu to boot.
Give it a go, I have only had experience at the bar and last night was when I was there last. Cheers
I do enjoy the new faux wood in the bar and the 80's videos.
