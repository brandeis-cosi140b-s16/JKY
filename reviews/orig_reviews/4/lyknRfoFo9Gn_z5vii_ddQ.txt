I've been coming to Chino Bandido Takee-Outee, vaguely racist name and all, since high school. It's nice to know that some things never change. The Mexican-Carribbean-Chinese menu never changes, and neither does the flavor.

If you're a newcomer let them know, they have samples. Get in line, fill out a form with what you want to eat, pay at the counter, and take a seat. My standard order is a jerk chicken/hengrenade chicken combo with jerk fried rice and black beans. Any of their entrees are available as burritos or quesadillas. Sadly, I can no longer get these because of the damned gluten thing, but you should try it. Their tortillas are fantastic.

A combo with two entrees, beans, rice, a drink and one of their famous snickerdoodle cookies costs around $8. It really doesn't get better than this for that price. I had to knock them down a star because they don't have enough restrooms for the size of the space and because the last couple times I was there the food had cooled somewhat before it made it out to our table, but it's really good, even cooled down.
