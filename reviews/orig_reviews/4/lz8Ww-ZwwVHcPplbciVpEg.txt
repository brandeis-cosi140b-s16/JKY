Just had lunch here.  It was a pleasant surprise.

The food was good.  I had a green chili pork burrito, which was deceptively filling.  The pork tasted excellent, and the added guacamole and sour cream on top made it even better.  The lemonade was also great.

Service was excellent.  They always brought more chips just as we were running out, and the beverages were well stocked.

The best part of the whole meal was the cream filled churros.  With all the sugar on it, the cream is totally unnecessary, but who's complaining?  Strawberry and whipped cream to dip it in just pushed it over the top.
