We frequent Nando's and love their food. You get a large portion and complimentary chips. Yesterday afternoon we went for lunch/dinner and the service was slow, it took nearly 30mins to get our food after ordering. (It wasn't super busy either; there wasn't a wait to be seated) Also, I asked for a substitute and they up charged a ridiculous amount without advising, which is  disappointing. I spent about $20 on a $12ish Chicken Flauta meal all because I asked for a side salad, which was literally only lettuce and shredded cheese, instead of the rice and beans and queso on my flauta instead of guac, sour cream, or cream cheese. --that's my normal meal there and normally they sub for no additional charge, just depends on the waiter I guess. Overall, we like their food and will return!
