Been here two other times now.  The food and service here is very good. I even gave a Spanish lesson to a server. lol--- The chef is from Mexico City so no Tex Mex here. Great happy hour place with my Girlies. Rasberry Habenero Margarita for 5 bucks, Yum!  Seven dollar plates. Yippee! This is my second favorite Mexican restaurant in town. The Guac is good, yes but still not as good as Gallo/Otro. I will have to go here more often especially since they are right next door to an "Anything Bundt Cakes."
