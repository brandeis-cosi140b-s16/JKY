Great food & tasty $3 margarita!!!!!

Carne Asada torta FIVE stars
Kale & Quinoa salad---good but if you are very hungry won't be filling enough without adding protein. 
Guac is tasty & good portion size -has a basil/tomato twist but a bit over priced (ie it basically costs the same as an entree)
Margarita was yummy, only $3, perfect strength (not weak or overdone)
Great outdoor seating
Like the music
Friendly & attentive staff:)
