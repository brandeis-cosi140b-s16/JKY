A real hole in the wall joint in a gravel lot - What this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up in price and quality. 

The price is pretty comparable to Chipotle and Filibertos and they have a pretty decent amount of choices on their menu. Stick to anything with Carne Asada!

The hours are a bit weird too 6:30am-2pm
