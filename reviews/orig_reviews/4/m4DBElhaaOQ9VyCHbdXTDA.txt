I really enjoyed the food here, and will make sure next time im craving tacos that this is the place I hit. My food was hot, spicy, tasty, the salsas were delicious the chips were home made ( i think).  Everything was as I wanted it to be.  I so desperately craved some mexican food and this just filled me up and made me want to go back.  The view is beautiful (as everyone else had said), the ambiance was great, the decor was a little goofy but I loved it.  We'll all be going back there soon!  The margaritas were sublime.  SO much better than Mad (tex) Mex.
