Great Mexican place - I think we ate at all the restaurants in NYNY since we stayed there.  We all were happy with our meals, the flavor was great - some of the meat was a little tough though.  We also ordered guac which was tasty as well.  The chips and salsa were also good - which is how we rate our mexican restaurants.  The margaritas were tasty too!
