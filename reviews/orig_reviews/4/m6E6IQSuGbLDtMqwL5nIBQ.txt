First timer-- AMAZING!!

I decided to take my fiance here for his birthday dinner because we love trying new places & I've been to Central Bistro before off Camelback & loved that restaurant (same owners).

Our server was super friendly & willing to make recommendations-which I like. Service was fast also.

I ordered the Passionfruit Sangria which was great!

It is a tapas style restaurant for sure, so we ordered a bunch of food & tried a little of everything.

My FAVORITE pick off of the menu is the Pork Belly Roll- oh my goodness! This has a great savory taste, a little crunch, & its a perfect combo with the coleslaw they top it woth. Definitely recommend!!

The downside is you will either be waiting a long time or you need to make reservations.. I made mine a week out & they only had 2 time slots left for a Saturday.. 

Definitely will be back though!!
