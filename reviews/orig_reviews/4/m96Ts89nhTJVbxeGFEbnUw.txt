They have a limited menu and limited hours but Rito's makes for a fantastic lunch.

There is a small building wherein you order, wait for and pick up your food.  At this point you either drive off or eat on the patio which features picnic tables and a couple trees that provide some shade and leaves.

But that isn't important, the food is what keeps drawing me back.  As other reviewers have mentioned, their tender, seasoned beef is top notch.  Both the red chili and green chili sauces are rich and tasty; I prefer the red but I still usually get the red sauce inside and the green sauce outside.

The beans - kind of half mashed - are nice seasoned as well and make an excellent side.
