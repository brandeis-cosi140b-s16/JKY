Lovely design and atmosphere. It is very inviting and social. Loved their whiskey selection and the red headed stranger was delicious. Their manhattan was okay until you ate some spicy tacos. The spice really brought out the sweetness and taste in the drink. I recommend getting this if you are eating. I went there with my SO, he had a short rib torta (very tasty) and I had the fish, pastor, and conchinita tacos.. all very good. They had fresh salsa and their queso app is delicious... I want that in and around my mouth, always. 

This spot has had quite a few failed attempts in the past few years but I feel bakersfield may be able to break that curse. I will be returning.
