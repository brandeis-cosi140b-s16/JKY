First of all, what a fun place. Probably a bit hard to find your first time (I was a passenger, so perhaps it's just me being poor with my sense of direction), but it's a little hidden away in the World Market Center. We valeted , which is a little funny b/c your car ends up parked right next to the door, but for a couple bucks, it's super convenient.  Inside, the decor is hip, the tables are very generously spaced - no bumping into anyone on the way to the bathroom.

So back to the dinner. I had the Queso Flameado for a starter, because, well, I can't turn down much that has 'queso' in the name... It was flavorful and interesting with the addition of goat cheese.  

For an entree, I split the Scallops with Mr. L - perfectly seasoned and cooked, great texture.

We were dining with friends that are vegan, and they seemed extremely pleased with what there was available to order, and the waiter was very accommodating with helping them modify certain dishes. 

Topped off with a pretty reasonably priced bottle of pinot noir, and it was a great night!

I hear this place is busy for lunch, but it seemed like a fairly slow dinner time... I really don't want them to close for dinner hours, so please give this place a try for dinner too! :-)
