What a great outdoor space. That really changed the game for this place. Now not only is the food great, but the atmosphere is awesome too. They also have an outdoor bar, which is really nice, and gives the whole place a ton more space. I recently tried their tamales, and they were so good Their tacos are great, as well as everything else I've had here. Really top-notch food, and not very expensive at all. Their drink creations are also pretty great. I love me a margarita. I can't recall any really bad experiences with service, but I also have never gotten spectacular service either.
