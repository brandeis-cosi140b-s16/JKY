Valle Luna is no doubt one of my top 3 Mexican restaurants in AZ. I find myself craving it at times and nothing else will do! It's an older restaurant with few updates. The parking lot is an absolute nightmare, and we usually end up parking on the street to the North. The service is okay- seems to vary depending on day and time.
The food, however is so delicious that I just have to give this 4 stars. I could probably just come and eat chips and salsa and be completely satisfied. They are delish! The menu is big and varied. I'm a bit limited being a Veg, but the beans never disappoint. The rest of the food all looks wonderful and fresh. It seems a bit costly to me at times when compared to other similar establishments, but I seem to forget that when I'm in the place eating!
