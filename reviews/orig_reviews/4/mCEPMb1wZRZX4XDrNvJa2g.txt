Mama's home!! Well almost home. Real salsa just like home (Cali), had the Cabo Azul (thank you Yelpers for the recommendation).  Omg the food was soooo good.  I am not a chile rellen√≥ fan but pretty good.  The lobster enchiladas succulent, cheesy goodness. The taco was tasty but the enchiladas, take me home and put me to bed.  Chips and salsa again just like in Cali! Service was efficient, had an early dinner at 4:30 or so.  Would have given 4.5-5 stars but the food was not hot, but I was famished. Plus no happy hour specials; come on people this is Vegas!!!
