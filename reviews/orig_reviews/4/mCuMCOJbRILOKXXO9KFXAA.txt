MUST TRY! Saw this place driving by, stopped and can't get enough. Just moved here from Tucson where food like this was on every corner. I had been searching for something to match up since november and FINALLY, here it is. Service is great, salsa bar is yummy, and the food is delicious and authentic. I am only lacking 1 star because I wish that it was open later and especially on sundays. Also its a bit pricey from what I am used too, but as I said this kind of food was on every corner in Tucson at .75 cents a taco. Im still hooked and will recommend to everyone I can.
