I kept hearing about this place and we finally found a time to make our way there. the casino gave us a comp for the restaurant which was really nice.

the hostess was a sweetheart and very lively as she greeted us upon our arrival. it was pretty busy but our wait wasn't too long before we were sat. I liked the chips and dips - salsa lacked a little flavor but adding a little salt and lime helped give it a kick. 

I went with the shrimp diavolo, chose the soup as a side option and it was so delicious! it was nice how they gave a good chunk of avocado too instead of cutting you short with just a slice or two. 

we saw our busser more than we did our server but he was pretty awesome. overall good experience :)
