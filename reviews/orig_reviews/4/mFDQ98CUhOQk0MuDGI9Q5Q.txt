I am actually really surprised by how low of a rating this place has!

Came here with some girlfriends to grab late lunch and drinks after checking in to our hotel. We were seated right away and had two tables pushed together so we could all sit together. We were all happy with our food and got the fun tall drinks. It was also happy hour, which was an added bonus, in addition to our free drink tickets. The prices were reasonable and the people who worked there were great! It was oppressively hot (to our New England standards) when we visited but we were seated right by the door, so we got to enjoy the cool A/C air while still being seated outside.

As always, super fun decor!
