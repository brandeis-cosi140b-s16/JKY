Aside from the fact that I specifically asked for cheese in my burrito and did not receive it, it was pretty good. The girls working there were super sweet and the service was fast. I got a carne asada burrito and will say that it was tasty. It had a good portion of meat, beans, and rice (except no cheese..arrrgggghhhh HULK SMASSSHHH!!!!!) and the cilantro and onions complimented the burrito. 

They could do with a bit less salt on their meat  and perhaps the burritos could be a bit bigger (then again I eat like a 400 pound man so I can't judge small portions.)

I will definitely be returning there again in hopes of getting cheese to go into my burrito. Would recommend this place as a good lunch spot :)
