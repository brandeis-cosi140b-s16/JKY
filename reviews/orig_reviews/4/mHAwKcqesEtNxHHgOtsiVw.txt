The Meal.  The lava sauce was spicy: heat and smokiness; great stuff. The potato jack enchiladas Christmas style with Chihuahua Cheese and topped with freshly made sour cream was DELISH!  I enjoyed the oven where they heat up your clay dish holding your enchiladas; it is brilliant!  The only thing that I think could be improved upon, meal wise, is the corn tortilla itself.  The tortilla was too thick, which led to it unrolling while it was being prepared and while eating it.  I think if they were to make it just a little thinner, it would make the tortilla hold its shape better.

Service.  It's still their first week.  They were nice and ready to answer questions, but a little slow getting ready for the lunch time crowd.  It was fine, we weren't in a rush, but one thing to improve is have one person for each station.  While I was attended there were multiple people, some unsure where to go and what to do, and only a couple of people preparing the dish, which led to a bit of chaos and time delay in the kitchen side.  

Ambiance. The place was nice, clean, modern, and casual. Love it! Especially the light fixtures! The patio outside was great!  Maybe one thing to consider is add a couple of those pavers from your patio exit to the north parking lot  along the gravel garden, you know to reduce people walking all over your rock and ruining the wonderful landscaping.  

Portion. The two enchilada plate did not fill the stomachs of my coworkers, nor mine, we filled our cups twice with beverage and that held us over.  One of the guys did get a three enchilada plate with a drink and that did the trick for him.
