As far as venues go this is the place to catch a show!!!! Great space makes for awesome interaction with the groups! They bring in some lesser known amazing indie artists! The selection of beer is descent for a show venue.  

The front bar seems like a really cool place but I rarely stay with all the other cool places downtown.  The DJ sound setup seems to need some work.  The music was pretty distorted.
