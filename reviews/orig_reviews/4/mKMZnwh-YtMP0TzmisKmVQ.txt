My girlfriend and I went here for the first time on Easter weekend. 

We started off with the calamari with aoli and their Moroccan beef soup as the appetizer. The calamari wasn't the traditional type you'd get at mainstream American restaurants but it was thicker pieces of squid with panko breading. This non-traditional set-up was quite good although the sauce that came with it could be a little bit more tangy. The Moroccan beef soup was very good, beefy but not overbearing. 

For the entrees, I ordered the Phyllo wrapped lamb and she the duck roast. The lamb was excellent, it came wrapped in a flaky Phyllo pastry and a succulent sauce. The sides were also superb, although I could use a little less garlic in the mashed potatoes. The duck was cooked to perfection, although the plantains and mashed sweet potatoes were left a lot to be desired.

We shared dessert, which was the banana flambeed with vanilla bean ice cream. It was amazing, although it is quite hard to mess up something so innately satisfying. 

Overall, the presentation was superb and the waitress courteous. The atmosphere was fine for the occasion, although my girlfriend did complain about the "orangy" walls... haha. In any case, I highly recommend Escobar's for a good meal.
