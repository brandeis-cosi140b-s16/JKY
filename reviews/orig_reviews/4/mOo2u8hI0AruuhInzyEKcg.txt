I loved this place, I'm always spectacle of Vegas restaurants, flying servers, or should I say sommelier's.  I really enjoyed my meal.  

Started with a generous portion of chips and delicious salsa, of course we ordered the guacamole, made table side.  I'm a huge fan of tortilla soup so when I saw it on the menu I immediately sang the happy dance (in my head).  Followed by the carnitas tamales, fantastic flavour.  Go hungry because the portions are generous, my only regret was that I was too full to continue or even peek at the dessert menu, next time.
