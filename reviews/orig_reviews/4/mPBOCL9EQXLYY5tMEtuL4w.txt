One of the better Chevys I have been to. Was hard to find, as it is in the Galleria mall, and due to construction, there is currently no outside signage to lead you to their entrance.
We went during lunch service. Our server was friendly, attentive, with a touch of humor. LIked that.
We had the chicken and the steak fajitas, both cooked to perfection. Food was served hot as were the sides. 
No complaints here, we enjoyed our meal and margaritas. We left with full tummies and smiling faces!
