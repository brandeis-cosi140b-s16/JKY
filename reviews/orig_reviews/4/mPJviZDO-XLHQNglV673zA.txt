I've been a fan of Carolinas for years, and eaten at all three valley locations. This location , a renovated Fazolli's, is the nicest of the three. The food quality is consistent with the orginal, but the service isn't . It may just be new staff at a new location and will hopefully improve with time. 
Make sure to get a dozen tortillas to go, these wagon wheel sized delights freeze well and can be enjoyed for weeks.
