A local hot spot in a non-hot spot. The location for this fine restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but many have found their way to this delicious establishment as there is always a crowd from the moment they open. Not your typical Mexican joint. If you are looking for basic burros or tamales or chimichangas don't look hear. If you want a selection of thoughtfully created tastes and food then you will not go wrong here.
