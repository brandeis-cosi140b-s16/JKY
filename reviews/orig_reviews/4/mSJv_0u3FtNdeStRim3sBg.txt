This place is fantastically quirky with regard to decor and the food is excellent!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because all too often they are out of two menu items that I always get with my meal when they have them.  They are half the reason I like coming here... Flan and horchata.  Although I'm loathe to say this, for fear of it being even less likely they will have it when I come, everyone must try the flan and horchata!  They are both excellent!
