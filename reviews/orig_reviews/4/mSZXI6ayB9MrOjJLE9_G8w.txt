Came here during lunch hour and sat inside because it was wayyy to hot outside. We were seated immediately and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the atmosphere, relaxing but fun. The food was good... just got some tacos and a lot of coronas. Overall, I thought the prices were reasonable and I would come back again.
