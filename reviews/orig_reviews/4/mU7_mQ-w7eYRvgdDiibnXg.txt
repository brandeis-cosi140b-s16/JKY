This is a great place for us because its a rare place that I can agree on with my wife, daughter, and both of my parents - its rare to find a place that all 5 of us like.  The crazy potato is amazing and that is what my dad normally gets, I typically get the carne asada burrito, and my wife, daughter, and mom get the tacos - then we split a chips and salsa and a refried beans. The food gets 5 stars and the service does too.  The owner is often there and I've chatted with him a few times, he is a really nice guy.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the place is small and busy, it can be difficult to find indoor seating, and sometimes seating at all.  Also, the condiment area is often crowded and inefficient due to its location in the corner but there isn't anywhere else to put it in this small place.  The parking lot is crowded too, this place needs to either open another restaurant (further south and east please) or move into a bigger location.  But the food really is amazing!!!
