Great Sunday Brunch...  Awesome location, Sits high on top of the hill with amazing post card view of the city.  Service is spot on. The staff treats everyone like family. The appetizers are great and love them making fresh guacamole table side. Like ordering different entrees and serving it family style.
It's said repeat business is highest form of compliment, and we've been faithful patrons since this location opened!!!!
