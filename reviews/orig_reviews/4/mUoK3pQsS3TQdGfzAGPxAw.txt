They call themselves the Original because they have nothing to do with the gross-o chain Garcias.  
It's so good.  I work in the southwest valley, so I have endless choices for Mexican food.  This is the only Mexican restaurant I'll eat at in my area.  In fact, whenever the boss man comes out to work with me, it's the only place he'll eat at too. 
He eats healthy and I do too, well on weekdays.  There are a few options on the menu that won't weigh you down the rest of the day.  Dishes with fish, black beans, chicken breasts, spinach, etc, made with delicious Mexican flavors.  Ofcourse there are the weigh downs as well.  Looove the chimichanga.  
It's huge and cozy inside and don't let the area scare you.  It's on the main road and you're safe if you're there during operating hours.
