I actually really liked this bar. We went here for late night drinks after watching the fountain show at The Bellagio. Inside it was fairly crowded but not overly so we sat at the bar. I had a frozen margarita that was delicious and not too sugary or tart. The bar tender whose name I am forgetting was super cool and was pouring some good size shots - rare in sin city! The music was really good (we had been blasted with early 90's dance all day at the pool so were happy for some Foo Fighters, The Stones etc). At some point they give away free Tequila shots although that's not my thing. The misters were nice given the 105 degree heat. I'd definitely go back here!
