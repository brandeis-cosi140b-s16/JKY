We had dinner there after my lovely man had a good business meeting. Since I craved beans and we didnt want to drive off strip it was right there :)

The service is good, attentive for sure. The food is very fresh. I had the chicken fajitas and man had the steak fajitas. I liked the food a lot. 
The spices were just right and the black beans delicious and very noisy later :)
(yes I grew up in a barn)

The prices are higher than they should, but its the strip and these are tourist prices. But it was a good meal. I didnt sample the alcoholic cuisine since I drank too much the night before (and nearly invited a lady I made out with to the room...) so I stayed sober.

Its so convinient, in the middle of the casino of PH.
