Great atmosphere, affordable rates and great food. We had beans, guac, chips and salsa, pineapple and mango margarita and almost one of everything on the menu in our large group. LOVE that you do happy hour on Saturday- made our dinner for ten so reasonable!  Have to say a highlight of the experience was the very nice, blond server, Belinda? You made us feel at home - didn't feel like the typical counter experience and the family had a lot of fun with your help. Thanks for a fun start to our night!
