Great  place but only go here if you're  ready to take your burger eating to another  level.  They have so many different twist to a burger. I started with a maple,pecan,and bacon shake it sounds funny but oh so good once again let me know that anything can be made better with bacon. You have to try the sweet potato  tater tots delicious. I tryed the  daily special which was a burger that had ground lucky charms mixed in the bun. Diffently  a new experience and they topped it with funyuns. Can't  wait to go back and take another burger journey.
