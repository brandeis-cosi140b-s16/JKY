Went with a small group of 4.. The place looked pretty busy but they were able to get us in it right away. Food was delicious! I had a carne asada quesadilla. It was about $18 (to me that's expensive for such a simple dish). Service was slow that's the only downside. Had to wait for the server to come back around because he barely checked on us. I'm a local and would I go back? Probably not unless a friend wanted me to for a special occasion. Don't get me wrong it tasted good. But I just don't want to pay for an overpriced quesadilla and I don't want to wait 20 minutes for water. Thanks just me though. Servers were nice.
