Came on a Friday night without reservations.  My fellow foodie and I ended up downstairs at the bar where we enjoyed outstanding service.  The bartender, Phil, not only made a fabulous Manhattan, but his knowledge of the menu impressed.  With so many amazing options, I don't think we ever would have decided without Phil's guidance.  

We finally settled on the Shrimp Piri Piri, (essentially a chopped Shrimp Scampi) made more delicious after adding a few squeezes of lemon.  We also enjoyed the Roasted Garlic Plate which you should not order if you don't like garlic or peppers.  For dinner we both selected from the specials board.  I had the Blackened Tuna with a Strawberry Champagne sauce, an interesting combination of savory, spice, and sweetness.  My friend had the Sea Bass and felt it was just ho-hum.  

Overall the evening was lovely.  We met several friendly people and enjoyed delightful food and service.  However, the $180 bill came as a bit of a shock.  Because of the price, this restaurant will be reserved for special occasions only.
