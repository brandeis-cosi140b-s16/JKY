I love the menu, I love the presentation, I love the feel of the restaurant, and I love the happy hour prices.  The hotel and restaurant has a trendy, retro, modern, Crate&Barrel color look to it.  All of their tacos are fresh and delicious, especially the pork belly when it's available.  The one exception was the carne asada, which was tender and cooked well but tasted a little off, as if it was seasoned incorrectly or something.  The horchata was decent.  I was impressed by the guacamole and the housemade salsas, and that huge grilled corn is awesome too. The staff even accommodated a dairy allergy and grilled one of the corns without the cojita cheese for us. 

I'm telling you - everything is incredible, and during happy hour it feels like we're robbing the place clean!  Servers are great and attentive too, and they really try to take care of you.  You have to bring an out-of-towner here to eat, cause there really aren't too many places like this.  It's just a fun, beautiful spot to come and grab a bite, and everyone there is so pleasant and attentive.  Gotta try their breakfast items next time I'm there.
