Decent food! Good service considering how busy it is. Average drink selection. I like the location of this place but it can get a bit crowded and noisy depending on the night. I feel like a bigger space would allow for a better experience since it is a hot spot in NoDa and let's face it: there's just not enough room for everybody! Still give this place four stars though, because these are just minor setbacks. The salsa is fresh and super chunky! Probably one of the best food items.
