Stopped by early this evening for dinner.  It was only a little after 5:00 p.m. and the place was packed.  We were greeted warmly and walked to a table.  Such cute decor inside.  The LARGE Margarita's were just that . . . LARGE!  And the chips and salsa were great.  Our combo plates were LARGE!  In a nutshell, this place is great!  We had the tacos and enchiladas, beans and rice (I'm stuffed).  I'd go back for sure.  I saw a guy having the shrimp cocktail and it looked so good.  Try this place . . . you won't be disappointed.
