Great Tex Mex food served in an extremely trendy restaurant.

The restaurant offers half price food from 11.00 PM onwards so its always packed with students. The nachos grande and the honey barbecue wings are my favorite things there.

They also offer a wide selection of margaritas and beers and is a perfect place to go to when you don't have a lot of work to do for the next day. 

The only negative aspect of this Mad Mex is the lack of seating. There is almost definitely a 20 minute wait if you go for food after 11.00PM so it's better to go there at around 10.30 PM put your name down on the list. 

Although I have not been there for lunch, I have heard that they haven half off from 2.00 to 4.00 if you show a valid student ID.
