I met a customer here for lunch on Friday. Ricardo's Mexican Restaurant is a large restaurant with plenty of parking and offers a lunch buffet in addition to their regular menu.

We sat in the bar where each booth contains a flat screen TV.
I ordered the killer guacamole and chips which were awesome and so addicting!  For my lunch entree I ordered  the combo - choices were a chili relleno and a beef enchilada which also came with beans and rice. The beef enchilada contained shredded beef and was tasty and the chili relleno was yummy too. 

The portion was large and I ate so many chips and guacamole that I couldn't finish everything.  Thank goodness I didn't go for the buffet.

I'll return here again since this is my clients favorite place to dine.
