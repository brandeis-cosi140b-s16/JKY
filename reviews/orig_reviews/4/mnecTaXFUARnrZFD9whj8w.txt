This was a recommendation from one of my coworkers and I decided we would stop in there after work the other day and get dinner... 

First thing is first, the building is not the prettiest of places but i guess it fits the overall feel of the place, you walk in and 2 young ladies dressed in old Mexican dress great you and get you seated, the waiter then came by to see us and offer us drinks.. Let me stop and say that the waiter was extremely friendly and on top of every aspect of our meal. We ordered a Margarita and waters with the Table side Guacamole for an appetizer. this was probably the best guacamole i gave ever had. The meal also comes with not only your entree but you get sopa de fideo with every combo plus beans and rice, My grandma used to make sopa de fideo before she passed and it tasted just like her.  memories!!!  

Okay so now that my review has turned into one long run on sentence I will just finish by saying the meals are huge, tasty and fairly priced, I definitely recommend this place if you like Mexican food and great service.
