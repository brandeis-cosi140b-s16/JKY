I loved the ambiance of this place. Hidden in the back of the Villa off Providence it is like a little oasis with its large gorgeous patio. The inside is nice, classy, and perfect for a girl's night over frozen margaritas or first date. Parking out back is easy.

My SO and I had wings as an app. I recommend them. They are crispy and covered in a tasty sweet chili sauce but not spicy. We shared a few tacos. We loved the skirt steak, carnitas, Korean steak, and crispy chicken.. Not crazy about the tofu (not much taste) or mahi mahi. The "famous" creamy white beans had way too much lime but overall okay. 

Great service, our bartenders were very nice and attentive. I cannot wait for the weather to warm up to enjoy that patio! Lots of other yummy looking items I look forward to trying. We will definitely be back for more.
