We were looking for Mexican food in the area, this place got great reviews so we thought we would try. I agree, the pico de gallo was very good, I like that it wasn't loaded down with onions like most mexican places do. I also like that the regular salsa came in a squeeze bottle, that made apply to food super easy. I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga, rice and beans. The Chimichanga was very good, not dry like many can be. It was large and very moist, reminded me of chicken pot pie without the veges wrapped in fried flour shell..yummy! I didn't like the rice so much, had a little to much red enchilada sauce flavor for me, but I don't like red enchilada sauce. The other item we ordered was the Beef Taco Salad. We expected Ground Beef and were pleasantly surprise to find Steak. I would give it another try and go for the Faijta's next time, a table close to us got them and they smelled very good!
