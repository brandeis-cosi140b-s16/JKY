Ive read a lot of mixed reviews about this place on yelp but everyone i know in person has told me the food is delicious here. This is a very chill environment but nice and neat at the same time. There is a nice view of the strip, so we sat outside. I brought my Bf to celebrate his B-day here and we were impressed by how nice the waitress was, always checking up on us and making sure everything was okay. I ordered the shrimp tacos, i loved the chipotle sauce on them, i even ordered extra on the side. I'm not a huge breaded shrimp kinda person but for some reason i was feeling these, it wast overwhelmed with shrimp. My plate came with rice and beans they were good too. My bf ordered the carnitas plate, i tried some of his duhh.... The meat was nice and tender and flavorful. We got Churros for desert, 4 come  in one order. We really enjoyed them because they weren't super sweet and sugary it was just the write amount, it came with 2 different dipping sauces to add extra flavor.
