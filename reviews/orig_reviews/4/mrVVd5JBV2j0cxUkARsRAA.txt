Maize is good, but the hype has gotten out of hand. 
Their burritos are average - I mean, they are above-average for this area, but in general they are just okay. Kind of loosely wrapped, which is disappointing.
Chips and salsa are good.
Tacos seem fairly standard.
Perhaps the issue is that there is so much mediocre Mexican food around. I heard rave reviews about here, and have tried them a couple of times, but they are just good in my opinion. So, this is a local 4 (I'd rather have Huaraches) and if I'm judging it against legit Mexican in other areas of the country, it's probably a 3.
