This is our go-to place when we are craving chips & salsa and/or want to relax outside with a cold beer.  This patio is amazing...you get the feeling you're in Mexico (at least until you hear a pack of Harleys cruising by out front - it is in Cave Creek, after all!)

We love that the chips come with 3 salsas - the hubs and I don't usually like the same thing, so this satisfies us both!  The mild is my personal favorite and he loves the salsa verde.  

They used to have a kick-ass plate of nachos, but they took it off the menu (wasn't sophisticated enough, apparently)...though it is sometimes available during happy hour.  We also love the Spinach Queso, but that's only available at Dos.  Pollo Fundido is our usual dish and friends love the Fajitas.  My mom still raves about the Sopa Albondigas she had 2 Christmases ago!  The variety of Margaritas is good too.  

We love taking visitors here for the obligatory Mexican meal everyone wants to have when they travel to Phoenix.  There may be places with better/more authentic food, but you can't beat the ambiance.
