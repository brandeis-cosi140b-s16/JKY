This place is literally a diamond in the rough. When I tell my friends to meet me here, they are somewhat weary of my description of how to get here. It's just north of Greenway on the west side, right across from a trailer park in a dumpy old strip mall. 

It's brilliant really. Let's take two of some of the best guilty pleasures: Mexican and Chinese food and mix them together! When I'm hungry and am craving food and can't make a decision, this is my go-to place, because it satiates the cravings for salty, rich, cheesy, and maybe spicy if you'd like. Oh, and sweet too! (They give you homemade Snickerdoodles with each meal!)

My favorite thing to do is get the combo platter with the Emerald Chicken (so light, tender, and yummy), either Machaca beef or carnitas in a quesadilla, and the pork fried rice with black beans. As another reviewer said, go for the Jerk chicken or Pollo Diablo if you want options that are spicier. 

It can get confusing what to order since there's too many options, but no need to fret. They let you sample everything! You can just order one dish (i.e. Teriyaki chicken) alone with rice, or you can get the combo like the one I mentioned above so you have more choices. Ordering a meat/veggie as a quesadilla or burrito is merely an included option if you get the combo plate, but it's extra if you're only getting one meat/veggie alone. 

Don't forget to check out the life size Panda in a sombrero either while waiting for your food. The place can get pretty packed on weekend evenings...
