Im an originary of TJ and I must say...Vegas is the shiz nit, however, havin' a lil' piece of TJ made it a tad bit better this last time around...

Tacos El Gordo has been in Vegas for roughly half a year now.  I dont know how they hadn't thought about settleling in Vegas before, given such a large Mexican population, but I'm glad they did now.

I was thrilled to have some good old fashion Tijuana street tacos after a long nite of drinking and dancing :D  However, the carne asada fries took me by surprise and made my night even better than it had originally been.

I definately plan on coming back to this establishment when I come back to visit.
