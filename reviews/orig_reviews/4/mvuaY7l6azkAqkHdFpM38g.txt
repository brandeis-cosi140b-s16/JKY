Of course, I live on the complete opposite side of town!  I will happily venture back down here anytime- excellent beer selection and pricing.  And who can resist yummy tacos?  What draws me in is the free local music!  Yayo is perfectly designed for bands to play, and offers plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Great place to come with a group of friends- I would suggest checking it out when bands are playing- just to support the local music scene, as well as a tasty taco shop!
