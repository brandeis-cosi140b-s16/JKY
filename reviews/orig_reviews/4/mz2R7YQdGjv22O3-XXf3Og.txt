I live close by and normal go down town for Mexican but came based on the other reviews and was not disappointed. Very good service that was fast. The food had a beautiful presentation and was very tasty. Had the house margarita and it was smooth and filled within alcohol.  Would have given them  5 stars but no hot sauce on the table.
