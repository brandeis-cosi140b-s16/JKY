I've found a great new happy hour (3-6pm) location in Hussong's Cantina. $3 draft beers - including imports. Most other happy hours in Madalay Bay/Luxor seem to discount just PBR or Bud Light.  Food was also a hit including the free homemade tortilla chips and salsa as well as a half-price steak quesadilla that was big enough for two.
