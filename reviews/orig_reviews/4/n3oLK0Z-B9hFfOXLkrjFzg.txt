This is my go-to Mexican food restaurant whenever I have to meet the folks out in Mesa. I do not think I have ever had a problem out here except maybe for it taking a minute too long to get a margarita on a busy day but you can't really fault them for that.  The decor is bright and festive which is great for the tots and the mini-chimis always seem to put my girlfriend in a good mood when when she is blue (read:hungover).
