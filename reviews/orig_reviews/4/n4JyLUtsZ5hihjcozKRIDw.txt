I love the way the waitress use a team system, it makes sure that your order is taken very fast and you get refills on your drinks as well. The chips are very good and they have 3 types of salsas, which are great. I like to mix the hot chunky salsa with the mild. The mild salsa has black olives in it which makes for a very interesting combination. My favorite thing to eat here is the beef tacos. The best flavor of any tacos I have had. The rice is really good too. Other greats are the Mini stuffed quesadilla and cheese crisp. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that the prices are pretty expensive for the casual and much in need of updated dining room.
