The restored church is unbelievably cool. The El Pastor pork is my favorite as it's like a gourmet version of a 2 am Mexican street taco. I love the chips and variations of guacamole as well. 

The strange downside of this place is there is no clear hostess station and because of this they're horrible at receiving patrons through the front door. Now I love the food enough to endure this, but I've stood at the door so many times to the point it was awkward I had to stop someone to get seated. I've also been told they were on a wait while I could see open tables and simply needed to get somebody else to get a table.

On a sidenote the jukebox can be a blessing or curse. Lots of horrible music but they also have old soul music like Joe Tex on it. My advice is take it over early if you're going to stay for a while.
