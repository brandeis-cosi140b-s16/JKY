We met a couple of friends here as a halfway point and will definitely return.  We sat at a booth in the bar (we were the only ones in the bar area) and I was thrilled to see they offered Tacate LIGHT which is a hard find even in most Mexican restaurants!  My husband ordered a margarita which was just okay.  On my girlfriend's recommendation, I ordered the number 48 with chicken..Corn tortillas with chicken, green peppers, onions, and bacon (which at first I thought sounded odd but the flavors together were delicious.)  Their rice and beans were pretty no nonsense but good.  I heard that this is a Little Mexico style type of joint and that their spicy factor is quite low.  The service was pretty good and I thought the prices were fair.
