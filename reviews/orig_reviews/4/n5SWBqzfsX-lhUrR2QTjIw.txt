Green hatch chile...Yaaaassss!!!! The first time I was introduced to this place, I had a third of their bacon and egg breakfast burrito that was shared amongst co workers. This burrito was HUGE and smothered with green chile. I've never had a desire to visit New Mexico but it is now on my list of desired places to visit just from tasting what I've been missing out on. I took two other visits since that first taste and have not been disappointed. I have even ventured off to try their smothered fries with red chile...delicious!! This place is GREAT!!! The staff is extremely friendly, it gives you a feeling of not being in a big city like Vegas anymore but in some kind of small friendly town. The one and ONLY reason for giving Carlito's 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the restaurant itself is so tiny!! My immediate local family could fill that place up easily. A restaurant this delicious and friendly never stays empty so consider that as a warning if you're expecting to for sure have some place to dine in. Ooh and please don't let me forget to mention the $3 tall glass margaritas!!! If beer is your preference, they have that also. What else can you ask for.
