Yow! Has it really 4 years since I wrote Abuelo's off as disappointingly bland? I have to remedy that. Along the way, they've found their footing again. On top of that, there have been several menu changes for the better. Whether you want mild or a kick in the mouth, they've got you covered. The menu's expanded to the point it even includes some less-common dishes you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. 

And oh my God, you guys, the carnitas, oh my God. They originally introduced it as a weekend special--basic carnitas tacos--and it's since colonized a half-dozen entrees. EAT IT.

Service has been impeccable without fail.
