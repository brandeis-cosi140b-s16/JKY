Great food. Tried it for the first time at the Yelp Sol Train event. Was able to try the guacamole, chicken quesadillas, carne asada as well as pork carnitas street tacos and frozen margaritas. The food was all really flavorful, however a the mushroom quesadilla and pork carnitas tacos had a surprising and unexpected kick to them. Food was great though. I'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items!
