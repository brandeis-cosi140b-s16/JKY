The salted caramel shake is seriously the best.  As a fellow yelper previously wrote, that it was the best thing she ever had the pleasure of sucking down - I would have to say I wholeheartedly agree.  And it comes with a big straw to allow for extra quick suckage.  

I got the short rib tacos which were okay, it's not something I can see myself craving in the near future, but I ate the fries my coworker ordered and I absolutely love the seasoning on 'em.  I definitely will come back to try the burgers.
