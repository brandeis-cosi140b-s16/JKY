I watched the two owners of Border Grill on Top Chef Masters and Chef Hunter and wanted to try their restaurant while in Las Vegas last week. The restaurant is very bright and attractive. The chips were outstanding, although my husband did not care at all for the salsa. We split one of the specials - short rib tacos combo plate. It was very tasty and there was plenty of food to share. Service was extremely attentive. I am glad we tried this restaurant
