How am I the duchess and haven't written a full review yet??? Dos Gringos is my total go-to for happy hours and nights out.  Mini chimis are absolutely delicious and frequent beer specials.  It's my #1 spot for day drinking, which they proudly advertise!  I've spent New Years Eve here two years in a row, my 30th birthday, AND even the start to my bachelorette party! As I said, it's one of my favorites in Scottsdale.
