Stopped in this weekend to have a meal with a dear friend after a gap of MANY years and was happy to see the joint was jumping'!!!

We were seated immediately and brought drinks shortly thereafter.  I asked about the beans and was brought a small plate to try, which was a pleasant surprise 

We both ordered a cream cheese-chicken chimichanga thing that was really yummy.  They were a nice  compact size and we were able to finish them off easily.

The service was great...efficient and unobtrusive.  Paying the bill involves visiting the cashier on the way out.  A couple of 10 cent York Peppermint Patties rounded,the meal out nicely.

We left full and happy.   The total cost was $30, which included a generous tip!  I don't get over to downtown Glendale very often but am happy to recommend Pedro's for a good Mexican meal to those who do.
