Sunday brunch on the patio, before hitting the pools. 
For $24.95 I got: huevos rancheros, a fruit plate, pastry basket, AND bottomless mimosas!
And yes, we took full advantage of the term bottomless! I had 4 and my boyfriend had 5 before we went down to mandalay beach for a day in the sun. 
My huevos rancheros were good, not the best I've ever had, but still quite tasty. My boyfriend had chicken enchiladas from the same $24.95 brunch menu and they were great, I loved the flavor of the guajillo sauce. 
I've been here once before with friends for margaritas and apps before a concert, but I'd say brunch is way better!
