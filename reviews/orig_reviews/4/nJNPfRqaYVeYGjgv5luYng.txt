Reviews don't lie. Our party of seven had no complaints about the food, excellent. Service was friendly but EXTREMELY slow. It was lunchtime on a Monday but the restaurant was dead so no excuses not to be on top of things. It took forever to get water and chip refills. From order time until they picked up the check it took one hour forty five minutes....but we did get some complimentary chocolate dessert compliments of the chef
