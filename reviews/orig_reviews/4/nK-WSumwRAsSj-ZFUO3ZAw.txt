Dropped by around 1:30am and it was PACKED. Good thing they close at 4am on Fridays and Saturdays! 

You go in and order first, then pay. There are three different lines depending on what you're ordering, so make sure to save time and get in the right line :) We got tacos de cabeza ($2), lengua ($2.25), and adobada ($2), and a half order of adobada fries. All the meats were tasty, especially the lengua. So tender, mmm. My only gripe is that I wished they put more meat on our tacos and fries! 

Would I be back to this Tacos El Gordo? Maybe. I like it, but I don't know if I would go out of my way or make it a point to get food here, especially with all the food options available in sweltering LV ;)
