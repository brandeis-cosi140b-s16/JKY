Reservation through yelp was a breeze. Got a seat beside the river/ gondola rides. Best to reserve such seats ahead. 

Back to the restaurant. Ambience was great what with the gondolas going by with their magnificent serenades. 

Food came after a short 10 to 15min wait. Ordered the chicken quesadilla, good sized portion. Tasted great.

My partner had the mahi mahi, fish was cooked to perfection, not overcooked. Rice was not soggy despite being in the broth. 

Service staff warmed up through dinner. Initial welcome was a tad curt and tight faced, but it all went well specially when the restaurant manager went on his rounds. :-) 

Affordable, mid-priced restaurant found quaintly im the venetian!
