Not exactly "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" but it's certainly a "Yay! I'm a fan."

My boyfriend's co worker was the one that recommended this place so on a late, lazy afternoon we decide to go and try it out.

The cashier was friendly and her customer service was amazing. We were pretty picky on what we want/didn't want on our tacos and she accomadated our order without acting like we were a bother to her. Menu was small and simple which was not a problem at all. You got your tacos, burritos, quesadillas, spanish rice, chips and salsa, nachos, and seafood plates.

My boyfriend and I got 3 carne asada  tacos, a side of chips and salsa and two drinks. Our total came out to be about $17. Kinda pricey for just tacos, small basket of chips and drinks.

Although the tacos were DELISH!!!! It looked like a gourmet taco with all the fixins'. You can choose to have beans, sour cream, avocados or cheese. The carne asada meat....let me tell you: the way its marinated and cooked, it reminded me of my Cali summertime BBQs at a mexican family get-together. (i know im not mexican but i've been invited to my mexican friends family get-togethers wayyy back in the days okay!?) The meat tasted fresh, there weren't any fat and it wasn't dried either. I didn't even need to put any lemon or salsa because it was packed with yummy goodness like my favorite: gucamole.

We will definitely be coming back to this place.
