The ambiance in this restaurant is really nice, especially for a Mexican restaurant. I immediately felt it was a good choice by the handsome decor and level of cleanliness.

The chips and salsa were delicious. The chips were the very thin, crispy chips that I love and are hard to find at grocery stores. 

I ordered the lunch enchiladas accompanied by rice and beans, both of which were delicious. The food was a tad salty, but was very good.

My husband ordered the tilapia Vera Cruz and enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. Good blend of seasoning and good portion of veggies, but small portion of tilapia compared to the photo on the menu. The fish and shrimp were cooked very well.

In addition our waitress was very professional and answered all of our questions with good knowledge of the restaurant. One other plus, the food came out piping hot which I usually have a hard time with at restaurants.

Would definitely return.
