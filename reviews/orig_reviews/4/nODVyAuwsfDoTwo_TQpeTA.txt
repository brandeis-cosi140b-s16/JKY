I was first introduced to Fiesta about 6 years ago by a friend of mine at the time, who lived around the corner. The friendship with her did not last, but my love for Fiesta Burrito did! From the Carne Asada or Bean and Cheese burrito to the Adobada tacos, Fiesta rocks! 

One morning at work, my urge to skip my usual yogurt or oatmeal overcame me and I wanted a burrito (almost always a bean and cheese. yeah for breakfast. I'm strange like that!). I announced that I was going to my favorite taco shop and the questions starting rolling in. Where is this place? Are they good? etc etc. By the time I left, I had six orders, not including mine. So now every time I have a burrito urge, I try to keep it to myself, lest 6+ orders. Selfish, yeah. But that saves me on having to dole out 15 cups of red, green, and/or pico. :P 

Speaking of red, green, and pico - try to only get 2 cups of green for myself. Though really I could easily use about 6 of them in one sitting. I would probably be kicking myself the next day. 

HOW in the heck does Adam Richman - Man vs Food eat all that spicy stuff and not cry the next day on the toilet?!? 

Anyhow - CLEAN, Fast, with Courteous employees. Did I mention clean??? This is NOT your average "-bertos" taco/burrito shop people!!
