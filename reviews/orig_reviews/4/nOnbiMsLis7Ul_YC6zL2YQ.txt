we came here with a group that i work with.  I am very impressed with the architecture and decor.  our waiter was a young man named sam (I am) who was very entertaining and knowledgeable.  He suggested a tequila I had never heard of, it was very good.

i shared the pork shoulder, thinking it would be huge, but it was not that much food.  still, very high quality and many new flavors.  

as with other reviewers i am completely addicted to the pumpkin pudding.

for those of you who like tequila, this is the place.  i think i counted about four dozen different kinds.  (but no jose Cuervo reserva de familia, the very best in all the land!)....also flights of tequila so you can sample.

altogether, the mission is a delight, especially if others are footing the bill!
