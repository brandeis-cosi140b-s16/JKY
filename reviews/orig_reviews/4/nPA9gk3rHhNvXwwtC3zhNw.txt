Delish brunch spot!!  They take mexican brunch dishes and add a special touch. For instance, they have these amazing fries that they melt cheese on and add corn to...nice touch!  Eggs were yummy.  Love love love this spot for brunch and when I walked by at dinner time it was totally happening so I assume that is good too!
