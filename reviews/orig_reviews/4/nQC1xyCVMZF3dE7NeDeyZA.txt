Tried it for the first time Friday.  I got the Paradise Burger.  I asked for pickles to be added instead of cucumber (cucumber on a burger?) The food came out fast, within about 5 minutes of ordering which I like.  The first thing I noticed is they did not give me any pickles but did indeed give me cucumber.   I was in a hurry so didn't bother asking for pickles a second time.  The burger itself was very good and I would go back again to eat.  The fries were also good but way way way too much seasoning.  So much in fact that I had to wipe the excess seasoning off my fingers after every bite.  They could easily use 50% less than what I had on my fries.  I don't know if this is normal for them or just a fluke over seasoning.  When I do go back again I will indeed insist on getting pickles instead of cucumber and will ask for a "normal" amount of seasoning on the fries. Almost forgot,  loved the bun.  Very soft and wish more places used these buns!
