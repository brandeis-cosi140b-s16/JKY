I frequently visit this place and I'm happy nearly everytime I go. The food is great and at a decent price. The smell has much improved since closing its old location and reopening just further up the parking lot. Get the house margarita! Delicious and with a generous pour of tequila, you won't be disappointed. The wait staff could use a freshening up of attitudes. But all in all a great place for a great-priced Mexican meal!
