Pretty excited to have found a mexican restaurant that serves one of my favorite dishes: Alambres.  I highly recommend ordering it because they make it very well, a ton of meat (and bacon in there if i remember correctly) slathered in cheese.  The only other place I have found Alambres at was in SF so when i saw this on the menu i was elated.
