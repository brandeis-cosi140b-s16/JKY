5 stars rating makes me want to check out places, but I was a bit iffy when I fist came here. It's a strange looking place, but I decided to come here during daytime (made me feel safer). Once you get in...it doesn't look any much nice, BUT the staff is super friendly! 
I tired all the dollar tacos (I mean...how can you really go wrong, right?). BUT...I tired the FISH TACOS...oh boy oh boy!!! It's the BEST I've ever had for such a cheap price! Seriously, you MUST try them. The horchata is like a hit and miss with me, but it was the first time I ever had it with fruits and nuts...it's pretty good. The little side of grilled onions is *wiping my drool* so good! I don't prefer not to eat onions...I'm not into them, but it's so good from this place.
I know this place has lots of 5 stars and you might think people are putting too much hype into the place, but go try it out and judge for yourself...but if you are craving for fish tacos...definitely hit this spot!
