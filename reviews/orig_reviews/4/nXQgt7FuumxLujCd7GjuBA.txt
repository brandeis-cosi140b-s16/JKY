Omg! The California burrito is SSSOOO good!!! I hate my coworker for introducing me to it just because I don't want to gain 100 this week. How can French fries make a burrito taste so much better?! The only thing I thought was ridiculous was the price to add sour cream. It's $1.10 just for sour cream!! $1.10 is just a little excessive I think .30 would be more reasonable. Not going to lie tonight I am planning on going to get my burrito then putting sour cream on it when I get home. :) when I die I hope these California burritos are in heaven and that it doesn't cost to add sour cream :)
