This place is soooooo goooood!!! Must try!!! Avocado creama is bomb. I get the adobada tacos and fries every time. Best tacos in town. The only downside is that you smell like meat when you walk out. The staff could be a little bit more friendly too, but I mainly go for the food and not the customer service.
