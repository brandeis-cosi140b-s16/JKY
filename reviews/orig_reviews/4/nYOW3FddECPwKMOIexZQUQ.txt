If you go to Tijuana avoid the donkey show... if you go to Round Corner Cantina do NOT avoid the Tijuana street dog.

Cantina is a great place for a few drinks (best cocktails in PIttsburgh) whether it be their red pepper red pepper or a legit caiparinha.  Great atmosphere both inside and outside for a group of any size.

the food is consistently great from they carnitas to their various other dishes.

The only mistake you can make here is having too many of they great drinks... my wife has lived through that..
