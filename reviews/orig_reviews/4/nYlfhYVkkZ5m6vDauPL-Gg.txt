Taco Guild has an incredible atmosphere and lovely service, but their menu recently changed and I have to say that while most tacos were still quite yummy their switch in the lamb taco was, to say the least, disappointing.

What was once filled with scrumptious morsels of perfectly cooked lamb topped with crunchy sweet potato strings and crumbly salty cheese has been replaced by a texture-less jumble of too many flavors combined with dry, stringy, braised lamb.

If you go I would, ironically, recommend the enchiladas. They've been perfect every time I've gone and you get a much bigger portion for what you pay.
