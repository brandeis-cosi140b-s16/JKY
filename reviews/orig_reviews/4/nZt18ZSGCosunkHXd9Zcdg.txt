Stumbled upon Fajitas while driving around......lost in Phoenix.

Frikkin' GPS! Left turn here! Right turn now!!! We damn near hit a lightpole before we got our asses good and lost! Grrr!!! Anyway, somehow through this mess we located Fajitias and yazz, yazz!!!

Ya' can't go wrong with amazing deals! The place is actually quite huge and the margaritas (offered at $3/each) didn't disappoint. 

We'd actually ordered the Mexican pizza as an appetizer thinking we'd be able to make it to an actual entreé (#fajitas)....

But this thing arrived and was so huge that it literally became a meal. The savings from not ordering an actual entreé allowed us to order extra booze. 

We departed full of food and booze for less than $20. Unbeatable!!!
