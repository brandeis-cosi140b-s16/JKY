Terrific food, great decor but lose the TVs and turn down the music.  The guacamole is superb and no matter what kind of meat you have, it's so tasty.  Today it was too cold inside and the canned music so loud that we had to move outside.  I don't get what the din adds, and I honestly think that the TVs detract from the ambience.  If people want to look at a screen, they probably have their own smart phone.
