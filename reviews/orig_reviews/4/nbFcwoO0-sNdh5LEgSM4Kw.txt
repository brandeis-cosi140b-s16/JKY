Saw this a while back on the show DDD and saw the reviews on yelp so finally took the plunge and went on my first yelp trip. First off...the area is a little scary. I'm not one of "those" girls. I lived in downtown LA right next to the garment district...took the subway to work in hollywood in the middle of the night. Anyways maybe I just went at a bad time where a bunch of ppl hung out outside. I go inside and grab the order form. The people there were really nice and helped me fill it out and was patient enough to help my man over my cell phone. He is such a baby doesn't like to try new things. I swear its all burgers and chicken strips. Anyways I got the bbq pork 'dilla and emerald chicken with black beans and chicken FR. He got the jerk chicken burrito and chicken diablo with jerk FR and black  beans. Everything was good, even got him to try mine which is a miracle itself. The cookies were to die for...diamond in the rough for sure. Next time though, he is going to go pick it up.
