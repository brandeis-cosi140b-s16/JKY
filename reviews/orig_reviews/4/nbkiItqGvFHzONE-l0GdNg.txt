This is my favorite new bar in Scottsdale.  The wall art is awesome and the music is always right on for my "going out" mood.  It gets super packed so if you're planning on going on a Friday or Saturday night get there early so you don't have to fuss with the lines.  It's definitely a party hard or go home type of place so be ready to boogie down if you step foot in the door.
