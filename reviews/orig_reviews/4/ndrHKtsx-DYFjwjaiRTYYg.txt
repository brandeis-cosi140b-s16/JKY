When I first heard of Spotted Donkey I thought it was going to be gross but I went there on a date with my boyfriend and we had the best waiter, told us about some of the most popular dishes they had. We went with something that that waiter told us about and it was SOOO good. Overall we had a great time, every nice environment. :)
