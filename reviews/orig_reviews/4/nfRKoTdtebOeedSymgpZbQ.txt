Sushi burritos! I ordered a "stock" burrito with soft shell crab and spicy tuna. I asked for a side of cilantro avocado sauce which worked surprisingly well with this. You can customize the burrito with whatever you want. I think this was their first day so there was a brief problem with their payment system. Had to wait a bit but they gave me a discount for the trouble, without me having to ask. Pretty good, especially for the price.
