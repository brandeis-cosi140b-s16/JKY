We went to Gonzalez Y Gonzalez our first night in the US, and didn't have a meal afterwards which came close! I'm a ood snob as well, so I heop this comes accross the way I mean it :). Great authentic Mexican, great atmosphere. The chimichumgas were fabulous , my new favourite mexican dish - margaritas unreal - and going to try and make guacolmole the way they did myself from now on! We ordered combination meals with a selection of dishes, which I'd recommend . They were also very accomodating with my daughter who didn't want food that was "too" spicy, ordinarily a bit cheeky to ask for considering where we were!I'd stay in New York New york hotle next time, just to be closer to this place and the indoor street courtyards!
