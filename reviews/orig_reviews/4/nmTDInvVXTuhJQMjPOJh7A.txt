Ok - this place is totally out of my world of existence...But a bunch of us had just volunteered with Packages from Home on S 7th Ave, and we were hungry, so we went here on a suggestion from the team.

Good service, fantastic huge food and reasonable cold beer and margs...we all agreed we would have never thought (or had been in the hood) to stop here without an intro, but we were very satisfied with Guadalajara!  Try this place if you are in the area - you won't be disappointed!
