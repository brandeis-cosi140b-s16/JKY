I believe this is the most expensive Mexican restaurant in Vegas (yes...$20 for a quesadilla) but at least I know where my money went!  

My wife and I were kindly seated in one of the cool booths which gave us a great view of those amazing wood carvings of the dead.  I'd love to know how much they actually cost.  

We were in a rush to catch Zarkana so we didn't dilly dally with any appetizers but the salsa that came with the chips was muy delicioso.  My wife ordered the "Cabo Azul" which was basically a seafood combo.  The most eyecatching thing in the combo was the lobster enchilada but it turned out to be just OK.  The grilled chile relleno which was really big and stuffed with cheese, shrimp, crab and topped with tomatillo sauce was mouthfuls of awesomeness.  They actually served the shrimp taco on a separate plate and that was very good too.  

I ordered the carnitas based on the waiter recommendation.  I didn't know what to expect since the priciest carnitas I'd ever had before this was $12.  But I was pleasantly surprised when he brought it over.  The plate featured 3 parts of the pig including ribs, tenderloin and shoulder.  SOO good!  The waiter informed me that the pork is marinated for 24 hours, deep fried and then finished in an oven.  If KFC started frying pork, it would kind of taste like this.  The was crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  

This was a very enjoyable meal overall.  We both wished we could have stayed longer.  The atmosphere, food preparation, service and strong drinks will ensure our return.
