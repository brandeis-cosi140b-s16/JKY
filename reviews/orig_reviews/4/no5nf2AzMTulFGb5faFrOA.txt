Looks can be deceiving...don't judge a book by its cover...this place looks shady but the food was excellent!

The interior is very low key. I mean it's simply tables and chairs. It's clean and I like that! 

The service was very good. Our waitress was nice and knowledgable. She gave recommendations and I was pleased with the food. 

We ordered bulgogi nachos which were amazing. They had a Korean sauce that had a perfect kick to it. The meat was tender. This dish was on point. 

We also had the flautas which were fried just right. The guacamole to dip it in was great. We tried a pork belly fusion taco as well...eh. I've had better but it was tasty. 

The meal came with complementary chips and salsa. Chips were hot and fried! 

Will return to have the nachos but want to try the other location!
