I just love Downtown Chandler! I love how it is drawing new businesses and galleries, each unique but in keeping with the classy, casual, artsy feel that is Downtown. 

El Zocalo is no exception. The restaurant is sophisticated without being pretentious. The service is friendly and owners Pam and Abed are always very approachable. Oh-- and the patio is to DIE for! The only downsides are, the prices are higher than your would usually find at other places for similar food. But sometimes it's worth paying a premium for location.
