I approach Diego from the side of the bar. My pickup line? Entirely unoriginal, but you can hear the sincerity in my voice. "Where are you from?" I ask, mystified by ethnic ambiguity. 

He laughs. "Half-Mexican, half-Hawaiian," he says in a way where I can tell he's been asked that question by many a suitor before me.

After a whirlwind of an evening with the Mexican Trail Mix Salad, topped with adobo BBQ chicken (a plethora of green things, crunchy things, fruity things, and a tangy bird), I'm left with a sudden realization. 

It may have only been one night, and sure, I only know half of Diego (and I couldn't even tell you whether or not it's his better half) but hell, I'm in it, and I'm in it to win it.
