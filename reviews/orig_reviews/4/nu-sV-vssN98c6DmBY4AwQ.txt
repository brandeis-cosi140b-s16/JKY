This place is wondrous. It's in the hood but that makes the experience all that better. Walking in you're greeted with a burst of colorful decor in a cozy little space.  It was pretty quiet for a Thursday evening which was fine by me. Margs were yummy, food was spendid and reminded me of being in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I ordered the fish, shrimp combo. To die for. The shrimp was seasoned to perfection. I will definitely be back with a group so we can spread the word on this hidden gem. I also will add that they do have a patio that is dog friendly (I'm dog obsessed). Go here. You will not be dissapointed. This place is authentic. Buenos dias.
