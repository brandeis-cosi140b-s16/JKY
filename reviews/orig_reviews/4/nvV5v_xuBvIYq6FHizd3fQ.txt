La Casa Blanca

Chandler has quickly been gaining a reputation from its popular Mexican food. I have no doubts considering the border is not far away. I have tried some of Chandler's best hole in walls, and La Casa Blanca is definitely a favorite. This fast-developing town has seen many new restaurants popping up everywhere, but for anyone looking for a fun and cultural atmosphere that serves authentic Mexican food, La Casa Blanca is the place to go
. 
The restaurant is on McQueen, just south of Chandler Heights. It's hard to miss considering it literally is a white house. There is plenty of parking, and outdoor seating that include a fire place and several flat screen TVs. One step inside takes guests on an exciting trip to Mexico. The friendly staff and vibrant colors of the interior such as the plates, murals on the walls, booths, and chairs, keep the energy exciting.

As soon as you are seated, you are given fresh tortilla chips with a traditional salsa and bean dip  that is to die for. We started off with a cheese crisp. It was excellent. My family and I shared one whole one considering it is roughly the size of a large pizza. For the entree, I chose grilled steak fajitas. I very much enjoyed when the fajitas were brought out steaming and sizzling. The fajitas are served with bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes that compliment it very well. I enjoyed this dish. The servings were big and a not too pricey. The food is definitely worth it. There were only a few desserts, but we went with fried ice cream. It's scoop of vanilla ice cream covered with crispy flakes that is deep fried and topped with chocolate sauce. The dessert is very rich, but full of flavor in every bite. 

Not all secrets can be kept hidden. La Casa Blanca is too delicious to not recommend someone going. There's no question that La Casa Blanca has become one of the most popular hidden restaurants around among locals.
