I had to edit my review because I gave a low rating the first time, but I have genuinely liked this place way more since I've come back a few times.

I will keep this short and sweet, the portions may be a little small, but most dishes are eloquently designed and they make you savor each bite.

I've had some things a little over done w too much oil (ie street taco). But there are also many dishes that are quite refreshing and made quite clean.
