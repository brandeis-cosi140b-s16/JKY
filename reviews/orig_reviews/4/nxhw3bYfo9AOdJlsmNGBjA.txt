Very, very good Mexican food.  The flavors were awesome.  The beef Tacos are soooo good and the mole sauce for the Enchilada was outstanding.  Probably the best Mexican food we've ever eaten.  Chips and Salsa were excellent too.

However, the service was something to be desired.  The hostess forgot about us at the bar so we had to follow up on being seated and our waitress was a cool and aloof and didn't follow up with tending our table very well.  The men waiters were on top of their game as we watched them tending others.  We had to call on the Bus Boy a couple of times to refresh our water glasses.

Would definitely go back for the food and hope for a different waiter/waitress.
