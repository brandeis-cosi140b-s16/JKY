We have gone here twice for dinner. Wonderful service both times! The servers are quick and attentive and food and drinks come out fast! Food is pretty tasty too. Good guac, good salsa, and good enchiladas! Their jumbo margaritas are really strong too - plan accordingly if you order one! We will definitely be back!!!
