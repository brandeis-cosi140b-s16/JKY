I ordered my dinner as take-out so that I could go back to my room and work, because I'm lame like that (no judgment).  While I waited, I tried the $2 margarita and it wasn't too shabby. I would have liked it to be a little less sweet with a lot more tequila, but hey it was $2!  The grilled fish tacos were just perfect. The portion was huge and I couldn't finish it (which made me really wish that the hotel room had a mini fridge). I might just go back tomorrow night!
