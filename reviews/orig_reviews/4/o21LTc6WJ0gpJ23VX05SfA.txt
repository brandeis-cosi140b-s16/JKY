ummmm YUM

Ok first of all, Salted Dulce de Leche milkshake?!?! HFS this was good - now onto the burgers...

One step up from fast food but still deliciously greasy.  I was fortunate enough to come  here while enduring a less than delightful hangover.  Perfect food, especially with the milkshake.  

When you're not in the mood for something gourmet, The Stand is where it's at.
