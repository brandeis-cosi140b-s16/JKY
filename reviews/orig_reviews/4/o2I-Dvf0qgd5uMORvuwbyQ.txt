It's easy to miss this place when driving by. It's such a small place, but the food is great. I ordered a wet burrito with chicken and 2 tacos (1 carne asada, 1 beef tongue). Yep, you read it right, beef tongue. All the food was fresh, authentic, and most importantly, delicious! I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
