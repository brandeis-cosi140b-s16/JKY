Four stars for the deal! My boyfriend and I shared the special they have, 3 tacos and a HUGE plate of nachos. Tacos were meh, boyfriend like them though. Nachos were yummy and super cheesy!! :D this was $14, BEYOND a good deal!! I had a bloody maria, yes Maria, they use tequila. $5. We had 4 shots of tequila at $1.85 each. So if you're on a budget, pay this place a visit you won't be disappointed! It's somewhat towards the back of Bally's. :)
