Lindo Michoacan is another West Vegas secret I will gladly expose for my yelp-ographic experience. Located at Hualapai and Flamingo, it's about a 5 minute drive from where I live and quite awesome. I think of Lindo as the perfect "step-up" from Roberto's Taco Shop, a sit down custom mexican spot. My last visit in October was really great: service was outstanding, no wait, and my food was immpeccable. I usually order the steak cilantro with extra tortillas and guacamole, perfection. Another great secret, revealed ^_^
