I have eaten here twice with friends and both times very good. I have no complaints except you may have to wait on a Saturday or Sunday night. Even then we didn't wait long.  Excellent Mexican food, I had the beef chimichanga which was absolutely delicious.  Basically everything good and the staff even though busy are warm and ready to serve.  Go check it out, and will not break your pocket$$$$.
