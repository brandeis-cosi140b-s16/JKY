Z'Tejas made me realize that I should eat brunch more often.  It's not quite breakfast, it's not quite lunch, but it comes with a slice of cantaloupe at the end.  You don't get completely what you would at breakfast, but you get a good meal!  Come on, Z'Tejas, there are ten pins in my heart, you've knocked over eight.  Won't you please pick up that spare?

I ordered their breakfast-y enchilada and it was pretty amazing.  It had an egg on top and spicy sauce and it was served with a muffin and fruit.  Enchiladas, eggs, muffins, fruits.  And iced tea.  The combination of flavors was kind of a shock going from here to there but it was fantastic and I loved it.

I've ridden past this place again and again and again.  People have spoken about it on Yelp.  People have told me how awesome it was.  Seeing it out of the corner of my eye going down mill, I never made the connection that it was there.  Because of the red, squiggly "Z" in front, I always assumed it was a cell phone company.  I don't know.  It just looked that way to me.  I'm glad I finally checked it out.

On a lazy, hungover Sunday, I'll be back.
