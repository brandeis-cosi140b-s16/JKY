Great food, nice, quiet environment, a little tough to find in a strip mall but totally worth it! The flan is outstanding, like all the tortilla options that come with dinner (they were not stingey with sides), and the staff were great.
Agree with other reviews that the salsa was just OK.  Tasty, but far too thin; nearly impossible to eat with chips.
Will definitely come back.  It's sooo much better than the other Mexican food restaurants nearby at FLW and the 101.
