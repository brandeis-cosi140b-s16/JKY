The atmosphere is nice.  I happened to enjoy the place more because a friend works there.  Free drinks always make a place more delightful.  The music is like any other place they would play at any club.   You can relax on the first floor, eat or have a few drinks at the bar.  If you want a more upbeat atmosphere, go upstairs where there's music playing and people dancing around the bar.  It isn't an exquisite place.  It's more in the area of "Margaritaville" if you've ever been there.  It's a cool little joint to check out on a weekend if you like a crowd of people.
