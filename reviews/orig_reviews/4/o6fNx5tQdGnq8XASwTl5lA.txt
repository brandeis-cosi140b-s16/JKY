Went with a group of about 10 and had a great time.  Service was pretty good, restrooms were clean and well stocked (yes, this is always something I consider while reviewing), and the heaters were working perfectly.  

One funny thing was that my friend ordered a round of shots for the group and the chick taking his order says "What is that?  What's in it?" and he states "Just tell the Bartender, they'll know".  In a rude tone with a rude face she says, "I am the Bartender."  Go look it up then sweetie.

All in all, a fun night with friends at one of the cooler Scottsdale bars I've been to.
