Went a few days ago, shortly after their opening. Did not see their sign, but we found the place by the crowd in front.  Every seat at the bar and all tables were taking. We found some spa e at the bar and ordered some drinks. No surprise, given their name, as they have a number of different margaritas. I went with the "Rustic" which was supposed to be a little spicy, but did not register on my heat index. Ordered the grilled fish tacos, which were great! The place had a good vibe to it, with hip music adding to the experience. Finally, our server, Michelle was friendly and efficient, so the staff had obviously been well trained.
