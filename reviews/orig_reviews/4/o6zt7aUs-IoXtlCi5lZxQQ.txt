The Lamb Barbacoa was one of the best dishes I've ever had in any Mexican restaurant, anywhere!   The lamb was tender and without any fat or gristle (rare for lamb dishes), and the sauce was fabulous. ALL the items in the dish were just right also.  I ordered a roasted Jalapeno on the side, which was delightful. 

The chips and salsa were some of the best also (thin chips, and medium, hot and green sauces)

The setting is cool.  We sat overlooking the 'duck pond' watching terrapins or turtles or whatever they are. A great lunchtime experience!  I wonder what it's like at night ...!

I just took at look at the 'take out' menu, and it shows that they have two other locations - one in Fountain Hills ... so I'll try the FH location next!
