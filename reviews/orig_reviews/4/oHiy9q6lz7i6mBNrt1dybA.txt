Not a bad place for upscale/fusion-y Mexican food.  The decor is beautiful and service is great.

The star of the dinner was the appetizers.
The nachos were delicious - nothing like the usual yellow cheese on triangular tortilla chips with canned jalapeno slices. This was unique and delicious with fresh cheese and two types of unique red and green chile sauces.
The chicken wigs were good - not spicy enough but good nonetheless
The taquitos were good
The chile relleno was good and HUGE
The green mac and cheese was NOT good - mushy
The posole soup was DISGUSTING - I took one sip and I returned it back to the kitchen. It tasted like a wet donkey.
The chopped salad that replaced the soup was good
beet salad was good
calamari steak was tender but I felt lack flavor.
Short ribs were huge and delicious
