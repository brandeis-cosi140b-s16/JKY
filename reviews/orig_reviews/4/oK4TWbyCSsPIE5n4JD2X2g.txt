Elmer's Taco Shop is one of my favorite spots in the East Valley area to get Mexican food.  It has ample seating both indoors and outdoors and the prices are very affordable with Chandler HS across the street (but don't go during the high school lunch hour, the line is out the door.) Definitely try the strips  or the cheesy tortilla with beef. Amazing!
