HUGE portions and great service. had the pulled pork and a chicken taco. both were very good. Not your typical flour tortilla, more similar to what you get a papusa on, very soft and clearly home made.

Wont be disappointed but remember one order of nachos is enough for two people. 
look for their yelp deal free chips and salsa !
