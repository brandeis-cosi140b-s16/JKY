Alas someone felt the need to tinker with what was a near perfect establishment. The awesome tacos are no more--no jerk chicken taco, no curry shrimp taco, no shrimp diablo taco,no chorizo taco, .....you get the picture.

This place is still above average, but it is more of a dinner sized, and priced, entree menu now. 

Bummer.
