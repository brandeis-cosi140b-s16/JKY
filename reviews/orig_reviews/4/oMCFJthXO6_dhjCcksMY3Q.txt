I think the food here is remarkable and very authentic.  You can start off with a wonderful variety of salsas and chips.  I ordered the special, which was a lot of food and absolutely delicious.  The ingredients are all fresh, everything tastes great.

The service is first rate and the staff is friendly.

I can't wait to go again.
