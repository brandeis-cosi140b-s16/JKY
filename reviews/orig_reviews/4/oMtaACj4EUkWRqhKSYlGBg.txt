I am definitely a fan.  Their tacos are big and very tasty.  I really love the steak and the al pastor tacos.  Their meat tastes so good and this is hard to find at most taco shops here in Las Vegas.  With 2 tacos you are good and the tacos are served with beans, cheese, 2 corn tortillas, and if you want at an extra cost, sour cream and guacamole.  It's my favorite taco shop with Tacos el Gordo :)
They also have fruit juices that are very good, the mango is delicious.
