As I entered into Chipotle Mexican Grill I was welcomed by a 18 person line. I could tell everyone was super excited to try this super authentic Mexican food from Colorado. 

I finally got to order and was overwhelmed by the amount of ways one could eat beans, cheese, saut√©ed vegetables, a plethora of meat choices, and several different sauce types. I really appreciated the fact that what I was about to consume was GMO free, called out on the menu. I decided I would try a way called a burrito, where these ingredients are wrapped up in this thing called a tortilla (which is heated up on this tortilla warmer). This was my first experience ordering anything like this since Subway, so I was able to make choices relatively quickly as it's sort of similar. 

I watched local police that were tall fill up the ice maker for a short employee; heartwarming. 

I checked out and got a Coke, burrito, guacamole (invented in Colorado as well), and a side of chips which are like a smaller fried version of the tortilla my burrito was wrapped in all for $13.   

Really impressed - I know I'll visit again when I'm in town.
