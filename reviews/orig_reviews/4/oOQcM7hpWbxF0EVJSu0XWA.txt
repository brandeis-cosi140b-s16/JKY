I ate the Tacos de Carne...and they were great.

Any of the negative reviews here were about price and portions.  But my $8.00 tacos (which came with French Fries or Salad) were decently portioned, and the price was fair.

My visit was on a Sunday afternoon, so the ambiance wasn't exactly perfect.

The backdoor entrance was strange...you have to walk through the restaurant to the hostess podium.  

But overall, good food.
