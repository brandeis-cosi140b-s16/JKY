When I moved to Scottsdale from SoCal, one of my BIGGEST fears was that I wouldn't be able to find the kind of Mexican food that I like (seriously). 

People are always super opinionated (myself included) about where to go for the best Mexican food and in the past I have been disappointed in most of the recommendations I have received.

While I have yet to venture out and find a taqueria worthy of replacing Taqueria de Anda (Santa Ana, CA), I have found a good substitute for my beloved La Capilla (Huntington Beach, CA). 

When you walk in, you are greeted with kitschy "mexican" decor. Their hostesses are efficient and we've always been seated quickly.

The food is great. One of my biggest pet peeves is when restaraunts lack consistency. When I go to Macayos I know exactly what I am going to get... every time. 

Everything that I have tried (so far) has been great. My favorites: Grande Chimichanga de Macayo with chicken or carnitas, tortilla soup and their green chili corn tamale... mmm

They also make great drinks and have a great happy hour, all their apps are 1/2 price. My fave is their green chili corn tamale bites, served with a side of baja sauce. Have you tried the baja sauce people? It's (jalapeno cream cheese I think?) soo bad but soo good.

I know a lot of people probably have mixed feelings about this place because it's a "chain" restaurant... but to me it just doesn't feel like it. It's nowhere near what I would consider "chain" Mexican food to be: El Torito... They aren't in the same category. All I have to say is don't knock it til' you try it.

My only complaint would be the wait staff (the bartenders are great)... Don't get me wrong, the service has (almost) always been WAY better than average. However, most aren't too friendly and a few are just downright odd. But, I won't hold that against them or the restaurant.
