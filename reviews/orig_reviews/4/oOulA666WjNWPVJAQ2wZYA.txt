Highly recommended for Latin American food, but make reservations.  We went for dinner on 4th of July.   The dining area was pretty dark, but I later realized it was because we were outside and our eyes needed time to adjust.  I loved the black chandeliers everywhere.  Very lively atmosphere.

I started off with the Watermelon Basil mojito.  Very refreshing!  The table next to us had ordered the tableside guacamole so although we had chips, salsa and guacamole for a snack earlier in the day, we had to get some.   We ordered medium spice and it had a good kick to it.  They do make it in front of you and for 2 people, it was a whole lot of guacamole!  

For appetizers, we ordered the Duck Confit Empanadas, which ended up sounding better than it tasted.  It was not the pie crust dough like most empanadas.  Instead, it was like crispy wontons.  The crust was overcooked and it came with a sweet sauce so I felt like I was eating Chinese food instead of Latin American.  That was a disappointment!

By then, we were pretty full so although we ordered two types of tacos, we ended up canceling one.  We just had the Mahi Mahi tacos which were Tecata battered with a nice sauce.  It came with 3 street size tacos.  It was delicious.  The table next to us ordered the Pork Shoulder tacos which serves for 2.  That looked good as well as it came with a whole chunk of braised pork.  If we were hungry, we would have ordered that.  

Overall, service was great.  Enjoyed most of the food and drinks.  If it wasn't for the duck empanadas, I would have given them 5 stars.
