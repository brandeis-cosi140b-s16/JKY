Talk about branding! 

Even if you have short term memory loss you'd know you were at a place called Diablo's because everything there says it.

This is a great mexican restaurant for white folk who can't stand the heat. They must look hard for jalapenos that have no bite for their poppers. Their salsa? It tastes great, but gets bland after a bit since there's no heat to it. 

I ordered the pulled chicken burrito which was very good, but start half way in where it gets really good. Again, it got bland though, so I asked for hot sauce and started liberally pouring it. The downside to this is that I really really like the flavors of mexican food and hot sauce just covers the flavor - I want the spice cooked in dernit!

As always in Las Vegas, the staff was showing a fair amount of skin which slightly compensates for food with no spice.
