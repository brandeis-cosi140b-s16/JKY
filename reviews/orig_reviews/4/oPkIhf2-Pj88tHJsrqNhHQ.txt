Came here on a Saturday afternoon to go meat browsing aka check out guys on the strip.

We sat on the balcony outside, ordered a pitcher of blackberry mojitos with a side of chips and guac. 

The people watching here is awesome, a great place just to kick back if you are over the pool scene for the day and just want to get your drink on.
