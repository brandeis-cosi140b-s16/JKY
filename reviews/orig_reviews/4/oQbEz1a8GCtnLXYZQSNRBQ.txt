I know I give more four star reviews of establishments than I probably should, and I'm trying to break myself of the habit, but Los Olivos deserves a solid four stars in my book.  Like others have said, the food isn't over-the-top amazing, but its solid Mexican and its solid consistent.  I've had enchiladas (fantastic), fajitas (fantastic), and multiple times, the guacamole (fantastic).  

What is over-the-top is the architecture, the character, and the somewhat-rustic feel to the slightly-wacky dining room(s).  While it is not completely clear from the exterior of the Los Olivos structure, the interior reveals a Xanadu of sorts, no ceiling angle alike, no wall length perpendicular to another.  Floor tiles show signs of decades of foot traffic, and chairs reveal evidence of many meals enjoyed.  In a town where most establishments are half the age of your favorite pair of jeans, I find the comfort of Los Olivos to put me at ease.

On the weekends make sure to arrive early, or you will be asked to wait for what could be more than an hour, and its not a comfortable place to sit and have a drink while waiting, so plan accordingly.  If you like Mariachi music, give them a call ahead of time and find out when the strumming goes down.  My last time there the band set up within arms length of our table, and while some might have found this to be annoyingly distracting, my party used it as a great excuse to kill the small talk and let the guitars, vocal chords, and flavours do the talking...

Los Olivos = Love the Place.  Mexican Food = I would marry it if I could.
