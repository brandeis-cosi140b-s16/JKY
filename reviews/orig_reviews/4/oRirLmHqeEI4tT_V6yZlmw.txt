Amazing late night mexican food!  Me and a couple of buddies would hit this place almost every night on our way home from the casino.  They got to know us and knew what we ordered.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though. It's a favorite of the 20 something crowd heading back to tempe after a long night of bad decisions up in scottsdale, at least they finished strong.
