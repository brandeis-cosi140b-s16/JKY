I just went here tonight and I do not know why I haven't been here before! The place was really inventive with the fillings for the enchiladas. They had corn bread and mashed potatoes and short rib and all kinds of deliciousness. I got enchiladas like I've never had before. Short rib and mashed potato with christmas style sauce (red and greed), a fried egg, slaw, pico, cheese, ohhh my, it was delicious. Also got the guac, which was wonderful! I got two enchiladas and still have plenty left for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely be back!! (I had a taste of the cornbread...and I need more!)
