We've been going to this place for years.  Very tasty drinks and food.  And the atmosphere is really great with the decor and exterior patios.  Decorator details will have you looking at every inch of the place.  Once the food arrives you won't be disappointed.  Stuffed quesidillas are always a hit and my husband never deviates from the carne asada.  Downside is that it is always busy so you always have to wait.  But worst part is once seated it is really loud.  You're really packed in so hard to carry on a conversation if you're with a larger party.  Try for patio seating if the weather permits.
