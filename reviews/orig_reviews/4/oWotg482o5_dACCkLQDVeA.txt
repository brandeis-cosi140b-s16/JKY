While at the fashion show mall my family and I debated between Maggiano's and El Segundo Sol. The music at El Segundo instantly won us over. As Mexicans, we enjoyed the Mana that was playing. Unfortunately, as soon as we sat down the music changed to the likes of Jason Derulo and Lil Wayne fans.

The food, however, was delicious and tasted pretty authentic. The chips and salsa were amazing. All three salsas were delicious. The parentals ordered the guacamole which I'm guessing they loved because they devoured it. 

 I opted for the Chicken Tacos which were served with Mexican Rice and Black beans. Let me just say, yuum! The tortillas were served rolled up in a tin, which is pretty convenient. 

Mom ordered the Chile Relleno. When it comes to Chile Relleno's she's very critical because "none are better than the one's she makes." But, she seemed to love it. 

I'm giving it 4 stars for the not so Mexican music that played through out our visit. It is a "Mexican" restaurant after all. I believe this restaurants belongs to the same owners as Mon Ami Gabi. As a themed restaurant, I expected the music to follow.
