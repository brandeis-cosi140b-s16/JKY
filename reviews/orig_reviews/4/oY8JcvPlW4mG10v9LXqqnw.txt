Been to Downtown Nacho Daddy several times with rave reviews, we were on the Westside in Summerlin and decided to give this location a try.  Food was consistently good most likely because all recipes are made in their commissary kitchen.  We came during a late lunch so there was no one in the restaurant.  Food came out in minutes since we were the only ones in the dining area.   Our Nachos were delicious, the chicken tenders for the kids  did not look as fresh.  The chicken strips were an odd shape with a unique processed taste.  

I will always be a fan of Nacho Daddy I think it is a great concept.  One of my favorite features about the Summerlin location is the self serve craft beer area.  You can purchase a gift type cardin $20 increments and draft your own glass of beer.  They have many great selections of local and regional brews available.  Insert you card and pull the lever and your credits will be deducted form your card.  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT??!!! Great Idea give it a try.  I have seen a similar setup in wine dispensing before.
