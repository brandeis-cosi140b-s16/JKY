If I were to give this a letter grade, I'd give it a B+ since I did enjoy most of the items that we ordered. We came here last night for christmas eve

The decor was so cool and chic! I give it a A+ because I loved how it was glittery, but not over the top. They had this wall that looked like bubble gum. but was actually velvet or something material.

The drinks were fun. I had a Spanish Fly, it was really delicious and not too sweet. Everyone else had beer and wine.

The roasted peanuts were so good and had spiciness in it. It was really good.

We decided to order guac and guac with crab. They both were delicious and generous with the crab meat. My mom and I split the octopus ceviche which was really good. Our friend ordered this sushi-like dish, Hiramasa ceviche, that he shared with us, it was delicious and fresh-tasting. When I go back, I would definitely order that again.

Mom and I split the Los Hungos huaraches dish which was mushroom, it was delicious and warm. Dad had the short rib huaraches which I found a better dish and even more tasting. We also had the carinitas tacos which were good, but not out of this world.

We also tried the Mexico City Quesadilla which was delicious flavor, but came a bit cold so we told the service staff and they were very appreciative of us telling them. 

Overall, it was delicious and I would go back!
