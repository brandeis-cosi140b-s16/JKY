I love their salsa. It's different and interesting. It's almost a mix of pico and corn put together. Atmosphere is nice and pleasant. Parking can sometimes be hard to find but it's worth it. It seems like they always have a crowd but that goes to show you how good their food is! I got their tacos and thought they were awesome. They have a nice selection of food to try.
