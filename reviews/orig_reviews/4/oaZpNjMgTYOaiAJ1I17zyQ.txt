Attention margarita lovers- you MUST order the Chambord Margarita. Delicious (and dangerous) and oh so tasty!

The restaurant is always busy because it is at Fashion Square but the service is always prompt. The patio/bar area upstairs is open seating so you can usually snag a table up there even during busy times.

The cornbread they bring to your table is really yummy but sometimes you have to ask for it to make sure that they bring you some.

I have had a large variety of of things on the menu and never been disappointed. The seasonal menus they offer are great as well and i definitely recommend branching out and ordering off of that menu every once in a while.

Definitely our "go to" place for drinks and dinner.
