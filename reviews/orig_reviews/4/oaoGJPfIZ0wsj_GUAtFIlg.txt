We came here on a Thursday afternoon and ordered 
1. Super burrito - 14
2. Enchilladas - 11
For $5 (Used the $10 Groupon for $20) 

- Horrible parking! Luckily, after a 2nd round, someone pulled out so we swept in. It looks like that other customers parked on street. 
- Busy. We came during lunch hour and had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. 
- Groupon lunch special was only valid for lunch entrees. Cheapest Lunch entree was 11, so the value of actual $20 is diminished. 
- Love the Chips and Dip! Dip comes with both salsa and beans! This is the first Mexican restaurant where they gave beans for free! 
- Large portions. 
- Fast and friendly service. Everything went smoothly. 
- Super burrito and Enchillada were satisfying. Lots of beef. 
- Comparable to Legit SoCal Mexican fast-food (Pepe, Molca salsa, etc...) but you get the whole dining in experience.
