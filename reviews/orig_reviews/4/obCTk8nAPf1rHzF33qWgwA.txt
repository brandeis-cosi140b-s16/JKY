Decided to try this new restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's new job! I love Eastern European food and this hit the spot! I had the beer stroganoff and my boyfriend had the garlic shrimp. We also had the hummus with ground beef and it was delicious! Definitely a must try when you come here. Just a heads up, the restaurant has a very relaxed European feel. The service does take a little longer than most but the food is worth the wait! Plus, the waiters are really nice and check in to make sure everything's ok. We'll be back with friends next time!
