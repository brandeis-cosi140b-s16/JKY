My son and I work I'm the area and we have been waiting for this place to open so when we saw the now open sign we went!!
We were not disappointed service is on point Christian was our server and he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome!   food is good not what I expected not authentic but defenetly good, the taquiza (mix seafood and meat) was great flavorful and enough for two, sangria was refreshing and bean dip was flavorful! We will try it again and again!
