I checked this place out for the first time the other day and the margaritas were amazing! I highly recommend the habanero margarita. Tacos are delicious too. I wish I had more of an appetite to try the rest of the menu. Service was great! Mimi was our server and she was so funny and really went above and beyond. I will be back and I will recommend this place to others.
