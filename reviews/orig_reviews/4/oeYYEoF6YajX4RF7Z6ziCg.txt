I've been coming here for the last 6 or so years, in my neighborhood.  Always tasty...I've had everything from the cheese crisps to the enchiladas and burritos.   Start out w/ the chips and dip--the red sauce is spicy and very good.  I like the green also.  Inside or on the patio, nice decor.  Service can be a bit slow depending on the time of day, but we always got what we ordered.
