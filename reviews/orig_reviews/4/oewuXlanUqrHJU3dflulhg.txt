We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. We had a restaurant.com gift certificate and had to spend a minimum of $50 to use it. This wasn't easy for the two of us since alcohol is excluded, but we got the queso (best. queso. ever.), the combo tacos, and the combo #3 (enchiladas). We enjoyed everything - though the carnitas taco was a little dry and lacked flavor. Would definitely visit again!
