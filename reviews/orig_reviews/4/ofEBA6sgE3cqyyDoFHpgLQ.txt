Solid cheap mexican place close to my work. 

they have great salads (surprisingly) with rice, avocado, meat, romaine, tomatos and a salsa like dressing. 

The burritos are okay.  I had a steak burrito, the carne asada was decent but a bit to mushy for my taste. 

they heap guac on their tacos which is good. the el pastor is not the best i've had, but the big tacos are decent for the price. 

LOVE their agua frescas... all are delicious, yes even the spinach. Good place to go if you're looking for a quick fix, but obv does not compare to dirty street tacos from the streets of LA or SD.
