Our food was excellent.  My boyfriend had a pork dish and I had a combination plate.  The fried ice cream dessert was so delicious.

The service was not the best, but manager Julie made up for it.  We were seated at a table and asked to move about 10-15 minutes later because a large party was coming in.  After other frustrations with our hotel, this was an annoyance for us.  At our new table the staff forgot to bring me water and then later on in the meal someone took the salsa away as I had just grabbed several chips to dip in to it.  Julie did get us a round of drinks and dessert.  What I appreciate even more is that she listened to our frustrations and made us feel valued.  I will definitely come back again.
