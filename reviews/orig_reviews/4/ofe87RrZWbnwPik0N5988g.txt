The restaurant is in the clarendon hotel - where we stayed for 2 nights.  I'm thrilled that such a great restaurant was in our hotel.  It had a cool vibe and atmosphere yet it was very casual.  the service was good - nothing to complain about. the food was delicious! the first day my husband and I shared the ceviche with tortilla chips and a house salad with citrus dressing.  both were so fresh and yummy.  the tortilla chips were the best I ever had.  I ordered halibut tacos and my hubby got the pork and carne asada tacos. both were yummy as well.  they all had pico de gallo and their homemade citrus guac.  we cooled off from the AZ heat w/ classic margaritas - they were a little sweet and would have been better with a splash of GM but overall were okay.

the next morning we had breakfast there and discovered the 2nd best pancakes!  (the best pancakes are at mama's on washington in san francisco). they were made with sour cream so it made them super fluffy on the inside and crispy on the edges. I could eat these all day.
