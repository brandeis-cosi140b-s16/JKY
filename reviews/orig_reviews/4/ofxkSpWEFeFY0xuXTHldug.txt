Holy Guacamole I am in L-O-V-E with theirs! First off you get a ton so you wont end up with guac-envy if the table next to you hasn't finished theirs (hey it happens). Second of all it's fresh and made at your table with love - well maybe not but it really tastes that way.

Next we had the garlic shrimp which was mind altering good. I could have drank the delicious sauce it was swimming in...mmm. 

Last we had the wild mushroom flautas which were a bit greasy and disappointing compared to the other two fabulous appetizers. I wouldn't get this next time.

We had two drinks - the Sangria which was pretty delicious. It was fizzy though which I haven't experienced before- but in a good way. The agave margaritas were all natural and quite refreshing as well. 

We then decided to step it up a notch and have a shot of tequila (rough week!) we asked our server for a recommendation - he inquired about a price range and then came up with something that suited both our tastes and wallets. We were told they have a large selection if you're a tequila connoisseur. 

Our server was friendly although at times MIA- we did have to track him down for drink numero dos. He also charged my card three times ($48, $66, $75) and never told me about the two voids. The next day when I went to check my account the charges were pending so they withheld that money. A quick call to the manager and my bank took care of that. I had wished the server told me that up front. 

I will be going back for the guacamole and shrimp for sure. This is a great option for uptown eats albeit slightly pricey when compared to other Mexican options in the area.
