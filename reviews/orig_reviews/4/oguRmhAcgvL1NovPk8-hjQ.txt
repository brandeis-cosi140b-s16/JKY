Loved this venue! Definitely a great little intimate place to hear live music and up and coming bands. The staff are all really friendly and the room has good acoustics for the type and scale of performers brought to stage. The only thing that felt a little weird were the bleachers in the back... It did feel a little high school gymnasium, BUT it also created seating for a lot more people. So functionally, the bleachers were great; aesthetically, not so much.

The drinks were also reasonably priced.  Didn't try the food, but the churros that came by smelled great!

I'll def look for another event here.
