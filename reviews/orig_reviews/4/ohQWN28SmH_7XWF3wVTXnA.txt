Get the Michelada to drink. It truly is more than just a tecate in a glass, it has a spiced/salted rim with fresh squeezed lime juice and some other glorious  liquid in it that I am unsure of. 

the small portions here are awesome, which makes this place perfect for late night drinks/snackiez.

also the guacamole for $7 is worth it-- it has fruit in it or something.

on the downside, shitty music, it's obvious that one of the wait staff has their mini ipod on shuffle or something, and the service kinda blows. Also, cheap decor, but really nice lighting.

I am really pretentious (obviously) but I like this place a lot.
