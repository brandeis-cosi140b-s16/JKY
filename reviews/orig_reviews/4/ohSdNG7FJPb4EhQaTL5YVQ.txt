Came her with a friend who really likes this place. I was hesitant as I saw on 3.5 star review on Yelp* and I like only 4 star. I must admit though, I am a fan! I think it's a SOLID 3.5, but I'll give the extra .5 point because I enjoyed my taco alot.
I wasn't super crazy about the maui onion rings. I LOVED that they offered them, but they were too greasy for me. I know, I know, it's OR (as I call them), of course they are greasy. NO, not always! Anyway, got the grilled fish taco with the Basi? teriyaki veggies. Very very good. Wish I got 2 taco's and no OR. My friend got the platter with rice and beans and that looked fabu. I will definitely try that next time. I liked that they use green leaf lettuce instead of ice berg for my taco. The veggies were tasty, I enjoyed very much. It's a cool atmosphere place. Lots of surf stuff and eclectic decorations. It's a combo, fast foodish but casual dining place. You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you when it's done. I'd love to go to the one on the beach in CA for the real deal experience. Overall, good food, good price and good service. No complaints here!
