Do go here for their half off wings special during happy hours and after 11pm. I've never tried anything here besides their wings. But trust me, the wings are good enough to have me keep coming back for more. 

My favorite flavor is Southwestern--just the right amount of garlic, lime and cilantro. You get to choose between three levels of spiciness, but I usually go for the medium level. The amount of sauce is just right. The wings are crispy and meaty. I highly recommend if you are a wings fan and eating on a budget.
