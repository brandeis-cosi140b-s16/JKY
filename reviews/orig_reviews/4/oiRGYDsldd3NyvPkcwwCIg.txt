Nice and SUPER clean restaurant, the service was exceptional, marie was very nice. I ordered the carne asada tacos and gordita combo with chips and salsa and a drink. The carne was top quality 5/5 and the meal was huge! I think next time I can just order a la carte and be perfectly satisfied. Chips and the salsa was just ok.
