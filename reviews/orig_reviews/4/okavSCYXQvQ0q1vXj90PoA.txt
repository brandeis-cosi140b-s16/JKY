We've been several times now and have been very pleased each time.  They have some typical "American" Mexican food, some Sonoran and some other unique Mexican dishes from other regions which all have been well received by us and our co-diners.  It is a little noisy and the A/C can be a little fickle if you are right under a vent (but hey with AZ, i'd rather have cold A/C vs. none)
