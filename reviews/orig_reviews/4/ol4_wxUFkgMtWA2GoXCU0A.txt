Reminds me of my travels to Guadalajara with all its grilled meats, little spicy sauces and freshly juiced veggies and fruit.  The portions are huge, service is attentive, quick and very efficient.  These folks are really on it, no mistakes on take away orders.  I hate when I get the take away home and something is wrong or missing.  There has to be something said about their professionalism, none of the staff stand around talking amongst themselves, they are very impressive and I for one really appreciate it.  
I absolutely love the fresh juices, especially the watermelon, reminds me of Shanghai.  I go here just for the juices, but usually end up with some tacos or the Del Rey, a mongo quesadilla, which 1/2 usually has to go home with me.  The torta's are mexican style sandwiches filled with Mexican ingredients such as chorizo, which add quite a bit of flavor and wasn't greasy as in some other dishes I've had elsewhere.  Served with potato chips, just like in Mexico.  Love the avocado, not commercial packed frozen guacamole, but real sliced avo's.  Sunnyslope is safe, unless you are looking for something you shouldn't be.  I'm a single female who drives a lexus and I go.  And yea they are Mexicans--thats why the food is so good and real.  It's not the conventional commercialized crap that most of us have gotten use to.  So go if your brave enough to walk from your car to the door and enjoy a little piece of Mexico right here in bland America.
Okay, here is my question: Why doesn't the US have juice bars?  
In all of my travels through South America, China, Thailand i've been able to get my favorite concoction, carrot, beet, apple & ginger.  Maybe cuz we don't really grow that much or do most people self juice at home.  Just my musings to justify my laziness of preparing juice at home.
