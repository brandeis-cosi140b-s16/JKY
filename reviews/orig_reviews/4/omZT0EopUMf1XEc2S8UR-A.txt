Great patio, good happy hour, love the carnitas tacos.  Good drink selection... interesting options... had some jalenpeno margarita of some sorts...  Nice upscale place with a very friendly comfortable atmosphere.  Located in Scottsdale quarter just east of Brio... if you turn in the parking garage off Greenway parkway it is just to the left of the parking garage entrance.
