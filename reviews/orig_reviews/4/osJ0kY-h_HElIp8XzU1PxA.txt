Located in a strip mall next to the Encore, there is limited parking, but most people walk to this location.  It's very busy and you need to be experienced to get what you want. It's like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi.  You have to know what line to get into for which type of food.  One line for asada, one for spicy pork and a line for the rest.  So, if you want one of each, you need to get into three lines. 

I had 4 spicy pork tacos. The meat is on the spindle like gyro meat.  It's got good flavor and they give you a lot of meat on two small street taco tortillas. They also have some homemade sauces and garnishes that make them really good.  I think they make the tortillas on the premise because I see them making them, but I can't be sure the ones I ate were from that same process.  I can't see them making every tortilla because they sell a bunch.  There is some seating indoors and a lot of table outdoors under a canopy.  I don't think I would make a special trip to eat these. I would wait in line if I happened to be the area.
