I've been going to Round Corner occasionally for drinks since earlier this year (love the Bloody Maria), but only just got around to trying the food yesterday. 

My friend and I went for Sunday brunch shortly after they opened (11AM), and had no trouble grabbing seats right away at the bar. We started, of course, with Bloody Marias while looking over the menu--they're on special for $4 during brunch hours, which is a great deal. 

I eventually settled on the Brisket Hash. I love savory breakfasts and this seemed like a solid choice. The dish consisted of soft, salty potatoes topped with tender and flavorful brisket, bacon, a fried egg, onions, and cilantro. I added a dash of hot sauce for some spice, but overall the dish was packed with flavor. The portion size was perfect for the price ($9) and left me satisfied but not uncomfortably full as brunches so often do. 

I've always been happy with the drinks here, and now that I've enjoyed the brunch, I need to make it back to try the regular menu sometime soon.
