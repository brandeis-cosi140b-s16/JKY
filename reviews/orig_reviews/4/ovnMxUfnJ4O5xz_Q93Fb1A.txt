First off, love the decor here! It's not a very typical Mexican decor but more along the trendy side of the tracks, which I am perfectly OK with.  I mean once you've seen one sombrero hanging on the wall, you've seen the all right?

I had the Mexican Cobb Salad and it was really good and not all together that different from a Cobb salad you would get at a non-mexican restaurant honestly.  Looking back I wish I would have gotten something more authentic but meh....maybe next time.

Service was great, very attentive and polite.  

The bar area (although unvisited by me, other than to say hello to a friend) seemed really cool and looked like a great spot for an after work cocktail or two.  The location of this place lends itself to a great social setting given the perfect location of the patio.  It's right at the heart of the Epicentre and so people watching (my favorite sport) is pretty fantastic here.
