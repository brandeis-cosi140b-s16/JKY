So I decided to return and give it a second chance. My food didn't blow me out of the water the first time I went, but was pretty good and I've been having some serious cravings for carne asada lately.  I went with the Torta de Carna Asada and HOLEY MEXICAN SANDWICH BATMAN!!! The absolute best torta I've ever had!! The bread was super soft and flaky, had the carne asada (which was much better this time..and two days later when I went again...sssh don't tell my wife) guacamole and I think onions.  Overall, THAT'S the item I'll go back for....probably more than my wife and doctor would sanction....but I won't tell if you don't tell.....
