This is The Spot when you're craving authentic homestyle Mexican food and great hospitality! 

Simple yet flavor filled menu!  Loved Rito's beef Red Chile burrito, enchilada style! Might be the best red Chile on the Westside! Meet was tender and succulent. Refried beans were creamy and delish! Guacamole, chips and salsa were too salty for me, but still good!  This is my spot when I'm this deep on the Westside!
