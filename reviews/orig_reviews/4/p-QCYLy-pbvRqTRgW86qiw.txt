Very enjoyable.

 I had the SD chop salad which I thought was quite good, my companions got the fish tostadas and cobb salad and they both enjoyed their meals as well.

The high point of the lunch was that we ordered the nachos as a starter, they were excellent. 

Service was good, decor is nice, all-in-all a place to which I'll definitely return.
