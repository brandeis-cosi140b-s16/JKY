My husband and I went here for a club meet up on a Tuesday night.  The place was packed!  My husband ordered one of the sandwiches and I ordered two tacos and a side order of chips and salsa.  It took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  Although the food was good and really cheap, I will probably pick a less busy time to go here.  It wasn't really worth the 45 minute wait.
