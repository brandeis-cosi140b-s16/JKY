Was looking for a place to stop in for a drink on Friday so I went to El Hefe again.  First 2 time were a good experience so I went back.  

This time I was stopping in a little late, about 10pm, so did not eat this time.  But I would have if I was earlier.  Greeted again by Emily and her amazing smile.  She is definitely one of the reasons I come back.  Emily and the margaritas.  

Once again Emily was charming and helpful.  Never waited too long for a refill.  She was always on the spot and great to talk to.  And also incredibly beautiful!!

Next time the margaritas are calling me, I'll be back.
