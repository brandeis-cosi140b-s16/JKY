Great experience! I got the Para la Mesa which is a sliced new york strip steak, habenaro shrimp, and sliced marinated chicken breast fajita platter. So much food. The flavors were amazing and the heat was perfect for those who love spicy food. The portions were huge! I would definitely recommend this dish! The only reason i put a 4 instead of a five is because i felt the wait staff was extremely unattentive which was a little disappointing. All in all i had a great time.
