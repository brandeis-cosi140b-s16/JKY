Finally! I made it! I could just kick myself for waiting so long to try mama marias, especially since its down the street for my house! This place is legit. The food is good the prices are cheap and the people are friendly. It's a small spot nothing fancy, maybe a little old and worn on the inside, but the food makes up for all of that. My friend and I shared this Mexican platter meal, it was $20 and it included one cheese enchilada, one chile rellano, a piece of carne asada, a small chimichanga and rice and beans of course. Seriously where else can you get all of that for $20?? And I never like chile rellano's but this one was delicous!! Plus they give you fresh tostadas and salsa that were really yummy too. I am definitley returning and adding a margarita next time!
