I was referred to this place by a shuttle bus driver while traveling to Arizona. This place specializes in New Mexican style food. I was warned the food is very hot and spicy and it was but not unbearable. I tried their signature dish adovada ribs based on a recommendation from our driver. When they came out I was surprised their was no bone and then u realized they are country style ribs so they don't come on the bone. This made it easier to eat. The meat was very tender. The sauce was spicy but flavorful. It came with a fresh hot tortilla. 

The place is pretty popular and the inside was packed when we arrived. We didn't want to wait a long time for seating so we opted for outdoor seating. It was cold that night so they put us near s flamed heater however the fire burned out and they could not relight it so that was a let down. The servers were nice. Overall a decent experience.
