Close to where I live and the food is nothing but delicious. Only the second time here but nothing like tamales to warm your stomach on a cold evening!! Service is fast, food comes out hot and the service seems to be pretty fast. It's kinda like a hole in the wall Mexican joint that serves a purpose. Decor is everywhere but good to watch games at and relax.
