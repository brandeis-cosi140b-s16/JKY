Always sort of busy at this location, their sweet ports is delicious. I like watching the lady make fresh tortillas while I wait in line. I ordered the nachos and it must have been the special of the day because all the employees started chanting a nacho song. Which in my opinion is kind of weird and I know if I worked there I would be like wtf again? Lol overall a good place to eat.
