Good inexpensive seafood in Gilbert, AZ??? What????  It's true.  This place is legit.  Try the fish tacos with shark,  Calimari Fries(yeah the thick cut calimari battered and fried) ,  Clam chowder,  Fish and chips.  Kind of weird you get beans and rice with some dishes.  Slaw with others. 

Seafood enchilada was not bad.  I don't drink but, buddy said there was good selection of beers.  He seemed to enjoy the two he tried. 

Good seafood for a reasonable price.   Didn't try any of the non-seafood stuff.
