Last night's Flamenco Night was a gas. Great crowd, Prickly Pear Margaritas, Four Peaks Hop Knot on tap, and a wonderful patio for enjoying the night breeze. Guacamole and chips sounds like entry level fare but Gallo Blanco's is on its own level. I'd probably wear the guacaomle as war paint it's so fresh and flavorful. I can also speak for the carne asada tacos, which are pretty good for Gringo Mexican. Next time I will try the burger and maybe a white sangria, which looks amazing with its chunks of fruit floating at the top.
