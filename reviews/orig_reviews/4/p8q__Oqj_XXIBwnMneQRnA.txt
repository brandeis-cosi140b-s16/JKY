I was craving authentic Mexican food tonight and have been wanting to try out this place that I found on Yelp in Avondale, Arizona a while back. It's located in a small shopping center and looks and feels like a family owned restaurant where everyone knows everyone. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. There was not anything exciting about the decor and the lighting was very bright. This is def not a date night place but for sure where u wanna be if you want to satisfy your mexican food cravings:) The staff were all very friendly, helpful with suggestions and welcoming. We ordered all of our food at the check-out counter then sat ourselves. The girl at the register gave us some really great suggestion that were consistent with the recommendations I reviewed on Yelp. They gave us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips that were drizzled with bean puree and had gorganzala cheese sprinkled over the top and four different homemade salsas to choose from.  Within 7 minutes our food was served to us. We ordered the carne asada tacos that were cooked to perfection with a lot of flavor! We also ordered the enchiladas, which came with a choice of cheese, beef, chicken or pork and rice and beans. We chose 1 cheese and 2 chicken and the both were delicious!
