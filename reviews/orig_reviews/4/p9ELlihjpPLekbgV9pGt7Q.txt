I came here about a couple days ago. The place overall Is fairly small but their food was great! I can honestly say out of all the Mexican restaurants here in Las Vegas this is one you definitely need to try out, they have real authentic Mexican food! Also the carnitas there are amazing! :) the only downfall was the distance, but other then that I will most definitely be back!
