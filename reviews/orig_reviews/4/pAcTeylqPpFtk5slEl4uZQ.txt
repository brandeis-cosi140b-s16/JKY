I don't know why everyone's giving this place such bad reviews. I sat at the bar and had a great time the bartenders are really friendly and food came out quick.... Yes food was mediocre. . But it was the experience that will keep me coming back.! Mmm maybe more people should sit at the bar then tables ;)
