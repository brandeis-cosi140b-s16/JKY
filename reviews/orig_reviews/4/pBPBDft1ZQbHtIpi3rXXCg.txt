I'm all about some Los Favs.  I usually get the California Asada burrito which is super legit, and I'm actually a fan of their fish tacos too (not for everyone) and not as awesome as their burritos/dillas but they are good especially with their green hot sauce.  Also the breakfast burritos are off the hook, everyone I know loves those.  Plus the best part is it is cheap, quick and close by.
