A really great taco place! I went here with my family a week or two ago. The atmosphere is nice and casual, but it's still okay to wear a cute dress or a nice shirt.

They have good happy hour deals! My family mostly ordered from this because we wanted to try the tacos. We weren't let down! I got the standard (signature?) taco which was delicious! Be prepared for a little bit of a messy meal though. Don't wear your best outfit in case you drop, drip, or spill. 

My only complaint (if you can even call it that!) is that the waiters/waitresses all wear regular nice clothes, so if you have questions, you must memorize the face. You might mistake a twenty something for one of the workers! But otherwise very good service and very good fresh food! A fun place to try with your friends or family.
