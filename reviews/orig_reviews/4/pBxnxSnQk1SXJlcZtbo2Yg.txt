Small, local bar with New Mexican food. We went for happy hour on a Monday and ordered chicken quesdaillas and chicken nachos. The service was amazing. The bartender was our server and a hostess for the restaurant. Despite her having to hustle and bustle all around the restaurant, she kept up a happy and a very pleasant attitude and she kept an eye on our food and drinks at all times.

They had great beer on tap for hh ($3). The food was good but kind of heavy, but my husband said that New Mexican food is like that. I think we found our local reverse happy hour spot.
