Holy food coma.

Charming, small hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.
Booths and tables.
Pleasant, efficient service.
Music varied from Mariachi-style to Ibiza techno.
Which cracked me up in a good way.

Stopped in by myself for an early dinner -@Five-ish.

Salsa was delish, although it is of the soupier variety  and I prefer some chunk to my salsa. Still, the flavors were balanced and there was a nice little black pepper zing.

Guac was fresh and just a wee bit salty for me, but hey, I took the remainder home so that says something.

Ordered the Green Chile enchiladas sub veggies for the protein.
It was GINORMOUS. I managed to eat a full half a portion. And I'm happily stuffed.

Lots of crisp lettuce on top too, rather than the sad little side garnish of lettuce you may see at other joints. The cotilla was fresh and plentiful too.

And, normally I cringe at the ever-present side of refried beans and rice - but again, freshly made and tasty.

Didn't have a Marg this time, but spied some on the other tables that looked worthwhile.

In short, I will be going back WHEN I recover from my current food coma.
