Pretty good food, pretty good drinks, expensive but that is typical for Vegas.  The best part about this place is when they play Mas Tequila you run to the bar where the wait staff is waiting standing on top of the bar to pour tequila right into your mouth.  Pretty good tequila too.  Go on Sunday night when the have karaoke to a live band.  VERY FUN!  We went the end of August this year and it was not very crowded.  I will for sure be back the next time I am in Vegas which I hope is soon!
