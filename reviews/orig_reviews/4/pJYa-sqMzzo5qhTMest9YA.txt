La Casa Blanca is pretty far from my house I stumbled upon it randomly on a Sunday afternoon drive.  This is a really nice looking restaurant from the street so I decided to stop in.  They have a ton of parking in the rear of the restaurant  and the decor is pretty nice with a big covered patio.  The waitress I had was nice and my food came out quickly.  They have very good chips, salsa, bean dip and guacamole.  My chilli reno was good and came with what appeared to be fresh tortillas.  If I am on this side of town again I will definitely stop in.

Try:

- Bean dips and Salsa
- Sitting on the Patio
