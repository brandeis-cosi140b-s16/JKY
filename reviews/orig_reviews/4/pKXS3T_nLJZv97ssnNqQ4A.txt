I have always been a fan of Chipotle's food but haven't really been motivated to sit my ample butt down and give them a review.  Sure the tasty burritos the size of Mom's meatloaf should be worth a few kind words and their delicious guacamole is some of the best at a fast food style Mexican place that I have had.

What changed my mind and inspired me to write this was a recent article I read in Newsweek about the effort they are making to use humanely raised meat and rbgh free dairy.  I am not nearly as conscious as I should be about what I eat.   Knowing there is an option to support a business that is helping even in the smallest way would definitely change my mind about where I might fulfill my fast food urges.  They are not using 100% organic and cruelty free but they are doing a whole lot more than most fast food places.  (the pork is 100% humanely raised and they contracted with Tyson to get chickens raised specifically for them with a better diet and more room to move around.)  Good job Chipotle, while you may not be perfect at least you are making an effort.
