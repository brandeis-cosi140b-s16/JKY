Tried this place tonight with my boo and  I am definitely a fan. He loved his carne asada burrito and my enchiladas were super tasty. They are a little different than the traditional saucy enchilada, but good flavor.  The rice was very good and the mexican slaw had pumpkin seeds in it, which added a nice crunch! The main thing that would keep us going back was the amazing service. Our server was Kimberly and she took care of us from start to finish. It is refreshing to go out and actually get great service.
