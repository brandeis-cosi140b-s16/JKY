YES.  Slightly grubby inside, not big, but the food was good, the chips and salsa were AMAZING, the booze was cheap cheap cheap, (a single dollar and seventy-five cents will net you a margarita) and the service was excellent.  When people complain about how customer service is dead (am I the only one who does this?), send them here.  Our waiter had minimal formal training, there were no "comments/suggestions" cards, no floor managers looming over us.  He knew what he was doing, and that's a testament to the value of common sense.
