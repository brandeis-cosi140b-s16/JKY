I love me some Chipotle about as much as I love my Starbucks. I go to them so often my girlfriend thinks I'm a connoisseur. Back to the review... So this Chipotle location is everything you'd expect. They have a nice clean dining area, a small outdoor patio, it's set back in the corner of a large shopping area so the patio is reasonably quiet and enjoyable. The price for what you get here is well worth the value. My favorite is the Burrito bowl. Basically all the contents of a burrito with all the calories in a giant flower tortilla. So you basically get the same great taste without the extra guilt. For a small up charge of less than $2 you can request double meat! It's handy for the times you get the girl who's trying to save the company a little money by shorting you. They have a pretty consistent system for portion control but there's inevitably employees who seem to act as though not quite a full spoon full is going to get them employee of the month or something. Anyway, Love the food, Great value for the price, comfortable quiet location, plenty of free parking!!
