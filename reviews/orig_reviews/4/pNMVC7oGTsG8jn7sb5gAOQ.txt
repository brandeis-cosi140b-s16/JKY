I would easily have given this place 5 stars hands down, however the service was a bit too slow for our liking.

We felt that the waitresses and the host somehow forgot about us couple times so we did not want to seem annoying as we tried waving them down numerous times, but overall the food was absolutely delicious! It was on a weeknight and they were not slammed.

We also ordered some beers and they were not served very cold so we should have said something, but we did not want to seem unappreciative, but just letting you know that beers should be freezing cold always! (or at least serve the beer with ice cold glasses).

We had the guac, swai fish (out of this world amazing), enchiladas, and the kale salad. No complaints about the food whatsoever!

We will definitely be back!
