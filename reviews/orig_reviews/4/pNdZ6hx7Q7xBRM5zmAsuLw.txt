My girlfriend and I met here for lunch last week.  She lives in the west valley and I'm in the faaaar northeast valley.  I've been wanting to go to Gallo Blanco for a while, so this seemed like a great place to meet halfway.

The restaurant is really cute and chill as far as atmosphere.  The entrance is a bit confusing as far as where you go to get sat, though.

We had early lunch, and I hadn't had breakfast, so I was thrilled that they had breakfast all day!  I had the steak and eggs, which I shared with my son, so I had to have all the sauces on the side :o(  Next time I go, I will have the sauces on the plate because they were YUMMY.  My breakfast was well-prepared, tasty, and nicely plated.  Portion size was perfect.  

It was a quick lunch and I was more focused on catching up with my girlfriend than I was with the food.  I plan to go again and take it in a bit more.  I have a feeling I'll be updating to 5 stars :o)
