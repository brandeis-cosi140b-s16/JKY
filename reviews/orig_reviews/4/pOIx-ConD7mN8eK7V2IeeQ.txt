I finally got to try the-oh-so talked about KoMex! I love the concept; I especially love Korean food so I was extremely thrilled to try this place out. 

We went here on a Saturday night around 6pm. The place was dead. It was seriously just me and my boyfriend. It was a little awkward but overall I did not mind it too much. A few tables were labeled "Reserved" so we were hoping that people would roll in when we were there. We stayed there for more than an hour during our meal, no sign of any other human life form except for our waitress who was super friendly by the way. 

To start, we ordered 1/2 Beef Bulgogi Nachos. It was delicious. The meat was so tender and it was really flavorful. The combination of the sweet sauce blended so well with the pico and jalapenos. We ordered the Bulgogi burrito next and then three tacos with three different meat: beef bulgogi, pork and chicken. All of the meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors were spot on. The burrito was made well in my opinion. You know how when they make burritos, one side has all the beans and the other side has all the meat? Here they make it so that every bite is all the combination of the meat, pico, rice, etc. It was just so good that I was able to finish the whole burrito. And trust me, it was massive! 

I will definitely come back here to get my burrito fix.
