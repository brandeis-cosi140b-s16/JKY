My boyfriend and I really enjoy Blancos.  However, we only go on Saturday or Sunday for lunch (to avoid the Scottsdale club scene at this restaurant at night).

The food is decent Mexican food. I am always satisfied and I also always have leftovers.

The best part would have to be the drinks - I love their margaritas - very fresh.

The only negative would have to be the service. Every time we sit at the bar, we receive impeccable service. However, if we sit elsewhere in the restaurant, it's pretty poor.

Overall - a great lunch place with wonderful margaritas
