While my husband and I were visiting the area we tried and really enjoyed this place! It was a fun and lively bar/grill.  we were there on 1/13/12 and shared the nachos w/ ground beef (big enough to share), then my husband had the shrimp fajitas and I had the chicken fajitas. The food was really fresh and the portions were very generous. Our waiter (didn't get his name) was awesome, just the right amount of attention. The night we were there the age group of the clientele seemed to range from early thirties up. If you're looking for intimate this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for a fun place to laugh your head off with friends then I highly recommend it!
