We where pretty hungry and wanted to eat something different but light for lunch . The staff was friendly especially the hostess asking us about our stay etc etc .... The waiter was very attentive and friend as well . The menu is a bit Strange mixing Mexican  cuisine And Chinese but it was a nice twist to let us each try a differ choice without having to go to a buffet. We ordered the recommend Chicken Ji Song (4pc. Lettuce leaf cups / fried sweet potatoes 16.88) is was very good no over powering flavored but very tasteful !! We also ordered the Fish Ceviche which was also very good it had a bed of guacamole on the bottom and the fish on top , it also had a nice flavorful kick to it as well . I'm not a spicy kind of person but I was able to eat enough to enjoy the meal . The also had a good beer selection which we ordered the Westmalle Trappist Ale, never tried it before but it was delicious.
