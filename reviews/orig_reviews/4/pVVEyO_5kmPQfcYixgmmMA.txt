Great atmosphere, service was excellent, stopped by about 40 min prior to closing and no one ever made you feel rushed. The reason for this review is the cucumber orange salad! It was delicious, I know it's considered a side but it was amazing. I was meeting up with friends and wanted something light it exceeded my expectations. The veggie taco was quite delightful as well.
