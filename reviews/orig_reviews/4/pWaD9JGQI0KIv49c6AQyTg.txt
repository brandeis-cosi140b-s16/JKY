Seating is in short supply here!  There are also no misters outside for summer seating. Great flavorful enchiladas done Chipotle assembly style with a local Phoenix twist.  Multiple meat, cheese and sauce selections.  They are so great they allow you to mix and match!  I had the pork and chicken.  I loved the slaw add on, I don't see that often.  They also heat it up in a fire.  You also have two different style enchilada shells.  Staff is very helpful and guided me in my first time ordering.  I left with a hook up-enchilada style!  I'll be back soon.
