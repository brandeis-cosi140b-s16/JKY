We met up with some friends here on a recent weekend trip to Phoenix and had a really fun evening. I would say I am a fan more so because of the ambience and service. We snagged a patio table for our party of 7 and it was a perfect evening for dining al fresco. The whole restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it and is as trendy as you expect the Fox Restaurant group to be. Our server was really friendly and sooooo patient with us. He offered lots of suggestions when we couldn't decide on drinks or menu items. I tried their pork enchiladas and thought they were just OK. They were a bit spicy for my taste so I actually didn't finish my plate which is unusual...but it may have just been me not feeling the spicy that evening, who knows. My husband, however, learned from our server to order the fajitas IN a burrito and he loved it. He polished off his plate completely clean. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as no one was complaining. I would be willing to come back and try some other items from their menu. I think I should have looked at the menu a little more and picked something that I was really excited about. Next time!
