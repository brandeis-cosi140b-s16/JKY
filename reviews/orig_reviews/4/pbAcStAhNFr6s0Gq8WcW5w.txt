Massive portions, great taste and everything freshly made to order--I am in heaven.  If you aren't a big eater or sharing, the half portions will suit a normal appetite fine.  This is a family run restaurant, with Mom taking orders, Dad doing most of the cooking and 2 cute daughters as wait staff.  The Bulgogi burrito is huge and so yummy, as are the fish tacos.  Drinks are all canned or bottled, so no free refills.  If you want water with your meal, it is bottled, and is free..  Such a nice touch.  There is seating for about 30 or thereabouts, so you may have a small wait if you hit right at lunch or dinner hours, but I have never waited more than 5 minutes for a table

Last visit cost 21.70, including tax for 3 people.  Nice job, Komex--I look forward to my next encounter with your kimchi..
