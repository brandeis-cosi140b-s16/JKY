A 4 or a 5?  Lunch today was a 4 - mainly because my shredded beef taco was just way too soggy.  But 90% of the lunches and dinners here are 5's.  Great house margaritas! Excellent salsa/bean dip choices. Waitress Sammie was a delight.  And we'll definitely go back because we know next time will be a 5!

Oh, after lunch, stop and check out the Western Museum downtown.  Absolutely a Gem!!
