I really like this place!  I'm not a fan of nachos really, but that's ok.  Their enchiladas are super great!  They have the best cheese dip in town (white, as it should be) and their jalep√±os are so good, I had to find out where they get them so I can have them at home.  Yum!  My wife loves their nachos, I'm just not a fan of any nachos, they get too cold too fast.  Plenty of other things on the menu for you that taste good!!
