Delicious. Went here on a random Sunday night and had an amazing time. Their happy hour was just ending and I was able to take advantage of a bunch of items! Their tacos are good. Some of the toppings were lacking a little bit but overall they were great. The nachos were a good filler and thoughtfully arranged with the toppings. The best part was the flautas! The flavors were amazing and there was a perfect amount of filling in each of them. I would definitely be back.
