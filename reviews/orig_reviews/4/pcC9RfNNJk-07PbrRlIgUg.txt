We went to SOL for the first time this week for lunch. The interior ambiance is beautiful & the patio is fabulous. Since it wasn't scorching out, we opted for the patio. 

For starters, we ordered chips & guac. Very good, but could have used more chips on the upfront, as we needed about 3 baskets in order to finish the guac since only about 5-6 chips fit in a basket. Hungry people problems maybe?

For my entree, I ordered the beer-battered fish tacos with a side of rice. Ryan ordered a pork burrito with a side of rice as well. The tacos were great with a delicious cabbage slaw. Ryan's burrito resembled an episode of Man vs. Food. 

-1 star for service. I think being on the patio made our table forgettable. 

Didn't take advantage of the Yelp check-in deal as I wasn't having a boozy lunch. However, I'm sure I'll be back to use it!
