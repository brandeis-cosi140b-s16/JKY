A great first time visit overall.  We made reservations through Open Table, and got stuck in traffic on the way (we were coming from quite a bit away).  We called ahead and the staff was very accomodating when we ended up being about 10 minutes late for our reservation.  We were seated right away and ordered the fresh-made guacamole and salsa sampler to go along with the house salsa.  Everything was great with a nice variety in the sampler.  The food was excellent, we had the chicken tacos and smoked chicken enchillada.  Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful and assisted us in designing our own Tequila flights to sample from their extensive tequila menu.  Our server even recommended a new tequila that wasn't even on the menu yet, which was also excellent.  Our only complaint was the lack of parking, which admittedly goes with the territory in this part of the city.  There are just a few spots behind the building (which were all taken), so we were stuck with street parking, and the surrounding streets are not well signed, so we couldn't tell if we were illegally parked or not.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the type of restaurant- not cheap, but not overpriced either with reasonable portions.  Tequila prices were comparable to other places in the city, and the chance to customize a tequila flight is a great way to sample lots of different options without spending a fortune.  Overall, a fantastic experience, particularly for tequila lovers like us!
