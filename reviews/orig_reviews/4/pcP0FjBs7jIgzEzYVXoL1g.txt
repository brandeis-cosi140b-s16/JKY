Viva Lunch Specials!! 

Some of my faith in Las Vegas Mexican food has been restored by Viva Mercados. The restaurant resembles some chain Mexican places (Chi Chi's Macayo, etc..) but that's where the comparison ends. This is a good restaurant with great specials. 

If you sit in the Cantina, you may order some of the Cantina specials. I had a Carnitas Taco & Margarita special ($8.95). The margarita was a good "restaurant" margarita, and the carnitas was flavorful and well made. I asked for it spicy, so the chef used some very hot Chili d'arboro. This taco was en fuego y delicioso! 

The menu is pretty big, and there are lots of items I'd like to try. The service was wonderful, and the people working there seemed honestly happy to be there. It often goes unappreciated, but a positive morale amongst the staff really improves the dining experience for the customers. Whoever is responsible for training the staff at this pleasant place needs to write a book, because so many other restaurants in Las Vegas could greatly benefit from this "Zappos-like" approach. 

Gracias for a great lunch amigos, I'll see you soon......OLE!
