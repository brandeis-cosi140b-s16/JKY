Not your typical Mexican restaurant. It is very different but I thought it was delicious. We came around 8:15 on a Saturday night and were told it would be about 1 hour and 20 min wait, so we left. About 15 min later I called back and was told it would be about 30 min so I put my name down and went for a drink with my bf and mom. Upon arriving we were sat and our server was friendly but a little too flirty for my liking. I get it, you're a server and want a good tip but she should learn to talk to the rest of the table. It's disrespectful and unprofessional to focus your attention on the hot guy of the table, which happened to be MY BOYFRIEND! Anyway, the food was good and different but I loved my shrimp tacos! The manager was very nice and he actually looked like he enjoyed his job, not like many managers you see on the strip. I would definitely come back. :)
