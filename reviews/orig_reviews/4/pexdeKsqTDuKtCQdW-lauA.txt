Alert! The salsas are to die for! soooo gooood yum yum
I wasn't that into the chili verde pork I ordered because the pork wasn't falling off like the way I like it. But man the salsas saved it.
They provide salsas and chips at a small counter as self-service and there were 3 different kinds when I was there. Almost couldn't leave the counter :P
