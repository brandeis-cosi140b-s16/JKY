I ended up eating here by pure chance. I was headed to Red Robin when I saw this place next door. I decided to eat Mexican food, and I'm glad I did. The staff was friendly and quick with the service. They were making tortillas in plain view of the restaurant behind a plexiglass enclosure. The food was terrific. I will certainly be returning.
