This is my go to Mexican spot. I hate margaritas but always seem to order a margarita when I'm here. I love their spicy bean dip and always ask for the hot sauce over the chunky salsa. Their nachos are way too big for one person so I recommend sharing with the table. Wait staff are always personable and attentive.
