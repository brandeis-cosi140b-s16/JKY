My wife and I have been here a few times now. We really love it here. Tonight we had the street corn and the nachos and quesadilla. All amazing. Previously we have had the enchiladas also very good.

We don't drink but I have hear from friends that do that the mixed drinks are great. 

The complementary chips are salsa are really fresh and tasty. 

The atmosphere is casual. The place is huge and the best time to go is late afternoon. They don't accept reservations. 

We will be back often.
