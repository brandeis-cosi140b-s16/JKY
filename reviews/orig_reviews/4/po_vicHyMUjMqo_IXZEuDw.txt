So-Cal Fish Taco's are really good! My girlfriend ordered the shrimp taco platter, she got this based on our servers recommended and she nailed it. My g/f thought they were some of the best she'd had. I ordered Cod tacos, the panko breading was very good, they were piping hot, and from the time we ordered the wait time was only about 5 minutes. My favorite part was the salsa, they really made the taco in my opinion. Very good and would recommend.
