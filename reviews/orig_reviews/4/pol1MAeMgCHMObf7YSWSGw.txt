Since it's already a well-established point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value, I'll simply provide a few bulleted remarks:

Great Original Paintings
Sweet & fresh faced Guadalajaran transplant at counter
Amazing Strawberry Salsa (WTF -- who knew?) 
New favorite pinto beans in town (sorry America's Taco Shop)
Not a fan of the Dogshark taco
Chicken Mole & Conchinita were T'Asty
Generously portioned $6.99 2 taco combination entree is UNBEATABLE

I went in at 1pm, and the place was empty.  With all these great Yelp reviews, where are all the sophisticated, bargain hunting peeps with a hankering for delicious Mexican in a town notoriously lacking in this?
