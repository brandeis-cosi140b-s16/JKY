Dog friendly restaurant for all my fellow pup-parents! 

Delicious, affordable food. Great for relatively "clean" cheat meal if you're eating healthy.

We got the salmon bowl & wahoo's bowl with fish--both with brown rice--and a kale salad with tofu. Everything was tasty and the portions were average/good...not too small but not particularly generous either.
