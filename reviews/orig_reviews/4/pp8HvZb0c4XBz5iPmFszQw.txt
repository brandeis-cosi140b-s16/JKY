Score one for hole-in-the-wall, local's hidden gem places!  This place has consistently good food for amazing prices.  

Most of their food is fairly customizable in terms of spicy-ness, which I find awesome.  My poor tummy can't handle spicy anymore, and that's made finding good Mexican food that I can actually eat a bit difficult down here.  Any requests to alter food (no/little salsa, no cheese, etc) have always been happily accomodated.  

Their burritos, while not the biggest I've seen (that title goes to either Picante in Berkeley, CA or High Tech Burrito, also in the Bay Area), they're pretty damned tasty.  

All of the meats I've had are very good.  Granted, I've not tried the ground beef, but I tend to steer away from that unless I'm having a burger.  

If you're in the Ahwatukee area, this place definitely warrants a visit.
