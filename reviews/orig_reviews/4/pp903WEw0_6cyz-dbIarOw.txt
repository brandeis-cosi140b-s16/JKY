This is a good place to eat.  It is pretty basic but the food is always good and the place is clean, with seating indoors or outdoors.  They have a chip and salsa bar that is pretty good - lots of different salsa with two types of chips.  Not the best Mexican  food, but for the money it's a  fair deal.  The ambience is nice.
