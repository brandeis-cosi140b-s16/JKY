We couldn't wait to try the Barrio Queen when it opened, as we are huge fans of The Barrio. However, the mixed reviews kept us away for awhile. I'm happy to say that whatever they did to make changes now works. The menu is strategically different than The Barrio, and that works, too. My peach margarita was delicious, and my tacos al pastor were the best I have had. (I do understand that for some people, the portions may not be filling......so order a side dish or start with an appetizer.) No problemo. 
Everyone at our table was very happy with their dinners and we are looking forward to sitting on their sidewalk/patio when the heat subsides. I'm also hoping they will have some of the same musicians that perform at the Barrio.
