I visited Cantina Laredo for a Sunday Brunch and I have yet to get it off my mind! I have only been one time but I will definately be going back. I had a dish with eggs and carne asada. What made it so rememberable was this sauce they put on the carne asada that just made it all melt together and filled your mouth with flavor! It was like a cilantro pesto type sauce. Their drinks were also delicious. I will definately come back for brunch and maybe even a lunch or two.
