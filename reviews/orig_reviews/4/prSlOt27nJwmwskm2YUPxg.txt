Went with my folks in December.
- loved teh decor
- fantastic service.  Our waitress was a gem.
- cozy seating
- Carne Asada was divine
- my parents each loved their dishes too.  My mom had a salad with the picked jalapenos.  Sweet and delish.  
- my dad got a steak and loved it. 

This was fabulous.
