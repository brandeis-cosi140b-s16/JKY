It's in the South Point Casino.  That said, you really shouldn't be expecting some grand, authentic Mexican experience.  Baja Miguel's is one of my favorites - and who'd have thunk it?!?

First off, the starting chips & dip...I can't even.  I crave that bean dip at least once every week.  It is so amazing!  The guac & salsa that accompany it are both good as well, but the bean dip is where it's at.  In fact, I would be happy with a couple margaritas and that dip, but I don't know when to say when, so I always overdo it with the dining and end up full and feeling like a stuffed pig.

Which means, of course, I love their entrees.  I usually get seafood enchiladas or the burrito carbon but everything else looks tempting and tasty.  Like I said, I wouldn't call it an "authentic" experience, but it's really, really good.
