A good quick meal that tastes pretty good as well. I end up usually getting the jerk fried rice, and jade red chicken. Grab the black beans you'll thank me :).

The snicker doodle they give with your meal is delicious as well (love the after meal treat).

The only true downside is you'll be in a food coma by the time you're done with the meal (unless you get the bowl which is about half the amount of food).

Overall, check this place out. It's worth the visit.
