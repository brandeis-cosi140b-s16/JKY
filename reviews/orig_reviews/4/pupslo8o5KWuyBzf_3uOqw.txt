Why can't this chain take over Roberto's??? 
A big thumbs up. 
I got the junior burrito with beans, rice, carne asada, and pico de gallo. 
Ahhhh all the great memories of going to the taco trucks in California flooded back. 
$3 bucks. That's a great deal. 
The place may be fast food, but it's authentic. I wish they had more locations.
