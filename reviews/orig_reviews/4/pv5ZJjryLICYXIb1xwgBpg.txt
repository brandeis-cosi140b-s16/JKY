This place is an amazing little secret hidden in the sea of restaurants we call the Scottsdale quarter.

 It is a "type" of mexican food that is hard to explain. It's not authentic "the hole in the wall type place where you're afraid to use the restrooms) , it's not fresh mex (the type of Mexican food people who don't like mexican food eat) but we did come up with a name : MODERN mexican. It's decor is Spanish style decked out in tequila bottles, comfy tables, and an AMAZING patio with lounge seating.  

The food is awesome.  I highly recommend the coconut calamari,  the gabernador taco (no way can I pronounce that properly) the grilled sweet corn, ANNND beer battered shrimp taco's. The one thing i didn't care for in my many trips was the tortilla soup because it was OVERLOADED with raw red onion to the point i felt it was inedible. The service has always been great and the drinks are wonderful.  Happy hour menu: the prices are not very "happy" but rather great recommendations of their specialities. Other than those few things the food, service and atmosphere keep me coming back again & again!
