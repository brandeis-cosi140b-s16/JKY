What a great Mexican food restaurant!  My companion and I tried this place based on a friend's recommendation.  It is in an old church and the stained glass windows, stunning chandelier and wall murals set the tone for a great dining experience.  The warm, fresh chips are served with homemade spicy salsa and three different types of sauces that are fun to try.  We have now been to Taco Guild four times and have haven't gotten past the tacos on the menu-they're that good.  The Mexican street corn is delicious and the drink selection is great, as well.  My companion is a bit of a beer snob and he loves the selection here.  Service is attentive and polite.  We recently held a special occasion party at Taco Guild and they made the experience extra special for us.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  I didn't give it five stars because parking is a bit limited.
