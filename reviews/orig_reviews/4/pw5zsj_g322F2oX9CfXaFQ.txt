Starvin' like Marvin, we arrived for dinner on Thursday night around 7:30pm.  I'd heard how good this place was that served cuisine of New Mexico.  What does that mean?  Something to do with hatch chiles.  All I know is that it was some good eating.  I was so ready to eat that I have no pictures of the food.
I had two chicken enchiladas, a red chile pork tamale, and a side of black beans; the beans were not necessary after all that food--I had two bites.  Boyfriend had a stuffed steak sopapilla, a tamale, and a side of rice.  Not much talking, lots of scarfing.  Everything was so delicious, fresh, and cheap for what we ordered.  This is one of those places that has so many good things on the menu that it's hard to decide, so take a gander before you go.  I want to return to try some other items, like the Navajo Taco and the dessert sopapilla, and next time I'll remember to save room.
