We went on Sept. 4 Thursday evening. It was our first time. 
A bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. 
We asked the cashier and she explained it well. 
You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. 

We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.

We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars! 

We didn't try the other items. 
We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. 

Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that. 

Definitely will be back.
