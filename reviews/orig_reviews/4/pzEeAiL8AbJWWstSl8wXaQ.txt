Chips and salsa do not come free with this review or with your meal but the food and drinks make up for that.

We walked in with a larger party of eight to grab some food for Cinco De Mayo. The meet up was last minute so we didn't have a chance to make a reservation, and they couldn't take us right away so we walked next door to have a drink while we waited for a table. When we returned we were sat outside at a high top. It was great weather and our server came over right away to get our drink order. We ordered a few beers and some amazing cocktails. The drink I ordered was called "The Big Nose Goes to Mexicao and was lined with a pink salt and was lit on fire. The guava in it was delicious and the drink tasted fresh! I also ordered the Carne tacos. The meat was tender, marinated and flavorful and the corn tortillas were homemade. The jicima slaw and crunchy onions on top were the perfect addition. I loved them. 

Overall, we were happy with the service, food and drinks. This place is a tastier, mexican version of Kona Grill which means great people watching for men in silk shirts and overly plastic women. We will be back.
