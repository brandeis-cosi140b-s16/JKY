Whoa, how have I not reviewed CFT yet?

Okay first, the wait: To address all these reviews that talk about waiting to be seated - yes, you usually have to wait for a table. Yes, there isn't really a good area to sit and wait. But yes, it is worth it. When you're coming to a restaurant this delicious, you'll probably have to wait.

The food: I'm not a huge fan of the chips and salsa, but most people I go with love them. I've had the BBQ Mahi Tacos (about 6 times). They are amazing. The tortillas are fried and the slaw is incredible. I usually get full after the first one, which says a lot because I can usually house my meals, but always make room for the second taco. The sides? Nothing great. Some of my friends love the jalapeno-cheddar mashers. I usually pay the up-charge to get a side salad, which is delicious, but the tacos are good enough that the lack of yummy sides doesn't really matter. The Guacamole Salmon Salad is also incredible.

Great beer selection. Decent margaritas. The prices can't be beaten. I love NoDa and I love Cabo Fish Taco.
