Just visited Los Taquitos for the second time recently and was again very pleasantly satisfied with dinner! 

My date had 4 street tacos (Carne Asada) on flour tortillas and they were great! I had the Chile Relleno Burrito and it was awesome! Both of the sauces (green/red) are great to add to any dish as well. I couldn't decide on which one I liked better so I just dipped alternating bites into a little I put on my plate. 

Four Tacos, Chile Relleno Burrito and two bottled sodas totaled $13! Can't beat that deal!!! 

Can't wait to go again! Yum Yum!!!
