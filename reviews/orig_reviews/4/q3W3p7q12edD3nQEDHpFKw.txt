It's a Chipotle.  That means its consistent, you know what you're getting, and it's always fast.  If you haven't been to one before and you like fresh Mexican-style food, you have to try it.  Choose your ingredients so you get exactly what you want.

This location is surrounded by a lot of office buildings so it will be very packed every weekday during the lunch rush.  Show up by 11:45 and you'll be fine, but just after noon there will be a line out the door.  Still, it only takes about ten minutes to get through.  Or order using their iPhone app and you can walk to the front of the line, grab your stuff, and go.
