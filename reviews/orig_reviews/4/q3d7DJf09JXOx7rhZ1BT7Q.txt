Delectable, fatty, smokey ingredients wrapped in greasy, hot tortillas.  Tasty tasty stuff my friends.

Now for the wait...it's a nightmare, especially when you're hung the f**k over and need to get it in ASAP.  So, it's ill advised that you go here after a night of drinking unless you have the capacity to wait about half an hour in line.  

Separate lines for different meats/ organs.  our friend tells us its the most genuine replication of tijuana style tacos.  Whatever this is, it's f**kn delicious.  

4 1/2 stars.  Product is solid 5 but the wait is unbearable.
