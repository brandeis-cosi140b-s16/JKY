OK.. First let me say I am a fan. Very tasty and unique flavored street tacos. I ordered the al pastor with the pineapple and the flavors were wonderful. Loved the taste of the tortillas. Yes, they are more of the smaller street taco size but not anywhere near the "not much bigger then a 50 cent coin"  post I saw earlier.  As a person being conscious of calorie counting right now I loved that ithis restaurant only uses one tortilla per taco as opposed to some other places that put two tortillas per taco just to make them more filling, and that Milagro concentrated more on the flavor.  I also ordered the rancho beans which were very tasty and served in a small side pot.  Very friendly service from the waiter and a comfortable atmosphere even for one person dining alone. I do plan on returning, as my waiter suggested, for the Saturday brunch they have coming up for cervezas on the patio and some football watching.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is just the price point.  $15 for 3 tacos and a side of beans is a bit more on the pricey side for a lunch meal. I think they will figure that out with all the feedback and of course the build out on the place could not have been cheap.  When that happens my star will surely become a 5.  I for one am hoping this place sticks around.
