This place is really good and we love the decor and atmosphere. They actually had a live DJ which we didn't notice until we were done with our food. The drinks and tacos were definitely good and we'll be back here for sure. 

The only reason I give it 4-stars is because I can't remember how good the food was. It was good, but was it really good? Usually if it's really good I write a review instantly. However, 4-stars is good enough for us to continue coming back... we might eat here tonight now that they're on my mind. Hmm...
