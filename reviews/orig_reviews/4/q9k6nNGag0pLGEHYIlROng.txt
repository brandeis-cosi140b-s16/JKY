Went to TQLA for my first time for lunch on a Friday with a client and sat in the bar at a high-top.. It was slower than I had hoped for, for TQLA. So everyone that try's this place, please write a review to help support them. The food was SO very good. The guacamole kart (where they make it in front of you) was fantastic!! I had the wedge salad with chicken, would get it again. The service was amazing....I don't how many times someone would pass by to make sure we were happy. Everyone from the manager, server and I think even another waiter or the bus person. I hear they get a crowd for the evenings because of the open patio that they are due to get misters soon for the summer evenings. Please support this place, it's a great upper scale bar/restaurant and this area really needs a fun and unique venue such as TQLA. The menu offers American and Mexican style food. When you go, ask for Lyndsey as your server....she was GREAT!!
