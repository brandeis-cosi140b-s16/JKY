Brought some people from out of town.   They loved it. I thought it was good.  Staff was very friendly and there was no waiting to get menus or place our orders.  Had the combination plate which was excellent.   One of the Companions had a chimichanga.  She loved it.  It wasoaded with chicken. Everything here tastes very authentic.   Will return
