Hand crafted specialty Margharitas.  Fresh and strong.  We shared a De La Tierra.  It's basically beef,  and chicken fajitas served with chorizo,  grilled Veggies and sides of rice,  beans,  corn and Tortillas.  This was shared by a party of four and it was perfect.  

Sit upstairs outside for a great view.
