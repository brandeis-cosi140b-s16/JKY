Stopped by this place as we were heading out of town from a business trip. It was a southwestern type authentic Mexican food restaurant. We both had tacos. I had the skirt steak taco and husband had skirt steak taco and their Paco taco. Lots of choices for different types of tortillas and beans. Both plates of food came with choice of beans. We tried the retried and black beans which were both good as well as their rice. It was too early for margaritas as it was on a Sunday and NC law requires you wait till 12 to drink. NC residents should vote that law away- lol. Great place for Mexican food. Service excellent.
