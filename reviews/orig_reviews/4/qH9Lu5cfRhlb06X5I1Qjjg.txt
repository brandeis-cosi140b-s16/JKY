In the mood for Mexican food near our hotel and visited this weekend while in town for spring baseball.
We were impressed. 
Started with Green Chile Lobster appetizer which set the stage nicely.  
My wife had the Cruz Kitchen which includes Tenderloin Relleno and Smoked Pork Tamale. She described it as tasty but somewhat salty. 
I opted for Santa Caf√©  Choose Three option and got the Smoked Pork Tamale, Carne Adovada and Shredded Beef Taco which were all quite good. 
Service was reasonable.
As with most reviews I read, I would go back.
