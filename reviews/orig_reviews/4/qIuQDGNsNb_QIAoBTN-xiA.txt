Food was OK, I didn't eat much as I met up with a few fellow Yelpers just after 10am and I wasn't all that hungry yet. Only tried a few things and they were all decent. Can't really argue with AYCE Brunch with bottomless mimosas/margaritas for $14. That my friends, is a STEAL.

Service was fairly good, no complaints. I left early compared to the others so I may not have gotten my full $14 worth but I had a few mimosas and a plate of food so I'm not complaining :)
