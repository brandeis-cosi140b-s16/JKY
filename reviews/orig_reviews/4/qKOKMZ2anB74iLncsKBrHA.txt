This appears to mainly a local/neighborhood place and especially popular late night according to a local bartender. We didn't know that until after dining earlier in the evening on Fish Tacos and Osso Bucco. I thought both were good although the chef could lighten up on the white pepper in the chile mashed potatoes. I capped the meal with some flan which was very good. The service and ambiance on the patio with waterfall/misters made for a nice experience.
