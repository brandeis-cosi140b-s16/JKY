The food is amazingly delicious and the service is memorable! The restaurant is just shaped a little awkwardly making is difficult to stand in line without bumping into people. Not a huge deal but I always take my food to go because of this. I always get the enchiladas and they are so authentic! I love their rice and horchata too!
