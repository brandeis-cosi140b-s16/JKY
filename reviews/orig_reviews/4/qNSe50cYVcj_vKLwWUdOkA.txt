First time here... Monday night, place was busy. Was greeted right away. Our waitress was very kind offered lots of advice to the food. Like they do not fry the chili relleno de vegetables and the drink Dia de Los Muertos was chili infused. I had the pollo deshebrado and the Oaxaca cheese was what gives this flavor. The carnitas taco was just ok little dry the rice was green? It had corn mixed in, not that impressive.  The sides, rice and beans are extra? Really? just throw that in with an entree. It took awhile for the drink to come, the waitress admitted she forgot to place the order. Sitting around waiting for dinner to arrive, I noticed the table in front of me had fancy drinks from the bar that were sitting getting watery from the ice instead of them drinking them, they opt for water? I'd come back and try again. I did love the T-shirts they sell and the cute stuff, day of the dead themed.
