Yum! Usually as a vegetarian, I hear that someone has picked a Mexican restaurant for a group dinner and I sigh. 90% of the time I end up getting a bean and rice burrito and enough frozen sour mix to make me never want sweets again. Mad Mex isn't really even Mexican, which worked tremendously to my benefit. It's Tex-Mex inspired but they really consider using fresh ingredients and working different cuisines into the menu whenever possible. They had so many veggie options, from seitan wings to marinated tofu and veggie-abundant enchiladas. Everything we had was great, including the not-too-sweet sangria margaritas. I'd gladly go back!
