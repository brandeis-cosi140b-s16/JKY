This is a much better mexican place than the overall score would lead you to believe.  

The service is pretty great.  No waiting to have your drinks refilled and always cheerful and pleasant staff.  The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice decor with the required Dos X most interesting man in the world cut out.  They have a nice patio  to eat,drink a beer or hang out.

The food here has always been better than I would expect from a chain mexican restaurant. They seem to do a much better job than the other chains in the area.  The salsa is a bit hotter than you would expect, which is always welcome, with some very good chips. The lunch combos offer a few non-meat choices with some excellent tostadas.

Try:

- Tostadas
- Enchiladas
