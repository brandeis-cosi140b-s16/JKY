I've only been to Agave a handful of times, not nearly enough. I really like the spot. At first, I thought the architecture was too eccentric, but then I thought of Antoni Gaudi and his warped up Casa Mila and things didn't seem so bad. 

Agave has great Mexican food, elevated to the status of fusion with the modern stylings the chefs use. 

Last time I went, I had the Shrimp and Crab Stacked Enchiladas on my server's recommendation. It was really good, really rich. 

Our server was awesome, by the way. Accommodating and not afraid to throw out suggestions. Very knowledgeable about the kitchen and bar. 

My mom and I had a couple of fruity bitch margaritas and my manfriend tried a different tequilla, Frida Kahlo (gold) on the rocks. Which, if there were such a thing as a sipping tequilla, that would be it. It was so smooth, "Yummy," as our server described it. 

The chips y salsa is really good, too. They serve blue corn tortilla chips with three salsas. A smokey salsa, a sweet red salsa, and a green salsa. 

Agave used to be a hip afterhours place. Not so much anymore, I guess, but I'd like to resurrect it as my afterhours place.
