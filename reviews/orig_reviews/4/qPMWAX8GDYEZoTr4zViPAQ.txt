So we went down to Arizona for a few days and found this little jewel! We heard a lot about this place from the locals with mixed reviews but after catching the episode of Diners, Drive-In's and Dives we decided to take the plunge.


The mixture of Chinese and Mexican wouldn't be an obvious jump at me combination but oddly enough, it works incredibly well!

 Amazing carnitas, jerk fried rice, and black beans...if your looking for something out of the ordinary, cheap and delicioso, look no further. A staple with the locals and a must stop for out of towner's (like us)!
