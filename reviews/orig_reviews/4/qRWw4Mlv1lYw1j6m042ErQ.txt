The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire, which only a few "taco shop" type places in greater Phoenix bother to do, and it imparts a different flavor to the meat. For $5.95, my burrito with loaded with tasty carne asada and little else... no beans or rice fillers - just good beef, not dry or grissely, nor mushy/steamed. It contained some pico de gallo and guac, though I didn't notice any guac until the last few bites (must have loaded one end). 

The biggest negative for me is paying extra for chips and salsa, especially when the chips come from a local store (and aren't that good). Also, don't go if in a hurry - it's a popular place and a small kitchen, so it can take a short while for orders to come up. 

Overall, some might get annoyed with the parking, waits, add-ons, etc. but if you like grilled asada, they do it better than most in PHX.
