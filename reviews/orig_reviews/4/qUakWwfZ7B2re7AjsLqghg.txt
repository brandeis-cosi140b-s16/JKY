I came across Roberto's on a episode of Diner, Drive-Ins, and Dive ... So I decided to check it out on a recent trip to Tempe, AZ.

For those of you who haven't seen the episode ... Roberto's is located inside a Shell Gas Station.  (I must say that it is one of the nicest and cleanest gas stations that I have visited in awhile).  I ended up going with the "Monster" Chicken Chimichanga combination plate.  The chimichanga was fried to perfection and the chicken was moist and tender.

I am a strong believer that rice and beans can either make or brake a Mexican restaurant ... Roberto's puts out some great rice and beans.

If I lived in AZ ... I would be eating at Roberto's on a weekly basis.  Thank god I don't live in AZ ... Because I would have died of a heart attack yesterday.
