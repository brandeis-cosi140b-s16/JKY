We just got back from Mexico Friday and decided we needed to re-live it on Monday.  Our traveling buddys had been telling us about Phrank's during the trip so we met up with them for lunch....  oh my gosh, delicious!  I had the Divorced Eggs (I can't do the Spanish justice) and my husband had an Adobada Burrito which rivaled our favorite in Albuquerque.  Well worth the drive from Hendertuckey.  We will be back and telling others as well.  And as a bonus, the service was very friendly.
