My husband saw this restaurant on the cooking channel and wanted to try it out! We loved the atmosphere and the staff was great! Everyone was friendly! We went on Valentine's night so it was super packed! Worth the wait! 
I am very picky when eating "Albondiga" soup and these were so delicious! My husband had the carne asada plate and he couldn't finish it! Which is a first, since he can eat! The portion was definitely not small! 
I tried a Strawberry Jalape√±o Margarita and now I am hooked! 
We are definitely coming back here when we go back to visit Vegas!
