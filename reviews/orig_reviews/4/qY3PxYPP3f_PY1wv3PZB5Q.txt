I love the food at Barrio and my favorites are the avocado salsa with the pomegranate seeds and the churro with ice cream and caramel dessert.  I would not call this a guacamole it is more like an amazing chunky salsa.  The food is really filling so I always plan to share when I go and we will get a regular dish and an order of tacos.  I prefer the slow roasted pulled pork tacos but they are all good.  For me the downside is the environment it gets loud.  The tables are close and nothing absorbs the sound in the dining rooms.  I wouldn't recommend going for a serious meeting due to privacy and noise if busy.
