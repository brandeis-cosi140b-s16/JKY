Enjoyed the brisket taco. The tacos looked small but were very filling and really tasty.  Pleasant service with a 20 something clientele and a cool atmosphere.

Have heard about the great outdoor patio,  I'll have to come in the summer and check it out. Will be back for sure. Great selections for beer and drink..
