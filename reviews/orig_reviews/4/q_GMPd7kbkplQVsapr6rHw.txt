Richardson's has been ressurected next door to its sister restaurant and I couldnt be happier.  Richardson's serves southwestern dishes in a cozy atmosphere with incredible mood and ambiance.  There have been misconceptions from others who think that this is straight up mexican food; it is not, this is southwestern food without the texmex spice (although I am a big fan of spicy food).  Richardson's is about the flavors and smells of the desert we live in and for that I love them.

Pick anything on the menu and you will be happy.  If you need a recommendation, most of the waitstaff can tell you what is popular or share with you their personal favorite dish.

Like the Rokerje, do not go to Richardson's expecting a quick in and out meal.  This is an experience, this is a place to take friends or significant others to converse and share a few laughs while enjoying some great food.  If you want to get a quick bite there are plenty of other places for that, this is a place for socializing.
