Happily surprised with the spicy portabello burritos. Super tasty and all the better for being free for my birthday! They also have a great happy hour from 4-6 with $3 margaritas!!! (and half off drafts). Great deal, better than expected food. They also have the option to get a growler of beer, which holds like 5 beers and it seems to be a good deal too (~$12).
