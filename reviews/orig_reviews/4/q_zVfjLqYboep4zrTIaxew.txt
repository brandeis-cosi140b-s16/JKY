Authentic good food.  Casual place and visually nothing special.  The server was funny and cool, the food was great.  Our group ordered a variety of things from tacos to burritos and a whole bunch of things to go into here.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The only thing we thought was that the margs could have been better, nore simple and authentic.  They are a bit americanized with maybe sweet and sour, which sucks.  The food and beer are great though.
