Since moving to LA, I've learn what authentic and good tacos are and Tacos El Gordo is one. Made to order and right in front of you. Though they seem little every taco is packed with meat. We got greedy and ordered too much. And the fries - warning - it's a whole lot of food.

Cheap, authentic and filling. Can't ask for more.
