WAYYY better than the one on cave creek rd. 

This place makes it fresh and they arent pre-made and sitting waiting for an order.

YOu can taste the difference in being made to order.

Of course this takes a bit longer for it to come out, but it is worth it... Also figuring out which of the 20 doors on the building is the right one to enter from is also tricky..
