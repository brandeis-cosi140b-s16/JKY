Stop by this place on a recommendation from my 9 yr old daughter who saw this place on man vs food.   We came, we ate, and we're stoked!     I thought coming from San Diego It wouldn't impress me.   But heeeyyyyy,  it did and we were delighted in everything we had.   3 different kind of tortas and an awesome quesadillas.   

One thing was weird is the fact they they use ruffles potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  

Overall a good place.
