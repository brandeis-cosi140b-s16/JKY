Loving this place since I was a kid. Stopped eating meat three years ago, so I miss the Jerk Fried Rice and Carnitas and Emerald Chicken, BUT the Veggie Quesadilla with black beans and white rice is amazing with their tasty red salsa.

Always amazing customer service and it's great that they let you taste everything before you commit. 

They should lighten their footprint and reduce food packaging. I always feel guilty when I leave with all that aluminum and styrofoam.

BTW, don't be swayed by offers of other cookies; snickerdoodles are where it's at.
