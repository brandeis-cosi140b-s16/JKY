We look forward to Pink Taco happy hour every time we are in Vegas.  Amazing guac, fish tacos and corn fritters... Did I mention the margaritas? Gangster Latino artwork ambiance at it's very best and always a great DJ!  The patio has a poolside view and the service is always on point. Reasonably priced, too.
