First time eating at this place even though we have lived nearby for the last 6 months!  Great food and friendly staff .. we really enjoyed the carne asada plate and red tamale and chicken taco plate :)  One of the staff members suggested the dessert chimis and they were delicious!!!!  We will definitely be back!
