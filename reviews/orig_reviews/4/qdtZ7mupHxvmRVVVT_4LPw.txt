Meal was very flavorful, service was great! I can only stress if you find your meal not to your expectation - ask for a manager!! If you have a request for something outside the box ask it could be possible not a promise but there's always a good chance - menu is pretty diverse. Take a chance I've rated 4 stars here but probably for me is a 3.5 for my overall lifetime experience.
