Best tacos in town!

When I need my mexican food fix, this is the place to go. 

My husband always orders the Carne Asada Burrito, For me, soft tacos!
So good, at least one of each. This time it was Carnitas, Carne Asada & Grilled Pork. All the meats are tender and seasoned great! The toppings of cilantro and raw onions  are fresh & tasty, along with the red and green salsas.

The best and my favorite is the jalepeno pickled carrots and onions. Nothing out of a jar here, they make them fresh! Chopped carrots, sliced onion, jalepenos in a pickling sauce with cloves. Truly the best I have ever had! 

I come here often and am never disappointed. Clean and friendly service!
