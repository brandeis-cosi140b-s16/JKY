Pros: Green Chili, Adovada, New Mexican, margaritas, salsa, bar seating.

Cons: Flex service can slow when busy, inconsistent hours/open times.

Los Dos is a great spot for spicy New Mexican food.  Keep in mind that New Mexican is different than Mexican - spicy with green chili either highlighting or supporting many dishes.  The flavor profile is similar, but not the same, which seems to throw off some of the reviews for this spot.  The food is excellent, and certainly representative of New Mexico.

Parking is pretty easy to negotiate, located behind the building via a narrow drive to the east side of the building.  

When its really busy, service can be patchy - it seems they operate with minimal front staff.  You'll likely have different servers and runners stopping by throughout the course of your meal to check on you, if you need something, flag any of them instead of waiting for the person that took your order.  I doubt they assign specific servers to specific sections.  Also, I drove there several days after a holiday and they were closed, which was pretty annoying.  Their hours have been inconsistent for me in the past, sometimes closing early, or not open, and so on.

Overall, the food is excellent and a must-try in the area.  The food gets 5 stars.  The restaurant may be closed when you stop by, and the service may go either way, but its still worth a try.
