Hello Yelp!  It's been a while.  In this economy who can really afford to eat out?  With that being said I allow myself a treat once in a while.  Tia Rosa came and went quickly in this space.  I was so happy to see that Nando's was taking it over!  I had been to Nando's in Gilbert and loved it.  They did a wonderful job remodeling and adding a beautiful patio to the space.  There are big screen TVs great for watching sports in the bar and on the patio.  It has a cozy feel that Tia Rosa did not have.  Now for the food. I've been here a few times and each time they did not disappoint.  The Chips and Salsa are delicious.  Hot, fresh chips and tasty salsa.  I've had the Chicken Chimichanga and the Pollo Rico.  The chicken is moist and tender and both entrees did not skimp!  Rice and beans are good.  The rice is fluffy and moist.  The beans are a tad bland but then it's beans so what are you gonna do?  They have killer margaritas in many different version for every taste and a giant tequila list.  Nando's is in my top 2 for mexican.  If you have not tried it.....what are you waiting for??  Go....now....there is a margarita calling your name!
