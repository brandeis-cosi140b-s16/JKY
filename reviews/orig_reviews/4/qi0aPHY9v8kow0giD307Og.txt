The ambiance is super simp√°tico, we loved it.  The inside was quite cozy, four 4 tops and two 2 tops.  Plenty of seating outside ands while it was cold, they had a lot of patio heaters going.  Great use of space.

Hubby and I ordered 4 different plates to try and taste a bit of everything.  The calamari fries are way yummy, crispy and the squid is cooked perfectly.  The dipping sauces were very tasty.  The cod fish tacos were spot on, delicious balance of fish and condiments.
The low points were the mahi fish tacos and the clam chowder.  
The mahi was too delicate for the mango salsa. I could only taste the mango salsa in the fish, nothing more.  
The clam chowder must have been bottom of the pot as it was super salty and a bit gummy.  I am sure under other circumstances it would have been great.
