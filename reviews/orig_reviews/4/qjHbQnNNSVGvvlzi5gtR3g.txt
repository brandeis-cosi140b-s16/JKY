Been here almost a dozen times; always satisfied and no complaints. 
Service is always good,  the food and drinks are  always tasty,  ambiance is kick back,  today(Sunday late  afternoon) they had a two- man band that is awesome to listen to, and it's never over- crowded or too loud like their sister restaurant,  Gallo Blanco.  
You can't go wrong with their menu, it's simple to understand and well thought out! A must try!
