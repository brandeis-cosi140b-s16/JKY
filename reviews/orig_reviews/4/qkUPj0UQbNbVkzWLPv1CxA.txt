Go for lunch and go before 11:30 or order out. Its crowded and loud and the food is pretty good. We eat here often, but I have had better at Matta's. Their enchiladas in red sauce and flying saucers with no dressing but with their green chili salsa are family favorites. The servers are fast and friendly. Parking is awful and the wait can get ridiculous at dinner time.
