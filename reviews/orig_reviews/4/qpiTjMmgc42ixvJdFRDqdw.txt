My lady wanted Mexican food, so we decided to stop by the place on a Saturday night.  I have been here before for lunch and had a good experience.  So we ordered the 5 small taco plate along with a casa asada burrito (enchilada style).  The food was super good and flavorful.  Everything was delicious.  I wish we would of ordered the Nachos though.  The table next to us did, and they looked amazing.  The meats were super flavorful and the sauces were great!  You order from a counter and they make it fresh right in front of you.  The service was good and food was awesome. 

I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat.  We normally go to Carolina's down the street, but glad we stopped by here.
