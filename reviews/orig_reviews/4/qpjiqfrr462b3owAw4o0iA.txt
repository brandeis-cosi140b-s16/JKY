Came here after my boyfriend had done seen it on Yelp. It is not by any means a large spacious restaurant. However, the best Mexican restaurants are primarily a hole in the wall. 

We split the House Margarita. We had asked for no salt but it still came salted. It was good,  although I don't like salt on my margarita when I am trying one for the first time because I want to know what it tastes like without anything added.

I got a lot of food (because I couldnt decide what to get). I got the traditional Quesadilla which is ironically not a traditional quesadilla. It is a corn tortilla  folded over that has Oaxaca Cheese inside and its fried. Its kinda like a Calzone but better. If I had to pick a cheese that could possibly be my favorite cheese in Mexican cuisine it would be Oaxaca. The Quesadilla was amazing but it is HUGE. I was expecting something around the size of my hand.  Nope, one half was probably the size of my hand. We did ask for no crema but they still put it on there. I also got the Conchita Lonche, the meat was delicious but the bread was kinda hard. It does come with mustard, which I was not expecting. It would be a great thing to order for Lunch for anyone who works downtown (which I do).  My boyfriend got the shark taco but I was not up for trying it mainly because I barely eat fish tacos when it is cod inside. It did look good displayed on his plate. I didn't get to try the beans but the rice was good. I have a hard time judging rice because I still believe my Nana makes the best white rice. 

The service wasn't bad but the woman was the only one really taking care of tables and about 4 tables including us walked in probably within 5 mins. So she was running around taking orders, running food and then touching back to the tables to see if anything was alright.  

In the end, I definitely am coming back.
