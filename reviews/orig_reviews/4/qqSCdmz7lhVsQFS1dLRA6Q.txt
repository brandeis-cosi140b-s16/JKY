We had a bacon burger, plain burger, cheeseburger and a Beach House burger, french fries and sweet potato tater tots.  Three of the burgers were good, with the fourth a bit overcooked and the bun burned.  French fries were just OK and the tator tots were a bit mushy.  Unique menu with several vegetarian options including taco salads.  Service was good and very friendly.  Go!
