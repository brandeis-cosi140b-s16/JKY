This place has the best, margarita's like fish bowl size!! and have every tequila you can imagine. they start you with fresh chips from cooker and serve you up, a assortment of salsa 3 to be exact!!! Shrimp cocktail is with monster prawns !!! I had a enchilada & shredded taco dinner !!! It was very tasty!!! and filling! I recommend this place even if it's just for shot's of tequila & beer, at the bar !! nice decor & good service!
