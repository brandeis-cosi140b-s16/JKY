Really awesome place. Solid food. Their salsa was really good and I'm crazy picky when it comes to salsa. The cheese plate was awesome too but I didn't think the chimichurri didn't fit; however the honey was great and so were the jalape√±o roasts peanuts.

I wish they had a better beer selection. I know it's not that kind of restaurant but being a huge craft beer fan it always bums me out when restaurants have a poor selection. I don't go there for the beer which is why it still gets 4 stars because their food was really good. Good mix of Latin with a modern twist.
