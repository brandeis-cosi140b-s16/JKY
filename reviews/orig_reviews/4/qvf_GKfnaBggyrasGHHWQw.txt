So glad we found this place. They are open late for us night owls yet still serve GREAT food. Most places that are open late are not very good, but Juan Jaime's never disappoints. I am absolutely addicted to their refried beans - I am pretty sure they're made fresh onsite, because they taste so good! My only complaint is that, in my opinion, the food is a bit overpriced (it IS Mexican food - just beans, cheese and tortillas in various combinations lol).
I will still go and recommend this place because the service is consistently fabulous!
