I have gone to Yo Rita three times now, and each has been enjoyable.  I like their diverse menu when it comes to tacos and the fact that the menu changes, however I'm sad that they don't have some of the tacos that I've really enjoyed.  The crispy potatoes (starter) are very good.  The salsas that they bring you are also super tasty; you can fill up on chips and salsa easily.  Most of the tacos that I've tried are excellent, but sometimes there are misses - some have been kind of bland.  I think the price is reasonable - I only ever need to get 2 tacos to feel full, and I usually don't eat them all since they're always so jam packed.  My husband really likes this place, and even my stepson was happy with the chicken taco that he tried (I was kind of shocked).  Service is a little slow at times, but it can be a busy place and they definitely don't have many servers it seems.
