My dad has been bringing me to Pedro's since I was a little girl.  I always get the same thing, chicken chimichanga - it's ooohh so good.  It's not those big chunks of precooked shamrock chicken that you get at a lot of Mexican food places, it's real chicken and it's been cooked with love, you can tell.  Chips and salsa are both hot and fresh, always.  The place is small and sometimes you have to wait for a table but it's always worth the wait.  The ladies bathroom is gross, just hold it until you get somewhere safe.
