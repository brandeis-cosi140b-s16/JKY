The California burrito and chimichanga are the best I've experienced in Arizona so far. 
They also have awesome salsas which I seem to grab way more than I need when I'm there. 
My only complaints are going to be the lack of seating, the length of time it takes to get your food sometimes and the clerk can be extremely rude. 
So I've chosen to get it to go and make sure I'm not on a time restraint when picking up food here. 
Also, the burritos are smaller than the ones I'n used to, but they're cheaper too!
