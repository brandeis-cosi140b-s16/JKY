Ok...I love Chipotle.  It's pretty hard to mess that up.  I'm a super huge fan of being able to coach the exact distribution of the ingredients going into my burrito.  The cilantro-lime rice just makes the burrito.  Doesn't matter if you add the super yummy, well seasoned, chicken or the melt in your mouth carnitas...The food is always great.  

The only reason for four stars vs. five stars is the physical building.  The actual dining area is much smaller than most Chipotles that I've frequented and the vibe here felt a bit different too...Don't know quite how to explain that one so I know it's not much help.
