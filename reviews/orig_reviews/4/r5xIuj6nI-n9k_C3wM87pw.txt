Really good tacos on the strip rignt next to Encore Resort.
$ 2.00 Tacos
excellent asada and spicy tacos and tripe is fried. really good tripe if you never had one.
3 different lines that you order first then pay at the cashier.
line for asada ( make sure you ask for grilled chili and onions)
line for pork and last line for tripe or stomach.
very friendly staff. only wish is they could be more generous on guacamole.
