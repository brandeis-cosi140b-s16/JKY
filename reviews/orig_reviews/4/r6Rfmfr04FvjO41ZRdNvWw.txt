Things started off a little slow trying to give my order. But that's pretty normal for your first time somewhere. Then they messed up my order and I almost didn't say anything. But I did and they fixed it no problem. So that's the service. 

The food? Amazing. Just a really really solid taco. Really fresh. I thought it was a little pricey but after seeing what I get I'm ok with it. I definitely ordered way too much food. Next experience I will be even better I'm sure.
