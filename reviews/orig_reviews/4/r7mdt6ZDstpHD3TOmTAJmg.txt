Our little family really likes this place.  The food is affordable, the portions are large, and the Mexican is clearly authentic.  I've liked their enchiladas and chimichangas, and who can ever argue with endless chips and salsa?  PBR for a dollar is a good way to go too.  Make sure you check-in here on Yelp, they often run specials.  This is our go-to Mexican place in Charlotte so far.
