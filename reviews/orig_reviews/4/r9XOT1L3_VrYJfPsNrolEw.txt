From the looks of it, this place occupies an old Pizza Hut. The inside however, is nicely decorated with with plenty of wood and metal (somewhat similar to Chipotle's industrial style) along with Mexican artifacts to give it a distinctly non-pizza vibe.

It's a fast causal, order-at-the-counter spot with friendly service. The carnitas tacos -- filled with tender, moist, and crispy-edged chunks of meat -- were the best items I tried. The al pastor lacked the depth and heat of greater versions around town. The carne asada was solid --  quality meat that was under seasoned but still decent. There are several flavors of agua frescas available with the option of mixing them together. The strawberry mango flavor was so good it was gone before the food hit the table.
