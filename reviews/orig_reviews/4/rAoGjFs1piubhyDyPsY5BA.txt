So honey and I wanted a lunch out one fine Sunday afternoon.. so, with our baby in tow, we hit this joint up.  Not busy, so we got seated promptly.. outdoor in their patio area with the great weather.
Our server guy was great - very friendly, talkative, prompt and gave good recommendations.  I had the spiked Horchata (with Frangelico) and hubby had on-tap beer.
His three tacos came out and, unfortunately, I didnt' get a chance to taste them but he appeared to enjoy them as I didn't hear a word otherwise.  My dish, the cochinito pibil torta was SOOO GOOD... that pineapple slaw was a perfect accompaniment and they *perfectly* buttered and toasted the soft, yummy torta the way I would!
I thoroughly enjoyed that torta and really really liked the horchata.. grainy the way real home-made horchata is.
I'd definitely come back, though not that regularly as it is a bit pricey for regular eating out for me.
