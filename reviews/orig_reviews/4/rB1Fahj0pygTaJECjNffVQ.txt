Went to Vegas last month and somehow my mom found this place and really wanted to try it. It was actually pretty fantastic. Just a great place to hangout and have some great food. I know I had tacos and I think they were fancy tacos like ribeye or something fancy. So delicious, everyone was jealous. They also had veggie options for my mom :) And don't forget the fried ice cream! YUM! But it's kinda rock hard so let it sit for a bit before digging in. Service was FANTASTIC :)
