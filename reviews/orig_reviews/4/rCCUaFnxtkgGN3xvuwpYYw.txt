This was a fun place, which had been recommended by a few people I know. A bit difficult to find because of the mostly residential setting and very crowded due to happy hour. 
In all honesty the service was slow though the server did keep coming back to apologize. 
Bonus was that for the healthy eater there were options. Often this is a very difficult task! 
I thought the chips and salsa were good - flour chip ones were great.
I do wish that their "hot" salsa had been spicier though I do have a love of exceptionally spicy food & for me, habanero salsa is "medium". 
I would definitely go back though. Good evening overall.
