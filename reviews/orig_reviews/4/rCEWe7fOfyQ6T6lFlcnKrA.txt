Best tamales in town very nice and moist the pork is so tender and flavorful. The salsa isn't the most flavorful but we weren't there for that so we added some salt and some lime from the beers and it fixed it right up. Already been here a few times. Always good to go on the night when they have the 2 tamale enchilada style for the special especially during happy hour! Love it!
