An upscale-looking Mexican joint in the questionable part of Main Street? That's El Sombrero! They've received a lot of worthy Yelp love for their brunch and lunch specials- I came for the latter. 

Lunch menu offers several choices. I got the chile relleno, which is a solid vegetarian (but not vegan) option. Add chicken or brisket for an additional charge to make it more hearty (and less vegetarian). Sides of rice and beans were well-done staples, the chile itself was nicely stuffed and blistered- brisket was a good amount but underseasoned. $17 for lunch is a bit steep for a "special" but I enjoyed the food and atmosphere.

Interior is a modern black and white scheme with clever Spanish quotes written on the mirrored walls and nice light fixtures. Staff was very welcoming and helpful, takeout order was packed nicely and even included the chips and salsa you usually miss out on by not dining in!

Would try again for brunch. Food is flavorful without being greasy, covered in cheese, or overly spicy like many people expect for Mexican cuisine.
