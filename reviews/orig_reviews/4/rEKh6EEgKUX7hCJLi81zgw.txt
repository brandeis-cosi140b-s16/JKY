If you are a huge glutton for cheese, Nando's is your paradise.  If you're looking for anything low-cal, don't waste your time.  Fortunately for me, I am fiend for all things frommage, and as Nando's is a stone's throw from my home, I frequent it fairly often.

Though it's well-hidden behind an Arby's and some other strip-mall junk, Nando's has a cute patio and a nice atmosphere inside.  If the service isn't exactly inspired, it's always very fast.  Portions are gigantic at Nando's, not that I ever leave with leftovers, or anything.  

They have quite a few nice combo options, and I can speak to the deliciousness of the Pollo Rico, as well as any of their enchiladas.  Again, be mindful that no matter what you order, you'll be consuming several cups of cheese, at a minimum.  That disclaimer aside, I think Nando's is yummy, and the prices are pretty solid, as well.
