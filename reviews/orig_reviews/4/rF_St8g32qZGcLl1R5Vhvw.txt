Very fun, upbeat place to hang out with a group of friends!

I've actually had a couple of friends perform at Crescent Ballroom, and hear that most other performers/shows end up being pretty entertaining as well.

Service and food were so-so, but didn't take away from the overall experience. Looking forward to my next visit here!
