I fell in love with this place a few weeks ago when my friend and I decided to try it on a whim. (By friend, I mean fellow foodie).  I love that Los Reyes isn't your typical Mexican place.  Not that I don't love that food, but this place is a cut above.  

My friend and I tried the cheese quesadilla del rey which was my first quesadilla made with corn tortillas and green sauce.  Muy delicioso! We also shared the Cubano torta which was very tasty.  I loved the cantaloupe juice I ordered, but I could see how many might not.  If you're not a real cantaloupe fan, it's a bit much.  
The next time I went with a different friend, we ordered the del rey torta which was HUGE!  We couldn't even eat half of it.  I know they are known for this torta, but the combination of meats was a bit much for me.  I preferred the Cubano.  We also ordered the Huarache with carne asada and it was very good.  I would order it again.

I can't wait to go back and try some more of their fruit delicacies and maybe a platillo or some tacos.  This place seems one-of-a-kind.  The servers were super nice and friendly, even though both times we were the only gringos in the place and had to point to the menu.  I will make this place a regular stop.
