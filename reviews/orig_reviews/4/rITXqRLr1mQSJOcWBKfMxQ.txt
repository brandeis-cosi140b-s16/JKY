My fiance and a couple of our friends returned here on Tuesday night to take advantage of industry night. It is definitely worth waiting until 9pm to eat! Food was fantastic, drinks were delicious, and service was top notch. It doesn't hurt that all 4 of us were able to stuff ourselves for a mere $80! :)
