I was feeling like eating Mexican food on the way back from my long trail run at Lake Las Vegas to Summerlin, and since I was going to pass all those Mexican neighborhods, I called my Mexican friend to recommend me a good Mexican place in that part of town.

As usual, she replies "none", you have to make them from home, but she did mention a few places and since Don Juan was pretty closed off of 515 that I was on, I decided to come here.  

It was reassuring when half of the parking lot was filled with Nissans.  Mexican folks seem to love Nissans.  The interior was strangely filled with Frida Kahlo stuff.  I was somewhat uncomfortable being surrounded by unibrow paintings but I got used to it.  

Chips with salsa/bean dip, tostadas with ceviche, carne asada burrito plate.  

The burrito was FULL of carne asada, unlike stuff you get at typical chain places where you find a few pieces of meat among a LOT of rice and beans.  It was the opposite and VERY filling.  Ceviche was good, but I'm more used to central American type of ceviche where there are big chunks of fish, but all of the fish ceviches I've had at Mexican places seem to have small, flaky sort of fish, but it was good in a different way.  

Depsite my running 8+ miles and having an enormous appetite, I did not have space left for tamales that were ordered so I had to take them home.  

All in all, I liked the food and I would definitely go back there.
