I remember going to Backyard Taco when it was actually in a backyard. (I know, I know, what a hipster thing to say.) Back then, I enjoyed the food but the wait and service were hardly worth it (granted, it was someone's backyard, so I couldn't really complain). So while I was anxious to try out the new restaurant, I approached it with a fair amount of skepticism.

Sure, my first time there the food took a while. The restaurant had just opened so I imagine they had some bugs to work out. I've been back several times and the food arrives much quicker.

Portion wise, don't expect much from the tacos; they are very small. I'm not against small tacos, not one bit, I'm just against not getting my money's worth. For their size, you'd expect to pay a bit less. That said, they're quite tasty so the price doesn't keep me from ordering a couple each time I go. Get a quesadilla if you want more bang for your buck.

I give points to any restaurant that serves bottled Mexican Coke. I'd love it if they ditched their fountain drinks all together for a better variety of bottle sodas (there are so many great Mexican sodas) but I'm likely one of the few who thinks that way. (To be honest, I'd love it if every restaurant went this route.)

The clean and simple design of the restaurant is nice.

This is certainly not the best taco joint in the Valley, but I love having a solid original, non-chain restaurant so close to where I work (there are so few food options in this part of Mesa). I've seen a couple different restaurants pass through this building while living in Mesa. Here's hoping Backyard Taco sticks around.
