Big ol' sushi rolls the size of your face? Yes, please. 

I came in during their first week and I opted for the select your own option. I chose salmon, soft shell crab, cucumber, yuzu guacamole and tobiko. The staff was new and just learning, but patience was key and they were really trying to learn.

They let you try any of the sauces and add anything on the side if you prefer. I was impressed by how friendly and accommodating everyone was and I look forward to giving them another try soon. If only they were closer to home.
