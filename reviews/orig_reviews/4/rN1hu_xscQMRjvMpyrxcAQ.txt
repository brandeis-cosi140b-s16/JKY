A great place to have a beer, fresh chips and great salsa!  Do not miss out on the rib eye tacos, they are to-die-for!  The diablo sauce is perfect accoutrement for these small slices of heaven.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  The kitchen can be a bit slow at times, but the fresh salsas (three of them!) and the bean dip keep coming, so the wait is worth it.  Large portions, if you leave hungry that's your fault!  Parking can be a challenge on Fridays and Saturdays.  Great atmosphere, excellent food, great service.  Definitely worth the drive.
