We only popped in for a little nosh, but my life was changed. The table side guacamole was amazing and elevated to a whole new level.  I loved the addition of the pepitas on top. This weekend, I had to attend a picnic and brought guacamole.  I stole the idea from the mission to add the pepitas and it was a big hit. 

We also sampled some of their tacos, the carne asada being the favorite in the group.

The back patio is a great place to spend a meal or two.
