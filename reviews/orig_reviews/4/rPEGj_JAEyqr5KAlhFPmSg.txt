Great food & service. Have driven by there for years and finally decided we needed to give it a try, glad we did.

Guacamole as a starter. Had the Chile Verde "Mauser", superb! Pork cooked to perfection, verde sauce tantalized my taste buds, some of the tastiest I have had anywhere.

Grandson's loved their meals and the fried ice cream.
