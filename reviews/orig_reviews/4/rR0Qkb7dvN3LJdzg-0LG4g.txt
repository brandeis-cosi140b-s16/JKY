EDGY MEXICAN CON SAVOR. Chicharron of grilled cheese, "green" rice, Grilled Chicken, Sangria. Cock a doodle DOO! White Rooster is a jewel. 

--revamped spot has finally found the right groove. Sealed concrete and faux Herman Miller with unique modern touches. 
--"chicharron" of grilled cheese is a must have. No flaky pig skin here, and you'll want to order another on righ away. 
--fresh ingredients throughout, down to the authentic flavorings of the real Mexican queso fresco atop the beans. 
--asado of the chicken asado preserves delightful juicyness of the meat troughout each delectable crispy bite
--"green" rice topped with wonderful limed greens
--New York steak was not filet mignon, but hard to find fault with the flavor packed in those grilled veggies. 
--cheeseburger fresh and greasy good covered with more of that delicious cheese mix
--banana crepes were simple and elegant dolloped with creme fresh
--fresh fruit is more of the garnish from the  sangria cocktails. How'd he know I wanted more of exactly that?!

--menu somewhat small, but that kitchen is tiny. Quality over quantity any day. 
--exposed surfaces make for a noisy atmosphere, not the quiet candlelight spot
--server Daniel is always on top of it
--chef often visits the dining room making sure every chair and every fork is in place

I can't wait to go back.
