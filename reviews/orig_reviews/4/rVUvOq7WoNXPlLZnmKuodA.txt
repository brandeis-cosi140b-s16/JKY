Was in town for the day and had a late lunch here.  For a Saturday afternoon it wasn't crowded at all but then again I was there well after a normal lunch crowd and before an early dinner crowd.  

The food was very good.  The corn bread was some of the best I've had and the frozen margarita was very good as well.  I had the Chicken Burrito and it was amazing.  The flavor was very good and the chicken was very tender and flavorful.   It had a bit of a kick to it but not bad.  I don't come out this way that often but if I find myself back in town I would certainly come back her again.
