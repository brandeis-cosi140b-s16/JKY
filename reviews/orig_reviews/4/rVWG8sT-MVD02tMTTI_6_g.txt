Great food, great service, and worth every dollar.  Came here at the end of our multi-state, multi-canyon tour and had to find a restaurant that was open late since we'd be arriving at Phoenix late.  The Mission was a great find.  The food was bursting with flavors and Jemar, our server, was friendly and knowledgeable.  Would definitely come here again the next time we come in town.  The only reason I took off one star was because it's a bit noisy for us.
