Let me just start out with a warning: I was in no way sober during my meal at Pink Taco, so if you feel that will reduce the merit of my opinion, please stop reading now.

After a day of non-stop gambling and drinking at the Hard Rock what could sound better than a monstrous burrito and Corona. First off, the hostess, servers, waiters, etc... all recognize the average customer is at least half-in-the-bag and they keep a fun and lively atmosphere going as a result, so it's a fun place. The food is also served in enormous portions and it's pretty damn good... especially when all your body needs is some carbs and grease to get right back on track. If you're a guest at the Hard Rock and need a quick pick me up after a hard day of partying, don't put too much drunk thought into it, just roll into Pink Taco and enjoy.
