My wife and I frequent VL quite often,especially when we have the BOGO coupon. What a great deal! I agree the parking could be better,but hey,I've been more frustrated in a lot larger lots. The hosts could be more attentive and friendlier at times but,all in all, pretty typical of teens with their first attempts in the working world. Sometimes we wait as long as 15 min. but it is usually worth the wait. Have been going to the Cave Creek Rd. VL for many years and can only remember one really bad dining experience. Everyone has an off night now and then I guess. Usually I get the Pollo Fundido (awesome and filling) and my wife gets the Baja Shrimp Tacos (she won't even try anything else cuz they're so good!) The  building could use some updating. New carpet and fresh paint would do wonders. They did put a new fan in the waiting area. :)  The service is usually adequate but seldom outstanding due to the fact that they are usually very busy. If you happen to be fortunate enough to catch them during a slow time it is a very pleasant dining experience with great service. Hopefully Valle Luna will be there for many more years!
