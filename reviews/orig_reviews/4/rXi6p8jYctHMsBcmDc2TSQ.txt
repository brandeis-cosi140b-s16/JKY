This is actually a really good authentic Mexican restaurant. I would reccomend to anyone. Their street tacos are ALMOST as good as real street tacos from the taco stand in the hood lol. If you go you gotta get dessert.! Best fried ice cream I've ever had! Yummy! Great atmosphere. Servers are friendly.
