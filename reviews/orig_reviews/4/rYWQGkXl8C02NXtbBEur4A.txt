Javier's is a great restaurant in the Aria and, while it is a bit upscale, it is very authentic Mexican, in terms of the cuisine, but also in terms of the environment (bartenders / waiting staff, music, drink selection, etc.).

It is definitely pricier than it should be, and that's the only thing keeping it from five stars in my book.
