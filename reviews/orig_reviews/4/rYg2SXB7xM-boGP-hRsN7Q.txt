Los Sombreros is one of our favorite spots for Mexican food. My husband and I have been going here for years - back when we were first dating! We've always had a good time and a good meal here. However, we've only ever eaten dinner/happy hour here.

Our favorite is the Puerco en Chipotle. It's basically a huge portion of slow roasted and extra juicy pork in a chipotle sauce with Oaxaca cheese on top. Oh my god. This just melts in your mouth. The flavors are so good together. I just wish it had more cheese! 

My husband has had the Lamb adobo before, which is a lamb shank in a spicy sauce. Again, this is really tender and flavorful. 

I've had the smoked chicken enchilada dinners several times here and they are consistently good. The chicken is flavorful and blends well with the chipotle crema. 

For happy hour we've had the grilled ribeye steak tacos, guacamole, and well margaritas. Everything was good, but the steak wasn't as tender as the other meats we've had here and probably wouldn't order again. 

For dessert, they have rotating flan flavors. The traditional flan is my husband's favorite, but mine is the Bailey's/Kahlua flan. Oooh, oh so good. This is a great way to end the night.
