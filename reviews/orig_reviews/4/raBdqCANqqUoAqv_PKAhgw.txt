We recently moved down the street from here and were pleasantly surprised by this little place.  Though the food portions could be considered small (come on people, we as a country could stand to lessen our portions a bit!) I find them to be enough.  The carne asada is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had.  The margarita's are really yummy and the fact that they are on tap makes me love them even more.  The horchata is also note worthy and if you want, they'll even add some booze to it for a small up-charge.  Hey-o!
