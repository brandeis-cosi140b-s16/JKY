I was in town for a business trip and found this place off the beaten path using my streetfinder. It was really chill, laid back and had lots of diverse people in there from college kids to small families with young kids and a couple of people on dates in between. Young waitstaff who were really friendly and energetic waited on you and gave good suggestions for grub. They have a red bull mixed drink that is AMAZING--if you like red bull that is, I forget what they added into it but it was great.  I had the black bean soup, it was spicy and not boring by any means. The tacos I had were not the most tasty but maybe it was because I got the grilled ones and also b/c I had just had a really tasty soup right before.  I would recommend the place though for a relaxed hang out and decent tex mexy kinda food.
