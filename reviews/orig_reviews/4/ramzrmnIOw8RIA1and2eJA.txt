TG has risen from the ashes and spread it's wings. New front room, bigger kitchen but same good stuff. Try a bunch of tacos ($2) and a couple of sopes (a $3 pile of awesome) if you like but the steak Platillo Guadalajara ($10) is my favorite. Wash it down with a couple of Negra Modelos and walk away a fan muy contento.
