Went to Barrio cafe on a busy Friday night during the 'chilly' season in Phoenix. We were there to celebrate the remembrance of a family member in an upbeat way. 
The food was great, starting with the table side guacamole (do it!). It was really tasty for me, though some people at my table weren't into the while pomegranate seeds. I get it. 
My entree was amazing, I had the Chiles en Nogada. Almost anything with that much cream and butter will be amazing, but I savored every last bite and wished for more. 
The atmosphere was so-so. Unfortunately they had a band playing that was too loud for the small space, and this on top of a packed restaurant with several guests waiting caused us to be unable to hear each other speak. Hopefully they will keep the live music to less busy nights in the future.
