I was super hungry after a delayed flight. Yelp came to the rescue once again by leading me to this super yummy spot. Went with the Machaca combo based on two recommendations by locals. I was also told to try the green burrito. Several people in line in front of me ordered that. Bottom line, the food was bomb! 

Four stars cause I hate driving to this neighborhood, but screw it - I'm coming here EVERY chance I get!
