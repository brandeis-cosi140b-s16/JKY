I only ate 3 things at Cien Agaves so that is was this following review is based on.

1. The chips and salsa are great. People were saying it was too watery, but I disagree it was extremely flavorful with great chips.

2. The classic margarita is 100% perfect. Not only was the taste perfect but they didn't wimp out on the tequila. The color was spot on. 

3. The carne asada taco. One word, delicious. I think this might be the best taco is the valley. Everywhere I go I try their carne asada taco, and this place was by far the best. I am just unhappy it took me this long to find Cien!!!

I will return.
