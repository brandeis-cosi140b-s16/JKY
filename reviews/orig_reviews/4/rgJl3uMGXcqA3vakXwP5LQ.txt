what can I say about this place? It's damn good.. one server in the place but she had two people helping her.. She has it down tho..I watched her go from table to table taking orders and answering question about the menu..

Her answer to the food.. "ITS BOMB".. and it definitely was.

a "half order " of bulgogi nachos can feed two..
bulgogi tacos
and a bulgogi burrito.
tasted all three..all were "BOMB"

I can't wait to go back again.. that is all.
