I love going to this place. It has a great atmosphere. I always try to sit by the duck pond. My baby, as well as my tablemates, love to watch the ducks and turtles. There is always some drama with the goose and mallards. Its great. It is like watching the discovery channel. 
I give the atmosphere 5 stars. 

The food is good. Is it the greatest Mexican? No it isn't. The food is probably a 3. It is good Mexican and I enjoy it. The chips and salsa are good because you get 3 different salsas. I have had the salad fresca with shrimp and it was good. I did not think the shrimp was worth it, and would probably just get it plain next time. 

If you are in Cave Creek, you should go here or take out of town guests. There is no atmosphere like it. Plus afterwards you can check out the shops across the street.
