This is one of my favorite spots to accompany my wife too. The hammered copper bar top is cool while the ambiance is just plane awesome in this New Mexican cuisine restaurant. We usually start with their Chips, salsa, and guacamole while I get a beer on tap. The wife gets a prickly pear margarita or a glass of wine from their great and reasonably priced wine list.  Although I have tried just about everything in the menu and many of their specials, I find myself going back to the chile rellenos platter. They offer two chiles stuffed with one of their several different stuffings. I like to mix it up and get one topped with red sauce while the other topped with green sauce. My wife is from NM, and she has stated many times that this is by far the best spot in AZ for NM styled food.
