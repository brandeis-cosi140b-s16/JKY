OMG someone needs break the thumbs of the hostess so she doesn't continue to snap her fingers.  She can't seem to get enough of it and it's driving me crazy!  Maybe she's training for West Side Story or something because she's going to town and won't stop!

However, the chips and salsa are great!  I had a chili rellleno and a beef taco and they were fantastic. My wife had the Vegetarian Burrito and like it as well. It's great to see this location near our home have good food.

The waiter and table service was excellent as well.

 I will be back (with ear muffs)!
