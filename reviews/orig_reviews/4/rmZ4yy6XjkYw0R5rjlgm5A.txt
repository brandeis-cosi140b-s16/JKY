strictly out of curiousity i tried this place out. big fan of hawaiian food. ordered a kalua pig burrito, with charred pineapple verde sauce. had black beans, seaweed rice, sour cream, cheese, lettuce. big fan of kalua pig, and this is right up there. the flavors weren't eye popping, but it was just a great burrito in general. you have to give it up to them, for introducing a somewhat new concept.  im planning to try the steak next.definitely a great place, to grab a bite to eat, nothing fancy just sit down, but you know you're getting quality food, at a reasonable price. came in there, during a tuesday afternoon, apparently they had new staff that was being prepped on the business, might have been the owner that was talking to them. like what he had to say, as far as running an operation, I manage a kitchen myself, these guys seem to get it right.
