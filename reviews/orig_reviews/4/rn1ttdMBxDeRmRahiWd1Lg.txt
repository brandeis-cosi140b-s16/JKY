Jalapeño Inferno is now a great new addition to my list of lunch spots close enough to the airpark to not be absurdly late for work! I recently went here for a team lunch after doing a little research and was pleasantly surprised by how good things turned out. 

The chips and salsa were great, but the salsa lacked that gritty (I'm in a hole-in-the-wall) flavor that I truly love. The spiciness is toned down a little more than I like too, but the flavors were very tasty,especially their version of a spicy selection. The chips though, that's where they got me... Some of the chips are regular corn chips that you would expect in a Mexican restaurant (but with quality) and the other chips were just cuts of tortilla that were deep fried! I couldn't stop eating them!

For my real lunch, after eating more than enough calories in chips, was Courtney's Favorite Burrito Inferno with chicken. It was off the very hot portion of the menu. The chicken inside the burrito was awesome. It was nice and blackened before being chopped up for my burrito and I could tell. The burrito itself was topped with Inferno sauce and hatch chiles, and it totally won me over. It wasn't the best burrito I've ever had, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was really good. I also got to try some of the Mexican pizza. If you can imagine what good nachos taste like, you'll understand the flavor, but now imagine that feeling of the perfect bite when eating nachos throughout eat bite! The Mexican pizza at Jalapeño's calms down your brain's instant guilt trip by rewarding your taste buds with a  perfect bite every time.

Jalapeño's was great for lunch and it was great for a group. The waitress seemed a little bit impatient, but next time I visit here I will update and clarify if that was just a fluke. If you're in the airpark for lunch, drive a couple miles north and give this place a try; it ain't bad.
