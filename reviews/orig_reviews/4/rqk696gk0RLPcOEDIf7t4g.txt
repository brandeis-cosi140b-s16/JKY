I don't think I've ever gone to a place for Dinner, went to do other stuff and then come back to the same place for Second Dinner. That's how good these tacos are.  

We had abodaba, tongue, and shoulder (over the course of our two visits) all with everything.  The adodaba comes with pineapple and somehow that makes it even better!  

The line was longer at 9pm, but it still moved rather quickly.  Do note there are several  lines each making a couple kinds of tacos, not just one line and you can get fries at any of those. 

Super delicious.  Totally affordable. Can't wait to go back.
