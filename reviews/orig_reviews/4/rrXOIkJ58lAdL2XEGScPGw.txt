Upon the recommendation of a friend, my fiance and I decided to give this place a shot. We were not disappointed! The food and drinks were phenomenal and the service was fantastic! 

First the service: the hostess was pleasant and we were seated right away. Our waitress was nice and knowledgeable about the menu. 

Now the food/drinks:

Passion fruit margarita- Delicious! Not too sweet and in lieu of salt, they use a chili lime salt concoction around the rim. Really good!

Queso fundito w/short rib: My favorite dish of the night! Gooey melted cheese, juicy braised short rib, and tasty salsa verde......I mean how could you go wrong?

Espada tacos: Perfectly blackened swordfish,  spicy aioli, & jalapeno slaw make for one tasty taco!

Elote: Yum! That's all I can say about this elote. 

Torrejas de bolillo: Ok, so I am not a dessert fan, especially bread pudding, but this dessert was soooo good! Just the right combination of buttery and sweet. 

I can't argue with other comments about this place being pricey,  but I don't mind when I am paying for great food. However, it does mean limited visits. But I hear there is industry night every Tuesday, so I'm looking forward to taking advantage of 50% off the entire menu very soon!
