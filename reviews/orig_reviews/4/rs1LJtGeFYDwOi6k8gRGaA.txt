While on a trip we were directed to this restaurant.  I will say in advance that I cannot handle really spicy foods, but my husband can. Hard to find a Mexican restaurant that we can agree on. 
We were seated inside since the patio was not open. I hope to time it differently next time, the patio looked like a fun place to be. 
Our meal was great and the server very patient with us. Great suggestions. 
I was so excited about the green cream sauce that was on my meal. It was surprising that they put the recipe on their website. How great of them. I have made it twice since we returned home....I don't have it down pat, but still really good.
I look forward to returning again.
