Just had dinner there. Prices were high for what I ordered, though I think I ordered wrong. I had the chicken breast stuffed with poblano pepper. The dish was pretty tasty though. I saw an amazing salad go by, and wish I ordered that or the sausages. Sigh.

Update - I had their spinach salad there last night and it was pretty good. Still, I think their prices are high considering what you get. I'm going to stick with the 4/5 stars.
