We went to Mundo tonight only to find it's not open on Mondays.  Duh to me for not checking hours in advance.  Plan B - go to Casa Don Juan.  We had two very enjoyable meals.

My gringa wife had a plain chicken breast with refried beans.  I had the chicken in mole.  Both were good.  My mole sauce was very flavorful.  It was rich with diverse elements that made it a complex and very tasty dish.

While there, a nice gentleman played guitar and sang including Speedy Gonzales.  It was a good meal and a fun evening.

I can't wait to go back to try the tongue tacos.
