Probably one of my fave 'hole in the wall' mexican food places around. There's not too many of these types of places in North Scottsdale, so it's a nice place to stop for lunch when I'm working in Old Town; convenient location.

They have the best adobada burritos around and their tacquitos are always fresh (as is all their food). I really can't begin to name off my faves because everything I've had there is great. Seating is limited, but don't let that deter you, they do have a drive thru and all their ingredients are fresh and doesn't take long to get your order.
