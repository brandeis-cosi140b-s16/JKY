Casa Reyna seems to appear on everyone's list of Best Tacos in Pittsburgh and after sampling, I concur. I'd also put them on a Best Salsas in Pittsburgh list. 

Seriously salsa and tacos are 2 of the most exciting foods ever for pretty much every member of our family and when you find a restaurant with a whole list of each as options and they turn out to be this delicious, we started wondering why we'd never eaten here before. 

We ordered the Habanero & Green Jalapeño  salsas with chips to start. The Habanero packed some serious heat & after burn so I had to dip lightly on that one. Hubby dove in with abandon because he loves the heat and most often can't get anything hot enough. This was totally to his liking. The green jalapeño wasn't overly hot but had delightful flavor. We'd love to go back and try the Chipoltle and the Spicy Mango, too. 

The mini tacos are a great deal at 4 for $9 with the option of choosing 2 varieties. I chose the braised pork and El Pastor with crispy pork and pineapple. Yum on both with serious high praise for the El Pastor. Hubby tried the pork and Tinga, which was a chicken taco with lots of great flavor. 

The restaurant is really cute with a nice rustic style located downstairs off Penn Avenue with some communal and smaller tables plus a small bar. I could see it getting somewhat loud when it's crowded since sound seemed to reverberate. 

Lunch service was quick, efficient, friendly & obviously tasty. We'll be back!
