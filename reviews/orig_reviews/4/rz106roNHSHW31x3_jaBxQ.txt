I was actually looking for a new taco Tuesday spot. Though they had what I was looking for, $1 tacos, I ended up getting the carne asada burro.  It was very good, just big enough to fill me up but not so big that I had leftovers. The meat had beans mixed in with some kind of a smoky chipotle flavor, and bites of red onion and cilantro. I went at lunch time and it was very busy so make sure to give yourself some extra time.
