This place is one of the busiest taco restaurant I've been too.  When you walk in you will probably get overwhelmed and walk right out. If you never been here before I recommend coming here with at least a few people. They have 3 lines. All lines serve different kind of tacos. Lines move fairly quickly but you can wait up to 30 minutes. But I promise you its definitely  worth it. I'm not a huge fan of the carne asada. It has too much of a smokey flavor in my opition. My favorite is the tongue and Al Pastor!
