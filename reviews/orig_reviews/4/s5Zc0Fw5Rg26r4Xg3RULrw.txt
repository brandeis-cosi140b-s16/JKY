Alex (our server) -- Thank you for taking a bad situation and turning it around. You are a great example of how you can save a poorly-executed meal with good service.

We had a party of 10. Pre-dinner drinks were wonderful -- great mojitos, margaritas, tequilas and IPAs. Appetizers come out quickly, and tasty. Good stuff, especially the ceviches and the guac.

Meals came out all at once. Not sure how it happened, but 1 of them came out room temparature and 4 of them came out cold, including a steak that was extremely rare (red bordering on purple inside). Alex apologized profusely and was able to get the dishes fixed and/or refired, but it took quite a while, so we weren't eating at the same time. He spent a lot of time apologizing and trying to make it right. He brought the GM out, comped 4 of our entrees, and comped us some desserts.

The food itself was terrific. Duck breast mole was wonderful, as was the seafood stew, the short rib enchiladas, the achiote-roasted pork. Everyone enjoyed the meal, just not the process.

Not sure why food came out cold. Place was only 1/3 full, although there was a big private party in the back. Maybe the kitchen just got hammered or lost their focus.

So 5 stars for service, 4.5 stars for food and 1 star for the kitchen.
