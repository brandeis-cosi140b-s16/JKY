China Poblano was a win with me. However, the $80 bill for 2 people who ordered 4 little plates of food and 2 beers was not completely winning with me. 

Ok, I understand, you pay for the name. Jose Andres is a brilliant chef. The idea of mixing Mexican food and Chinese food is ingenious. 

The food was good, the service was great. the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich with red braised pork was super delicious. The When Pigs Fly were Bao buns filled with pork. Although they were good, I have had better for way cheaper in Chinatown. We had a Barbacoa de Res taco and Pancita al Pastor taco. Both were good but keep in mind you are paying $5 for one small sized "street taco."

I m still rating it 4 stars because the atmosphere was fun and the service was great. The servers really take the time to explain the menu. If I go back, I would like to try one of the many "smoking" drinks I saw getting passed around. 

Great concept but do not expect street food prices.
