This place is in a weird location but that kind of adds to it's uniqueness. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful. The place is romantic, the lanterns really add a special touch and feeling to the dining experience. The food is very interesting and flavorful but reminds me of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill so is lacking in innovation. Some of the menu items are a direct rip off of Bobby's recipes. I would say that any foodie could find something on this menu that will please the taste buds. My only complaint is that I did not like the chips and salsa. These might be the worst chips and salsa I have ever had but since they were free it doesn't really matter. I'll be back but it won't be later this month.
