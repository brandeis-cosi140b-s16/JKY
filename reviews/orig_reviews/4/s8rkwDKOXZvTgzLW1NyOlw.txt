Overall:  Really solid Mexican food with a bit of a Tex-Mex spin (burgers).

Food:  Really good, although they were out of the burgers when we got there (it was a Thursday evening)...which my wife was really Jonesin' for.  The pozole was really good, as was the quesedilla and tacos.

Price:  Very reasonable.  We got a ton of food for three people (couldn't' finish) and spent about $32 if I recall.

Service:  Nice people working there and pretty accommodating to make sure you get the food you want when ordering.  But service is pretty fast-food oriented and the tables didn't seem to be getting bused / cleaned much.

Atmosphere:  A bit lacking... pretty sure it's an old fast-food restaurant that has had basically no updates to align with the current owner/restaurant/offerings.  Most signs, etc. hand-made.  

Net:  Good stuff across the board.  Inexpensive (maybe $11/person? for tons for food).  We'll be back and will be making sure to get the burgers next time.

Tip:  If you're really craving the burgers (which seem to be a fav of many)... recognize that they can and do run out... you might want to call and see if they are still serving them right before you go.
