This is definitely one of my favorite hangouts for fun, food and drinks. The service hasn't been consistent over the last decade, but it has definitely been going up again. There are finally servers who know how to keep you from going empty on your drinks and cooks doing a great job on the food. I have been very impressed with my last few visits and plan to make this a regular place to hang out again. Keep up the good work Dos!
