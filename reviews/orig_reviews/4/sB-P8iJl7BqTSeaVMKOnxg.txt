I found this place on Instagram and wanted to check it out. It is a very cool place! The decor is Mexico meets SoCal and I loved the vibe there. I got a toasted coconut margarita served in a baby coconut and it was delicious. I also got the pineapple pork toco and the chicken quesadilla... both were great too. The churro sundae was my favorite though. You have to get desert if you go! I gave them 4 stars because the service took a long time hand they messed up our order. However the waitress was very nice and gave us a free shot for the service errors. I'll be back again!
