An dear old high school friend's daughter suggested this for lunch the other day while I was in Phoenix for my thirty-year reunion (Wow, I'm getting old!!).

So...eight of us dropped in for lunch, and I wasn't disappointed.

It's a small place, but there's  a nice little patio outside, and the employees are very pleasant.

I had a carne asada burrito at my friend's daughter's suggestion.  It was quite tasty.  

I recommend this place if you're in the area.  A very nice little place to visit for a quick bite of yummy.
