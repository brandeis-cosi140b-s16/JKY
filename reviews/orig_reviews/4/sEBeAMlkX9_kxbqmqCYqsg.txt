3.5* would be more accurate. But, consistently good service pushes this over to 4 stars. Overall, a staple casual place for a quick dinner or happy hour.

The good:
- Quick, efficient service.
- Food is above average - and relatively inexpensive.
- Cocktails are average - nothing that'll blow your mind (or taste buds).
- Desserts are acceptable.

The not-so-good:
- Weekends and busy evenings may result in spotty service.
- Beer and wine menu/selection is not very extensive - but, then again, this is a taco place.
- Place tends to be a bit loud - but, then again, this is a super-casual place.
