I've tried another Korean-Mexican place in L.A. and had the runs, but the adventurous part of me still wanted to give this classification of cuisine another shot. I went with family and was thoroughly impressed. The tacos had the right texture and aroma with the tortilla, and the burrito was well done. Though the beef bulgogi was on the sweet side just a bit. It worked well with the burrito, but not so much the enchilada. Staff was friendly, and the toothpicks for the oranges were cute. The men's bathroom was clean, though it was intimidating seeing a poster of the godfather woke I was peeing. I highly recommend!
