Outstanding flavors and service at this spot. The filet and shrimp street tacos are definitely worth trying. For heavy meat eaters, you must experience the braised short ribs. Very tender and seasoned to perfection. Our server Ed, topped off our experience. Young man with huge culinary dreams and very funny. We learned that the chef hails from the Newport Beach Ca store, which is frequently featured on the hit Bravo show The Housewives of Orange County. She is definitely bringing her "A" game, with respect to the quality control of each meal. Only negative, you can tell the restaurant has only been open for about 10 days. However, time will cure that.
