We ordered the Sloppy Joe, Cheeseburger, regular fries and french toast fries.  Everything was excellent.  We have been trying to find a local burger place that isn't a chain and this was everything we hoped for including being a "hole-in-the-wall."  Some of the best places are hidden gems, and this would be one of them. 

The burger was cooked to order, the regular fries were perfect, the Sloppy Joe was our "wildcard" order and it was surprisingly delicious - add to that the french toast fries and it was like having a dessert with our lunch.  Will be back.
