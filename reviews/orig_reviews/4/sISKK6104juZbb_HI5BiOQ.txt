El Bravo has a typical menu with the regular items you expect to find at a Mexican restaurant.  The success of El Bravo is the quality of the food and their ability to put a distinct mark on Mexican standards.  

I ordered the #6: Chicken Tamale Deluxe Combo that included a shredded beef flauta, ground beef taco (with flour shell), chicken tamale with rice and beans.  The flauta and tamale were fantastic.  The green sauce on the tamale top notch.  The flower taco shell was an interesting experience.  It's the first I've had in the style offered at El Bravo.  I prefer the standard corn shell (also offered at El Bravo) but it made for a nice deviation from my typical taco experience. 

My order took longer than I would typically expect but worth the wait.  El Bravo has a smaller staff and all the food is prepared fresh when you order.  This isn't assembly line style cooking.  You can even look into the kitchen from the counter and watch the magic happen.  

The dining area is of ample size and fit for the solo diner or families.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Overall, I can say that El Bravo is one of the best restaurants, Mexican or otherwise, in Phoenix.
