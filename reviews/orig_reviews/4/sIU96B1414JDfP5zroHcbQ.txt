Joe was my bartender/server, thanks Joe. Very friendly and willing to help. Checked in often. My main critique of his service, which may be due to the restaurant owner(s) or his boss's required service attitude, was that he tried too hard to sell me extra stuff.  It felt like I was at a corporate must-sell-and-mention extras place, which is off-putting. Once Joe started talking to me about other (real life / experiential) things, I felt much more at-ease and like a normal human or friend.

Food was great, NYNY was the first casino I ever stepped foot in (10+ yrs ago), and I happened upon this restaurant and its spicy shrimp tacos... I've been coming back every trip since. In this case, I thought last visit had spicier and more flavorful sauces in the tacos, but it was still tasty. Yum. Will be back.
