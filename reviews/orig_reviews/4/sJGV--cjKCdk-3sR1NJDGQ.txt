Chipotle!!!! I love you but your empoyees are idiots. I asked them if the oil in the rice was hydrogenated and they told me YES

So after avoiding them for a good 3 months I decided to go inside and ask to see the oil.

It is Non Hydrogenated soybean oil, yes it had a few preservatives but no TRANS FATTY OILS!!!!!

The Tortilla however does have trans fat :( 

But Ive been making up for old times, I think Ive had the Veggie bowl like 3 times this week!!!

Im outta control, but Ill eat good starting tomorrow ?
