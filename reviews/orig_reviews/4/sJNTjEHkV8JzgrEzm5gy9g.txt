we were here for a friend's birthday (my fabulous maid of honor actually) .... the food is very tasty and there are plenty of options.  Good prices ..... the best thing?  They have these amazingly cheesy margarita mugs (you can buy them in either male or female ... I recommend one of each) that you can buy for about $10 but then you get $3.99 margarita refill!! Only $0.89 for flavors :) Limit two but they are strong :) It's a fun place, especially when you embarass your friends during their birthday with a singing staff! (bring your own sombrero for when they bust out the song .... the one thing they lack)
