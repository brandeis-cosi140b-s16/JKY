Well now I know that what I have heard about this place is true. 
The ambiance is very nice. Dark and comfortable.
The house salsa is killer. Not burning hot but enough to get your attention. 
Enchilada's for dinner. Chicken with rice and beans. My wife had the chicken breast in a red sauce with home made tortillas. Now there was something special, I love home made, hot flour tortillas. Excellent. 
One more thing, fantastic margarita's. Try the "Javier". Top shelf tequila, Cadillac style. 
The service was good, and they made sure that you enjoyed your meal. 
Long and short, it's a bit expensive but worth every penny.  
They have a number of locations, got to believe they will be as good as Vegas.
