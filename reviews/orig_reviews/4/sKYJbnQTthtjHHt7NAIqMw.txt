I went there with my BF yesterday for a late lunch and it was an amazing experience. It was our first time there. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was attentive and was quick in taking out orders and checking in with us  every few mins. I had the Cheese and Guacamole Crisps which were to die for. It's like an open quesadilla over a crisp tortilla very different and delicious. My bf had Enchiladas. Now they were not your normal enchiladas. They were served in a bowl with the tortilla in the bottom, filling over it and then covered with a layer of cheese with rice and beans on the side. We've been to many Mexican restaurants, but this was an interesting concept that we enjoyed. The ambiance is amazing. Perfect for a date night or family dinner. There's outside seating where you can sit around the fire. There's also a fully stocked bar in the middle which is very pretty and tvs around to watch teh game. Overall a great experience and would definitely go there again.
