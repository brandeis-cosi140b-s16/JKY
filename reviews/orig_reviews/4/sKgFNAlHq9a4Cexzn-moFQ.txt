Great service and very very good food. Explore.  It won't hurt. They will tell you when you are getting hot.  The flavor on the Osso Bucco is amazing.  The chorizo stuffed pork chop is very good.  The house salad with the kicked up ranch dressing is great.  Sunday special buy one dinner the other is 1/2 off made it a bonus.  Margaritas a little pricey but the house ones are good.
People around us had the fried chicken and they wolfed it.  
Only down is that it is very dark and can get loud.  Outside dining is great when it is cool or not raining.  Use your flash lite app to be adventurous on the menu.
