Cantina ranks up there in the places I like to visit along East Blvd.  While the businesses across the street tend to change out time and time again, Cantina seems to have weathered pretty well and has become a "go-to" staple for me whenever I am craving some good eats.

Recently visited on a Saturday for lunch and the crowd wasn't too bad.  They had streamlined there menu some and had a nice lunch menu to choose from.  I ended up having the Ancho Chicken Scaloppini & Cheese (Ancho chicken, caramelized poblano peppers and onions, melted Mexican cheeses) with a side chopped salad.  Dressing on the side, I only used about half of what they gave me but the salad was like crack and I could not get enough.  There were fresh avacados, chickpeas, jicama, greens, corn, black beans, and a whole lot of goodness packed into a small plate of salad.  The chicken on the sandwich was packed full of flavor.  My one comment was that some of the liquid from the chicken made the bread a bit soggy, but I powered through anyway.  The cheeses all melted in your mouth and I was stuffed in a good way for lunch that day.

I know this place is pretty popular in the evenings, but the one thing that I do get annoyed with is the parking situation.  It's great if you live down the street and can walk, but unfortunately the parking lot - they have done the best with what they have, but I do feel awkward parking in front of employees cars (double parking) but I think they do valet too so they can put your car wherever.

The patio is pretty amazing when the weather is cooperating.  And no visit to Cantina 1511 is complete without some tableside guacamole.
