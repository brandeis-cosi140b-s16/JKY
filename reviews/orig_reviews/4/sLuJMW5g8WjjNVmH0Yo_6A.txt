I just went today for the first time.  Really cool concept and the options you can add to your enchilada and tacos are a bit more interesting than Chipotle (not knocking Chipotle).  

I will say that as a first timer, it's quite a confusing way to order as the signage is directly above you so you have to step out of line near the tables to see the boards.

The decor is pretty hip.  Had to sit outside b/c  there really aren't too many tables inside, so that made the experience a bit sour b/c it's so dang humid and hot today.

Overall a cool spot and I hope to be back.
