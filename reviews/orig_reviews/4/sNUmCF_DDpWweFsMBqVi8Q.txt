We love this place.  Believe it or not, for lunch it's very baby friendly.  The last two times we've had the same waiter who has a daughter that's a couple of years older than our little girl.  He's taken such great care of us, I want him every time we go back.  The food is very good.   I recommend the queso, the fajitas and the tacos al Pastor... all are fantastic.  There are many more things on the menu I want to try.
