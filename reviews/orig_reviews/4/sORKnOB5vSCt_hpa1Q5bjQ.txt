Love the tacos that you can get here. $2.50 a pop? Doesn't get any better than that. The tacos are also freshly prepared on site and there are just so many kinds of meat and toppings/condiments to choose from the condiments bar located inside the store. Oh and did I mention that it's also a Mexican grocery store so that you can load up on Mexican treats and great prices for produce/meat/snacks? I will be back.
