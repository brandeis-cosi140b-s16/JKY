Awesome tacos and burritos. I love the Carne Asada Burrito and you can get a massive one or a normal size too. A bit pricey for tacos (more expensive than Filibertos for sure) but delicious. You can grab a beer there too which is great for after work/class. There are huge lines during lunch when school is in session so beware!
