The staff at this location was very friendly, bussers, waitstaff and runners all asked about our meal and refilled our water. It almost became over-kill but I'd rather have a full glass of water than be thirsty!

Food is normal Lindo quality and consistency for a very fair price. While I might not crave their food as much as other places, I always know ill get a solid meal no matter what I order!
