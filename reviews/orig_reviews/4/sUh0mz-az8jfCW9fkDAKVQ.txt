We've been coming here regularly since this location opened about 6 years ago.
I love the green chili pork. The pork is very tender, the sauce is flavorful and spicy.  The barrio tacos are also really good. There is a good selection of beers on tap; so happy that they have local craft brewers featured.
The service is always great. The bar area has enough tables to see the sports action on any of three TV's. In nicer weather, the patio is a great place to relax and enjoy dinner.
