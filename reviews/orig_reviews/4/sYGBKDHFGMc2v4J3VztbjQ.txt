Note:  we were under the influence during this meal!

Chicken fajitas were well flavored and juicy.  The portion size was pretty large.  Gotta love homemade tortillas (at least they looked homemade).  We also ordered queso.  It had a unique taste that at first I wasn't sure of, but it grew on me over time.  The salsa was a highlight of the meal with a smoky flavor.
