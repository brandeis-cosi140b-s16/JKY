hubs and I were staying in a resort for a few days vacay in AZ when we started craving for mexican food.
glad we found this place.

first: parking at the back of the restaurant  was small so beware.
place is dark but otherwise clean.

we ordered margarita and they were good.  we initially ordered pina colada but they don't have em.
had the guacamole-prepared table side which was pretty good and catchy.
their flan for dessert was definitely good.
had the mole-- also good.

service, food and drinks were great!
