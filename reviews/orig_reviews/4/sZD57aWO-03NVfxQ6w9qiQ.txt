Late weekday takeout lunch at 2:30 brought me here after having this place bookmarked for a good 5 months.

I was sooo on the fence about getting a breakfast burrito based on Blair B's terrific review and since it was my first meal of the day.  In the end, I went with the carne asada and a couple of carnita tacos.  The carne asada was pretty good but the pork carnitas blew my mind.  Maybe it was due to my hangover that day I was ready to drive back and have a couple of more.  The pork was so juicy and well seasoned that, like a good movie, I didn't want it to end.  

Phrank took my order and as everyone else mentions in their reviews was very hospitable.  He was also patient as I was the only one in the restaurant at the time looking at the menu for a while.  So many other things on the menu to try!  I would definitely frequent this place more if not for their hours but that's just the nature of their location.  I will be back for sure.
