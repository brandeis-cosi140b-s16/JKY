We were car shopping nearby and decided to try this place.  My wife ordered the green chile enchiladas and I got the green chile pork burrito.  We ordered both Christmas style so we could taste both chile sauces.  The sauces were very good.  The red was a bit tastier, and the green was a bit too gravy-like, meaning it was not as loaded with chopped green chile as I would have liked.

Sadly, the fry bread was a greasy mess and not good at all.
