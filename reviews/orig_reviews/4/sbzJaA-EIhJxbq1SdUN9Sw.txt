I used to go to this place ALL the time in high school. I would go there for lunch almost every other day, and grab burritos for myself and friends (about 20 burritos LOL). Back then it was great, and it was consistent. The thing that drove me nuts about this place was the salsa. Very cilantro-ish and it did a great job on your nasal cavity.

Carne asada fries, egg potato cheese burrito, barbacoa burrito, and the carne asada burrito are all very good. My all-time favorite is the $18, eggs potato cheese. VERY GOOD. this is my standard for breakfast burritos everywhere else I go.

The only reason I give this place a 4-star is because recently the salsa has been very inconsistent. One day I went and the salsa was extremely watery and gross. The chips are consistently gross, but what good is that without amazing salsa. They moved like 20 feet, and the new place is much nicer, but the food quality has gone down a bit. Last night my GF and I went close to closing time, and we didn't get very good food. The steak was more like barbacoa, and the potatoes were more like mashed potatoes (we got a steak potato cheese for my GF). Not very appealing.

This place used to be a staple for me, and I wouldn't think twice about going there. But recently, I don't know what has happened. The old lady that works there is very nice, but I just don't know what is going on to what used to be my favorite non-chain mexican food place in phoenix.

*sigh* I hope they find their consistency again. For a place to be 5-stars for me, it HAS to be consistent. Right now, its lacking.
