$2 meaty-tacos?! What's not to like? They have a bunch of different types of meat, I just stuck to the carne asada and spicy pork tacos. The carne asada was just ok but the spicy pork tacos were amazing. Make sure you get a slice of pineapple on top! The only weird thing about this place is that they didn't serve chicken.
