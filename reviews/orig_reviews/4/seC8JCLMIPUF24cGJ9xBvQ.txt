Great Mexican style cuisine.  I enjoyed the seasoned skirt-steak fajitas, served with roasted red bell peppers and onions with sides of pinto beans and rice.  The steak was very nicely seasoned; very flavorful.  There was a lovely sauce over the whole dish that really brought it all together.  The beans were rather plain and the rice was dry and boring.  It didn't matter really since I was quite content eating the fajitas and did not leave hungry.  Service was very attentive and the fresh salsas were a really nice touch.  I would recommend to anyone staying at the MGM Grand.
