Carolina's tortillas bring me back to the old neighborhood, walking down the street with a hand made, paper towel-wrapped tortilla, butter running happily down the forearm.  Siblings hovering around begging for a bite, but oh no, that was not  to be.  Good Times.  I do think Carolina's tortillas can be accurately labeled "authentic".

Yes, yes, everything else is good too.  But when I've got the really good tortillas that are so hard to find, it's difficult for me to put much more thought than that into the rest of the meal.  

Can Carolina's get horrendously crowded?  Can they get behind on cleaning up the dining area?  Yes, they can.  Do I care?  Nope.
