Carlito's has excellent burritos, with a style somewhere between Chipotle and Roberto's. The inside of the restaurant is pretty sparse, but they do have some d√©cor on the walls and they actually have a small bar at the front. I didn't partake, but I know they at least have beer.
 The burritos are huge and stuffed with lots of good stuff. I had chicken, rice, black beans, and....my favorite....some kind of veggie mix. It came with all sorts of interesting vegetables like zucchini, yellow squash, and even artichoke hearts! Yum, totally made the meal. If you're like my husband and hate Chipotle (and the like) because they put rice and beans in your burrito, taking up valuable meat space, then you can get your burrito served "Carlito's Way" - double meat, and nothing else inside. Regardless of the style, the burrito is served in a takeout dish covered with your choice of sauce and accoutrements (sour cream, guac, pickled jalapenos, fresh jalapenos, Serrano peppers, etc). I got all the extras and ended up removing as many jalapenos as possible because it was super-spicy.
 Note that it costs a little bit more than Chipotle: for our 2 burritos it was $19.
