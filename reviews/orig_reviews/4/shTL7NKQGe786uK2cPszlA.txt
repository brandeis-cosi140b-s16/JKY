This place is the bee's knees! Best guacamole in Charlotte! The chips are made fresh and are seasoned making them so delicious you could eat them by themselves but the salsa is also amazing! I ordered the steak chimichanga. It was good but not as crispy as I would have liked and it was filled with more rice and beans than steak, I'm used to them being more cheesy with the meat and peppers and onions inside, so next time I will ask to hold the rice and beans. My bf ordered nachos, a taco, and a burrito. Claimed he was starving and didn't even get through half of it because the portion size of the appetizer nachos was huge, enough for a stand alone meal. He loved all of his food. Also, you get a free empanada for checking in on Yelp how awesome is that! We will have to redeem ours on the next visit because the food we had ordered was more than enough.
