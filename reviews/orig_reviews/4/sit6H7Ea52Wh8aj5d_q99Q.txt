As the weather warms up, I can promise you will see me at Cantina! 

Especially for the brunch and happy hour specials. 

Their tacos are delicious. I dare you to split an order. The only way I have managed to is when it is followed by another order. 

The bloody Mary is magical. And the bloody Maria - well that is like magic with the sun shining and music playing through it. I have actually dreamed about these babies!
