I eat here every time I come to Las Vegas. I love the salsa here, and the chips are good. I normally order shrimp nachos and share, but my for my solo trip I ordered 2 tacos with rice.  I was a little disappointed when they arrived with iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  After scraping that off, the tacos were pretty tasty. They tasted more Americanized than a lot of tacos I have had, and they were good.
