Very nice location. Beautiful views from the balcony overlooking Walnuts St. We were only here for about 30 minutes celebrating my brothers birthday. It was after 12am so the restaurant part was no longer serving food. We only had a few beers and ten left but I was definitely enjoying the vibe of the place. 

This spot makes for a good first date or just a friendly get together with co-workers and friends.
