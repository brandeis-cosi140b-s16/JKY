We were just a few miles away from this place, and we were hungry.  Yelp showed good reviews, so we drove over!

First, the parking is tiny.  At least in front.  They say "more parking in back", but it's not immediately obvious how to get to the back.  The building is run down.

Inside, the place is a dive.  Not exactly "dirty", but not what one would call well-maintained.  On the wall is a small menu,  Actually, the sign is large, but there are only a dozen or so items on it.  The primary choices are "tacos" and burritos.  The tacos are soft open tacos, sometimes called "street tacos".  Several meats available.  Asada, pastor, lengua, chicken...

I opted for a combination plate which had some decent refried beans, rice, pastor (pork) and asada (beef).  Normally I give a pass on the beans, but these were tastier than most (I got a sample), so I went with it.  The rice was very good.  The meats were served with warm tortillas.  They were simple, but very good.  From what I know this is really authentic fare.  Not Americanized, just what ordinary Mexicans have in their homes.every day.

It's a bit far from my house in the east valley, but this has made the list of places to go when I find myself in Phoenix.

Be warned, it is cash-only here.
