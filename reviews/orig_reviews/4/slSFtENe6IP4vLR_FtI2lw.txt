When I was a college student at UC Irvine, my wife (then girlfriendat the time) and I loved to go to any of the 3 Wahoos locations we lived near. I always went with the Kahuna grande - a fish taco, three tasty taquitos (chicken, pork, beef or fish, my fav). Fast forward about 15 years and about 500 miles and the legit surfer grub we used to nosh on has found its way to the desert! I was so stoked when the Westside Rainbow location opened up, but to be completely honest, that location felt like any other Vegas bar and grill. The new Horizon Ridge location, however, delivers all the origibal tastes, vibe and ambience of good ol' Irvine and Newport Beach digs. For a second I felt like I was a twenty year-old in college again until my old man belly knocked my salsa over...haha its a little far for me, but I was told the GV location opens in 6 months! SWEET!
