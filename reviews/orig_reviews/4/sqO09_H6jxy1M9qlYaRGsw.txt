Popo's is one of the old fashioned kind of Mexican restaurant that I rarely go to anymore. Mostly cuz they are often so generic and blah. 
Yet there is something  warm and homey and satisfying about this spot, like  some body's grandmother looked around the grocery store and decided to add things like add cream cheese to her traditional cooking. And it works for me. 
The other day, after a long hot hike in the desert,  we ended up here to completely stuporize ourselves. I was pleased to see the happy servers and multigenerational groups getting some shade and 99 cent margaritas on a Sunday afternoon.
I looked around at what the other diners were having and decided on the chimichanga, enchilada style. I really liked the enchilada sauce and the red chili filling which was actually spicy with melt in your mouth cubes of beef. Seriously like my mom used to make. I skipped the rice and beans because this deep fried baby was more than filling on its own. Especially as we had started with a small bowl of the chile con Queso dip that was soothing and smooth with just a little kick. The chips accompanying the dip were warm and crisp. 
This is the place when you want Mexican comfort food that actually also has some flavor. As other reviewers have noted, it's heavy and hearty fare.  But sometimes that's what you need.
