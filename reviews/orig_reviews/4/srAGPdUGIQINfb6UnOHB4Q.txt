The food here was amazing. We arrived a little early (5:30ish on a Friday) and thought the place was closed it was so barren. We had trouble even finding staff to get seated, almost left but I persisted and we were seated by a friendly host. Everything we ordered was delicious, the shrimp queso fondido is a must try in my opinion. Not a huge menu but I'm confident everything on the menu would be a hit. Chips and a salsas come out as expected and by the time we got our appetizer the restaurant had filled nicely to provide a much more normalized atmosphere. Portions were good sizes and the food was we'll prepared and tastey but you'll see the cost for it when you get the bill. That's really the only downside, I'd love to make this my go to regular spot but the price puts it in a once in a while treat spot. On our next visit I might try to order budget, it still may be just as great.
