My Garcia's experience consisted of a red beef tamale and a fried ice cream.  And best of all, I decided to order them both at the same time and eat them both for my lunch.  The tamale was so so, but I really did enjoy the fried ice cream as the ice cream did not melt too much and it was covered with strawberries and syrup.  And it was coated in a delicious granola/corn flake batter...never had anything like that in Cali.
