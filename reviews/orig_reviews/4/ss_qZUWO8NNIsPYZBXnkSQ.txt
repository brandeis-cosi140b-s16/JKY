Hmm... all less than 3 stars huh... I wonder if this is the same one I am talking about. 

But regardless... they get 4 from me cause I bought one drink... ya you know those tall ones - Yard Stick. Yaaa... that one. And it had me buzzing. Thank you Miss Brandi for such a magnificent drink. Never had I tasted such a powerful and pungent Long Island Iced Tea.
