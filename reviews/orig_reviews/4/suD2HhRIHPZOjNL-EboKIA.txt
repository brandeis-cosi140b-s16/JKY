A fun outdoor environment with a shabby surf shack atmosphere. When I first walked in the place seemed kind of run down. The sprawling grounds had us meandering all around the property and no one was greeting us so I wasn't sure if we were going to get very good service. 

After finding a table out of the wind a server greeted us and gave us a menu. We ordered beer, nachos and a fried ice cream. I wasn't expecting much, but it was all very good. 

The setting was very pleasant with a view of a baseball field. Kids were playing volleyball and someone brought their dog. The music volume level was acceptable for the outdoor setting. 

The padded bar stool seating was very comfortable. This place would be good for groups of sports fans. A great outdoor place during our nice spring weather.
