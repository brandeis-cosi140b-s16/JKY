If you grew up on the west side of town and your family had any knowledge of decent Mexican food, you definitely know La Parrilla Suiza on 35th Avenue and Peoria. Luckily for a childhood friend and I, we were able to find one on this side of town. 

Let me preface this with saying the atmosphere is much more open than the original La Parrilla - you will never sit by the kitchen and sweat like can happen in Phoenix. 

Then the food. I have always loved their food - mostly the parrilladas - the large skillets with meat, cheeses, and vegetables, but I wasn't too hungry that day since we had already eaten the queso fundido with mushrooms, and a staple you can never miss: the chips with the tray of salsas to choose from. 

I ordered a small chicken quesadilla ... that is not what it was really called, but I can't recall the name. As usual, the food was great. The cheese was amazing, the tortillas even better, and the charro beans amazing. 

Trying to get out of the Mexican food funk? Try La Parrilla and I guarantee you and your family will be going there 16 years later like I am.
