hubby likes Arriba so our party of 4 adults went Sat just after 8pm - waited a bit for a table but got a nice booth.  ordered a pitcher of good mango margaritas and a cheese crisp with green chiles from a gal then ordered dinner from a guy.  never got the cheese crisp (nor got charged for it) but that's ok we had plenty to eat with the complimentary yummy chips, good bean dip, salsas and we also ordered guacamole. I had the carnitas street tacos (3 biggees) only $6.99 and, dh had the White Sands chimi which he liked.  Overall we had a fun time!
