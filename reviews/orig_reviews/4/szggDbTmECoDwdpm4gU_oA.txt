Good food and excellent service!  Had the brisket and bbq shrimp tacos with charro beans and rice.  All excellent! (and mine was not fatty at all)  Also they have a good beer, margarita, and tequila menu!  Best of all - the service was great.  Our server was attentive and personable and really seemed interested in our comments on the meal.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I think they are still working out some of the menu items since it is so new and I am not sure I am a fan of the warm tomato-y salsa (although the chips were great!).  I will go back!
