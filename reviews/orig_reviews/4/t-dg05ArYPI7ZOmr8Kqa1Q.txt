We stopped in after going to the speedway and we were starved. This cute little restaurant was just perfect for our hungry tummies! We ordered the beef flautas and the shrimp fajitas and they were brought out sizzling and tasted great! Service was good and fast. Well worth it. Chips and salsa were yummy too!
