We were staying at mandalay and we weren't sure where we wanted to eat and saw this place. It was a little late so we got right in, sat outside and view of the beautiful pool. We had the house margaritas which were delicious!! Their salsa was good, hot sauce was hot (obviously) and wasn't that good. My friend and I shared the quesadilla. I dont eat meat and she does so we got it half chicken half not and let me tell you, delicious! I know its not hard to make a good quesadilla, but really, like the best quesadilla ever. The tortilla was soo good that they used i dont know if its hand made, but yumm, along with the cheese, like the best cheese ever. My friend said the best chicken she has ever had, we were big fans! We were with a group and no one had any complaints. Would go back.
