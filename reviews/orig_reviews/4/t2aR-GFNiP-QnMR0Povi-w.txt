Wandered into Hecho on a Saturday night and it was slammed. Unbeknownst to me at the time it was the night of a Madonna concert. Somehow I was able to get a seat at the bar. I ordered a beer and took a look over the menu. The menu had a lot of great looking choices and I wanted to try them all but my stomach is only so big. The salsas that came with the nachos were good and as I was munching on them I ordered the fish tacos. They were really good! They came with refried beans which I barely touched only because I wanted to make sure I had room for the tacos. I will say the prices are a little high but I was on vacation so it really didn't bother me that much. Nick the bartender was great! Very friendly, attentive and accurate!
