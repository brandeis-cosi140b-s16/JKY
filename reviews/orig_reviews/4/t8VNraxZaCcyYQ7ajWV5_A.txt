I have been eating at Matta's since the early 1980s when I would often go to the location on Main ST in Mesa, AZ. I recently went to the location near the Cinemark Theaters on Dobson RD (south of SR202 & north of University DR) after seeing two movies. It was my first visit to the new restaurant location. I have to be very frugal when eating out due to my limited working hours.
I ate my all-time favorite food while at Matta's. It's something very simple, yet it is food of the gods to me. I had a bean burro, enchilada style (red sauce). I didn't order a drink in order to save money. My bill was just over $8.00 for the BB/ES plus a small serving of lettuce. The taste of the burrito was exactly as I had remembered it from my visits to the Main ST location years ago. The service was quick and the chips and hot sauce/salsa were great.
To sum up my review, I will mention one thought that kept bouncing around in my head after I ate there.
"This is the best thing I have eaten all year!"
