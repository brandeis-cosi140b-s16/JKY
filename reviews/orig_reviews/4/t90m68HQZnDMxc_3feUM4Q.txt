I had just landed at LAS and my friends picked me up at the airport. My first stop in Vegas was KOMEX. 

It's in a small shopping center and has limited parking. We go inside and there are about 8-10 tables maybe?? They greet us as we enter and asked if we'd like to dine in or get carry-out. We dine in and they let us choose where we would like to sit. We sat down, looked over the menu and got chips & dip, bulgogi fries, bulgogi taco, chicken taco and kimchi fried rice wth a fried egg on top. 

Everything was UHh-may-zing. bulgogi tacos came on corn tortilla with really fresh pico de gaillo type of toppings--diced tomatoes, white onions, cilantro, red and white cabbage.  We asked for hot sauce and they brought over a spice tray, which is amazing for us spicy-hot lovers. I was expecting Tobasco sauce but they came out with red chili mix sauces (total of 4 on a tray). We tried every single one of them and they aren't too spicy but they still have some kick to it and were very flavorful.  Bulgogi fries came out with fries at the bottom, topped with bulgogi and melted cheese and the usual toppings. SOOOO good. the fries weren't soggy (yet) and it came with jalapeno peppers, which was an awesome bonus. The Kimchi fried rice was spectacular. It came out a little later since they cook everything to order.  It was hot, it was spicy, kimchi was good and slighly crunchy, and it was really delicious. I highly recommend this dish.

The server was very attentive to us and everyone else there. She was really nice and checked up on us frequently. It was about 3pm when I arrived, so perhaps they weren't all THAT busy during that time.  But people came trickling in.  I saw that other people ordered burritos, which looked good from afar. Next time I visit Las Vegas, I gotta stop by here again and try the other items.
