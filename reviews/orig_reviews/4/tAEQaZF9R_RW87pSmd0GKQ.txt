Three Hundred Plus Reviews, Four Star Average.  A payaso like me what more can I write?   

Silvana Salcido Esparza's Barrio Cafe is ground zero for the  Calle 16 Mural Project.  Artists Casebeer, Gennaro Garcia and Hugo Medina led the effort to produce a creative response to SB 1070.  You know this.  The New Times and others wrote it  up, there's web and Facebook pages. It's a phase of the Valley of  the Sun's Hot mural scene. It's probably the hottest spark.

Those high prices you pay for your delicious cuisine are part of a subversive South of the Border capitalism to subsidize the arts in Our Fair Valley.  It may make Phoenix globally notable.      

Salud!

Not only that, when dine, an artist like Victor Caldee and his Cuban Connection may be aiding your digestion with Cuban classics plus songs you've never heard.  Your eyes will feast one an colorful art buffet.  Somebody at a  neighboring table may down enough boutique tequila to raise the decibel level in the room a few notches.  But Victor and others will keep the lid on.  

If you order any dessert, I it's all complimented by the coffee.

Salud!

I can't wait to see what happens next.  

Salud!
