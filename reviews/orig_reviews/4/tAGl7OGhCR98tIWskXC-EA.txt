To give you an idea of what I thought, I was going to take a picture of my meal... but I ate it first.

I got the Pollo Fundido, which is their signature dish. it was fantastic. It's basically a chicken chimichanga enchilada style. The sauce on that smothers the chimichanga was the most delicious sauce I've ever tasted. I took a bite and couldn't stop eating. It's like they took all that was good in the world and put it in a sauce. 

The chips were also very good. In all honesty, the first batch was good but the second batch of chips were a little stale. Still, a must stop for lunch or dinner if you're ever near South Phoenix.

I'm definitely going back.
