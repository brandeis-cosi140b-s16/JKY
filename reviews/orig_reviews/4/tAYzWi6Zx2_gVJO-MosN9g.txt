Came here and was very impressed with the local atmosphere of the place. This is the type of place we need to support more and more! 

Had the pastrami sandwich and also the special fries everyone seems to talk about. Really enjoyed flavor of the fries, one downer was didn't seem like there were enough, even though what there was was quite tasty. 

What caused this review to lose one star was the pastrami sandwich I had. It was a better than average and quite tasty. It was a little too fatty for my tastes. If they upped the flavor a little and got slightly better cut of meat then I'd go gaga overt it. 

Might be back here, not sure. Was pricey for value and my taste buds were pleased, but not ecstatic. Left a little less than full but satisfied.
