Awesome!  The food was amazing and inexpensive.  We got sat, we're greeted instantly with chips and a yummy corn salsa by our server who took our drink and appetizer order immediately.  Of we course we had to try the queso.. Not what we were expecting, but it was really good ( we actually ended up mixing the corn salsa with the queso dip - bangin!).  We definitely miss this place now that we are living back in Maryland!
