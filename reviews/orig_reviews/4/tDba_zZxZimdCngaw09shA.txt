Mmmm, mmm! That's all I gotta say.  Okay, maybe I have a little more to say, like just try the double-wrapped beef enchiladas (#12), and you may be ruined for anything else on the menu.  While my family prefers the machaca beef burrito, I am hopelessly devoted to order #12.  Devine as well.

It's arguably the best mexican food in Phoenix. Seriously.  I only give it four stars because I haven't tried anything else yet.
