This is great Mexican food...With a lot of places to choose from I am definitely a fan...The owners can be a bit standoffish and times but hey whatever...

What we really care about is the food. SO what can I honestly say is great...Well the Sweet Corn Tamale is by far the most amazing thing I've ever tasted (OK not really but the best thing I've tasted at jalapeno's). They have great Fajita's, and some great combo meals. 

Margarita's are yummy and they have a great specials such as Taco Tuesday's (All you can eat Taco's). Margarita Monday's jump on their website to see them. Definitely worth the drive up to North Scottsdale.

As for the chips and salsa hold the phone...They have corn and flour chips mixed with the yummiest salsa! Now they just need a guacamole made table side (or one that tastes good) 

Overall the food is great, the service is mediocre never outstanding but the food makes up for it...

Enjoy...
