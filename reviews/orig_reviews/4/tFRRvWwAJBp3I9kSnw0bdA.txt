I retuned to Joyride earlier this week for lunch with friends. I must say the service this time was much better. The servers were much more attentive. Still a little slow, however it was a busy lunch service so I will not mark them off for this. The food once again was on point and delicious. Much much happier with my experience this time. Good job!
