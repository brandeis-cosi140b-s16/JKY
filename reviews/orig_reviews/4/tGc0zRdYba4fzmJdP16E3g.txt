The moment I walked in I got hit with a whiff of flavor and got a flashback of my server days at Johnny Rockets. I saw the menu and knew I had to try it all. The stand burger was delicious and the tacos were unbelievably good. The fries were good but this place is differently a place you go for a taco or burger.  The elotes were not up to my par but the guacamole was good. The atmosphere and aesthetics of the place were on fleek.  Definitely a place I am coming back to.
