Quirkly good... Aligned with other reviews, it is similar to a Chipotle, but with enchiladas as the main fare. The ordering process is a bit clumsy, but the results are darn good.

I opted for a mix of veggies enchiladas - smashed potatoes, spinach, etc.. They are hand rolled and topped with the sauce of your choice. They add a few options - cheese, pico, etc.. that you can choose from.

The end result was top notch. Spicy, but not overpowering. Hot, but not so burning hot that I could not eat it immediately. 

The chips was really good as well.

Stop in, piece together enchiladas your style, pop a squat and enjoy. I will be back....
