This place does have great food and totally lives up to it's reputation.  I just wish the location wasn't in the middle of the ghetto.  I'd only recommend getting take out, but if you'd like to experience the area by all means dine in and get the true experience.  The food is great hands down and the prices are almost the same in Mexico getting street tacos.  
I'd really like to check out the other restaurants Carolina's has in the Phoenix metro to see if they live up to the orginal shack.  If they are even as close as good I'd be outrageously thrilled.
