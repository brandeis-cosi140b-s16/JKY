I've heard how great The Mission is ever since I moved to Scottsdale in 2011 and finally checked it out last weekend. My boyfriend and I went to the Mission for our 4 year anniversary dinner because we wanted to try something new.  The Mission looks really cool inside and there are pretty chandeliers hanging around. We got drinks at the bar while our outside table finished being set up - we ordered red sangria and a Michelada style beer - both were great.

Our table was outside on the patio and it was a gorgeous night. At first our waiter seemed MIA but then he made himself more apparent. For an appetizer we ordered the Duck Carnitas Empanada and it was sooo good. Then for dinner we shared the Pork Shoulder tacos and they were awesome. The hand pressed tortillas were a little smaller than the palm of your hand and then you created your own little taco with the pork, cheese, onions and cilantro. It being our anniversary, they comped our dessert and brought out the Pumpkin Bread Pudding and it was really good, rich, and I couldn't stop eating it.

Highly recommend The Mission! I would definitely go back - so much to try on their menu.
