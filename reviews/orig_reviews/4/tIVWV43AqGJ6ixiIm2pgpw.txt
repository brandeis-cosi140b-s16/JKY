If you ever find yourself at a company conference at the Mandalay Bay and you can't stand the banal banquet food that's been sitting under a heat lamp since 9:30AM, then quietly excuse yourself to the restroom and discreetly walk over to the Border Grill.  You will not be dismayed. 
It's okay to ask the host to sit you in the corner so that no one from your company sees you. 

Be sure to order a Pomegranate Margarita. You will be re missed if you don't order the Plantain black bean empanadas. ...this dish walks a fine line between sweet and savory...it is a taste of heaven.
