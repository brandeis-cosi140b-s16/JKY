It was tough to find a place serving decent vegetarian food at 9 pm near the Strip.  The Palms is not actually on the Strip, but it was close enough.  The "salsa de mesa" (the salsa served with the chips) was quite tasty. We also enjoyed the green salsa and mango pico de gallo from the salsa bar.

We built a combo with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and bean and cheese burrito.  The plate was saturated with cheese, as is common at tex-mex restaurants. The green chile sauce served on the dish was pretty mild, but tasty enough.  The chile relleno was surprisingly tasty, and we liked the enchilada tortilla.  The remainder of the dish was unremarkable.

We reminded the server about the sopapillas that were to come with our combo.  They were edible, but it would've been just as well if we'd forgotten about them.  They were essentially bready pillows served with a squeeze bottle of honey.

We'd normally give a place like this 3 stars, but we were grateful to find anything veggie to eat on the Strip.
