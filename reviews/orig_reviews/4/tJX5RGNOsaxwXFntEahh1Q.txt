Every thing was fresh and tasty. My husband and I split  an arepa and a veggie empanada. The arepa was overstuffed with shredded chicken. The empanada crust was crispy with a soft filling of veggies. Both seemed very fresh.

I had the elote Loco corn on the cob. It had a nice blend of cream and sweetness.

My husband had the pastor taco served Loco. It was very large. Nicely spicy with a hint of pineapple. 

The portions are generous and the prices are excellent. The have a solid beer selection too.

The salsa bar features 6 options ranging from mild to very hot. 

Our favorite item was the arepa.

It is very casual and a little worn in. 

The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. The did miss one item on our order, but they quickly corrected the omission.

We'll add this to our Charlotte go to list of lunch places.
