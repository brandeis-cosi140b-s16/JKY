Ok, it's been way too long since I've update my last review... But I've been back a couple of times now over the past couple of months and here is my take;

Food~  yes it's still a "gut bomb" but not a "total gut bomb" if you order the right things and besides everything here is very tasty and addictive!!  I suggest getting the veggie quesadilla, Polo Diablo or Jade Chicken with the Jerk Fried Rice and skip the beans.  This is a very tasty dish and you'll take me later for ordering without the beans :-)

If you have been to Chino Bandido, you're in for a wild ride with some tasty Mexican-Asian Fusion dishes!!  Save room for their snickerdoodle cookie or if you wait and go on the weekend you might get lucky and get a Lava Cookie!! NOM, NOM, NOM!!

I'm looking forward to seeing you there!!
