I like this place. The people working here were all so friendly and very inviting. The food was well priced for Vegas.  and the carne asade was REAL carne asada juicy and delicious! The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 was because I ordered the carne asada fries and they were a little dry. But someone else might hive the tacos a 5! Worth a try. :)
