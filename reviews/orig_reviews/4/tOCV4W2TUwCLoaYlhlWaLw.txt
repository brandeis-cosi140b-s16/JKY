My boyfriend and I tried this place out last week, and were pleasantly surprised. I was a little thrown off by the reviews, but it seems like the place is new, so with any new restaurant there are kinks to work out. The spicy Guacamole was really good, and they killed it when it came to the tortilla soup. I was also a big fan of the shrimp tacos, the taquitos, and the dips...I'm a sucker for a good queso! The space is great, I love the metal lamps downstairs and the rooftop patio is great. Sadly we don't live in the area but this will no doubt be our go-to whenever we're in town.
