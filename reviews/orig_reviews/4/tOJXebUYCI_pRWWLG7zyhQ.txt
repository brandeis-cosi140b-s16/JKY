I came by for a visit based on recommendations from fellow YELPers.

The place was packed for dinner, so I sat at the bar.  They have two bars, one in front, one in the other side of the restaurant.  The place was very busy, and pretty loud.  That's fine, it's just that kind of place.  The sidewalk patio seating looked GREAT but, it was full so, I couldn't enjoy the people watching.

I ordered the special, based on recommendation from the bar tender, the Tuna Wrap.  It was basically a tuna sandwich in a tortilla....sounds lame

but, it wasn't.  the Tuna salad was very nicely spiced and the wrap was quite good.  Very generous portion but, I was hungry!!! what could I do?  I ate the whole darn thing (oink oink)

The beer selection was nice, with a variety of local brews, as well as commercial taps and specialty beers.

Service at the bar was good.  The bartender was VERY experienced and knew what he was doing.  Friendly, good at small talk but, not annoying and bothering too much.

The ambiance....meh.  Take it or leave it.  Too "themed" for my own tastes but, that's just the kind of place it is.  I would definitely come here again, especially with friends for dinner before night on the town

Hint:  Plan on waiting if you come at peak times...the place was very busy during dinner, as well as lunch when I strolled by earlier in the day.  Not sure if they take reservations....worth a call to find out.
