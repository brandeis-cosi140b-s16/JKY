I've been meaning to check this place out, but its in Scottsdale and that's not usually where I go out. Last night we ended up here after going to a couple other bars in Oldtown.

It was pretty packed and we had to wait outside for like 10 minutes before they let us in but it was worth it.

The first thing we noticed when we walked in was Steve Nash chilling with some guys. I wouldn't have expected him at a place like this but it was really cool. They also had Mr. T upstairs dancing with a bunch of women.

Drinks are cheap. We got a couple mixed drinks and a couple beers for $14. Bartenders are cute and friendly from what I saw.

They had two girls up on the bar with a beer bong and I thought that was awesome. I didn't participate, but it was fun watching other people do it.

We got there kind of late, so it ended up clearing out a little bit and we were able to get our grove on. The whole vibe of the place was just really cool. I ended up having a blast here and I'm definitely planning on going back next weekend!
