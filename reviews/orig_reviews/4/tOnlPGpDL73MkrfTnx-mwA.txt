I think this place is really good. Is it authentic or legit? Who cares it's really good. I have been here twice now. I thought it was good the first time but I also thought the beer was good too so I wanted to wait to go again to write a review in case the beer was talking the first time. But no it is confirmed this place is really good. Now I won't say wow this is the best Mexican food I have ever had ever and I will never go anywhere else but it's at the top of the list.
The restaurant itself is very nice. The aesthetic inside and out is great. I really like the big iron tree that is covered in lights that divides the restaurant from the bar area. It's a small place but there is plenty of room and no wait to be seated. The staff is very friendly but I have to say our waitress the first time was a little bit better than our waiter the second. They both did a great job but the waitress the first time was just a little more personable. Now the company I was with might have effected my experience too. With friends the first time and parent the second. So I might of had a little more fun and therefore a better experience the first time.
Great food. I had the Sonoran Enchiladas this time. Very good. Filling too. Awesome chips and salsa too. They may have contributed to the fullness. I also like the fact that they have real Mexican beer on tap and you can order pitchers if you want. They give you a pitcher of water when you sit down as well so you are never short on water. Always a good thing.
Overall I think this is a great place and I will be back. In fact I will be there again in a few weeks with friends.
