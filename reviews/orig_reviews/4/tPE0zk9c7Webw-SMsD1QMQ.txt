Pretty good steak.  I know it's a New Mexican place but it's dark and loud and a friend blurted out that filet was on the menu before my eyes had a chance to adjust so I've never had anything else here after a few visits.  No problem, the filet is good, the potatoes are good and the sauce is good.  

The main negative is that this place can get kinda packed on the Friday and Saturday night so parking is a hassle even though they have their own parking lot.
