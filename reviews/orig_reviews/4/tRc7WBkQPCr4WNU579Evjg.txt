Tako has a really unique and elevated menu for its cuisine. We got the corn, tuna, and wings as appetizers. The corn and tuna were just mediocre for us - we thought they were over seasoned and a little harsh on the taste buds. The wings were cooked really well, the meat literally fell off of it. We got three tacos to share, the octopus and the Korean pork. They both were absolutely wonderful and totally demolished the apps to be honest. I will definitely go back for them but probably won't eat any apps next time. We didn't drink so I can't speak to that but the drink menu looked like it was on point! Maybe I'll try those next time ;)
