We were a pretty big party of about 30 people, 2 super long tables that we seemed to keep adding to.

Glad they had a separate banquet room for large parties.  

The food took awhile to order as well as to come out.  Sometimes service was super and other times delayed and maybe because we were such a large party.  Josh was our main waiter.  

Food was good, but my husband asked for his Carne Asada to be well done and when he got it, it was on the rare side, so we sent it back to be cooked longer.  It was good and at least gives us a place locally that has reasonable Carne Asada for my husband.

My daughter got some blue corn tortilla dish thing, my son a burrito (not sure what kind) and I got some chili rellano thing stuff with their pork specialty.  Food was good.  

No real complaints nor anything super, super outstanding.  We would come back again.
