After hearing people at work rave about Marta's I had to try it.  Met husband there about 430 pm on a Friday night.  The decor is beautiful! We both were impressed.  

We were immediately served salsa and chips which were tasty.  I got a strawberry margarita which was half price for happy hour, but really small.  It was really good though! Husband got some kind of beer on tap. I also got a Diet Pepsi (no Coke products always upset me!)

We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer to share and again it was small! Most Mexican places bring them out on those huge silver plates that take up the whole table.  It tasted great though!

For entrees I got 3 cheese enchiladas and double rice with green sauce.  Let me say it's hard to find green sauce with no meat in it! The enchiladas were fabulous, the rice not so much!  It reminded me of those Rice A Roni cheater Mexican rices I make at home since I can't cook!  It was good, but I don't know if we will go back.  Overall, we prefer Arriba,
