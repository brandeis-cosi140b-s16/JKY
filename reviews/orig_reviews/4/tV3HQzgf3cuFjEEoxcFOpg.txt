we were looking for mexican food in our trip to vegas until we found this place.........

we tried the carne asada tacos and were great, but we came back the next day and ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was THE BEST shrimp cocktail EVER.

I have tried a lot of places for a good sea food cocktail but none compare to this one, all natural shrimp and octopus (optional) lots of avocado and the hand made tortilla chips were hecka good...... and dont even bother to order the small size cup, go for the large size if you really like sea food,

our kids ordered the quesadilla and the torta and were excellent as well,
the place is clean and prices are decent.

the only reason for the 4 stars is the lack of fresh salsa bar and tortilla chips provided to costumers when waiting for the order. Almost forgot,..... they could inprove the fish ceviche tostadas........... 

overall the place is worth the traveling from the strip (like 10 mins) and the money......
