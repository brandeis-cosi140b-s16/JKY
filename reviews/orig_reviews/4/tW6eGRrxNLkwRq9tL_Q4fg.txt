Even though I miss the ahi tacos dearly, I still love this place.  I've since discovered the ceviche, the corn on the cob, the quesadillas, the burritos, oh my!  Everything is always really fresh and VERY tasty.  The staff is super friendly every time.  I can't wait to see what will be my next yummy discovery!
