Finally a Wahoos in Vegas!

This location is the same as all the others.

Consistantly good healthy food at a reasonable price. 

So nice to beable to NOT eat on the strip while passing though town.

This location is HUGE and the first that I have been to that has a full bar (slots too...well it IS Vegas)

Only bummer is they don't have "beer of the month" at this location but no biggy.
