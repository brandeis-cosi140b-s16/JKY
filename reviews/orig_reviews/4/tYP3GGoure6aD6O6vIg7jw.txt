You walk into this place and it's hot. The building itself is nothing to look at, like many local Mexican restaurants it is a bit run down and sparse inside. I have only had the tacos here, but they were really good. The shell is deep fried and probably the best part, but the rest of it was fresh and good as well (lettuce isn't limp and the tomatoes looked good too). Overall if you are looking for a local place to eat for lunch I would recommend this.
