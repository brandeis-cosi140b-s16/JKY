I'm in love. The festive d√©cor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.

We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink. 

We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch!
The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.

Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service.
