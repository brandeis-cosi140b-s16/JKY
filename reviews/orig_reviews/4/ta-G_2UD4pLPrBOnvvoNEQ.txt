I went here with a friend for lunch on a Tuesday and was pleasantly surprised to find that Tuesday is all day Happy Hour. Many of the dishes are included and of course beverages. We decided to try the "cheese dip" with vegetables instead of chorizo as an appetizer. The dip came with homemade bread and chips and was very tasty. For entrees we decided to try the fish and the shrimp tacos which were both delicious. The restaurant serves their hot-sauces in bottles and both the green and red sauce are very tasty with a full and flavorful taste. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fun and somewhat mid-century modern like the hotel it is attached to.  Overall my experience was great but I would recommend some improvement in customer service when it come to the waitstaff. Not to friendly or competent ... well maybe our waiter just had a bad day :) I will definitely return to this restaurant to enjoy some more tasty food and delicious beverages!
