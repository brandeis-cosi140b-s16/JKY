I went here on a blind date and the food was better than the date. The service was excellent and very professional. I had the tacos and they were delicious. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the price. I thought the price was a little high for what you get. But overall its a great date spot and a good place for a nice power lunch.
