This place is freaking amazing. My boyfriend grew up eating there so he craves it from time to time. I've only eaten inside once and we usually get take out but it's so good. He gets the red chili burro and I get green chili. We also order a cheese crisp folded and side of chips and salsa. Yes all in one order, I seat half the next day. Highly recommend this joint.
