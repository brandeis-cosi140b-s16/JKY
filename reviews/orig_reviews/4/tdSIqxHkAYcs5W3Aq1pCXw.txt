Friendly and attentive staff. Clean kitchen that yields great food in good portions.  I'm a big Chipotle fan and Cafe Rio is much better in their portions, taste and overall quality.  

The service line can be a bit slower than people would wish for....SLOW DOWN...it takes time to make good food.  Chat with the person behind you, read your book, hug your kids...then enjoy the good eats.
