like this place. I particularly like that it is NOT the typical Mexican refried beans, with blobs of cheese kind of Mexican place. Instead it seems to be more Southern Mexican food with Black beans (my favorite), and even things like "Fried RIPE Plantains" something you usually only find in Cuban or Salvadorean or Honduran restaurants. So thumbs up for this place. And the Margaritas are great. Just not a huge fan of the high chair tables that make up most of the restaurant. Doesn't make it very convenient to go there with young kids. but they DO have some regular tables with normal chairs too. so if you bring kids, make sure you reserve one of the lower/normal tables ahead of time.
