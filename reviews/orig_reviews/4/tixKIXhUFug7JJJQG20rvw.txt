Good place to pop in for a margarita and an appetizer. Went there with my brother on our vegas trip to grab a giant margarita to begin our trek down the strip but decided to have some food before diving head first into a day of drinking. 

Steak nachos were good and tasted really fresh. Chips and salsa were free for the first and were above par imo. Prices kinda sucked but its on the strip. Margarita was nice and strong which had me surprised, because I was expecting it to be weak as hell. Overall good place
