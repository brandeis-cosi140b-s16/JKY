I found this place while driving up 7th Avenue.

I stopped in and picked up some food.

I came back again the next day!

This place is super divey, but serves up excellent versions of the classic Sonoran style Mexican food that I love so much....and it is incredibly cheap!  I was surprised to see the cheap prices, and even more surprised that the food turned out to be so delicious!  The crispy beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are excellent versions of the classics.  Their green chile beef is divine, but I do wish they had green enchilada sauce in addition to the red version, but nonetheless, it was still tasty!  Oh, and the cheese crisp....so crispy, so cheesy, and held up all the way back to my office!

But one of my true barometers of good Mexican food is the beans...and let me just say....their beans are everything beans should be; creamy, salty and rich....they are AMAZING!

This is not very far from my office...which may cause me to visit more frequently than I should....but at these prices...the only thing that will suffer is my waistline!
