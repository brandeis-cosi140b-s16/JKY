Went there with a group of 20 last night. Large bar area, good sized dinning room, and we were in a decent sized room off the dinning room. large flat screen TVs encompase each room.  probably be a good place to catch a game. the servers are still getting used to place, but were very nice and gracious. 

service was a bit slow, and the food also came out slow; not horribly slow, but was noticeable. i hope it's just because they are still getting through their opening jitters. 

someone ordered 4 sets of their chips and salsa ($4.95) that came with very hard chips, tomatillo salsa and chopped tomatoes with a little onion and cilantro added. the tomatillo was good but the tomato side was boring.

i had the full size Cajun Nachos (Half $10.95 / Full $15.95; Blue corn chips, Cajun blackened Louisiana mudbugs, blackened chicken, shrimp with Andouille sausage, pepper jack cheese, tomatoes, scallions, red onions and garnished with fried okra and sauce remoulade). it was a pretty good entree, but would be a great appetizer for two to share.  i couldn't finish it all, but someone else in our group powered through it!  very tasty mix for nachos.

all the others in our group commented that the food was good, from the Jambalaya to the nachos to the club sandwich.

we will probably go back and look forward to faster service and quicker food.
