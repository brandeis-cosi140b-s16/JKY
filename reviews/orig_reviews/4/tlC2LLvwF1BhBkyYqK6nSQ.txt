Just moved into "the hood" and excited to have found this gem!

The husband and I stopped in for a quick bite Sunday brunch-ish time, and had a great time. I am pretty sure that we were the first patrons in the building and the bartender was very eager to serve us. We parked ourselves at the bar and looked over the brunch menu. 

We each picked a few tacos and decided to split a street corn. Our bartender was very nice to ask if we would like them to put the corn off the cob, I very enthusiastically accepted. No need for corn teeth. 

The tacos were delish!!!! My breakfast taco, was ok, but eggs don't have a ton of flavor on their own so no fault of theirs there. They put this awesome jalape√±o infused bacon inside, very interesting and yummy! I also had the chicken taco, which was perfect! Very juicy and flavorful, usually chicken can be underwhelming, but they hit it on the mark. Jon had cherry steak (I think that is what it was called) and a pork taco and a breakfast one as well. The steak was killer, they put these pepper fried string things on top that made the whole taco. The pork was very good as well, but probably my least fave of the tacos we had. 

The street corn was my only disappointment. It isn't what I am used to like at Blanco or Gallo Blano. Theirs is spicy, less creamy and kinda watery. I don't think I would get it again, but some people might like it, you decide. 

The place looks great, and being walking distance from mi casa I can see me being there often.
