Just writing a quick update. I would like to give a 4 star amended review on service alone based on a message I received from a manager at Border Grill after I posted my initial review. 

Although they really didn't do anything horribly wrong during my visit, the manager apologized for not providing a wow experience, thanked me for my feedback, and invited me to contact them in the future for a complimentary meal. 

It is so nice to see a business that does not get defensive in the face of criticism, let alone one that goes out of its way to display such gracious behavior. Certainly, this type of welcoming, open, and friendly customer service is rare and should be commended. Thank you, Border Grill!
