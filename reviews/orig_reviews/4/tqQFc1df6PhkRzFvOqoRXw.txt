Delicious tacos. I had the skirt steak (highly recommend) and the pineapple pork tacos al la carte. Service started really good and slowly our waiter faded away into the distance. They were out of ice cream (what?) so no dessert but that's okay because we ate three platters of chips and salsa. Cute joint, I liked the pineapple wallpaper. Retro vibe. Overall, good experience and would return, especially with $2 taco Monday's!
