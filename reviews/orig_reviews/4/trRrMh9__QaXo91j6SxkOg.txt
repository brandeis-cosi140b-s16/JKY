Was pretty good I thought. This is a slightly more upscale Mexican place so they fancy things up a bit and charge more for it. The chicken enchiladas with a creamy sauce on them I had were good and reasonably priced. The beans were good, rice sorta blah. I also had a  Los 1511 Margarita which was very good and had lots of fresh lime but it was not $12 good in a 10 ounce glass. To start with I had the table side made guacamole which was excellent and a decent serving size. I would go here again.
