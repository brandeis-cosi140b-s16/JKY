I am so excited that they opened a Cafe Rio here in Phoenix! Their fresh tortillas are AMAZING! I love getting their Salads with chicken and their house ranch dressing is to die for! I think that is one of the reasons why I go there! I just wished they had a few more options for toppings! I will be back!
