The best way to get acquainted with Barrio Queen is to visit on Taco Tuesday! You can order any of their 20 street tacos for only $2.50 each and they have a variety of drinks for $3 each, I'm in!  

I typically get 3 different tacos for a variety but can only ever finish about 2 of them fully.  I get the pollo, carne asada and chile relleno (it's delicious but very spicy so beware).  For the price the tacos are amazing, don't be afraid to experiment, after all they are only $2.50! 

The service is hit and miss depending on your server.  My favorite is Veronica, she is sooo sweet and knows the menu like the back of her hand.  She really makes the experience so much better.  

I have yet to try any entrees, I think the tacos are the best deal on the menu and i dont want to stray away from them.  It is interesting that the chips and salsa are $3, but if you are with a group, they amount to about $1, so just think of it that way! :) 

P.S. With the right server, you end up with bottomless chips and salsa so the money is well spent!
