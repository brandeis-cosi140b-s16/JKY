Perfect place for a large group of folks who have different palates and budgets.  
There were about 20 of us and they hade to split us up into 2 tables which would've been ok if not for that fact that both tables were situated very far apart from each other.  

The table that I was at received excellent waitstaff service, the food came quickly and was tasty, the bill was less than $30 /person.
The other table complained that their food and later the bill took a long time.

I rec: 
- the Queso Fundido, 'cause how can one fuck up fried cheese?
- the guac
- carnitas (very tender and juicy, plus I love me some hog)
- veggie enchiladas
