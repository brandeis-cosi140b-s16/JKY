I love to read reviews from everybody complaining about the drive to Carefree.    I feel your pain when I go to a Dbacks game  I live a couple miles down Carefree Highway but in 3 years had never stopped here at the Donkey ..but we went    Maybe you have heard the weather in AZ is glorious 9 months of the year and many restaurants have wonderful outdoor seating     So we cruised up the road thinking about dinner and at the bar we just had drinks and chips with the fundido.  Then we were full.  Next time we had drinks and an appetizer and we were full and left.    Everything tasty.   The  drinks were weak, but I like them strong enough to make me scared driving home.   Mac and cheese is tasty.  I'm going Wednesday for lunch.  I will try to get an entree.   Someone mentioned they didn't like the crowd.  This isn't old town Scottsdale. It is almost Carefree next to an expensive resort.   So no rap music or skanks.   Older folks with money! Worth a visit if you're in town.  If you're staying at the Boulders ask for doubles and stagger back to your room.
