I came here with a co-worker for happy hour and we sat at the outdoor bar.  The outdoor bar was nice and cool with really nice wait staff.

We each started off with a huge margarita ($5).  I only drank 1/4 of it because I was already feeling tipsy.  

From the Happy Hour menu we ordered the following:
Spare ribs - it was tender and mount in your mouth, I highly recommend these.
Queso and cheese dip - We can eat this all night!!!
Sliders - we won't be ordering these next time, it was a little too salty for us gals.
Whip cream cheese and blackberry dessert - delicious!!
Sopapillas - This should have just been our meal!

We will definitely go here again, totally worth going to the happy hour.
