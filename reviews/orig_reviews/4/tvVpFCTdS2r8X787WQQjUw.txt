my husband and I were driving by this place the other day and not knowing anything about it decided we would give it a try. 
I was pleased with the food. I got a bit of food envy when my husband's dish was way yummier than what I ordered. 
I got the tacos with beef and potatoes combination. I forget the exact name of the dish my husband ordered, but it was sort of a shrimp burrito dish. It had plenty of shrimp in it and was very tasty. My tacos were good, but I was disappointed at the amount of potatoes in it. I was hoping for a layer of potatoes and a layer of beef, but what they do is mix bits of potato with the beef. It was still good. 

Their chips and salsa are decent. The salsa for me gets a bit too spicy after a while. 

I would definitley go again if I'm in the neighborhood.
