A friend introduced us to this place a few months back and I can't stop coming back. The tacos are a good size and price! The corn salsa appetizer is super yummy. Didn't care too much for the crunchy taco, just wasn't my style. Some of my favorite tacos were the El Pastor, the Carne Asada, and the Creme.
