When I'm craving taco's Fuzzy's is always a top choice! I usually get chips and salsa and chicken tacos and they have always satisfied my taste buds! Every time I go in the cashier who takes your order is friendly and ready to help with any needs. They also have great happy hour and amazing beergaritas!
