Love this place!  

I have been away from the Valley for a decade. Chino's in North Phoenix was a favorite lunch destination. This location is hard to find but so much cleaner. 

Great food. Jerk chicken burrito and chile relent quesadilla. Yum. A complimentary snicker doodle to go...too. I dream about the refried black beans.
