The wait was a kinda long for just 2 orders of taquitos but it was well worth it. Had the flauta carne asada & potato/cheese w/side of rice. The portions are a good size, about 6 pieces per plate piled with guacamole, fresh salsa, Mexican cream & cheese. I could barely finish an order. The rice was really tasty too. I noticed a lot ppl ordering the taco plates and they looked delish, everyone's plates were licked clean. Good authentic Mexican food, definitely a step up from Roberto's lol
