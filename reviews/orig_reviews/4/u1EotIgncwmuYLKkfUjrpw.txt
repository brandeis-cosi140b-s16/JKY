Wow, surprised reviews from others were on the so-so, not too happy side. We really enjoyed this place. The inside atmosphere had a "quaint" kind of feel. The carne asada steak tacos were delish, they have great homemade tortillas.  I recommend this fine Mexican establishment if you are in Scottsdale!
