Good Mexican food.  This is our favorite sit down Meixcan in the East Valley.  Our usual order is the Pizza Blanco.  Giant fried flour tortilla topped with cream cheese, chicken, tomatoes, cheese, and peppers.  We split this and usually take half home.

I'm also a fan of the a la carte burritos.  

Thumbs up for being kid friendly as well.
