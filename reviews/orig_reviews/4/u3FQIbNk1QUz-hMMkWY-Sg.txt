Went here one night to grab a bite to eat in between jumping form casino to casino. Advertised that they had the best tacos, so being the taco fan that I am decided to check it out. 
Ordered a Margarita and some chips and salsa to start myself off. The margarita was made well with a generous pour and lots of fresh squeezed lime. Delicious! The chips also came with 3 different salsas which were quite good. While waiting for my food the bar tender kept telling me these random stories which I found to be hilarious, did a great job killing time before the food came out.
Then it was time for the good stuff, the tacos. I ordered one with cabeza, one with lengua, and one with goat. The first two were very good, very delicious, but I found the goat to be a little tough. The tacos were very good and bonus points for  having lengua and cabeza on the menu. 
Would go back in a heart beat
