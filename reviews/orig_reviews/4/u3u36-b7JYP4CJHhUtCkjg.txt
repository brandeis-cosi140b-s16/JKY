I've been meaning to update this for a while. I gave them another try, because they have delivery (only $10 minimum, and $1 delivery fee, I believe). I tried a burger instead of Mexican food, and WOW! What a vast improvement! Their burgers are huge, tons of great choices, comes with a side, and the prices are VERY reasonable.
