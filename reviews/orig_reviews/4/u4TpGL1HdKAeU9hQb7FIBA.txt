I like most of the food here. We've been 3 or 4 times. I love the guacomole, but I will say some of my favorite mexican food options aren't on the menu. Prices are kinda high and service is hit or miss. I've definitely had better Mexican food, but we've obviously been back more than once.... so overall, good food.
