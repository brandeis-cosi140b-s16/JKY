I don't know why this place got such rough reviews. ...honestly I thought the food was tasty solid service all the way around and the prices were decent. I had the super day burrito with red enchilada sauce it was huge!  My gf had the fajita salad and loved it. So all in all really good food great prices. The only thing I didn't like was the ridiculously large menu I think they could cut that down a bit or maybe separate the drink/coctails menu from the food menu.
