Nice ambiance, pleasant service. Everyone pitches in to make sure customers are hydrated & fed (warm chips/salsa). We ordered a standard taco (slow roasted chicken), carnitas (pork) taco, fish taco, and the braised beef taco along with black beans. All of which were quite yummy. I also tried their Cucumber- Serrano margarita - refreshing with a kick of heat - loved it! Overall a nice experience. Check it out :)
