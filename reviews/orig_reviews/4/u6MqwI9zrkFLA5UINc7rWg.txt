My husband and I enjoyed dinner at Sonrisa Grill. We stayed at the Ravella midweek in June and many of the restaurants in the Village were closed. I read the negative reviews on service on Yelp, but we decided to take a chance. The service was good and the food was delicious. Being from San Diego, we have our share of excellent Mexican Restaurants but Sonrisa offered some new and different flavors and menu choices. The tortilla soup was rich and smokey - unlike any I've had before. You must try the ribs! The ribs were so delicious - dressed in a thick, smokey sauce with a bit of a kick, and served with the a mango salsa. I'd never thought to pair mango and ribs together but it was so delicious. I tried to get the rib recipe from the waitress, but she wouldn't reveal the "secret spices". The margaritas were tasty too. Not too sweet and served in a larger glass than usual. Would definitely return on our next visit.
