I have been twice - once just for happy hour, and once for dinner. I'll review both.

HAPPY HOUR - Awesome! Amazing chips and other apps, and good drinks! I stuck with beer, but my BF tried their margaritas. They were good! This is definitely one of my top places to go for HH. I love places with a good vibe, clean, and easy!

DINNER - made reservations the day of for a party of 11. When we got there, they had given us the private room! Yay! Our waitress was ah-maz-ing! She divided our check so each person's order was sub-totaled; fantastic when you are dealing with people who have been drinking for the past two hours. I only got their version of the garden salad because I filled up on chips and drinks! The salad was very tasty though, and used quality ingredients. Everyone was very satisfied with their food - those that got the house rice were especially raving about its taste. My GF order "The Big Stick" in 32oz. Huge, pretty, and yummy if sugary drinks are your thing. Definitely fun to look at though!

During both visits, all employees were attentive and helpful. The prices are very reasonable, and the serving sizes are perfect so you don't have to worry about being too stuffed to fit into your club gear!
