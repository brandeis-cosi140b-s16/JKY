I thoroughly enjoyed the food- they serve large portions and mine was very good. I ate a combination plate of chile relleno, enchilada, and tostada there. The only thing bad about the food was they served it when it was still way too hot to eat. Although they got me the food fast, I would have preferred if they had let it cool down slightly before bringing it to the table. I also had some of their margaritas. I really can't complain because the price is so good. I've had better margaritas, but for under $2, that's a pretty good deal. The waiter came by frequently and it was a pleasant experience. It's a fairly loud venue so it's good for a fun night out but not as good if you prefer more intimate conversation.
