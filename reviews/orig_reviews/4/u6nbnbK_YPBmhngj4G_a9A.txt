Have been a fan of La Canasta's Red Chile for ages. Then they closed Richard's that was close to work so in a jonseing frenzy I decided to drive a few extra miles to check out Sylvia's La Canasta.. was totally worth the drive.

Ordered a green chile and red chile burro.. while the red chile was very good the green chile was the real start here! It was tender meat surrounded by a thick and cream like sauce.. haven't had green chile this good in ages!

You order from the counter then you sit and wait for your food. This is not a full service restaurant's, just an fyi. With this in mind I thought that 5 bucks a burrito was a bit steep considering that the burros were rather smallish. For the quality and the all you can eat chips and salsa bar made it worth it. I waddled out of there!
