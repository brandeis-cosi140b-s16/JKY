I discovered the stand a few summers ago. It was the newest addition of eats to the my then neighborhood. The Stand is a local owned foodie shop. The Owner is a super nice dude & he's usually working right up front with staff which I think is dope. 

My favorite things to order are the chicken tacos & fries. The absolute best milkshake on the menu is the caramelized salted dulce de leche!  The menu is a tad bit pricy.. You can end up spending 20 dollars easy. Overall dope spot to go on a summer afternoon.
