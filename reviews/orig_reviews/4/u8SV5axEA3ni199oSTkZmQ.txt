We went to check it out last night and took the whole family. We have 2 little kids (3 and 4). We ordered the chips/guac. Loved it! The kids ate a cheese quesadilla - a little greasy but...cant really complain since they ate all of it which rarely happens. My husband ordered the cubano torta and said it was amazing and I ordered the halibut ceviche which was also outstanding. Our waitress Danielle was very helpful and kept a great eye on us and our children. We will definitely we revisting - thank you Taco Haus!
