A great new place! 

We have been fans of Brat Haus and were excited to try their new restaurant Taco Haus. It did not disappoint. The staff was friendly, from our host to our waitress Sydney. We also saw the owner, Dave, who came by to check on us.

We started with the chorizo fundido and it was very good. You can taste the difference local vegetables make and the Niman chorizo was amazing.

We both tried the brunch items; the chorizo skillet and the huevos rancheros. Again, both were excellent with fresh local ingredients. 

It is a large restaurant with a big patio. The margarita was fresh and the bloody mary was very tasty!

We haven't tried the tacos yet but plan on coming back on a Tuesday to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday Specials.
