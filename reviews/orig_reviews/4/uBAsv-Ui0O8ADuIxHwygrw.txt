Muy beuno! Between the atmosphere, food and drinks, all I can say is...muy bueno! 

I am so happy that Sol decided to make the Scottsdale Quarter home. This is the perfect restaurant to visit for lunch during an afternoon of shopping, or for a date night later that evening! 

The vibe here is calm, cool and collected. It's on the darker side which makes for a cool escape on a hot day. I can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can take advantage of their nice patio as well! 

I love the drinks here, especially the skinny margaritas! They have the perfect amount of carbonation which I love in a cocktail. The bartenders are super friendly, as is all the staff! 

Now let's talk about the food. I love the food here! It's quite simple. This is delicious Mexican food. The table-side guac is creamy and comes with large tostadas! Throw in some of their spicy salsa and it's sublime. Their carne asada is some of the best I've ever tasted thanks to their seasoning and tenderness of the meat. I also absolutely love their fish tacos! The sauce they use with the combination of cabbage and fish wrapped up into a tortilla is second to none. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! I also like how they sell the tacos individually on the menu. This means that you can order one fish taco and one carne asada, or whatever combination you feel like! Each taco is about $4 but be warned, they are filling!
