Really cool place! Very hip and young vibe and environment. The decor was eccentric but modern. The menu was creative Mexican food with a modern twist. The nachos were really good, they used a really good white cheese. The tacos are also pretty good, the shrimp especially are tasty. Friendly helpful staff. The have creative alcoholic drinks and you can add alcohol to their agua frescas.We will for sure  go back.
