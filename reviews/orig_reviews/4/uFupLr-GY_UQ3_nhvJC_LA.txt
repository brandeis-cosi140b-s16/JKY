We have been coming to dine at El Encanto for over ten years, it has changed very little.  The food has been consistently above average from the first visit.  Chips are crispy, but they could be warm, the salsa (three varieties) are good, tho I think the lime green one needs some explaining, (what's in it?, again I forgot to ask).  I don't think the menu has changed at all since our first visit.  My favorite is the Pollo Asado con Salsa Autentica ranchero style with black beans and rice.  The cheese quesadilla and sample platter was ample and delicious.  Our drinks were checked and refilled promptly, and the margaritas were excellent.  The pond is full of turtles, and fewer ducks than I remember from my last visit, (they aren't on the menu) and the ducks and turtles will keep you entertained while waiting on your food and during your meal. The one inconsistency is the level of attention from the servers.  Our last visit was fine, our waitress was prompt and friendly, but prior visits did lack the prompt service and drink refills you would expect from a good restaurant, resulting in our request for a visit with the manager.   Prices are reasonable especially for the neighborhood.  I wouldn't hesitate to take out of town guests for unique atmosphere, indoor or outdoor seating and good food.  They can be busy on weekends and holidays, I would recommend calling ahead for reservations.
