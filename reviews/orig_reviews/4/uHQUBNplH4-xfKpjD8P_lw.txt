Great dinner.  Bummed they were out of strawberry cheesecake but everything else was really good.  Fish was cooked well which is a hard thing to do right in the valley.  Salsa was great and service was good.  We will be back.  Especially for the shrimp Appetizer. It was very traditional and delicious.  A refreshing treat!
