Solid mex food and solid drinks, especially if you live in the Northwest Valley.  This is the upscale mexican you are looking for , some would give it 5 stars, but I wouldnt as while its authentic, something is missing, maybe it just the fact they have to produce more, it misses some of that motherly love from a tiajuana street house or a few leaves of cilantro, or maybe its missing a lime.  NOt sure, but its really really good, I would rate the food 5 stars, value 4 stars, location 1 star, unless you live up here in Canada Vegas, and 4 star service, 4 star atmosphere, so 4 stars...If I could give it a half star I would....give it a try...undalay undalay yee ba esa...esa..........OH, by the way, the drinks are 5 star!
