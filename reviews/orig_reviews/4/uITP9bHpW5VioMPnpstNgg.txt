Thisnplace has the really good food. The atmosphere is pretty chill, I like how it's Inside and outside, they were a little pricy but it's red rock not Roberto's, so it's nothing crazy over board. I'll come here again I like it. The only thing that keeps it from five star was our server wasn't very social or attentive but it was a crazy busy night.
