Burrito shack is literally a shack on the side of Power rd. I past by this place numerous times and one day decided to try it out. The food is awesome the burritos taste amazing the service is good. Its a he in the wall looking place but it adds to the appeal of the place. Great spot my only complaint are the hours of operation are horrible. Other than that it's great check them out!!
