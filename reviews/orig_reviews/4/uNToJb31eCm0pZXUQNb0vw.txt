Some happy hour action here on a Friday night with HH running until 7pm. They give you free chips and salsa and that salsa comes in weird flower like vases. Not sure if they are trying to be different, but you might as well give us something we can dip our chips into cause a chip ain't fitting into that salsa casket. So, now you have to dump the salsa onto the plate and use two chips to get the chunky salsa onto your chip. Dumb. The "hot" salsa really had no kick and was more sweet than anything else. Beers were reasonable at $2.75 a pop and we tried two appetizers. The tostada's were standard with refried beans and lots of lettuce basically, but they gave about five per order at 4 bucks each. The better choice was the mini chimi's with fresh chunky guac at 6 bucks. Get it stuffed with ground beef, it was pretty good and you get four of them per order. Fairly crowded in the bar, but emptied out soon after HH ended. Good value for the stuff we ordered.
