Any old friend took my party here on a recent visit back to Arizona and this place did not disappoint. (Well, except the for the fact there's no beer/wine/alcohol.) My friend and I ordered two giant tortas. I remember mine having steak, pork tenderloin, ham, chorizo and two fried eggs, avocado, etc. It was a heavy sandwich and came with ruffles chips. The sandwich burst with bold Mexican flavors. I washed it all down with a giant order of michelada, with full celery stalk. My sister order camarones (shrimp) and her fiance ordered nachos. Both dishes received high remarks.

This place offers traditional Mexican fare and a dozen crazy tortas. My friend said this restaurant can get packed, with lines of people waiting for a  table. It is a place not to be missed.
