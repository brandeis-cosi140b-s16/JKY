The teepee is an arcadia neighborhood staple.  If you grew up anywhere around there, you went there as a kid.  It's not the best mexican food in town, but it IS the town.  

The sour cream enchiladas are a feast of cheesy fat.  If i could eat them several times a week somehow without getting ginormously fat, i would!  

They have killer margaritas... very strong.  The atmosphere is kind of like a dive bar.  I don't think the scottsdale crowd would get the appeal to this place... but it's the first place i go when i get back in town.

The taped up booths and old fashioned menus make me feel at home.  

If you want to drink like you grew up going there, try louis' lemonade...  but be prepared to stumble out!
