Very cute authentic looking decor,  our waitress was very nice and made suggestions since it was our first time here.  The chips came out hot and green and red salsas were tasty and hot. I liked the red, yum! 
I ordered a beef taco and cheese enchilada,  both very good and we're piping hot! They have you a huge portion too so go with an appetite, I'm STUFFED and my plate still looks full.  Prices are fairly low considering how much food you get. I would come back and try this place again.
