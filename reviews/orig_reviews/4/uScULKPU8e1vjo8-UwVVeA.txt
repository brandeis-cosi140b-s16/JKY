We were in Phoenix this past weekend for a wedding and wanted a low key, fun, yummy mexican feast before heading for a night out on the town.

Los Sombreros was recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel and it was great!  We sat on the adorable, sparkly light-lit patio and stayed warm with the help of two heaters.  The place was pretty busy but not too loud.  The margaritas were huge and strong as can be and made just the way we liked em!  We shared an order of guacamole - i was slightly disappointed since other yelpers RAVED about it - i thought it was pretty standard, a little better than "just OK".  Both of us ordrerd the chilaquiles (he shrimp, me chicken) and they were fantastic although it would have been great  if our server told us that each dish was a legit 10 lbs! We EASILY could have split!

we had such a fun time, the service was good, food was good and the patio was a great backdrop for a casual, albeit fairly romantic meal.
