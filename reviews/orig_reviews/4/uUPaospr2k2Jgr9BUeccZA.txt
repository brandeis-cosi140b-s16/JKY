My husband and I had a great late dinner here.  We had been told by a neighbor it was a "hole in the wall", so we were a little surprised by the (slightly high) price of the entrees.  The food was delicious (we got the vegetarian tamales) and the service was great.  We sat and had a drink at the bar while waiting and had great service throughout.  

The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it may be slightly pricy and they don't have a lot of menu options for vegetarians.  Otherwise, great spot.
