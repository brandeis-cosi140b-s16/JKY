We stopped here for a happy hour and it was an awesome experience hence it is connected to the mall. 

Happy hour food was great, fast, and fresh! Beer, I don't have to talk about that... Never disappoints:-) 

We sat at the bar and my boyfriend was happy as he could watch the goofball game while I was writing this review. Our bartender was really friendly, exposing menu to us and helping us pick the right choices. 

Music could be little louder and air condition lower. 

We are for going to swing by next time we are at the mall!
