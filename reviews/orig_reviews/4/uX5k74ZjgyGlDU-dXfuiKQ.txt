They have the best salsa verde I've had in AZ by far!

Tacos here consist of  tortillas, meat, diced onions and cilantro... none of that sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo stuff. It was perfect, the way I like it. Each taco was generously filled with tasty carne asada... without those hidden pieces of fat chunks some places mix in as fillers.
