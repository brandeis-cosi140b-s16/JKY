I can (and sometimes do) eat here two or more times a week. Their salsa bar is the best (pecan, mexicana, cilantro are my favorite -- I still haven't tried their strawberry salsa everyone raves about as it's not in season). Their veggie burrito is the most amazing I've ever had anywhere. No, seriously. It's true. Now they even offer a vegan version, but that Oaxacan cheese is too good to pass up. My meat eating friends love this place, too. 

I'd give them 5 stars, but their service is a bit slow and you may need to fill up your own water glass or go up front to pay your bill.
