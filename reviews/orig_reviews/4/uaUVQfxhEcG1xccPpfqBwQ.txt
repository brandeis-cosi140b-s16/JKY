JD and I wanted a super casual place for lunch on Saturday after a workout and he suggested here and it was the perfect spot. The chips and salsa were exceptionally good, or I had just worked up a voracious appetite at the gym, probably some of both. 

JD ordered a cheese crisp and I made fun of him by asking if he was on a diet. Then I ate my words when the behemoth greasy cheesy large pizza sized crisp actually came to the table. It was HUGE! A thin crispy tortilla topped with tons of melty fantastic-ness! It was cut in squares like some pizza's too which made it easy to eat. I had the Mexican Flag enchiladas and they were fine, but lackluster in comparison to the giant wheel of melted cheese across the table. 

All in all it was a great meal and definitely reversed any good I had just done at the gym, but that's life and I'm fine with it!
