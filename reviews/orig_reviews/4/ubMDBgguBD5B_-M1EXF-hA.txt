At first I was skeptical about Vida simply because many of these trendy mexican places often offer only mediocre food.  However, I've been there several times, and yes, I am fan.  In all honesty, I wish I could offer a review of more dishes, but I go there for one reason--the naked burrito with queso or as I refer to it--heaven in a bowl.  The burrito comes with a delicious grilled corn, which is the best I've ever had.  I've also sampled their chicken tostada for lunch which was also excellent, but the burrito is special.  While I haven't strayed from this dish much, my wife has enjoyed several dishes there, most recently the shrimp tacos.

Overall, the service is excellent because of their quick and attentive staff.

The lone drawback for me is that they don't validate, so you're left for looking for a space in uptown or paying for parking.
