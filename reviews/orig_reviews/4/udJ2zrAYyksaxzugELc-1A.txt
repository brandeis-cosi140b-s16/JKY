If you want fresh , flavorful meats this is the place for you ! Their carnitas and al pastor are amazing !! They also have a great Mexican style street corn , that is prepared to order ( as all their offerings are ) . They have a pretty big salsa bar with many fresh offerings as well ! Would have 5 stars but their ordering process is pretty confusing , as different meats and offerings have different stations and if you hit one , there is a tip jar at each one , which you kinda feel obligated to tip each one , ( I asked the guy ,he said they don't share ? ) but after you pass all the meat stations , you get to the cashier and guess what ? there is another tip jar there too!' Wtf ? Don't they pay these people ?? For food I would give 5 stars , value(about 13$ for a burrito ,corn and drink ) 3 stars and ordering 2 stars !
