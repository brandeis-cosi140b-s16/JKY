I went for pre-Thanksgiving dinner.  They had a special menu with a tamale, carne asada, and an enchilada with rice and beans for $9.95.  Also sangria's were only $4.  WOW the food was delicious I wish they had this on the menu every night I'd even pay more for it.  The sangria was ok but the food was definitely a hit. The menu looked pretty good so I'll probably come back.
