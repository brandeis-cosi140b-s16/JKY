Three of my friends and I went in to Barrio Queen as an in between before our next destination one night. The place was pretty slow and it was a perfect night so we sat on the patio. Our server came to greet us pretty quickly but I take it that might have to do with the fact that we were one of three tables outside. In any case, he was very attentive throughout the hour or so we were there.

We ordered four drinks that were a little pricy but worth every cent. They were amazing! This was a few weeks ago so I can't quite remember exactly the names but they were delicious. Fresh ingredients and a good amount of booze. 

The server made the guacamole table side and it was awesome. Figs, fresh avocado, apricot, chives, tomato among other ingredients made an awesome end result. 

I give it a 4 star review because even though we didn't have a full meal, given what we did have when we were there, everything was great. I'll definitely have to give it another go around for dinner just to solidify the rating as I have a tendency to be very forgiving. :)
