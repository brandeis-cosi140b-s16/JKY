This is pretty much the only mexican food place i eat at- although it is alittle sketchy on the outside and inside too, it is the definition of a "hole in the wall" 

Amazing food , i genuinly enjoy it! 

styrofoam plates and plastic spoons tho? tisk tisk

the staff is alittle weird - but always very friendly!

over all very good!
