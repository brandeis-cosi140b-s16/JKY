There are things I love, there are things I don't. I keep coming back based on pure convenience. The chicken asada ensalada is my go to, their green enchilada sauce is by far some of the best I've ever had.

However there are times when ordering especially on the phone that you may encounter an immature or child like hostess that doesn't listen and over talks patrons. Not enough to scare me away but enough to make it annoying, maybe just enough to make me question my intentions.
