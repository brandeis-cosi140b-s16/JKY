I went there for the first time last night to see VNV Nation.

Without a doubt, this is the nicest venue which I've been to in the Phoenix Valley.

They serve alcohol.  They have lots of good alcohol.  They have lots of different beers.  The bartenders actually made good drinks.  This is especially important to me because it seems that the other venues either don't serve alcohol or they only have a small selection, most of which is garbage.  There is also a bar with multiple bartenders ~50 feet from the stage!

Atmosphere is very nice.  They did an excellent job planning the acoustics and the sound system.  The sound was fantastic.

Regarding the bathrooms, my wife actually approved, which is a first for her.

Another perk -- they have raised seating (benches?) along the back wall.

The only con -- it was wicked hot by the end of the show ... and it's only the end of March.
