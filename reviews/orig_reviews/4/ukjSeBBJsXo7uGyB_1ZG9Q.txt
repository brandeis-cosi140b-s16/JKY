Pedro's is one of the better Mexican food restaurants in Glendale.   Be warned though that this is a tiny establishment, with minimal parking.  Given that it was no surprise the place was packed.  My husband and I went on Friday evening about 6:30 and were expecting about a 20-30 minute wait.  We were pleasantly surprised when we got a table after only 20 minutes. 
 I was not impressed with the complimentary chips and salsa, the chips were too thin and the salsa was too runny.  We ordered a guacamole cheese crisp appetizer, and it was good, nothing amazing but what can you say about any cheese crisp.  For dinner I had the San Marcos Chicken Burro and my husband ordered the Chimi San Marcos style with green sauce.  Both were huge, filling and super good.  I've never had San Marcos sauce before but this was really tasty.  Both the beef in the chimi and the chicken in the burro were moist and tender.  None of the food was very salty which is a huge plus to me.  The only thing I wish they differently was to offer a good spicy hot sauce. 
 Last thing to take into account, because it's so busy our waitress was not the most attentive although she was friendly
