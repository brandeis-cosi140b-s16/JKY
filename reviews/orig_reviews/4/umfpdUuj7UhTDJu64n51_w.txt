Went there for lunch with the kids. Everything was delicious but found the total higher than I was hoping for. I mean I've had great mexican food for quite a bit less! I guess this is a nice place for a special dinner, thus the higher price tag. 

Service was great - the server was helpful. 

The trio of salsa and chips was fresh and yummy!

I got the chicken fajitas and mmmm - good stuff!
