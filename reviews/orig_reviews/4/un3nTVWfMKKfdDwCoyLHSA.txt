The food is good and so are the cocktails. I had their Mahi-Mahi Tacos :-) and loved the cilantro rice. They have cool interior and lighting...very modern and fun/cute.

On Fri/Sat nights, they turn their space into a dance floor and play latin music. Don't expect salsa tho...more top-40 type songs. And the crowd is a lil ghetto...we didn't stay long.
