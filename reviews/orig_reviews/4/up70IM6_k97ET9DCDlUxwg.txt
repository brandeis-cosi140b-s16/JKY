Parking:  It sucks, deal with it, it isn't as bad as some places.

Decor:  Come on people it's about the food, the place is clean and the chairs are comfy.

Service:  Well, I've always gotten pretty good service, they can be slow on the bill and sometimes they disappear, but in general I order, get my drinks, get my food and that's about all.

Food:  It's AWESOME, it's HOT, it's NEW MEXICAN Chili's!!!!  I love the green chili pork, I also get a side of sour cream to cool my mouth, but I think it is perfect!  The drinks are strong, the deserts are really good, I don't need much more out of a restaurant.  

Don't have super high expectations, understand the food is SPICY, and be prepared to be wowed!
