Pretty good and super sweet older man as our server. He really went out of his way to check with the kitchen to accommodate me in my requests in changing some things on a dish that I ordered. We loved the sopapillas for dessert too ;) the only thing weird I noticed was the radio was breaking up and going fuzzy which was semi annoying.
