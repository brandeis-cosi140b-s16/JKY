I have been coming to this location for over 2 years and it's been consistent with the food....LOVE it totally...fresh and of course the handmade tortillas give you the authentic feel...It's reasonably priced especially in comparison to some others that are not as fresh. It's always busy so that makes me feel great in knowing the food is fresh..My one gripe is a lot of these employees lack GREAT customer service skills. Manager please train them better because some are very rude...I love the location however I will find somewhere else to eat if this doesn't change. Quite a few of my friends have complained as well...
