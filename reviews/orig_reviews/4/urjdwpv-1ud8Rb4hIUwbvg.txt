Came here for dinner recently, and I was happy with my experience. The staff is friendly and attentive, and you're provided with a free basket of chips and salsas (3 types, all spicy) when you're seated. Between the chips and the two tacos I ordered (at $1.90 each), I was full. The chips are filling, so be prepared to take home leftovers if you order a big entree. The al pastor was a good balance of fat and meat, and the carnitas was a bit dry but still tasty. I also ordered a glass of horchata (not on the menu), and thought it was perfectly spiced and milky.
