New to Yelp, and the first review I made sure to make was on Si Senor.  If you are looking for authentic New Mexican food this is the place.  The mural on their wall of the Organ mtns says it all although most of their employees don't know nothing about the other restaurant in Las Cruces.  The dip trio and chips are so good make sure not to fill up on that alone.  When they say the hot green chili is HOT they mean it.  Hot and flavorfull.  I stick to the basics like enchiladas and tacos so I can't say much more about the rest of their menu.  Also save room for desert when you are treated to sopapillas - plain or with brown sugar!
