Saw this from Man vs Food and had to try it. I like the mountainous tortas with a long list of ingredients. We came and had about a ~30 minute wait.

I tried the torta del rey, which was a giant sandwich. So many different meats and a decent flavor. I think having so many toppings might be overkill but I like the novelty.

Decent sized place and it looks like it's always busy. I'd like to get the King Carlos torta, just to see it and split it. There were also lots of regular mexican foods on the menu that I'd like to try, but I had to get the famous tortas for my first time.
