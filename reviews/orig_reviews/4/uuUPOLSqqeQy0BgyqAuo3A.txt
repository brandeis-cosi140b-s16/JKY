On Thursday July 10th I was early for a meeting and stopped in for a late lunch during their happy hour. I was a bit bothered by not being informed  that for the happy hour menu and pricing I needed to sit at the bar area. I was seated and then asked if I wanted to move after placing my drink order. So why the four stars? The food was great outstanding favor made up for it all. The next time I will know to seat at the bar area for happy hour. If you want an excellent Mexican meal this is the place.
