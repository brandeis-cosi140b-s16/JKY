Five of us enjoyed a casual and wonderful dinner at Blue Adobe. The fresh chips and dark salsa were very good - it took a lot of willpower to stop munching the chips and salsa before our meals arrived. I ordered the chicken chorizo which was accompanied by twice-baked potatoes served in a jalapeno pepper half - unique and zesty - as well as grilled vegetable strips.  All five of us truly enjoyed our meals. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. Our server, Ashley, was excellent. I would definitely recommend Blue Adobe if you are in the Scottsdale area.
