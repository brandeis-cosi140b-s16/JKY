I went here on a first date. It was a great atmosphere for that type of situation. 
We were seated outside on the patio and it was illuminated by twinkling lights. Very pretty! Our table wasn't the best, kind of crammed up against the wall but I think they had to do some rearranging due to some rain showers that kept popping up. 
I ordered steak tacos and my date ordered an entr√©e with steak as well. Perfectly cooked and very good flavor. 
Overall it was a great dining experience. I didn't pay, but I do know it was very pricey. The portion sizes were about just right. I'd definitely recommend to others that are looking for an intimate atmosphere that's romantic and has good food.
