Man so good!  Food was excellent.  I had the shredded beef enchilada and the green chile...both outstanding.  My wife had the beef fajitas.  Unfortunately we were both full when the entrees arrived because we were chowing on the chips and yummy salsa.   

We'll be back but it won't be for the atmosphere nor the quick service.  Everyone was friendly but not in a hurry.
