Thank you, it's good to be back!  

I hadn't been to LS in a few years since I don't find myself in that part of town often so I was excited to pick up the Groupon and head back.  After a  not-so-hot Mexican food experience with a friend I wanted to show him what I like.  And now he likes!

We got there around 8:30pm on a Sat nite and it was still packed inside so we sat outside since it felt reasonable with the misters.  We each had a Cadillac margarita, eh, was on the plain side.  The chips and salsa were tasty, one roasted tomatillo and the other a chunky tomato with peppers.  Neither overly hot but nice roasted flavors and spices, tasted freshly made.

We decided to have an appetizer dinner and went with the crab & mango salad, fish tacos and corn souffle with mole.  The salad was surprisingly filling and had nice, fresh flavors, the fish tacos were really tasty - just enough spice on the fish with a slice of radish, avocado and a little shot of crema.  The corn souffle was our favorite, we thought it was a nice idea.  The mole was nicely developed and went well with the corn souffle, although I think it would've been even better with some peppers in the souffle to add a little more heat against the sweet of the corn and mole.

Yes LS is on the pricey and more gourmet side.  If you're interested in nice flavors and interesting plays with Mexican food with quality ingredients then you'd probably like it.  If you're looking to consume mass quantities of cheesy-Mex and not so much savor it then its not for you.  The menu isn't overloaded, but it all looks pretty well planned and sounds tasty to me!
