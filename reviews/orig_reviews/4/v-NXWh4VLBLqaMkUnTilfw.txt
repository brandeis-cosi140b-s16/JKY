The tortas were really good... we've been here before, this time we got a USA and Del Ray.  One torta easily feeds 2 pretty hungry adults.

We did have one issue - last time we went here I'd ordered a steak quesadilla, and it came with beans on it.  So this time when we ordered a steak quesadilla we explicitly requested no beans on it.  This was for a 'to go' order and the person who took the order over the phone assured us there were no beans on the steak quesadilla but made note of it anyway.

when we got home..there were beans on the steak quesadilla.  My daughter and I cannot stand the texture of beans, so that made the steak quesadilla inedible for anyone in my family.  I called to talk to the manager, but it was during dinner rush and he was unable to come to the phone.. so I sent a message via their email contact.  

as I said, fortunately the tortas as easily big enough to feed a few people each, so we split tortas and everyone was full...  

but why beans on a steak quesadilla?
