Very good food, very good value, very long wait at lunchtime. I had the opportunity to treat some friends who were visiting from the northeast and wanted good Mexican food. Friday lunchtime may not have been the best time to do this because of the long wait, but once we were seated, everything went very well. The waitstaff was very friendly and efficient, the food was really tasty and the servings were generous. I would say that I ate here some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Valley, and my friends were equally impressed. Lots of parking, reasonable prices -- it all adds up to a great dining experience if you don't mind the long wait for lunch.
