I attended an event here for an amusement convention and it everything was on the house. The service was great. With the entire place packed there was no long waits at the bar, even with it being an open bar event. The drinks had an excellent alcohol to mixer ratio, no watered down drinks here. The apps the passed out were good. A few different bite sized quesadillas and some fish tacos. I will be back to check out the rest of the menu.
