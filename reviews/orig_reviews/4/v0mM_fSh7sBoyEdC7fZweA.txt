I can't believe I haven't eaten here until now!  I came last Friday night with Sarah H, her husband Dan H and another friend for dinner.  We only had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.  The restaurant was completely packed so service was a little slow, but that happens everywhere on a Friday night.  I was really looking forward to the table side guac, but that was a big disappointment, fortunately our only one.  We had it with everything in it, but our waitress didn't mash up the avocado so it was more like a diced avocado salad than creamy guac, or even close to anything you could scoop up with a chip.  For dinner I had the Pescado del Mar.  A luscious piece of halibut topped with shrimp and scallops.  I could eat this every day.  For desert we tried the churros with goats milk caramel.  If no one was looking, I would have licked the plate.  I tried a bite of the flan and it wasn't so good - cold and flavorless.  I'm looking forward to a return trip and will order the same meal.
