Be flexible when you come here because there might be a really long wait if you don't have a reservation (accepted for groups 4 or more). The food is a bit pricey (spent $83 the other day for 2 adults and a child). Despite this, I really love the New Mexican cuisine and flavors, although more often than not, the food is a little too spicy for me. 

My favorites are their bacon wrapped shrimp and roasted garlic plate. Fair warning that the menu is very similar to Richardsons. The other day, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp (5 for $16) and thought it was the dinner. The server told me I was confusing it with Richardson's and that at Rokerij, it was an app. 

Parking is valet, of course, which is a little annoying but standard in central Phoenix.
