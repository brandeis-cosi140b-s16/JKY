What can you say about a place that has already seen the stamp of approval from Guy Fieri? Well, the positives are quite clear, good food at low prices and an endless salsa bar that pushes boundaries with creations like strawberry salsa. But with this success the whole-in-the-wall charm has been lost. My visit became a transactional act due to poor customer service by the sole waitress attending to all the tables in the restaurant.
