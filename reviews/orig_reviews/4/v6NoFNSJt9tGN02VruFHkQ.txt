One visit and it will instantly merit inclusion into your lunch lineup.  The place looks the part- down to the vintage Shakira playing in the background- and its dishes deliver the goods. No longer will we have to rely on the Filoberto's/Aliberto's/Raliberto's/Rigoberto's of the valley to get our cheap Mexican fix on.  

Many people have mentioned the elote (corn) and I would like to second their approval. The ceviche is also great and the vampiro brings a little class to the standard street taco.  

People may complain about the diminutive menu but I say there is no need to when you do those few things well.  Do you same people whine about the lack of options at the In-N-Out?  Simple is good when the few items are excellent.
