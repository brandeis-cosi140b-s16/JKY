I tried the summer tasting menu at Diego...... excellent

The tasting starts with a "Diego margarita" using El Jimador tequila.
.... and the basket of totilla chips with three bowls of distinct salsas.

The table next to me ordered the guacamole prepared tableside with their chips and salsa.
It is always a treat to watch the servers prepare the dish fresh.
The real treat is eating it.

The appetizer for the tasting was a bowl of tortilla strip soup. Very well prepared .... it contained cheese, avacado and chicken.
Very, very tasty.

The main course I selected was the chicken breast with red mole.
It arrived with a small amount of rice and sauteed spinach leaves. 

Once again Diego lived up to my expectations .....
try it - 
it will live up to yours as well.
