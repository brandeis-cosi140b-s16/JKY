You show up and you are treated like family.  You have an incredibly fresh lunch reminiscent of what you'll get on the right street corner in Hermosillo.  Before you leave you get a big hug and kiss.  The do√±a takes very good care of you.

Quick tip: If you want carne asada come after 12.  It takes a while to cook so make your lunch a little later.
