We had been on the lookout for a place that served fajitas brought to your table still sizzling and thought we better give this place a try.  We are very pleased we did and found our new go to place for fajitas.  We ordered beef fajitas for two.  Chips, salsa were include, along with grilled peppers and onions.  The peppers and onions were a great treat and a nice touch that I had not had in other Mexican restaurants.  Fajitas were served tableside and flaming.  Nice Touch!  We were next in fajita heaven, could not have asked for better beef fajitas, nicely cooked, great flavor, tender beef.  Everything was very good; the soup that came with the meal, beans, rice, guacamole, and salsa.  The portion is big and had extra for take home for another meal.   The service was outstanding.  If you love sizzling fajitas, you need to pay this place a visit, as this was my first of many visits to come!   Thanks Yelpers for helping me find a new place that is great!
