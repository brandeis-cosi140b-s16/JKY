Excellent place for dinner.  I suggest you make reservations ahead of time if you want a good spot.  Valet only (no ticket fee).   It shares entrance space with Richardson's (Rokerij is on the right).  We were immediately greeted at the entrance and led downstairs into the bar area to an exclusive booth that was extremely intimate.  Truly about as private as it gets - highly recommend for dating (its at the end of the bar set back the from the main wall so if you situate yourselves in a certain way - NO ONE can see you except the bartender).  

Service was excellent and personable.  I ordered from the "special" menu - a trinity of flavors: the medallions were cooked perfectly and wonderfully flavorful, I enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp, the Mexican sausage was ok (more like breakfast sausage on beans).  My guest really enjoyed her meal.  I highly recommend the spot we had downstairs.  I met some of the staff behind the bar upstairs before we left - great guys.  All around great experience.

If you are seated in the downstairs area be sure to exit using the stone stairs - its really cool.
