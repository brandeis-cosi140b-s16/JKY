When I average out all the aspects of Gallo Blanco, I reach a four star rating.  The food and happy hour are the two reasons we keep coming back.  The service is not a reason to return, but we put up with it to eat those yummy little tacos.  This place is just off the lobby of the Clarendon Hotel, which is hipster central.   No one wears a nametag or any identifiable mark of actually working there so it's hard to flag someone down if you need something.  A few servers act like you are inconveniencing them for being there.  We put up with all that because the happy hour prices are great and the pork tacos and carne asada burrito are to die for!  We also love the green and red salsa (you can find the same stuff at Crescent Ballroom).  The white sangria and margaritas are just right on a warm day.
