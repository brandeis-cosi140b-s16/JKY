The food was so good it was gone before I had a chance to take pictures...oops!

I really like Otro,  their food is fresh, flavorful, and made with quality ingredients.

I went in search of a good taco al pastor, and while theirs missed the mark of a truly authentic one, the taste and flavor of the taco here was very good.  (BTW I'm still in search of a taco al pastor that tastes as good as the ones I came to love in central Mexico so if anyone knows of a good taco shop send me a message)

Now on to what is really good...the Inca salad, I could eat buckets of it.  The sofrito rice is another of my favorites, perfectly cooked and perfectly spiced.  Elote Callejero - roasted corn with cheese and paprika...in a word YUM!!!

I can't wait to return and try more.
