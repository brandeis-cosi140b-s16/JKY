This a great place to stop for a margarita or a shot of tequila!  The selection on tequila alone is awesome.  Great patio setting, so definitely come here and enjoy the surrounding when the weather is beautiful.  I work near by so our work team will frequent her for happy hour.  They have a decent HH special and if you are a YELPER...make sure you check in!  They give great Yelp specials when show them your yelp check in.  The staff has always been friendly and very accommodating especially for our large work group.
