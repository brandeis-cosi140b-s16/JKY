I had a cod taco and a chicken taco. Both were very good! The service was excellent, and the patio is nice. The only complaint was that I have had better margaritas, larger, stronger etc for less $ at Blanco or elsewhere. But overall this is a great place. 

It's a very casual, laid back crowd, not the Scottsdale scene you might find other places in the area.
