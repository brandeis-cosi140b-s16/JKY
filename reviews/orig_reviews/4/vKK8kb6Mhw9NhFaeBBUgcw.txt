One of my favorite Mexican food places!

The service varies, but the food is always delicious.  Very flavorful and prepared well.  My current favorite: the shrimp tacos.  The tortillas are made on site; I could just eat them plain, they are that good.  

They offer a military discount for cardholders and there is a children's menu.
