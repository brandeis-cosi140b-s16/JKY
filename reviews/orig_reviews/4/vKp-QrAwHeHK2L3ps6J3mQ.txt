I love their chips and salsa enough it gets two stars all by itself. I have never seen this place busy, yet they have been open for a long time. I have tried there fajitas, enchiladas, tacos, and burritos.. All tasty. I'm not a fan of cacamoule so I ask for all of that stuff without. The prices are reasonable.
