I decided to stop in on a Friday for lunch since I get off at noon each Friday and wasn't on a schedule. I got there a little after noon and while it was busy there was no line. SCORE! I had a bean and cheese burrito, carne asada taco and a dozen tortillas to take home (I mean how can you not grab a dozen tortilla when you come to Carolina's)! For them being pretty busy I didn't wait long. This was the first time I've gotten a taco and it was very tasty. The burrito was awesome like always. I know I will be back very soon as it's one of my favorite little spots.
