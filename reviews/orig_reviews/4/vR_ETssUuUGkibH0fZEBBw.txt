This is one of my favorite places for tacos as I have many options as a pescatarian. I have tried the wild white fish, shrimp, and vegeatarian tacos but I noticed they now have a smoked Merlin taco I can't wait to try! The best thing about this spot are the salsas; they are fresh, unique, and so addictive! I love the nopalitos salsa, with red onions, champignon, jalapenos, and cilantro that I can almost eat by itself with a fork. The only thing I don't recommended is the bean and cheese burrito as it is impossible to eat without it ooozing all over the place.
