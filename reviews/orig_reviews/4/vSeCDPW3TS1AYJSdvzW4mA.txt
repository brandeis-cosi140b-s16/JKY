Always a great place, we visit Los Dos 1-2x everytime we are in Phoenix yearly. This time we gave the Mesa location a go, opposed to the original. Food and service were great as usual, however the food didnt seem as spicy as at the original Los Dos and the ambiance is not the same...has more of the standard restuarant look and feel. Not a knock at all...still amazing food regardless!!!
