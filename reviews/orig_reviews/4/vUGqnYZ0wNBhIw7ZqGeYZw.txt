I love Mexican Food, it is probably my third favorite food group ;) 

I was craving some Margaritas and Fajitas. Luckily we live in Vegas and there are restaurants that are open very late- so I found this little spot in the Southwest area. 

We sat in the bar area, where they offered gambling as well. 

I ordered a Medium size Mango Margarita- Delicious and was definitely very big! 

My boyfriend and I shared the Fajitas for two, and we ordered half chicken and half steak. The fajitas came on a sizilling hot plate, with guacamole, pico, sour cream, rice, beans, roasted onions tomato's mushrooms and peppers topped with cilantro ..... YUM

They also give you free table side chips with salsa and bean dip. 
I am not a huge fan of bean dip, but their bean dip was amazing. 

The service was okay nothing over the top, and our server Kim was very nice, even when our order was messed up. 

I had a great time and we had enough for leftovers. Definitely a great place for a midnight snack :)
