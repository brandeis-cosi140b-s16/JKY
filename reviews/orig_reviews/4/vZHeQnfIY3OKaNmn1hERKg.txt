Living on the west side (especially the NW side) of phoenix, you will soon discover the splendors of a suburban, mostly caucasian demographic.  In other words, lots of chain stores and restaurants with most of the food tasting about the same.  That being said Abuelo's is a step above the rest around here.  If you're looking for authentic, high quality mexican food this isn't the place.  You'd be better served going to somewhere in Scottsdale, Phoenix or Tempe.  If you're trying to decide between Macayo's, Abuelo's, salsa blanca, top shelf, and carramba...then this is the place to go.  It can get a bit busy, so come here on the earlier side or expect to wait.  They got a great happy hour menu, and the food is pretty decent tex-mex.  Their salsas are pretty good.  Nothing you eat here will knock your socks off, but you won't be running home with diarrhea either.  If this place were located closer to better mexican options then I'd probably give them 3 stars, but since its the best in the area I'll grant them another one.  

TL;DR: Eat here if you're on the NW side and want tex-mex.
