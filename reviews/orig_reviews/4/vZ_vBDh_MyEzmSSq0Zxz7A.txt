Ordered the taco combo plate and a beer. It looks the like prices went up since the original posting of the menu on here. Still reasonable for the area. The tacos were great and the beer was nice and cold. I sat upstairs and was startled by the pyrotechnic mantis.. Wished the restaurant would play the music it was synced to, as salsa / jazz just didn't match up right to the flame spitting statue across the way.
The lengua (tongue) tacos were superb. This place is a wonderful addition to downtown.
