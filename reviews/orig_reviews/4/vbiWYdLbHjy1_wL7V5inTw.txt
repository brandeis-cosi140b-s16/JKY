We went here for lunch on a Sunday. A lot slower than it was for a Friday night dinner, which was nice. It also meant we had fantastic service, and we got our food right away and didn't eat our weight in chips and amazing salsa.
My wife got the tacos as she did the last time, and was very pleased. I had the veggie taquitos, which were incredible. They were filled with potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash and zucchini. They were fried, but didn't have the grease dripping out of them like you can find elsewhere. They came with sour cream and a very good guacamole, which were nice additions to the meal. 
I definitely preferred the food this time around, probably because we didn't wait long and it was super fresh.
