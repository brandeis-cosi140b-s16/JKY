We visited on a bustling Friday night and have our name to the hostess for a table. We were seated in about the quoted time and were greeted promptly with chips & the house corn salsa with a preliminary drink order taken. We wound up ordering the shrimp & chicken burrito (without shrimp haha) and a taco plate with the white fish and carne asada. Both were fabulous and filling. Many creative menu items and plenty of options for a non-fish lover like myself! Ingredients were fresh, presentation was good and service was good as well. Waited a bit for the bill, but hey it was a Friday night and we ate rather quickly. Fun & quirky ambiance. Reggae tunes on and servers wearing plaid ;) funky, mon!
