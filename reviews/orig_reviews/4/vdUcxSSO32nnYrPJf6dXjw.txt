I came here for a quick lunch with a colleague and I was pleasantly surprised. The patio was full, but we were seated quickly. Since it was the middle of the day I couldn't indulge in any alcoholic beverages but the food was great. We enjoyed:

-Queso Fundido
-Ceviche
-Guacamole
-Tacos

I really enjoyed the queso fundido. Service was attentive and the people watching on the patio was fun. I plan to return :)
