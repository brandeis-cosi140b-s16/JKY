We were in the area...starving. So of course I yelp to see what's around and low and behold Chinos! It had been forever since being here. The order taker was awesome with helping us choose our meal. Very patient and accommodating. I had the jerk chicken over fried rice. Spicy and yummy. Hit the spot. Thank chino! It would be nice if they put a little money into fixing up the place. But then again I do appreciate good hole in the wall eateries. :-)
