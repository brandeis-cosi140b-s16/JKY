The servers here are possibly too attentive, or maybe it was just the one we had. Noticed all of the hosts and servers were Mexican, nice touch.  Almost felt like I was at a mega resort in Cancun, only in Mexico they'd be dressed more conservatively and would be less chatty.  

The food was good and like everything else in  LV presentation is a must even at your run of the mill dinner or pho place.  Isla is no exception.  Even the chips and salsa are a gargantuan, overly salty ( in a good way) three tiered appetizer in and of itself. Margaritas are margaritas and somehow when I am at a place like this I forget the fact that I dont even like them, maybe it's the festive glass, I dont know. 

This review may be seen as negative. However, this place is good for fancyish Mexican.
