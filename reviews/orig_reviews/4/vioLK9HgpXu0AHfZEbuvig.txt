First time here... I love places like this, we ordered Taquitos as an appetizer, then husband had the grilled fish bowl, I had the pork bowl..   Quick, friendly service, Taquitos unremarkable, can get those anywhere... Husband liked the grilled fish, cooked well, beans and rice seasoned well, large portions, I took half of mine home for dinner that night.  Very good, coming back to try fish tacos.  thumbs up
