The best Mexican food in town! My husband and I have been going here for 6 years now and we are regulars. They are best known for their tamales, and rightfully so. My favorite is their chicken tamale with green sauce - so delicious! For me, the best item on their menu is the albondigas soup (meatball soup). I am a Mexican restaurant frequenter and I always order the albondigas soup. Dona Maria's is BY FAR the best in town. It's a must order. They also make their own flour tortillas (a must for authentic Mexican food) and they are great. The chips are good and the salsa is a bit "tomatoey" than what I prefer but it's still very good.

The only downside (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is the service can be pretty slow on a regular basis. Be ready for a minimum 45-minute meal anytime you come here to eat. But don't let that deter you, the wait is worth it!
