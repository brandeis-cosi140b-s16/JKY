The chicken tortilla soup was excellent...big pieces of rotisserie chicken and a light, flavorful broth. The shrimp Caesar salad was good but boring. Fresh and crisp romaine with perfectly cooked shrimp, but there was no seasoning on the shrimp and nothing in the salad but cojita cheese and tortilla strips and too much dressing. I would have loved some big slices of avocado...after all it is a SoCal restaurant! I'll try tacos next time unless they make their salads a little more flavorful. Also strange that you pay a waitress to bring you a drink from a fountain that is right in front of you. I like being served at a restaurant, but if you choose to dine in it would be nice to at least have real glassware and silverware instead of plastic.
