Sometimes in life all we need is a 2nd chance to make it right! 

Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights. 

If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating. 

Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet. 

Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs. 

The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!! 

The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection. 

Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable. 

While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ! 

Cheers...
