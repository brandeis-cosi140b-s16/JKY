The TeePee is good, greasy, satisfying mexican food.  The place is small, the booths are uncomfortable, and the wait can be long, but it is worth it.  my favorite is the lunch special, chicken burro with green or red sauce, rice and beans.  they also recently started serving vegetarian beans for all of you veggies out there.
