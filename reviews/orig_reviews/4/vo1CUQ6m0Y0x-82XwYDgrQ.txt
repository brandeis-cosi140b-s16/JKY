Of all the get in line and pick your bowl places in town, this one is my fave! I don't usually even go for pork (don't care for it at that other chain) but Braddah's pork is soooo succulent and delish!
Their chicken is great and even the fish was incredibly well done and tasty. The salsa's are great and the staff was very helpful too! 
Keep it up :)
