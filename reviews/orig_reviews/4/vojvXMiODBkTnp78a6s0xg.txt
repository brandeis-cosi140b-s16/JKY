A friend and I had dinner at The Mission, and were really impressed.  The food was excellent; the freshly made guacamole is a unique twist and the fries are perfectly made.  And we were really glad to see what seemed to us to be actually two pricepoints on the menu.  We opted for the less expensive tacos (fish and steak), and were SO glad that we did because, having already inhaled the guacamole, anything more than the tacos was much too much to eat.  I'd like to try a few more items on the menu before I upgrade this to 5 stars, so that means I'll definitely be back!
