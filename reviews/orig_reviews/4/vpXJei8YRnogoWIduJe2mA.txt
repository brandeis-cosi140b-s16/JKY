I moved to the valley a few years back and I looked up seafood online.  Well it took me about 2 years to get here, but it was well worth the trip.  I now make excuses to get near this place.  I have been more than a half dozen times with different people and we always leave satisfied.  I probably shouldn't give them 5 stars as I don't want the parking lot to be completely full when I get there.
