Beautiful beautiful place. Great for a romantic evening out in my opinion.  Quietly classy, yet not ridiculously presumptuous.

Have not eaten any of their food... this is just based on drinks, service, and ambiance.

Cool note: Birthday sparkles for the birthday person.

Free mai tai shots for the whole group because of the birthday.

it is very dark inside... like how a monastery would look but with crystal accents. (duh)

I'll go back eventually and get a meal.
