I've been coming here for several months thanks to the suggestion of you fellow yelpers! All I get is the breakfast burrito w no meat (potato, egg &cheese), so I can't speak to their other menu items.  The breakfast burrito is delicious. Rarely can I go a week without having one. It has the right amount of salt and spices and the tortilla is fresh and slightly flaky.  Prompt, friendly service.
