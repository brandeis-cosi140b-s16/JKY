came here after a night of going out with the girls. and boy was it the perfect fix to a night out. we got seated promptly upstairs overlooking the pool. the weather was perfect! so if you're out in vegas during the summer i recommend coming here. i had the chiles rellenos and it was delicious. the peach lemonade was also very tasty, i tasted my gfs' bloody mary and it was spicy and yummy. everyone else was happy with their shrimp tacos and the salsas and chips were good. but maybe the hangover was feeding us much more then we could taste. overall great experience and loved the service and food. will be back.
