After being quickly seated and served our $1.25 margaritas, I ordered the Navajo Tostada Grande, made of freshly made frybread, beans, green chile, beef, cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  It was a lot of food for the $8.95. It tasted good, the beef was tender. I would give it just 3 stars, but the service was so good, I gave them an extra star.  The staff makes you feel at home. We sat at our table and talked to friends for an extra hour after our plates were cleared and they kept our water glasses full the whole time.
