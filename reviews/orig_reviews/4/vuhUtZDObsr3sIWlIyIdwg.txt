I am going to start with a WOW!!! I was completely blown away with this Restaurant. I am not easy to please. That being said, let's get to the food. My family tried several dishes; the Shishito Peppers, Chile Crab Garlic Noodles, Crispy Calamari, Shishito Roll, Maya Roll, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  Everything was prepared and/or cooked perfectly. The two things that stood out was the Calamari and the Sea Bass. The game changer for the Calamari was the sauce and the salad it sat on top of. I could have that everyday. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. I've eaten fish at a lot of Restaurants and this is the best I have ever tasted. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. There was only two small skewers with two cubes of fish on each. They also use REAL crab in all their dishes, even the sushi rolls. Besides the food, the decor itself is very fun and bright and suites its theme. My family was there with my 4 month old around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Already at that time the places was hoppin'. I recommend making reservations.  The wait staff was very accommodating and super friendly. We and sat on the patio and we were glad because the inside was very loud and a little cramp. The patio is very nice and misters are very good. If you do bring a baby, they do have highchairs, but no place to change a diaper in the restroom.Other then that minuscule detail, I can't wait to try more items on the menu.
