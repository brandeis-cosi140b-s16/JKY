Went for lunch after reading the reviews on here.  I wasn't as amazed as most people I guess but the food was pretty good.  I started out with a Montana Margarita which was a margarita with huckleberries in it and huckleberry flavoring.  It was very good and very strong which I was happy about.  The chips and salsa came and the hot salsa was pretty good.  I ordered the crab and shrimp enchiladas and people weren't kidding about the portion size.  I barely got 2/3's of it down before I felt my stomach stretching in pain.  I was very happy that the rice and beans were actually edible not just there for taking up space.  Most places I have been to lately the rice and beans were just not edible.  The location was very nice and clean inside and had a tv with football on in the bar area.  The outdoor seating area looked very nice and the menu was full of stuff I wanted to come back for.  Especially the banana nut flan.
