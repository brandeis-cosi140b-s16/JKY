The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:

1)  The Sangrita
2)  The Churro dessert

In fact, if this place was called "Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.

Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.

I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch.
