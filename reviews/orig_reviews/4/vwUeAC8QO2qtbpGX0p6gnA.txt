Well.. I stumbled up Fuzzy's after raging at the Global Dance fest all night while under the influence of of alcohol a few weeks ago. Tacos always sound good after a night of drinking.  Fuzzy's did not disappoint. I had literally 7 tacos 3 chicken 2 beef 1 breakfast taco and a pancake taco. 

Let me tell you.. yes! that pancake taco was AMAZING. Go there for that alone..

Next time I'm down here and I want to get my taco fix this will be my first stop. 


Definitely worth checking out but be warned it can and does get busy so there may be a little wait for your food especially if it's after 8pm on a weekend.
