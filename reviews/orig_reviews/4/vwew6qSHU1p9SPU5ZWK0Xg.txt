Had the duck taquitos - appetizer, chicken tortilla soup and banana flamb√© dessert. I wish they would make the taquitos an entree, that is how delicious they were! The soup was OK. I thought it was a bit bland. The 4 stars are for the taquitos, the dessert and the service. 
If you are budget conscious (really, like really). I don't know if this is a place for you. Maybe lunch is different but I couldn't afford to bring my kids here for dinner without working a few more hours a week!
