This is hands down the best taco place I've been to in Las Vegas.  Got recommended to come here for lunch with some coworkers and little did I know, I fell in love with the.......COW HEAD TACOOOOO (CABEEEZAAA).  I originally tried the carne asada taco with everything on it at first, actually thought it was amazing.  Then the cowhead taco came along and I've never had carne asada ever since.  The meat is just so soft and tasty.  It has a really strong beef flavor to it which i love but many people think otherwise. 

So I recommend getting 1 carne asada taco, and if you're feeling adventurous try the cabeza.  But do not get anymore than 2 tacos or you'll be stuffed in pain.

The Jr. burrito isnt bad but sometimes the tortilla isn't soft and hardens.  The quesadilla is quite large so be aware.
