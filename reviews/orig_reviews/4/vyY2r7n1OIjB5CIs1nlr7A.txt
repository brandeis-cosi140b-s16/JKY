Really fun restaurant with great flavors.

We started with the kale salad (yummy), followed by the flat iron steak and sides of torreados (blistered peppers) which were to die for, and chipotle grits.  

Service was wonderful -- when we couldn't decide between two desserts (the fried bananas with peanut butter and the pumpkin bread pudding), our server brought us both!

Cocktails are also great -- especially those with tequila.  :)  The cucumber jalepeno margarita was excellent.

Ambience is a little dark/clubby for the desert but comfortable.

Definitely worth it for a night out!
