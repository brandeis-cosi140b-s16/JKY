Love this place.  The atmosphere is eclectic and funky and I love their outdoor patio.  The food is spot on every time we come here and the wait staff is always on their game and friendly.  We would probably visit more as we live in NoDa, but since it's such a long wait to get in most days, we try to visit during off hours - like 3pm on a Sunday.  I would highly recommend if you want some good Mexican food in a cool area of town.
