On our way to PHX, we stopped off here for a quick lunch. What a surprise! In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing. The menu seemed very typical of Arizona mexican cuisine. The #10 Enchilada plate was delicious and the #5 Mechaca plate was incredible. For two people, we were easily out the door for under $15 with plenty of food. Definitely not a frilly atmosphere but the food is great, tortillas are made fresh out back and I can't wait to go back for more.
