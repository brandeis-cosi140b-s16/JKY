Came here for Togo and they were really nice and friendly! It was a little hard to find because it was so small. 

Chimichanga- it was good but I've had better.. The lengua was very tender though. It just wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.
Asada plate- the Mexican rice was very good! Wish they gave more! The asada tasted a little burnt to me.
Carne asada tacos- little cousin enjoyed this but she said it tasted a bit burnt for her too. 
Horchata- I don't usually drink this so I'm not sure how it's suppose to taste like. However, it was very good and light in cinnamon. Good for me bc I don't really like anything with too much cinnamon besides churros. They gave a little ice which is a plus!
