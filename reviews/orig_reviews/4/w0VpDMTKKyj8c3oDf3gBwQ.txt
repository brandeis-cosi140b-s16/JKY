I have only been twice and ordered the same thing each time. Each time the food was awesome! Great prices for a quick lunch. The system was down the second time I came in during lunch time and the bar tender at the time handled the messy situation with so much grace and kept a smile on his face the entire time! I forgot his name but he has short brown hair, skinny and kind of tall... 

Anyway.. Looking forward to coming back and trying more menu items and I'm sure he drinks here are awesome as well.. 

Side note: the two times I have been in the bar rags smelled of mildew after the wiping of the counter tops. Something to be mindful of in the future (if staff of management happens to be reading this)

I'll for sure be back for a third time!!
