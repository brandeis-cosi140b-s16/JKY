We have been there two times now and will definitely go back as it is very convenient for us. The place is nice  I cannot say I have checked it out all the way as we always gave good company and thus we are chatting away, talking about what we will eat and drink. Not noticing our surroundings very well. The menu looks good and the drinks too. 
I got the huge hot smoking margarita. Very good and very generous. 
Twice I had the fish tacos: very tasty, lots of fish, good dressing and cole slaw. Three tacos: more than enough. We never had dessert as the main course is enough. Other people had the pasta dish which was very tasty and served hot. Fried calamari was very tasty too. 
Will definitely go back. And maybe try something else. In any case the fish tacos were very consistent.
