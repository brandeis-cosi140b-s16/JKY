Glad to see Gecko Grille is back in business.    I was really disappointed when they closed their Gilbert/Guadalupe location.     When there for lunch today, same great service, food and a modern new location.      Had their burrito with cheese sauce.    Just as good as their old location.       Highly recommend you stop by and enjoy the food.     Very reasonable prices and good food.     Like the new digs.
