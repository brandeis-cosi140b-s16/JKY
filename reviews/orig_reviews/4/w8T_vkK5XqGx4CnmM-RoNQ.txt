Stopped in the Cosmopolitan and were looking for a different style restaurant to try and we came across China Poblano. We had looked into Jose Andres' other restaurant but it exceeded our budget a bit and we saw this place we thought it would be a fun place to try. Hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. We did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over. 

Service: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but I felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall I think the service was nice. 

Cocktails: I had the Lemon Drop which is a "noodle" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. I didn't love it and for $12 a pop I wanted to love it. After a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and I like sweet. 

Food: we ordered some appetizers. Got the lamb potstickers Stuck on You. I liked them but I wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. Needed more seasoning of some sort. For my entree I got the Ocean Nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. Heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. I really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat. By that I mean you can't look cute eating what looks like a birds nest of tightly wound noodles, especially with chopsticks. 

I like the setting of the restaurant. It's a nice space. I would come back again but maybe try the Mexican half of the menu.
