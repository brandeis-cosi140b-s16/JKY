Very crowded, but good service. Love the chimichanga here. One difference at this location is the nice bean dip they give with the chips. Very good. I wish the rest of their locations would have it. 

The rice and beans are fairly mundane. I'd give the pinto beans the nod, over the retried and black beans. Nice and spicy, too.
