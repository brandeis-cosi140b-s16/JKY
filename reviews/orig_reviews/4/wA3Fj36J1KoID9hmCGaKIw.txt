Nice place and appreciated the modern lighting and atmosphere. I would have to agree with other yelpers, the blood orange margarita was great!  I also enjoyed my shrimp salad it was good size, tasty, filled with avo and jimca, a perfect combo.  My husband tried the Caesar salad with added steak and he said it was excellent!  The steak pieces looked rather small to me but he liked it.
