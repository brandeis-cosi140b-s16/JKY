My husband and I ate here for lunch this afternoon after reading the "Eating 16th Street" blog in the New Times :http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2012/08/la_condessa.php#more

We went for a late Friday afternoon lunch and though the place is on the small side had no problem finding a seat. The decor is great, and the food truly was delicious. I tried three different "street tacos" and they were all wonderful - particularly the Al Carbon. My husband had the Azteca Tinga Burro and he also said it was very tasty. We also indulged in some "we earned it" margaritas and they came complete with grapefruit, lime, orange and lemon slices. I've never had it that way before and it was delicious. We will definitely be going back for more soon!
