Based on the previous reviews I guess the hubby and I just got lucky :) I really enjoyed this place! Thought the decor was super funky and fun.  My meal was delicious, as was the hubbys.  Maybe our bodies were just starved for something that wasnt deep fried eaten at 5 a.m., who knows.  I ordered the carne asada tacos and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Everything tasted so fresh and yummy. Chips were very good, prices were good...I would definitely go here again.
