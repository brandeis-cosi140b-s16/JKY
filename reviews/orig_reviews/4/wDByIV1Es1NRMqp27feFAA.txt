My wife and were meeting friends from San Diego at a hotel in Scottsdale for dinner and had not deceided where to eat before hand. We were just driving and looking for a nice place to eat and stumbled upon the Spotted Donkey. We had not heard of this resturant and were not even sure what type of food they served.
Once inside we were very pleased with the atmosphere. We were greeted and promply seated by very curtious staff members. Being that we are all from San Diego we were a bit skeptical when we realized the fare was Mexican food. I have lived in the far southeast valley, Queen Creek, for approx. seven years now and have really found it difficult to find Mexican food that compares to some of my favorite places in San Diego.
Let me say first that our waiter, Rick, provided top notch service and made our dinner experiance very pleasant. The food was amazing. We all ordered differant items and eveyone could not stop saying "Wow, this is Really Good!!" We had calamari for an appitizer and it was bar none the best I have ever had. The prices were in my opinion very reasonable and portions were more than ample. Although this resturant is an hour + drive from home I will make it a point to return as often as possible. I am not in the habbit of writting reviews, however I was so impressed with this resturant I just had to write this. Check out the Spotted Donkey, you won't be sorry you did.
