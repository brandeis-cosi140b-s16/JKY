The restaurant is beautiful and it has a nice patio.  The happy hour runs 11-7 daily and includes $2 drafts.  I have had the carne asada burro was very good and the green chili beef burrito which is now my favorite.  The chili is tender and juicy and the tortilla was nice and soft.  I had a lunch with two beers for under $12 in a beautiful location.  If the waiter would stop calling me "bud" I would give the place 5 stars.
