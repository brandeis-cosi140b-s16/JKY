As a South Side resident, Emiliano's has become my first-choice Mexican restaurant...BUT only if I'm craving Mexican food and I'm too lazy to drive to Rey Azteca in Monroeville.

As expected, the chips and salsa are good, and the cheese dip is on-par with most "authentic" Mexican eateries popping up these days, so it's easy to get settled into your meal. 

The entr√©es aren't going to blow you away, but if you're on a Mexican food kick, the food will definitely satiate your craving. I've tried a few of their burritos, the enchiladas rancheras, and the fajitas - all of which are pretty good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but still very good.

Service has always been hit-or-miss for us. We've ordered drinks and never had them arrive, and we've also waited for what seemed like an eternity for our check other times. Of course, we've also had really good service a few times, so if you're in a hurry, I would recommend telling your server when you sit down and hope for the best. As with most Mexican restaurants, your food will come out quickly, but you might find yourself waiting for refills and your check.

Regardless, I really enjoy Emiliano's. The food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed, and employees are very friendly. Plus, I've never had to wait for a table.
