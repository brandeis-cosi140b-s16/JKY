I heard about this place while watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. My expectations  were high and I'm glad to say I was not disappointed. We've been in Phoenix for almost 5 months and have been on a mission to find a good taco joint. Not a taco restaurant, but a taco joint and we found it at Los Taquitos. 

I ordered the street taco meal: 2 carne asada and 1 chicken. The carne asada was seasoned well, the chicken needed a little more flavor and was a wee bit dry. The rice & beans were good and were not an afterthought. My husband also got the street taco meal, but instead of chicken he got the fish taco. He liked the fish, but said he would get 3 carne asada next time. 

The street tacos were a little in the small side, I don't know if there is another type besides street tacos that are a little bigger. We dined in and it would have been nice to have a complimentary basket of chips & salsa while we waited for our meal.

We live about 15 minutes away, but will make the trip again very soon. I'm looking forward to trying the Bombaro.
