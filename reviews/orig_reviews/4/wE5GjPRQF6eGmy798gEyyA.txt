Ate here with my wife and sister.

I'm a big fan of Mexican restaurants, and this place did not disappoint. The chips were served with bean dip and salsa, both of which were good. They stayed on top of refills as well.

Ordered the house margarita on the rocks, which was also delicious. Very strong as well, be careful!

I had the chicken Chimichanga which was delicious and a generous portion... it was so large but also delicious that I was still full when dinner rolled around the next evening...

I also enjoyed the nice lake view. Was not able to sit next to it but added to the atmosphere. Overall would recommend and return.
