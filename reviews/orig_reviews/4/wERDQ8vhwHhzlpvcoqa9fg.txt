I love this place!  Located in a strip mall (like most places in Vegas!) but inside it's like a cozy, dim, romantic cave.  Great place to bring a date.  They are moving soon apparently, so hopefully the new location will be at least as good as the current one.  Great choice for vegetarians since there is a whole veggie section in the VERY extensive menu, with more options than the usual cheese enchiladas.  Spicy and good salsa.  Portions are huge so come hungry!  Before you even get your meal you get chips with salsa and bean dip, jalapenos and onions, and soup!  Great live music...you may get serenaded at your table.  The bar has a good selection of Mexican beers and tequilas too, as well as many flavored margaritas.
