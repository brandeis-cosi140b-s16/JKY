A very nice treat after special events.   The graduate enjoyed prime rib and Mexican chocolate cake. He said it was "two thumbs up.".  

A couple of the ladies ordered tilapia with a chili sauce on one side and a honey sauce on the other. It was superb!

My pork tenderloin was a bit overcooked but it was still very good.

Overall - well worth a visit.  And the owner and staff was very friendly!
