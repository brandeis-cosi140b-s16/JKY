It's a good little place with a nice authentic vibe. Certainly plenty of salsa options - ranging from acceptable to pretty good, but you can't argue with the variety.

I thought the roasted pork shoulder taco was flavorful and delicious. Found the black mole chicken taco to be a bit too bitter, but the meat was tender and good. Enough salsa verde on top got the job done.

$2 negra modelo on Sunday was a bonus.

Certainly worth eating. Especially for $10.
