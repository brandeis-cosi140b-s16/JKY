First off let me just talk about the elephant in the room here. Service. We have heard stories about the service at the Barrio Queen but let me tell you, our server was very knowledgeable, helpful and attentive... even standing in as a camera director for us! He also makes a mean guacamole!

This definitely is a must. must. try. item. The guacamole is hand-made at your table and by far the most surprising and delicious guac we have had. What makes it so special, the dried cranberries. Yep, you heard us. They are a sweet touch and made this guac a real stand-out. Our only regret was the chips, they are home-made as well, but a bit thick for our taste.

Next up, the tacos. If you love some street tacos, this is definitely the Happy Hour for you. With over 30 tacos listed on a check off sheet (similar to ordering sushi) there is certainly something for everyone here. The tacos are organized by category; chicken & seafood, pork, beef, vegetarian. For Happy Hour Barrio Queen selects two of the tacos and offers them at $3/2 tacos, which changes daily, the remainder of the tacos vary in price from $2.50 - $4.50. Happy Hour runs daily from 2 - 7 pm every day but Monday (they are closed on Monday for the summer months).
