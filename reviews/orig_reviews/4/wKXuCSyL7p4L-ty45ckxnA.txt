Wow

Gecko grill has a unique and sweet taste on to their meals. Mango Sweet Shrimp Quesadilla is what I had...... MANGO.....Who thought of that? Put mango in a Quesadilla or anything else!! Very Very tasty.

My experience here was great, our waitress Alexis did a wonderful job. Made sure our cups were always full and brought us chips and salsa  prior to our main course arriving to our table. Very clean place and environment. All the workers are all friendly and acknowledges you once you walk in.

I highly recommend one of their chimichangas or burritos. Definitely will be seeing me here.
