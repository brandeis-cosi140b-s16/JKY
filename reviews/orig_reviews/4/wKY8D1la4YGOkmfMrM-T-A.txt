Parking was a breeze and so was being seated. I took a seat at the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks - hold the salt, please. Chips and some kind of thick chipotle salsa came out. Good stuff. I ordered the green chili corn chowder and tacos.  The salsa for the chips has a little kick to it.  Nothing outrageous it's packed with flavor though.  The green chile corn chowder was slamming!  So was the green chile sauce. It had pieces of green chiles in it and was served warm for my tacos (one beef one chicken).

Definitely coming back here the next time I am in the area.
