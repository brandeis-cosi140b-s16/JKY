Food was awesome. Service left a little to be desired. Waitress got my drink wrong as was extremely slow. Took forever to get guacamole, but it was worth the wait. Forgot to bring us waters after she offered to. Baja fish tacos and chicken nachos. Tacos better. Tasted tomatos salsa awesome. We ate out on the patio and had a niece view of foot traffic going up and down the strip.
