This review is for the nightlife, not the food. 

Myself and two other Latinas came here on a Friday night. There was an AWESOME band playing everything from oldies to cumbias. Even though it was ridiculously packed we were always able to find a place to rest our feet while we waited out the slow songs. Man, I haven't heard a live band play cumbias this well in a while. I seriously danced all night long. 

The bar was packed and it made it hard to get a drink, I wish they would have had servers. 

The crowd was puro Latinos. No one bothered us, no one even asked us to dance, which pissed off one of my friends but I didn't care, that's what I love about cumbias, you can dance by yourself. 

I can't wait to come back!
