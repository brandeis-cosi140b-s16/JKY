Food is pretty solid, although the surrounding area is pretty ghetto.  There's a good reason a security guard is on the premise at all times!  They close at 2AM so come in for late night eats.

Sopas (Al Pastor) $4-Slightly above average- The Sopas here is 10x better than anything I've had in So Cal.  It's overflowing up w/ meat, covering the entire corn base.  It's also loaded w/ veggies, sauce, guac, and covered w/ a hard shell on top (I didn't care for the hard shell, I actually removed it when I ate it).  While expensive, I highly recommend it.  My only gripe was the Al Pastor was very sweet.

Sopas (Carne Asada) $4-Exceptional-Same as above, except the carne asada is cooked to perfection.

Tacos (Carne Asada) $2-Slightly above average.  Again, the tacos here are much better than what I've had in Cali.  The sauce on the tacos really give it a great taste.  I'm used to "Cali" tacos which only have onions & cilantro.  Carne asada here is pretty good.

Tacos (Al Pastor) $2-Average - Same as above, except the al pastor was way too sweet.

Carne Asada Fries $10 - Slightly above average- I think the fries are pretty good but nothing to write home about.  If you are sharing w/ a group of people I'd go for it, otherwise you are OK passing on it.

Tips:
-Area is pretty ghetto at night, but there's a security guard there
-Restaurant is pretty clean
-The Carne Asada here is exceptional, but the al pastor is very sweet (but still good nonetheless)
