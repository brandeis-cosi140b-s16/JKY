My review is based on the Mexican side of China Poblano.  My buddy highly recommended the tacos here, "you got to try them, they will put a smile to your face."  I was skeptical because what would a Spaniard know about tacos?  A tortilla is considered an omelette in Spain.  But, I ran with my buddy's suggestion. 

I did find myelf to be in an identity crisis when I walked in because the restuaurant is literally divided between Chinese ladies making noodles on my left and Mexican ladies making warm tortillas on my right.  I decided to sit on the right side to see the ladies make fresh hand made toritillas.  

I had a few tacos: lengua (beef tongue), fish, hongos (mushrooms), pork belly, and barbacoa (braised short rib).  All the tacos had high quality ingredients, from the condiments to the meats.  My notable favorites were the beef tongue and hongos.  Beef tongue was very tender and seasoned well. Hongos had perfectly sauteed mushrooms on top of fresh guacamole. Very tasty.  

Service was slow but staff were apologetic.  I would definitely be back for the tacos again.  I appreciate that Jose Andres maintained a traditional taco and did not kill it with unnecessary fusion techniques. I definitely did walk out with a smile on my face.
