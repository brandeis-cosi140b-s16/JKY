I've bean waiting for a place like this.
Four hundred and fifty... pennies for a taco?! 
Oh but they're so worth it! She said. 
I had two of them, they come with plenty of meat guacamole salsa and sour cream.  You can opt for the regular two dollar tacos that only come with meat and salsa if you don't want all the extras but I wouldn't skip on all that extra deliciousness, go back to the car look for extra change under the seat and upgrade your tacos to Cadillac!
I also tried the shrimp cocktail, it was very good but they need to add octopus and oysters to it to make it perfect, which they promised me they will. Wow! I'm in!
You can order your basic fountain drinks or go for Mexican bottled sodas. Difference between American coke and American coke from Mexico? Sugar! Here in the states they use corn syrup and in Mexico they still follow the original recipe which asks for real sugar but that's a whole different review for the coca cola company, this review is all frijoles. They also serve aguas frescas of different flavors, pineapple, melon cucumber horchata and many more. If you can't decide what kind you want they'll give you a taste to try, that's how nice they are. The elote was good, they can use a little help from the elote man on the streets but it was still good, covered with cream, cheese and chile is hard to just eat one.
 Not a full service restaurant, you order, you get a number, and the food is delivered to your table but the service you do get is outstanding and it comes with a smile at no extra charge. The place is clean and though they added a few mexican touches here and there does not hide the fact that this place used to be a Pizza Hut but once you try the food you realize it was always meant to be Frijoles.
