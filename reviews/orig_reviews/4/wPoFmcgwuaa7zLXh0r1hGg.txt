Great happy hour (runs till 8 pm), the food is always excellent. The folks working there are always friendly and prompt.  

Try the Halibut burrito,  tried it once and I haven't looked back.

The decor is conducive to having a drink and relaxing.

Watching sports is easy with the 5 or 6 flat screens.

The have a small but robust salsa bar.  Some hot stuff on there!

Overall, a great place to relax.
