This was a pleasant surprise for airport food, yes its pricey but at least its worth it.  They have killer french press coffee, they bring you a big carafe for 2 that makes at least 5-6 cups.  I ordered the chilaquiles which were tasty and my husband had the Mexican omelet.  The service was really good too, since we were in a time crunch they served us pretty quick.  If in the area again I would definitely come back and try the cochinita pibil witch is supposed to be the house specialty.
