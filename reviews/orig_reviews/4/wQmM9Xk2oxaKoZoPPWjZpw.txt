Ok so this place is controversial... You either love it or hate it.

The food is GREAT, especially if you love SPICY food. The menu marks the stuff that is hot, and it is no joke, its HOT. But very tasty. The hottness kind of depends on the day I have found, some days it like liquid magma, and otheres its got a good kick. I have had the Adobada ribs, the enchiladas, the machaca, the chimichanga. All good. Sometimes the beans are even spicy. You can get your meals with either red or green chile, I am told that the green is hotter, but that is up for debate.

On to the not so good: The service is at best mediocre, especially if they are busy and its a weekend. Dont go here if you are in a hurry. But for us, the food is worth the bad service. Consider yourself warned... Also they dont have much of a kids menu, our 2 year old has snacked on rice and beans (when the beans are not spicy) and a cheese crisp and the rolled tacos on occasion. Thats about the extent of it, everything else is spicy.

This is not completely authentic mexican food, its more of a southwestern flare. No carne asada here.

The Kick-Ass Margarita is awesome (so my husband says) and I like the Sangria and the Sangria Margarita. Margatitas overall are good here.
