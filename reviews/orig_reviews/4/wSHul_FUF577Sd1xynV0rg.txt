If ur looking for street tacos; this place will do! Got the family pack carne asada ($16) that came with 15 yummy mini flour tortillas.  The carne asada was good. would've loved more marinade in it. And just to feel like I was spring breaking it up in Mexico; got some coronitas. ($1.80 each)
The setup is a lil awkward when ordering; kind of cramped and you don't pay until you get ur order . Outside patio was perfecto with music pumpin'. Everything is served up in styrofoam; so ur gonna have to sacrifice the environment people!,  for some yummy food.

Dress: anything goes, from jeans to ladies in their cha cha shoes and pi√±ata dresses
