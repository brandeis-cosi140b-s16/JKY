Foodwise, Baja Miguel's is on par with most Mexican restaurants that I've been to. I got a three item combo with a cheese enchilada, a chicken enchilada, and a shredded beef taco. All were really good, and I think they might have thrown in an extra cheese enchilada, but I didn't ask. I really liked that the entire plate was baked with some delicious cheese on top.

The service was really good. We had a coupon for a free margarita with purchase of an entree. The margarita was tasty, though small. My husband thought it was light on the alcohol, but I didn't mind since it was free.

The big plus here is that unlike every other Mexican restaurant I've been to, they bring out salsa, bean dip, and guacamole with chips for FREE at the beginning of the meal, as in they don't make you pay extra for guacamole! How rare and awesome is that!
