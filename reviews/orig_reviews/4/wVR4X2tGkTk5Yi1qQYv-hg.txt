Always busy, this East Boulevard restaurant has great food. Best thing on the menu- Barbacoa! Order it as an entree, or in tacos. They have a top shelf /handcrafted margarita menu that produces outstanding drinks. 

Table-side Guacamole is the best in town! 

Perfect spot to meet friends and enjoy some terrific food. And, if you need it, they have a kids menu.

Also, th eparking lot is fairly small, but valet parking is usually available at the front door.
