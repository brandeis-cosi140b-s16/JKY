Always good after many visits over the last ten plus years. If they have the pumpkin empenada you must get it.  The slow roasted garlic pork is amazing and even though I haven't had it for years after going vegetarian I still recommend it to everyone who accompanies me to Los Dos Molinos.  They all love it!
