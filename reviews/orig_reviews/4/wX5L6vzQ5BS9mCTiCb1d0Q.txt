This place has the best tequila selection in Pittsburgh. Goes way beyond college-level tequila styles and actually stocks very tasty tequilas that deserve to be enjoyed. Happy hour margaritas are a great deal and last until 7. Plus, while I found that the food was just ok when they first opened, their food has greatly improved. I highly recommend the shrimp tacos. Also, they are great for large groups. I've never had a problem gathering 10+ people here and having great service.
