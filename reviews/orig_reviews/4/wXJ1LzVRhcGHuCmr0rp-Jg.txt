I always love the small local Mexican restaurants around town. This one is good but nit favorite. I only go there for the breakfast burritos and they are amazing. They are under $5 and are twice the size you will get at any fast food restaurant. I also like how they are not dripping with grease like others. I was unimpressed with the inside of the restaurant and the worker who took my order was not very nice and didn't smile at all. I usually do the drive thru and it is quick and easy. This place is better then filibertos and is great for breakfast or a quick snack.
