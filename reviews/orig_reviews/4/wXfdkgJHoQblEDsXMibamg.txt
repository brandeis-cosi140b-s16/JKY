THIS PLACE IS A SLEEPER

This place is nothing more than a sandwich shop with seats... and a little run down. Over the years, the celebrity chefs that have TV programs, i.e. Guy Fieri, Adam Richman, etc., in my opinion have been right less than half of the time with their suggestions. This one though is a WINNER! We both had the steak with queso fresco and avocado on a Mexican roll... DEEELICIOUS!
