I've probably been to Z Tejas more times than any other restaurant in the area. For a franchise, it is surprisingly good and consistent. I can think of only one bad meal I had here (a chile relleno) and many more good to great meals. All the appetizers are good, including my favorite thing on the menu, blackened catfish tacos. Also good are the barbacoa stackers, and from the main menu all the salads are good and interesting, as well as the mushroom enchiladas (outstanding) and the macaroni and cheese (just good soul food). Another specialty are their margaritas. I generally prefer the 6th street on the rocks, but the frozen margaritas have more alcohol in them (for the same price--a bit annoying) so I've started ordering those. Their mojitos are also really good. The service is usually pretty good, even when in big parties (I've been with ~20 people at happy hour and the service is fairly quick and friendly; they will also split bills for easier payment). The best time to come is during happy hour, when margaritas are a dollar off and all the appetizers are half price (1 appetizer is usually enough for me). It can get crowded at times, so if you have a larger party I would recommend a reservation, especially if you want to sit inside. 

Also as an aside, they have a gluten-free menu upon request (my friend loves one of the salads on that and asks for it even though she can eat gluten).
