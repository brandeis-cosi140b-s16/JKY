Oh all the Los Dos Molinos, I will say that this is the best one.
This is the one that I would go to again and again.
The oridgenal location was up in Springerville,(AZ) I have not ever been to that one, but have friends that have and all say it too is great.
This was a place opened by family. I think that is why it is so good.
The name translates to The Two Grinders. The story goes that both the husband and wife had a meat grinder that they brought into the family that had been passed down through the generations. So they decided on that name because, it was cool and it is.

This location is the home (ranch) of an old Cowboy Movie Star. Though I cannot remember his name right now. Ask when you go.
It is a great place. Lots of cool decour.
The food is nice and spicy. New Mexico style spicy, which is a little different than Mexican style foods.
They start you out with some chips and salsa. One Green, and one Red. Both delish, if you can take the heat.
The sauses are really good, fresh and tasty. Everything you get there,mmm!
Of course they are famous for their Margaritas, the strongest out there, I think.
It is worth your time to give this place the once over.
