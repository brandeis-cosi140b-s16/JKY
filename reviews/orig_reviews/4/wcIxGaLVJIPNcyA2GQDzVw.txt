DO NOT COME HERE DURING SCHOOL LUNCH HOURS.  Just a little warning.  Made that mistake one time and won't make it again.  Although, I have to give them credit- the high schoolers get their own line and their food is ready made.

Anyway, My husband thinks this place rocks and doesn't want to get fast food Mexican anywhere else.  He hoards the salsa packets and brings them home and puts them on everything.

Personally, I think it's good, but does leave a little to be desired.  It is greasy.  Very greasy.  I like to get one of three things.  The bean and ground beef tostada, the ground beef burrito or the machacha chicken tacos (not as greasy).  I haven't ventured far from those things though.  

The refried beans are the best I have ever had and I have to steal the recipe some day.  The rice is blah.  

The service is okay.  The food takes a little while to come out, especially if you go during a rush hour.  The layout leaves something to be desired because the place gets so busy.  Location is awesome.  Always clean.
