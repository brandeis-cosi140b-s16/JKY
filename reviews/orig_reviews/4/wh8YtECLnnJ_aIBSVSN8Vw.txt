this place is nestled right next to a huge strip club. Very awkward place but it works. I started out with the Queso Fundido which was all i anticipated and then some. asked the bartender which tacos to get and i was not steered wrong. I chose one taco myself which wasnt recommended and i see why. Rajas con queso just sucked. Bland and barely any queso at all. The pork with habenero pickled onions was my favorite. The hot sauce trio for dipping was some of the best salsa i had. It gave you 3 levels of heat. My favorite being the organge habenero salsa. I see why this place has all the stars. they deserve it. Decor is very nice also.
