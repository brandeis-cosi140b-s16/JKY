I've been here several times and in have to say the food is pretty good and the staff is very friendly. I've tried the Torta del Rey (about $9) and it is packed with meat, eggs, ham and many other yummy things that make it a gigantic Mexican sandwich.  I would split this with another person as it is big, unless of course you have lots of room for the entire yummy Torta. 

I've also had the Carne Asada mini tacos ($5.99 for 3) served with cucumbers, lettuce and radish slices. These are good if you're not feeling extremely hungry. 

There are many things on the menu including seafood and the regular burritos and typical Mexican dishes you would expect to find.  You MUST try the "aguas naturales" ($4) which are made with natural fruit right when you order them.  The strawberry and cantaloupe are my favorite.
