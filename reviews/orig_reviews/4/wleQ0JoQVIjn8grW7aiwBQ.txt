Went for my grandfather's birthday last night. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The music and ambiance were fun and they even have a cool upstairs area with an outside patio. The ceviche and guacamole were great and we all enjoyed our mains. The best part was our server- I don't remember his name but he was tall with a big smile and a long ponytail. He made us laugh and joked around with us. We will be back! Thanks for the great service!
