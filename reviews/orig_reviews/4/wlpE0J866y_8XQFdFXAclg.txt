La Tolteca is probably the most interesting Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix. The building houses a bakery and a market in addition to the lunch counter. On the walls of the eating area is a cartoon mural that is always very entertaining while eating. 

The food is fantastic. I haven't had any disappointments for the 7 years I've been eating there. You can get some real authentic food here. If there are Mexicans in a Mexican food restaurant, it is always a good sign!
