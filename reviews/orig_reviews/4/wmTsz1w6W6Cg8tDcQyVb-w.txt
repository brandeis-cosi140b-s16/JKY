Great experience.  Lots of onstreet parking available and great location.

I went here with my fiancee and we shared the tableside Guacamole and the Pork Shoulder Tacos.  I would find it hard to not get the same thing - they were both absolutely delicious!  Portions were large but not obesity sized.  For dessert we had the
Expresso Churros, which were awesome as well.  We wouldn't have gotten it normally because we were so full, but they gave it to us for free since we were celebrating a special occasion.

I thought the service was a little slow to get to us (about 6-7 minutes) initially, but once he did, the service was excellent.  That was the only blemish.  If I could give 4.5 starts, I would.  We will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix.
