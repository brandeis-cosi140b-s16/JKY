Living in Ahwatukee, this spot is just about a 5 minute drive from my apartment so I tend to go there at least once or twice every couple weeks.  

The atmosphere is pretty festive and entertaining.  The crowds on Fri and Sat nights tend to get a little too big for my liking, but it can still be a good time.  I prefer to go during the week when its a little more mellow but still enough people to make it lively.  

The food isn't traditional mexican by any means, but still not bad.  I really enjoyed the jalapeno mac n cheese.  The drinks are decently priced, the mixed drinks can tend to get a little pricey so I usually stick with beer.  Wish they had drink specials on Fri and Sat nights, but most of their specials are during the week.  

Overall, I enjoy this place.  Its close to my home and the atmosphere makes up for the other minor inconveniences.  I've read other negative reviews about the staff, but personally have never run into anything that was too big of a deal.  The proximity and familiarity with the place is why I enjoy it like I do.
