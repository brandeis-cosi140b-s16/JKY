Excellent service and the chips & salsa were tasty, not spicy. I ordered two margaritas, one with cucumber and cilantro (refreshing and not too sweet) and the other was a mango and jalape√±o margarita (way too sweet and thick for me). I enjoyed my experience and soaked up the sun for 2 hours. It's a great place to just chill and enjoy a refreshing drink.
