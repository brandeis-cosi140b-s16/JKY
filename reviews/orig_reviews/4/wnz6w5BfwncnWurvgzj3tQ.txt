This place is pretty good! I love their tacos de carne asada and lengua! If you love spicy salsa then you need to try the habanero sauce! Their enchiladas were alright...but their sopes are really good! Even the regular red and green salsas are delicious. A mexican food restaurant is NOTHING if they don't have good salsas...so that should tell you something about this place :D Definitely will keep coming!
