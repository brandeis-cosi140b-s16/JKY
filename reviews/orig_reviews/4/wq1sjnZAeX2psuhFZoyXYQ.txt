So we went to Osla for my sisters 21st birthday dinner and it was great, the service was kinda slow but over all the drinks and food was good we didnt have the groupon that everyone is talking about so it was a bit pricey for tacos lol but its vegas haha let me say that the NACHOS & mango margarita are so yummy.... 
i will be going back when im back in town
