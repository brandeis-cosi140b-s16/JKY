I've been to Las Velas too many times to count. This is my go to spot to take friends for the BEST queso in Pittsburgh! It's a hidden gem in Market Square. It's above Diamond Market so it's sometimes overlooked by newbies to Dahntahn. 

Stopped in last night for HH before the Pirates Game. Staff was attentive and friendly as usual. The only drag is that there always seems to be a delay at the bar. Drink refills take a while, which is not a plus during HH. I want to get the most for my money! 

My friends and I ordered the following:

Large margaritas- two strawberry, one regular, and one mango cayenne. All delicious! The mango cayenne is my favorite and talk about a double whammy punch to the tastebuds. The alcohol in the margs is strong so along with the plentiful addition of cayenne pepper, it's a poweful hit to the senses. 

Chips, queos, gauc and salsa. The chips were a different variety this time (that's how often I go there- I even know the chips! ) They weren't the fresh cut & fried corn tortillas. They seemed like the type of bagged "authentic mexican chips" I hope this isn't a permanent change to the menu! Queso was amazing as always, gauc was fresh with huge chunks of avocado and salsa was mild and refreshing. 
Even though we didn't need it (chips and dip is filling!) we ordered two quesadillas, stuffed jalapenos- stuffed with fresco cheese, ground beef, chorizo and drizzled with tamarindo honey sauce and one order of Sopecitos- 4 corn tortillas, topped one each of chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas and cheese. The stuffed jalapenos were each large and lit my mouth on fire. Well done, Las Velas! The rest of the food didn't dissapoint... my go to is usually the Sopecitos! 

Once again, Las Velas was a great choice and I'm sure I'll be back soon!
