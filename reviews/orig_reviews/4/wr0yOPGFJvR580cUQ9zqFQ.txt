Really enjoyed this place! Went here for my birthday with family and I'm happy we did! We LOVE mexican food and good salsa/guacomole and Mercadito had both. The menu was a little confusing but that is very minor compared to how great the food and service was.

Our waitress Amber was fabulous. She seemed very happy to be at work and was very knowledgeable. 

We got the 'unlimited 3 salsas,' and 'traditional guacomole,' to start with. Everything tasted sooo fresh. I'm a guacomole connoisseur (haha) and fell in love with Mercadito's guac. I'm already craving to go back for it. 

I got the enchiladas and they were delish. You know its great food when you can taste the freshness and that is what my family and myself kept talking about.

I can't wait to go back & Thank you Amber for a great experience!
