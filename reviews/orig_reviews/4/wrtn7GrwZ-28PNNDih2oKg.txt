San Felipe's has a great happy hour with half off all appetizers and most if not all drinks.  The appetizer selection is pretty legit with things ranging from your standard wings to Mahi Mahi sticks to shrimp cocktails to oysters.  When I go I typically order the Mahi Mahi sticks and a shrimp cocktail.  You cannot lose with this combination.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  With the plethora of tvs and a great happy hour San Felipe's is a solid spot to watch a game.  Be forewarned though, this place can get packed especially right now with the NBA finals going on.
