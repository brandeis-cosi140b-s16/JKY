Went there for Taco Tuesday and was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservations.  We got a seat right away in the self-seating bar area, but it was the last table available.  Cool atmosphere and decor.  Only had the margaritas and chips and salsa.  Chips and salsa was good.  Margaritas were a bit sweet, but they were large and only $3.50.  Seemed like a fun little place, but I hated my date.  I'll go back there and explore a little more when I'm with people I like and I'll update my review accordingly.
