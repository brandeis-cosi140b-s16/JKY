Well I've promised to put a few reviews on here to get past my joining Yelp just to vent my frustrations with one (now defunct) business.  So, I can think of no better restaurant to start with than La Fonda.  I've been coming here since I was kid; it was my father's favorite Mexican joint, and it is now mine and my son's as well!  My son and I have dinner alone together once a week and have made La Fonda our restaurant of choice!  The chips can be a bit greasy (hence not 5 stars), but they're always hot and fresh, and the salsa's hands down the best in town.  None of that cooked, tastes like it came from a jar stuff; just fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc.-- it's so good, I could inhale it.  Being the creatures of habit we are, Jacob and I always get the same things every week. (Nowadays, we just order "the usual.")  For Jacob, it's a cheese crisp with guacamole, for me, it's a machaca burro and a side of beans.  I've had other things in the past...  the tamales are wonderful too, but I absolutely LOVE the machaca.  It's tender, crispy and fried up with lots of onions and peppers.  It's delicious!!  The beans are good too, but beans are beans; it's the machaca I keep coming back for. 

As for the atmosphere, it can definitely get a bit loud in there when it's busy.  The sound just seems to reverberate off the tile and concrete.  And...  pray that no one near you orders fajitas, or you will (guaranteed!) smell like them for the rest of the evening.   But, again, I am addicted to the machaca and therefore find the rest to be mere trifles.

What more can I say-- I love La Fonda.
