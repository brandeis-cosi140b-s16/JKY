Cheap. Delicious. Cali-Mexican. There Cajun chicken is to die for. This is always a fun spot that a bunch of friends end up at after hanging out at the bars in the area. The staff here seem really cleanly and friendly. They have a discount for all bar, casino and restaurant employees with valid proof from 9pm-8am!!! Love the locals discount portion.
