Yes Mill, yes! I know it's selfish, I really do, but I love the direction you're headed if you get more places like this. Canteen represents the perfect step up from Cue and Tavern for those of us who like to party down but aren't enthralled with the novelty enough to jam into tight spaces. Canteen finally gives a touch of class to a stale bar scene, without needing the cab ride up to Scottsdale or the Biltmore. That's not to say I'm done with the aforementioned bars, but damn does it feel good to have a choice. 

Pros:
Huge tequila selection
Multiple bars
Huge patio in the back
Decent dance floor inside
Drinks aren't thaaaaaat expensive
Generally pretty good music

Cons:
Always a line, though it does move quickly
Back bar is a nightmare to get drinks
A line for the mens restroom, what??!
