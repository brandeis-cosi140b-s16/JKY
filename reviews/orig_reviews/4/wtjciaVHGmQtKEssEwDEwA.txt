In the past 20 years we ate here so many times, lunch, dinner, we did all! Tried almost everything from the menu! Never been disappointed!
From hostess to servers, all very friendly! No matter how busy the place, seating and service is always fast! 
Lately we are eating lunch here!
Their specials are worth driving from West to East!
Prices are very reasonable. The food quality is good.
They are very helpful to explain the menu items. I'm not from that region, so I always have questions!
They don't mind making changes to the orders, if I'm asking for it. For example if I don't like something very spicy, they are willing to prepare the meal for me the way I like it! They make everything right!
I love their Shrimp Fajitas. Very tasty! Love, love, love their homemade tortillas! Always fresh!!!
My latest addiction is their Mango cake. So refreshing! Of course the Margarita is a must, especially with premium tequila! So you can SAVE water!!!
The restaurant has a very welcoming atmosphere with beautiful, authentic decorations.
Live music is always entertaining!
