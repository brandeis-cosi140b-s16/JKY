This place is VERY difficult to spot if you've never been there before. It is located across the street from an elementary school's playground in a nondescript brown brick building. Look for the metal gated doors - that is the entrance. There is no parking lot, you just have to find a spot to park in the street.

My coworkers and I arrived here about 11:45 today, thinking we were going to beat the lunch rush, but we were wrong. The person in front of us ordered about TWENTY burritos to-go, so it took our food a pretty long time to get out. I would say we waited about half an hour, which kind of sucked. But the food was really good just like all the other reviews say! I ordered the rice and bean burrito with green chile sauce. I think $8 for a burrito is pretty fair, especially considering I could only eat half for my lunch and will be eating the other half for dinner tonight. Plus it's always nice to support a local business. Next time I think I'll try the enchilada.

Oh and they only take cash and they seem to run out of coins frequently, so if you have exact change that is even better. And there is no seating inside. I think they have a few tables on a patio outside, but most people typically take their food to-go.
