omg I guess any restaurant with a long line is a good one! Specially a mexican restaurant with a lot of hispanic patrons!

The food was SO good, like more orgasm on a plate. The tortilla were handmade, really really good! I stuffed my cheeks till i couldnt move.

The Margaritas were a little too sweet for me... I still prefer the ones at dona marias. But the food here... to die for!
