My wife and I were at Mandalay Bay for a trade show and we needed to get a quick lunch so we had lunch at the Border Grill. We got the margarita for 2 and it was really good, prepared table side, that was a treat.
We started off with the 3 sweet corn tamales and these are the best!
I got the carnitas tacos, two were good, the 3rd one was full of fat, not much meat, that was a disappointment. I could have sent it back but we were in a hurry. Who ever prepared the tacos, must have been blind to include all that fat.
My wife had the spicy shrimp tacos, I tried one and they were tasty.
Our server was really great, very personable.
I thought the prices were a bit high but we are in Vegas, kind of on a short leash so we endured the expensive lunch.
