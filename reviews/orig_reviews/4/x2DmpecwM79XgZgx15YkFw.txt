Came here because the hubby has been wanting to try this place for the longest. I'm so sorry I waited so long!! This is authentic  Mexican food at its best! From the restaurant decor to the hand made tortilla station! My husband ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered a side salad and a shrimp ceviche tostada . The steak was well cooked and flavorful and they give u alot of steak! My tostada was delish!! The chips and salsa come with a bowl of refried beans that are just like my abuelita(grandma) use to make. 

Service was on point too! Our waiter Arturo was fast and attentive and super friendly! It's hard to find friendly waiters nowadays! I wish I receives this kind of service at every restaurant I went to:)
Now why did I give this place 4 stars and not 5 u ask??? My husbands fajitas only came with two flour tortillas!! Who can eat a large plate of delish steak fajitas with 2 tortillas!?? We asked our server for another tortilla and he politely said he would have to charge us for a order of tortillas! Come on owner of Casa  Don Juan!!! Stop being stingy on the flour tortillas! That being said , I would definitely come back to this place!
