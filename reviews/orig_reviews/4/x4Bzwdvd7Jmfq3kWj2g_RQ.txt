This place has some really, really great food. Here are the high points: 1. The guacamole was phenomenal. 2. The Agua fresca was amazing. 3. The lime tart was great. 4. AMAZING QUINOA SALAD. Low points: 1. I didn't like my milkshake- chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream. 2. I didn't like the tortillas on my tacos. 3. The inside of the restaurant was extremely loud, so I suggest you grab a table outside.
