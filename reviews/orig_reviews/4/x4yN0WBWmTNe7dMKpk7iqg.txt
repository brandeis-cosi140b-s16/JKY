I stopped by on July 4th for some lunch and a margaritta. Service was fast and friendly. Margarittas were loaded with taquilla. The salsa, while heavy on the tomatoe, was also spicy. The chips were fresh and warm. My meal, a taco and tamale, went down fast. The shredded beef in the taco was soupy but full of flavor. There was a bit of guacamole on there too. That is never a bad thing. The chicken tamale was still wrapped in its husk and had no sauce. This was perfect for me. I usually scrape the sauce off a tamale anyhow. Did I mention it had a ton of chicken? Not too much massa to worry about with this one. I can see why they are famous for their tamales.
