My first meal out as a brand new Chandler resident! I'm transplanted from Portland Oregon which has one of the best food scenes in the country. My expectations of Chandler were really low. So thankfully I started with el zocalo. I had a simple meal of caldo Azteca soup with chips and guac. The soup was FABulous! Generous amount of quality chicken thigh meat, potato,spinach and avocado. Service was friendly and prompt. Even the coffee was good. Yay Chandler!
