We needed to take my parents out for dinner to thank them for watching our pups while our whole house was retiled - my mom had heard something about this place from a few friends, so we decided to give it a shot.

First, it's tucked way in there, I would have never even known it was there.  It was pretty slow for a Thursday night, but it did seem to pick up later in the evening.

After looking over the menu and the specials, we decided to split some appetizers and the special of a grill platter that night. 

We started with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla - let me be the first to say I'm not a huge fan of pork (except bacon, god's most perfect food) but this was so tasty!   We added to that the Bacon Wrapped Jumbo Shrimp, which came with 4 sauces.  While none of the sauces counted as hot on our meters (AZ Natives are tough) they all had complex and well developed.  

For the entree, we split the Grill Platter, a special for that night.  With the appetizers, it was perfect for 4 people to split, if it had only been 2 of us, the appetizers plus the platter would have been WAY too much food.  All the meats were done to perfection, and so much flavor!  Presentation and plating for all the items was nice too, it really elevated this meal to a truly nice evening.

The desert was a "brownie" with ice cream - but brownie is really the wrong word for it.  It was this warm, gooey, almost fudge like concoction, that was the perfect finishing note to this meal.

Even with a few beers, the meal was super reasonable - we did get happy hour prices for the appetizers, but I feel like our wallets were just as satisfied as we were.

The decor is charming, the booths create an intimate atmosphere, and the service was good.

Overall, this is going on my go-to list for beyond the chain Ahwatukee dining.
