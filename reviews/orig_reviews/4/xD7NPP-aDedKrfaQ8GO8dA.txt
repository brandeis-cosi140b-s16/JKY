Had a wonderful dinner here tonight with about 18 of my work colleagues. Food was great and service was excellent. I had the signature paco tacos with charro beans. Very tasty!  One of our group was celebrating his birthday and the server even took a sombrero off the wall at our request, crowned him with it and we all sang Happy Birthday. As you can expect on a Saturday night the place was packed. Super energy. Lots of fun.
