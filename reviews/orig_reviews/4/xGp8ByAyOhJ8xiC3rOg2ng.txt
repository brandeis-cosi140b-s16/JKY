We lucked out and got seated at the comfy booth ( there is only four) the atmosphere was electric, eclectic music, mood lighting and friendly staff. The food was just ok. I ordered the steak fajitas, I was disappointed they weren't served on a traditional steaming skillet and were under cooked. The guava margarita was delicious and so was the 3 leches cake. Over all I would go back but wouldn't order the fajitas.
