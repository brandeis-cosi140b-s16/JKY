Definitely a fan. The waitress was sweet and accommodating. The salsa and chips, with a seasoning, are great. As for the entrees, the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte! The only reason I didn't rate Three Amigos a five is because the timing. We waited a while for the entrees, but they were worth it. Will definitely be back!
