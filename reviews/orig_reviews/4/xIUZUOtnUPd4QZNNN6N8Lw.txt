I love this place the only problem is that the last few times I have gone there the service was a little less than what I am used to.  The cook and the cashier were arguing over my order and I was hoping it wouldn't get taken out on my food!!!! 
I would definitely eat here again.  
Recommend the emerald chicken, black beans, chicken fried rice, and jerk chicken quesadilla
