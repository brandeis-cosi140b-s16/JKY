We've been here a couple of times now and I love the place! We walked in there you feel like you're in a restaurant in Rocky point Mexico. It's got a really cool coastal beach theme. The menu is rather large and has a lot of options. It is a bit cumbersome to understand in parts of the language barrier. Service on both times that we went was exceptional. They have a ceviche tostada on happy hour that is knock your socks off fantastic. That with a cold Corona light draft beer you can't go wrong. My only negative issue was there's a male manager that walks around the dining room on both occasions with a cold and stern look on his face and seems really uninviting. He stopped at our table to clear off some table settings and didn't even speak to us which I thought was disconcerting. I find the parking lot a bit sketchy to as the first time we were there there were people walking out of the restaurant with Bud lights in her hand heading towards her vehicles and the second time there was a couple of good old boys in the parking lot with the tailgates of their trucks down sipping on a bottle of Jack Daniels. Does it give the place very good curb appeal. Other than that this place is rockstar!
