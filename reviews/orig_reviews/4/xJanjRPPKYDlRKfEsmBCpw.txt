Food: Trying to be fair, I will not compare the food here to authentic Mexican food that I order off the truck in Mexico or San Diego.  While the food overall was good, it was not spectacular. But decent for Phoenix area. The horchata drink was a little watered down, and the grilled halibut was tender, but expensive at $20. The best part was the table-side guacamole with the pomegranate. The pomegranate had a distinct flavor and crunchy texture that contrasted well with the avocado. The churro dessert was great.

Service: A bit slower than I would have liked, but I recognize that they were busy on Thursday night. 

Ambiance: The tables were too small for the 6 of us (they put 2 tables together), and the overall area was cramped. But the live music was really nice touch. 

Price: ~$10 for appetizers, $15-$20 for entrees.  Margaritas were really pricey at $10-12 each. 

Overall: It's not great value, but the food is decent and the ambiance and the live music makes the entire dinning experience 3.5 stars.
