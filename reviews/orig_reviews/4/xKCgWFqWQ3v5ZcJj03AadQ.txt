Came in during 1:30pm with a couple people to try them out.

Around that time, they were packed! If that's how lunch rush is on a Sunday I would hate to see it on a Saturday but good for them! 

Came in and had the following:

Tacos (Asada, Al Pastor) -  tacos were not my pick because I normally get lingua, cabeza, tripas, so not my first choice but I enjoyed it. I appreciated the hand made tortillas. Fluffy and not hard. Just the right amount of salsa that they put on for you. I'm picky since I would rather control the amount myself but still good. The onions weren't over powering.

Michelada -  perfect amount of Tajin and hot sauce. Not too spicy, but not weak either. 

Elotes - nothing memorable. Just your corn, mayo, cheese, and spices. But still yummy to eat. Corn was surprisingly sweet.

Torta - this was actually done pretty good. The bread they chose and the size complimented the amount of meat they put in it. Normally you'll get a soggy bread with very little meat and way too much filler but not this one. 

All in all, I would come back again. Nothing that makes it stand out for me to go all the way to DTLV from Henderson but if I was in the area I'll definitely give them a try. I'm just very partial to Taco y Taco that's all
