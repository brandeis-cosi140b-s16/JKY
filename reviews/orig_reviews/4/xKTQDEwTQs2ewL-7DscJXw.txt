Mad Mex is small quaint place.  The decor is dark but vibrant.  There is always a number of people and while you're packed in with tables it doesn't feel too crowded.

The food is good if you stick to the Tex Mex, otherwise it is hit or miss.  The beer selection is good and the prices are dead on (especially if you have a student ID.)
