This is a great place to go if you're craving some Mexican. It's kind of a hidden entrance but it's not a hike in the wall. It has a nice atmosphere and just as good of food. I definitely recommend the sweet mango salsa if you go for the sampler appetizer. 

I had the chorizo and potato tacos and they were great. Soft and fluffy tortillas that weren't overfilled but were just the right size. The flavors were definitely well defined and brought by with authentic recipes and much care. 

Overall I would come here every week if possible and would recommend it in a heartbeat.
