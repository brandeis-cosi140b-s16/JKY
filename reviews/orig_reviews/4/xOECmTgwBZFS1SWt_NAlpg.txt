I didn't have a meal at my trip to Javier's, but I can vouch for the margaritas! Woah! With so many places on the strip that skimp out on the alcohol leaving the flavors lacking in my favorite cocktails, Javier's really hit the spot. Even the flavored margaritas have a perfect amount of tequila that gives you rosy cheeks and also your money's worth. The chips and salsa are delicious too!
