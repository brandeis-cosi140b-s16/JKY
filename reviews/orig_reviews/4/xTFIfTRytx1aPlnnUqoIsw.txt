Strictly stopped because of the reviews. Got a taco al pastor to go and a burrito de asada to go. The place is a little loud with music. The burrito and taco were good but not the best I've had, no napkins on my to go bag. Overall descent place to eat and/or have a drink. Definitely will try something else next time.
