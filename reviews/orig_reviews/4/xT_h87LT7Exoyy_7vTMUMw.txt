Let me get all the bad stuff out of the way...

They have a drive thru that isn't in service.
The way they have the lines set up is a pain in the @$$.
The seats and tables are awful.
The parking situation is terrible. 

Ok!!! Now let's talk about why I love this place so much!!

FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD!!! I don't think I've ever ordered anything here that I didn't love. I'm particularly fond of the pork mulas with flour tortillas. 
I have a hard time driving by this place without stopping in for a taco or 4. 

This place rocks.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the way they have the food ordering process set up. The "one line for each type of meat" business might work in TJ, but this is America baby. We like our food hot, cheap, fast and delicious.
