Party of 13 with reservations on a Friday night. 
We were seated in the cove. Seating was a bit awkward for the size of our group; but we were taken care of. 

The chips and salsa we good to get started. All our food came out at the same time. 

I had the Albondigas soup and a shrimp tostada - all good. 

The fare is fairly standard Mexican Phoenix food. Can't say anything blew me away and everything needed a kick of el tapatio! 

Good spot, good service for a large group and a festive atmosphere!
