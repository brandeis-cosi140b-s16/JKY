I had the chicken chimichanga which was surprisingly great. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The margaritas are huge. Service was prompt and pleasant. The menu has an awesome array of selections. I had a hard time choosing my meal. Inexpensive place. The only thing I do not like is they drown everything with lettuce.
