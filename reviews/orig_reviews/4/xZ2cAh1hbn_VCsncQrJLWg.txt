Love the food! Portions were great! Ambience, traditional Mexican decor, tasteful done. Missed going to bar, but it appears to have all sorts of tequilas and all other kinda spirits. Definitely making it a regular place to eat at. Since our new home is nearby. Note, al pastor tacos were spicy, which they should not be. I did notify the waiter but no response from the kitchen. Other than that, my shrimp cocktail was great and all the other food plates my family and friend ordered were very tasty. Also, loved the salsa and chips!
