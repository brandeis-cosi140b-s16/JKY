We ate here on a Saturday night for our girls weekend in Vegas. We were all very excited to see what the 2 hot tamales are all about. We had reservations and were seated promptly in the upstairs balcony. This gave us a perfect view of the Train concert going on in the pool area and provided wonderful background noise. The guacamole was worth the extra money but there wasn't any spice to the salsas with the chips. If there was an alternative available it was not offered. I shared the Peruvian ceviche and sweet corn tamales with a friend. I loved the plantain chips with the ceviche and thought it was very refreshing. The tamales had wonderful flavor but was so wet it had to be eaten with a spoon. For the entree we had the seafood chile relleno. The pepper was nice and crisp with a very flavorful filling. Over all it was a very nice atmosphere and good service. I would definitely come back.
