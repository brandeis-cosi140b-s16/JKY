I read the reviews with interest, and all of the focus is on people, crowds, etc. I want to weigh in on a different topic: Lunch. I went with a buddy for a lunch on a Friday, with meetings scheduled in the afternoon, thus Diet Cokes instead of beers or better. I ordered the Baja Shrimp Sandwich, $5.99 on lunch special, he ordered a grilled fish taco and beans and rice on the side. His was about $6.50 My sandwich came out in a reasonable time frame, contained huge amounts of shrimp, and tasted great. His had a bunch of chunks of grilled fish, and he was raving about the quality of the beans surpassing Tia Rosa's, one of our work favorites. There weren't that many people there, SportsCenter was on the TV, and the waitress was a nice peice of eye candy.
