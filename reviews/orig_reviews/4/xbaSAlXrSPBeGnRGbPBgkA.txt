Very cool place with more character than seats.   The staff was very efficient with managing the Sunday after St Paddy's day brunch crowd and ensuring everyone was being taken care of as soon as possible.  The french toast was toasty and cooked perfectly with the faint hint of cinnamon that kept you wanting just one more bite when you knew you should have just taken the leftovers home.  My girlfriend got the french toast and a cup of coffee which she was given before we even were able to get a seat at the bar.   The staff made sure the water and coffees were always full, really a nice job.   I got a well made bloody as it seemed fit to have such a drink on Mar 18th at 9 am.  The combo of jalape√±o Benedict, two chicken enchiladas and perfectly cooked asparagus were a treat as well and I would love to go back again tomorrow if I could but have to leave town so until next time DH.....keep up the good work and keep this place hidden!
