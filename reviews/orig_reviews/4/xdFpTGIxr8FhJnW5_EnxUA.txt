I've had the adovada ribs, the blue corn enchiladas, and the adovada plate. All were excellent, but the ribs might become my staple there. It's New Mexican food, so it tends to be on the spicy side, but here the chili is not overpowering (it actually could be a smidge hotter in my opinion.)
This is turning into our go-to Mexican restaurant in Gilbert. We've been there several times, and both the food and service are always great.
