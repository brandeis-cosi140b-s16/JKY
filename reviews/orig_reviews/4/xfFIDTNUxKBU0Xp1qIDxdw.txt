Reminds me of being in El Monte, Ca....hole in the wall kind of place but I kinda have a thing for those unfussy ones. Some people don't and thought it kinda weird when I said I've been here like I went into a gang lair. Most of those night taco stands I love back home are kinda shady looking at first but doesn't bother me. Hell, I've dined at taco shops where gangsters have meetings and rib joints with real pimps sharing my table and mexicans having a blood feud running into each other and stabbing each other before their tacos are called and  to me that just adds to the flavor. This has an odd old area- but it has none of those and just normal people dining so it's not that bad to me. Maybe I'm desensitized to "ghetto" cuz is a whole different level in LA and when I lived in San Diego I went across the border for tacos often but old odd area doesnt just add to a ghetto to me.

Lengua was pretty good times I went. I have trouble finding the exotic meat toppings at most joints. Adobada was good. Carnitas were good. I mostly come for lengua late night. A few times the consistency was just okay, kinda ordered on an off day but what taco place doesnt have that? Overall though more on than a off day and been here many times as it was the closest lae night to our old house.

It's decent for my late night lengua. I am still in search for the best taco shop, but I have a feeling it's probably way across town with my luck.
