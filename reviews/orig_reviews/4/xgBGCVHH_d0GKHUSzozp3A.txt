After living here over 8 years finally decided to check out the Hard Rock Hotel since major changes were made. One thing has stayed the same. Pink Taco . Sat at the bar our bartender was attentive and made us laugh . Tall guy dark hair. The corn tortillas were bomb the butterfly chicken full of flavor and the portion size is great actually took a lot home . I reccomend this place for locals and tourists alike cannot go wrong . The multicolor chips are crisp and the salsa is delicious !
