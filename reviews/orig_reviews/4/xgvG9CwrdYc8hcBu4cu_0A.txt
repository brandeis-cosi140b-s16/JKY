Other than going there with a meetup group and slipping out of my shoes due to the sand there, I liked this place.  Service is really slooooow, but the waitresses are nice.  
Ordered some calamari which had some hot saucy jelly looking blob for a dip that I hated, but the nachos with fajitas were really great!  And what a HUGE serving you got.  Gobbled them all down as I was rabidly hungry.
I'm sure that impressed the guys in my group, eh?
Anyway, since I'm a geezer, I get the impression this is a 30 y.o. hangout; however, it was still alot of fun.  We sat on an elevated platform that was covered and really enjoyed our day there.
I'd definitely go back to Sandbar....maybe not by myself since the crowd seems pretty young but with a friend or friends, you bet!
Great nachos!  I just had to emphasize that to you...and loaded with white cheese and not skimpy on the fajitas either.  Worth the $10 for sure!
