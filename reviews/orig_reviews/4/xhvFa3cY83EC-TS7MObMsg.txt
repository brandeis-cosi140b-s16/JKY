I keep coming back because the I simply love their tacos. I'm pescatarian (seafood only, no other meat), but I've shared meals here with vegetarians  and my dining guests always say they plan to come back. I love the veggie taco and the vegan option, and usually pair one of them with either a shrimp or mahi mahi. Always delicious (and, of course, the salsa bar if great!)
