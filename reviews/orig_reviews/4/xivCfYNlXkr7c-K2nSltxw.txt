My daughter-in-law and I ate there on the patio last night.  We wanted to try it because we're a fan of supporting locally owned and operated businesses. Of all things, I forgot to ask that question! Not knowing what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised.  Great SW style Mexican food.  Great Sangria and delicious chips and salsa.
Service was good until we got our food, then the water became sparse.  Other than that everything was pretty good.
We'll be going back!
