We swung by after happy hour on a Friday, and were surprised that it wasn't busy and we were able to sit right down.  We chowed on the chips and salsa, and our waitress was happy to fill us up again.   For dinner, I had another yummy black bean and cheese burrito!  Everyone seemed pleased with their food and I just love quaint little downtown Chander.  

Now if only they served Z'Teja's margaritas here....
