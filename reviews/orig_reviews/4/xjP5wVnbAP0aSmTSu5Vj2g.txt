They have some unusual food here.  I ordered a duck taco.  It was delicious.  The meat fell off the bone yet crispy on the outside.  However the portion is very small.  This goes for all of the plates.  One duck leg, 3 small corn tortillas, 3 slices of avocado.  The best part is the dessert.  We ordered the dark chocolate bread pudding and blonde brownie.  Awesome sin food.
