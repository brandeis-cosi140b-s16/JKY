i recently stopped by for lunch with a group from work. i'm upping the star rating to 4 for three reasons:

1. the sign restricting firearms on the door. i like dining without guns. 
2. service was really, really good. when 1 server can handle a table of 16 and make it look easy i'm impressed.
3. my jerk chicken salad was really, really good.
