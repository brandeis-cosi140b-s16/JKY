Had "happy hour" appetizers and drinks with friends.  Great staff!  We each bough a different appetizer (6 in all), so we could sample the various items.  Really good chips (thin and crispy) and salsa, and the chicken quesidilla was very good.  Margaritas were good.  Can't remember everything else, but we were all satisfied.  Very upscale place inside.  Would return if in the area again.
