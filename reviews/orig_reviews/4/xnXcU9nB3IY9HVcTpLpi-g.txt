On my first trip to AZ family brought us to Abuelo's so I am partial because of the memory of good times. There is one in Myrtle Beach we go to when we are in that area as well. Since I was back in AZ had to go to Abuelo's and grab some lunch. Ended up there at the odd time of too late for lunch, too early for dinner so they were not very busy. Our server, wish I remembered his name, was EXCELLENT. He brought us the normal salsa, then offered the habanero salsa.... gave great recommendations on dishes to order and when decided he had great suggestions on how to "customize" them. BF had the taco and enchilada plate, beef crunchy taco and chicken enchilada with the spinach cheesy thing and the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are excellent, the spinach cheesy thing excellent.. mix the two and it is beyond yum. Beef was well seasoned and chicken nice and tender. I opted for the 2 enchilada plate with one chicken one shredded beef. Server recommended the velveeta cheese on the beef which I opted for but ended up scraping off.. the flavor of the "cheese" overwhelmed the beef. The beef was nice and tender, well seasoned and the chicken was the same. I had the cilantro rice and black beans. The black beans were well seasoned and delish, I could have eaten a huuuuuuuuge bowl.
