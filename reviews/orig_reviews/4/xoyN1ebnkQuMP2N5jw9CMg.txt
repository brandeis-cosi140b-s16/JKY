This place is great for ambiance food and service. The adovada is hot but wonderful and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing. Its a dark cave on the inside and waterfalls on the outside... wonderful for a date or a family gathering. Just make sure you like food a little spicy :). Would have been full 5 stars, but the price is a hair high for what you get. However, the place is always busy, so I guess it may be priced right for the area....
