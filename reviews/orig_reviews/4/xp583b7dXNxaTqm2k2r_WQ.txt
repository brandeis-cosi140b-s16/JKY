The last two times I went to Macayos I had the Sonoran Beach Chicken Tacos. ( I love them) They appear plain but the sauce really makes them stand out ..I think it's made out of cilantro and ranch. They serve it with beans and rice but I always pass on the beans. It's filling and not bad for $9.99. The service is always accommodating especially last Monday our server was awesome. She really went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed!
