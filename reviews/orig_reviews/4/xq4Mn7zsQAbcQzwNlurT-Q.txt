Delicious New Mexican cuisine! They don't do mild. 

The staff is friendly and will keep you glass full, but beware that it's not the quickest service. This is definately a place to go and unwind and take your time eating.

Food- I've never had anything I didn't like here. The adovada ribs are great and ridiculously hot. But my personal fav, is the spicy guacamole, made fresh and guaranteed to make you sweat. The red chili burro enchilada style another hit out of the ballpark. They used to have a great green chili stew, but sadly it's was a limited time menu item.
