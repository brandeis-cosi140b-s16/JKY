Great customer service.  It was my first time, so they let me try samples of the meat.  I ordered the kalua pig bowl, which was pretty good but too salty for my taste.  Next time I will order the steak and try the burrito.  If you check in on yelp, you can try a sample of their bark.  They didn't have samples at that time, so they gave me a box!
