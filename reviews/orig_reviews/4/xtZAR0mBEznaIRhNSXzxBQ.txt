I enjoyed what they call their "Arizona Burrito". The (smallish) burrito is filled with an amazing mix of tender pork and cheese covered lightly with flavorful sauce. I opted for the garden salad side and it was a very good accompaniment. 
My wife had the skirt steak street tacos and she loved them. She grades her street tacos on a tough curve.
Order coffee and it comes to the table in a large french press.
We chose Barrio Cafe only because we were very hungry on a recent layover and they  had open seats. Turned out alright. 
Unlike many of the reviews below we experienced prompt and polite service.
*I knocked off a star because a burrito should not cost $13.50 no matter how good it is.
