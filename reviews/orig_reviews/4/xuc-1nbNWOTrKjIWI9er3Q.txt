We went here orig. on a Sunday a.m. and had the menudo, yum. It was way better than the Roberto's Tacos menudo which was full of fat more than meat or hominy. Yuck. My bf ordered a beef taco plate but was so covered in onions (if u like that sort of thing) This chips and salsa are pretty good, not a big fan of the flavor of the beans that came on the side. The nxt time we went I had the menudo again and my bf had the #2, which the beef enchilada was the best, followed by the tamale and the taco was in last place. They had a singer there and he made the ambiance feel so authentic, almost felt like I was back in San Antonio at the Mercado/ Market square.  Its the only place Ive gone to in LV that was playing mexican music! I loved the feeling this place gives you and the staff is super accomodating and makes sure you always have enough beverage, chips, tortillas, etc.  They also had great breakfast specials from 8-11 am. Sadly though we arrived at 11:01 so maybe next time!  
ooh and they also had a book of mixed drinks that make the mouth water. but.. I had a lot of errands to run that day so maybe another time.
