I've been here about 5 times and I'm finally going to yelp it! This place is one of my favorite spots to relax. On a Friday, I want to go out to a trendy spot with fresh food! This is the place. In this part of town you can't be sub-par. And Joyride meets the mark! The atmosphere is warm and easy. The staff all have smiles on their faces and everyone seems to be having a great time working. Food is great; despite previous reviews, I never had a bland bite. My shrimp taco had two pieces of over cooked shrimp and the third piece was perfect. Consistency would have been reviewed with 5 stars... I'm still in love with Joyride! In fact, I can't wait to get back!
