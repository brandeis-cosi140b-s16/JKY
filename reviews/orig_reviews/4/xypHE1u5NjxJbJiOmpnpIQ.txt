In town from New Hampshire where they are short on authentic Mexican restaurants. My wife and I pushed our way into this tiny place and found seats at the counter. The guacamole was terrific and came in handy later. She played it safe and had a taco, I gambled on the Torta Ahogada with chorizo which the woman behind the counter described as VERY spicy. It was. My eyes were watering before I had eaten a forkful and my lips are still burning. But it was so worth it--like a super hot Mexican French Dip. Only their heavenly guacamole could ease the heat. The two meals with soft drinks and tip came to $25. Yeah. $25. Wow!
