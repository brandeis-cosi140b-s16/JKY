I'd been wanting to try this place upon my last trip to Vegas. Went here for lunch and had some of the best fajitas I've ever tasted. My friend ordered the Carne Asada and, that too, was great. Had a mango margarita to wash it down, which was very strong, but flavorful. Service was alright. Outside and inside decor is pretty cool. Wish we would have come back here for drinks at night- they have a spinning wheel that decides the drink specials of the night which I very much wanted to give a try.
