Food is a little pricey, but overall yummi. i got an enchilada plate. They give you chips and beans before your food and they give you more if you ask. My plate came with noodle soup (fideo) could be more Mex style if they add cream and avocado. They have music. It was a little crowded for dinner but a must for birthdays let them know and they sing Marachi and they put a hat on you and force a tequila drink on you!
