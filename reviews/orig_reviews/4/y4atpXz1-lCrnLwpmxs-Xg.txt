Don't let the name fool you.  This is not a barbecue joint from Texas.  They have a great variety of specials that are very unique.  I had the shrimp tamale and a Paloma Fresca"tequila with fresh grapefruit" great flavor and just the right kick! We had the chips and salsa, fresh guacamole and salsa would be enough to make a grown man cry with joy!
