I've driven by plenty of times and decided to try it for lunch today with my mom. The place with clean and the girl who took my order was very pleasant. We ordered take out but while waiting I did see the chips they serve and they are made fresh which I thought was great. Nice to know they are not made hours prior sitting in some warmer.

I ordered the pork carnitas burrito and my mom ordered the pork green chile. I have to admit that my burrito had some over cooked chunks of pork which made it a bit dry. Not a deal breaker for me. I just had to throw some salsa on it. I took a couple of bites of my mom's pork green chile and I really liked that. The green chile wasn't overpowering and gave it just the right amount of flavor. The beans and rice they add to the burritos was good.

I would definitely go back but probably wouldn't order the carnitas again. I would love to try the shrimp burrito.
