Pretty small place in a slightly odd looking neighborhood, we werent sure if we even found the right place to begin with since we were new. However the interior is nice and cozy, but tightly spaced so I can imagine it being crowded and full. Service was a tad slow, and they served bread which was a bit of an odd choice, but the dip was good. The food itself was quite good. The Pollo Poblano was very flavorful and quite unique, we did see another table enjoy the Chiles En Nogada  as well. 

There arent many veggie options though which is a bit of a bummer, the Chiles Con Queso sounds more interesting than it was in person as it was a tad too simplified. However the flavors were there and it was still a good meal. Overall, definitely worth a stop to taste something a bit different in Mexican cuisine with bold and strong flavors. Just wish the service was quicker and the overall balance of the meal was better and they had more veggie options.
