Nice decor and atmosphere. Love the Latin music and unique menu. Tried the carnitas verde appetizer and guacamole, both were very flavorful and the chips were fresh and thick. Jalapeño margarita was so good they make their own jalapeño tequila. 
Tip ask for the hot salsa if you like spice and flavor. It was so good. The first salsa brought it couldn't touch it. 
Will be back for taco Tuesday. 

We took home menudo. I must say most of the customers who are going to order menudo are going to be Mexican.  It can be an acquired taste. We were disappointed. Very little tripe, not very spicy but did have a cinnamon flavor. It's ok guys ramp up the spice on this one. Just like My abuelita.
