My husband had never been to the canal shops at the Venetian so we decided to check it out.  After walking around a bit, we decided to try out Taqueria Canonita.  We saw some empty tables directly on the canal and asked the hostess to seat us there.  She says that she has to check and walks off.  When she returns, she asks if we have a reservation.  We did not!  She tells my husband that he should have made a reservation to get a seat outside.  I pointed out the empty tables and she decided to give us one of those tables with hesitation.  Part of me wanted to leave but knowing that my husband was looking forward to it, I didn't say what was on my mind.

Our waitress Catalin, came to our table as we sat.  She told us that the margarita was great so we decided to try it.  It really was great!

We ordered...
Guacamole - GREAT!!!
Cabo Ahi - delicious!  Will be back for this again.
Wild Mushroom Enchiladas - delicious!

Everything we had was delicious.  Our waitress, Catalin was amazing!

It was lovely listening to the singers on the gondolas.  It's a very romantic place for dates.

Aside from the hostess with the bad attitude, it was a great experience.
