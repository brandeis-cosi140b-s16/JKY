This place is right by my mom's house so we go regularly. Go for lunch if you don't want to wait for a table.the staff is always really nice. Never a long wait for the food to arrive. This place is just good cheap Mexican food! The pork tamales are a must! The sopapillas are a great desert! I love the street Tacos..everything I try here is awesome! The yummy salsa and bean dip are complimentary with any order of food:)
