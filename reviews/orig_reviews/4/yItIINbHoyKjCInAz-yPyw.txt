Okay, I've never made it over to Barrio Cafe, so I can't make a comparison.  But this place stands out on it's own.  I had the Arizona Burrito which was filled with pork and not too many toppings.  The highlight was a side order of the Barrio Papas that had the corn, goat cheese, salsa, etc.  That easily could have been my meal and I would have been happy with that.  Barrio Queen's Mexican food is good high end food, but let's not forget, low end taco shops have very good Mexican food too.
