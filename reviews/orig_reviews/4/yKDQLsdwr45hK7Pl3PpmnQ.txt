Was is good.. Yes
Did it blow me away.. No

I arrived here about 4:45pm Monday evening. It was me and the photographer for AZ Republic. 

I look over the menu and the salsa bar and man did it look good. I was hoping there was a sample platter or something but the best I could come up with was the 2 Taco meal. 

I opted for the Chicken and the pork, one of each. 

What I liked: 
-Chips with out having to order them separate.  
-Tacos full of meat. 
-Staff was nice
-Rice and Beans were good. 
-The salsa bar...way cool

Meh:  
-Corn shell was overcooked on 1/2 (one side)
-meat was boring without salsa, good thing there is like 20 to choose. 


It seems like the upscaled two hippies and it worked! 3.5 out of 4
