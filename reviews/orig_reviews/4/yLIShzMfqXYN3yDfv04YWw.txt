On our recent trip to Vegas I researched different restaurants to try - turns out that Dos Caminos AND Isla have closed. We knew we'd be in the Cosmo for the Secret Pizza (that's another review) and I wanted to try China Poblano after reading the menu on the Cosmo website. What I DIDN'T do is check the Yelp! reviews, and I'm glad I didn't. What we experienced was so far different from most reviews that I've just read!
OK look - when you're on vacation, you tend to spend money. $15 drinks are the going price at upscale hotels. And the "salt air margarita" (I just HAD to try one) was worth every cent!  I have no idea how they do it - the salt cloud that floats on the surface of the drink stays there as you drink, so with every sip you get a piece of salt heaven. 
The wait staff were friendly and efficient. The manager, Iñigo, even stopped by to chat with K'ayum (age 8) and watched him do his latest magic trick.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo. It came with fresh-made tortillas and was excellent. Adriana got a carnitas taco and she was thrilled with the chicharrón topping. I had a fish taco which was fantastic, and K'ayum had some noodles which he devoured (and he's a picky eater!). 
The drinks were what really got me excited. After the "salt air margarita" I had another specialty called a "Mexican gin and tonic." It's made with cilantro, elderflower liqueur, and I don't know what else, but it worked. For dessert I had a tequila flight that came with house-made sangrita that was sublime!  I wish I had a bottle of their sangrita for sipping tequila here at home!
Anyway, it's a week later and we're still talking about our experience. We loved the decor, the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. We'll be back!
