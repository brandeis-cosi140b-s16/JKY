I like this place. Inside and out are very simple with no thrills. As you enter you will see a nice selection of items on their menu attached to the wall. Step up to the counter and ordered then sit back and wait for a delicious and inexpensive meal.

Service was very friendly. The owner that works up front has a dark beard and is very tall with several tattoos. He almost looks intimidating at first but is so polite and very helpful. It was very important to him that I was enjoying their food and he ask me a couple times if everything was alright or if I needed anything. Nice!

First time here so I ordered an assortment of tacos and a Hot dog Oaxacan style. Had a Chorizo, Tripa, Al Pastor and a Fish Taco. They come with a couple types of Salsa and a side of Grilled Onions and a Roasted Serrano Pepper. The tacos are small but packed with flavor. They also serve Burritos, Quesadillas, Tostadas, and several other authentic dishes from the region such as the Tlayuda which is a toasted tortilla with all sorts of yummy items on top.

Place can get really busy during peek eating hours and the seating area is a little tight. Seen a few people getting items to go. Recommend trying everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back. Delicioso!
