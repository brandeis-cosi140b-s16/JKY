I've been frequenting this place with my family since I was a kid and they used to be located in a hole in the wall on Flamingo and Jones. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that I went last week and they have seriously raised their prices. The food is always great. I am addicted to their beef tacos and anything covered in their enchilada sauce. Their chips, salsa and beans are always yummy too. My mom loves and hihgly suggests the green chile pork burrito, which I also think is very good and flavorful, but I would rather stick with enchilada sauce. If they would lower their prices back down some, they would easily get that 5th star back.
