We go here about once a week. Love the Pollo Fundito and Carne Asado Relleno ... oh! and of course the frozen house margaritas. There aren't many good Mexican restaurants in this part of town, and I'd say this is one of the best up here. The ambiance, with the pond and trees, make it very nice as well.
