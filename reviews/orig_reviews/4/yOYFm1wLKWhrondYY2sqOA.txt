I was recently in Vegas for a wedding and the groom's parents generously treated the wedding party and family members to a reception here.  The weather was PERFECT and we were up on the rooftop deck for the night.   The patio was nice with an ample amount of chairs and tables for sitting and mingling.  On the opposite side of the bar is a stage where bands can play.

I stuck with beer for the whole weekend and here, they served Negro Modelo in the bottle (along with other beers, of course).   I only had a wedge of the Mexican pizza appetizer and it was damn good.  I highly recommend ordering that.

The servers were great.  Very friendly and attentive (and attractive, but duh...it is Vegas).  Based on the ambiance and service, this place is awesome and I would come back here again.
