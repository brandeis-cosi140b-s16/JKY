This was pretty good fare.  I had a stewed lamb dish.  Unlike any Mexican I have ever had.  Come to think of it, I've never had lamb at a Mexican restaurant, or in Mexico.  Everyone I was with enjoyed what they got.  Most had Mole, one had a steak.

The tappas we had at first were a good sampling, even if they were foisted upon us.  I went with a big group.  The waitress was pushy, that was the only negative.  She basically told us this is what we were getting for appetizers, a sample tray, and we were getting 3 for the table.  We really had no input.

They did not have a liquor license, but I can't dock any stars for that if they let you BYOB and no one advertised it for its drinks.  Although I must tell you that bar tender looked pretty lonely at his empty bar polishing his glasses all night.  I was told the liquor license thing is an on again off again thing for them.  They insisted on pouring the wine we brought in, even though no one there could tell a Chardonnay from a Pinot Noir.
