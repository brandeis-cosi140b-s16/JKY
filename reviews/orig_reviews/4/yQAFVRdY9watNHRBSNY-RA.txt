Since I started at my new office in November, I have been exploring all the new restaurants in my area.  When I realized that Sylvia's was close by, I decided to try it out one day.  I had not been to Sylvia's in about 8 years, and that experience was take-out that had to survive all the way back to Tempe (but it did!).  So I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was that it is no longer an order at the counter restaurant, it is full-service.  I was a bit bummed about that, because at lunch, I would much rather grab food and go, but I guess I would just have to deal.

I got the green chile beef burro lunch special, beans only...and OMG it was AMAZING!  The beef was tender, the sauce was thick and the flavor was just right.  The burrito was huge, so I had leftovers that made up my dinner!  They also have excellent chips and salsa, with both corn and flour tortilla chips....the flour ones are so good!  The salsa is thick and chunky, and the hot sauce has just enough bite.

I have been to Sylvia's a handful of times over the last couple of month's, and my only gripe is that when you order take-out, you don't get chips and salsa...how rude!
