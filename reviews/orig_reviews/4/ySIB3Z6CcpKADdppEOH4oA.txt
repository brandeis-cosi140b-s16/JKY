Our first visit was a couple of weeks ago. My boyfriend is quite picky when it comes to food and I am always on the hunt for a great street taco. We both enjoyed the Urban Street Tacos. We tried one of each (made our own sample plate) My boyfriends favorite was the octopus asada, mine was the braised pork. We enjoyed the warm, salty chips after our tacos to finish the awesome salsas we tried. All were great! Margarita were a little weak, but that is an easy fix. ;-) We will be back!
