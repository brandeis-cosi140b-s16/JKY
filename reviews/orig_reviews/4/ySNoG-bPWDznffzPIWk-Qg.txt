I was in here with my sister a couple of weeks ago, we were looking for someplace we hadn't tried, and this really hit the spot.  You get two different types of salsa, one warm with blended beans in the background (but still very clearly a salsa and not a bean dip) and the other fresh and cool to start, both of which were good although I preferred the warm dip.  My sister got the shrimp flautas and she really liked them, I didn't try them as I am not a fan of shrimp and cheese generally (alfredo sauce not withstanding).  I got the trio of enchilads with mole, ranchera spinach, and Veracruz.  The ranchera spinach was fresh tasting, but didn't have too much flavor; the mole was good, but the sauce needed to simmer longer to help smooth out the flavors, and the Veracruz style with a tomatillo sauce and cotija cheese was excellent, with gooey cheese and nice chunks of chicken and plenty of spinach, all rolled in what seemed to be a housemade fresh corn tortilla: all this, plus soft drinks and 20+ percent tip for only $18 a piece: can't be beat for the price in the area!

Only minor detraction was our waitress, while properly attentive, did not really speak English and was somehow unable to split the bill into 2 equal checks
