These street style tacos are delicious! The pastor with pineapple and carne asada w/ guac and handmade tortillas are my favorite. They have a little bar area and a set up for a lounge type at night, but I have only been there for lunch. The setup is a bit confusing since you have to go to different stations depending on what type of taco you want, but the staff is helpful. I think tuesdays they have taco specials.
