Holy hangover, how good is this place?! My girlfriends and I came here for lunch after a long typical Las Vegas evening of good clean fun and and we stumbled upon Border Grill while we were, errr, stumbling through the Forum Shops. Yummy, authentic Mexican food sounded like just the cure for...our good clean fun. 

But I digress. 

We shared a few dishes to start. The queso fundido was incredible and cheeeeeeesy. I could put that on anything. We also shared the ceviche which was super fresh and tasty. 

I ordered the crispy potato rajas and let everyone try a little bit. This was hands down the best main dish. Paired it with the blood orange lemonade and you have yourself a meal.

The ambiance was super cute and I love the decor. Good meal for groups and casual while still keeping it somewhat classy. I need a Border Grill in the NYC area asap please!!!
