I'm not claiming that Toros has the best tapas in town, but they are good enough for me to come back.  I've been here just twice and I'm a fan. 

Here's what you get at Toros...
-Smoke Free
-TV Screens (a lot of them and perfect for the game)
-Great Service
-Spacious Joint
-Inexpensive mini dishes (i.e. tapas)
-Happy Hour Specials (look for the red star on the menu)
-New Establishment
-Not too busy

Tapas (My Rankings):
-Oxtail:  My goodness, this is good..ness.  It's a bit rich, but nothing beat their fall off the bone oxtail.  Perfect with rice. 

-Asparagus:  Grilled to perfection. I think I can eat two orders on my own.  

-Bacon Wrapped Dates:  Pretty good.  Not sure what was better, the bacon or the dates.  Regardless, still tasty.  

-Meatballs:  Not the best that I've had, but a good addition if you're looking to add some meat to your diet.  My opinion, the sauce was a little runny. 

There's a lot more that I've tried and a lot more on their menu that I haven't tried.  For now, it's their oxtail and asparagus that keeps me wanting more. Thumbs up for price, value, and selection.
