The largest tequila selection in Phoenix puts this place high on the list of my favorite North Central Phoenix mexican food spots. It is awesomely tacky, and the crowd at Via Delosantos is always ready to have a good time. Of course, it's hard NOT to have a good time when they have great margaritas for 99 cents at Happy Hour. 

The food is good, the service is good, but the drinks and drink specials are (*) great. (expletive deleted)
