So, yeah, it's really good Carna Asada, but don't forget the shrimp ceviche on Fri/Sat, as well.

I just had some for lunch (along with a couple of CA tacos) (great online ordering, btw) and I am seriously thinking about stopping by for happy hour on the way home so I can have some more along with an icy cold beer!  Mmmm, so good.

So glad they opened in Melrose!
