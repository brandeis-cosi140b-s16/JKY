Now I love my burgers and LOVE having an option to decide how I would like it cooked. If im not given an option I am already bummed out by that time when they go straight to the amount you owe or what toppings you would like instead.  Its not that I wont eat a burger like the ones here because obviously they are good.  But getting burgers that are smashed and thin and such is just depressing to me. Its like going to an upscale mcdonalds. I am all about deals and here for the price you pay I would rather go down the street to grab a full size burger medium rare with a over easy egg on top. Now thats my cup of tea per se.  My boyfriend loves this place and i enjoy it as well. Its just not on the top of my list at first to go to... its more of like oh...okay. sure...whatever. Its good but not my favorite at all.
