Great central Mexico food. I had the shrimps tacos which are flat out flavor. I have had many dishes here and all are good. Keep in mind, this is not a typical Mexican joint. It is higher in price and unique flavors. 

Drawback is the chips and salsa, good, just not what I crave. 

Plus is a very cool vibe and amazing flavors. Also, great margs.
