Now open for lunch!

Previously I had only been here to meet friends for happy hour, and they have an EXCELLENT tequila selection.  They have expanded the patio just in time to take advantage of our gorgeous weather. 

I got the Pibil pork tacos served with a habanero mango salsa, they were sweet, spicy and delicious. Three to an order for eight bucks, and it was the perfect amount of food. I was in and out in under 40 minutes. I think this may be a new "go to" spot for lunch.
