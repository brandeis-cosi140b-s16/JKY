I lived in Phx for my 1st 18yrs and I had never been here!! 
I brought my family with me and my aunt and grandma and my grandma had never been here and she usually knows about all these places. 
Very cool place. 
I got the El Pollo Fundido and the prickly pear margarita. 
the margarita didn't have much flavor difference then a regular one so I would try a different drink next time.
The fundido was great and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The flour chips are really different and good also. 
Will be back!
