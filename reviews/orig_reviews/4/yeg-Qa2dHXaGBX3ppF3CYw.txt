Fairly typical Mexican Restaurant, went sort of late on a Tuesday and there were few other customers so things were quiet. Chips were warm and the salsa was good although a bit on the tame side, it could have had a little more heat to it. Good size portions and my enchiladas were very good along with the rice and beans. I didn't try the tamales but plan to when I go back. If you are in the area and hungry deffeinately worth a shot.
