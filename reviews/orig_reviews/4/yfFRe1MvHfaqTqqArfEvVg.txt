I would really give 3.5 stars but decided to be generous with 4. We went on a weeknight and were seated right away. Place has trivia to play on your phone so my boyfriend loved that and it was fun to play a game while eating/drinking. Our servers were pleasant and nice, chips and salsas came out right away. Love the chips and salsa, as well as the homemade bean dip! I could eat an insane amount of these! 

The menu has a lot of options to choose and I went with the chicken fajitas. Food came out quick and was hot! I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning that was cooked with the fajitas, a little spicy for my taste. Rice and beans were delicious, too bad they charge an extra $1.25 for sour cream and guacamole. The margarita was also really good but $10. 

I haven't been on taco Tuesday but am interested in checking it out!
