HOLY MASSIVE BURRITO.

This thing was a monster.  When i got it i'm thinking something comparable to like robertos burritos.  Big but manageable. but this place holy moly hahaha I'm 6'9" and a husky guy.  This burrito is 2 meals for me.  So if you're an average person... Expect a mexican thanksgiving meal.

I had a combo burrito with veggies and chicken in it and it was pretty good.  The staff was very friendly.  And what was refreshing is that even though i'm new they didnt give me the "please hurry up and order attitude" The lady was just real courteous and kind of gave me that "let me help ya out" mom feel.  Also ordered smothered fries (a meal in itself unknowingly) and i'll admit i like it more than Roberto's carne asada fries.  

I like this place a lot and when i want some comfort mexican food... I'm definitly going to return business here.
