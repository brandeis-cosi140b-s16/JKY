I give props to the food. Everything is delicious. My only qualm is I wish you got more food for the price. I'm sure the quality of the ingredients is exceptional, but I like being full after my meal and not having to shell out another $7 per person to leave with a full tummy. Like that one commercial - " it's like elf food..."
