Sam Fox ...don't ever let me down with your restaurants. If you do, I might have to move away from Phoenix to get over the pain. Blanco is practically in my backyard and anything with "tequila" in the headline perks my ears, so I had to check them out. The set up looked cool enough, but would the food be worthy of the authentic Mexican cuisine surrounding our little desert land on the boarder of Mexico? Start lining up because I think they did it! Blanco is nice because it's a good mix of trendy American cuisine with the spicy Mexican kick to it. 

Happy Hour. My very happiest hour of them all and Blanco keeps me smiling. Half off my friends. Half off... appetizers, cheese crisps... the mouth watering margs...all half off during the Happy Hour times. 

Atmosphere: Trendy and sophisticated but get there EARLY. A Fox Restaurant underline means crowds and popularity like the homecoming court so if you want a seat arrive early and if you are coming with a large party, call ahead. 

Food. A-OK! I seem to always go the appetizer direction (probably because I'm there for HH) when I go but they fill you up enough for a meal. The guac is homemade and tasty, the queso is great and the cheese crisps melt in your mouth. I'd also try out the tacos. If you're there with a couple people who cater to your taste buds, order a bunch of food and share, then you'll get the full Blanco experience. 

Large groups. My friend is getting married and the bach location is Scottsdale. Watch out Phoenicians! I am working with the events office on a large group prefixed menu. So far, the service has been excellent and the pricing is completely reasonable for a hefty amount of food...and Sangria! I'll report back after the dinner occurs. In the meantime, Happy Hour, here I come!
