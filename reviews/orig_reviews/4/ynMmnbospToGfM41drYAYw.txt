I love this place. Here are some of the finer points of this establishment. The food is great. Every single entree that i have tried has been fantastic. I am personally a huge fan of their black bean tostadas. Unfortunately, these are only available on the weekends, though. The place itself is VERY casual, but who cares. The food speaks for itself. Also, the staff was always nothing but helpful and friendly when I lived in the area. We were on a first name business for some time. 

A few of the drawbacks for me was the location. It was a bit of a hike for myself, but worth it. Also, I no longer eat chicken, beef or pork, so my options are quite limited. There is not a bountiful selection for vegetarians. However, the beans are fantastic.
