I absolutely love Mexican food! 

There are reasons they won't get a 5 star that I won't go into. I had a carne asada burrito it came with rice and beans. The food was great, the service excellent, and the price was a bit much at 15 for lunch.

I thought there would be more food for the price. We didn't have any problems and they were able to keep up with us with the drinks. We drank like camels, 3-4 glasses each  even when it got busy. 

I look forward to the next visit!
