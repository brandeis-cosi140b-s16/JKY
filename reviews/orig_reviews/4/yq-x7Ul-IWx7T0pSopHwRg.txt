After hearing all the hype about Taqueria Guadalajara my boyfriend and I finally decided to go. It definitely did not disappoint, I would say it is by far the best Mexican food I have had in Madison. I got a pork sopes and a pork guardita. I liked the sopes better all around as the flavors were fresher (had lettuce and tomatoes). However the pork inside the guardita was to die for great flavor but very greasy. Not food I would eat on a regular basis but great to cure that Mexican craving.
