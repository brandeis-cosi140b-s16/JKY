After reading other people's reviews I wasn't sure what to expect.  I found the food to be fairly good.  The guacamole was great, their ceviche was a bit different than I am used to, but tasty.  My mom had lime shrimp tacos and was vey pleased, and my chimi was pretty good.  Atmosphere was great too!
