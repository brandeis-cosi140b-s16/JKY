I came here last night for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised... I am not a fan of Mexican food and had frequented the Firefly that was previously here so I was not quite sure to expect. 

They have a decent happy hour menu - $5 dollar house margaritas (and they didn't skimp on booze). I was happy with the food on the happy hour menu as it wasn't all carbs. I had the ceviche and I have no complaints. The grilled corn tempted me too.

I don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread/weird butter at Firefly)

I would go back.. and I know my friends definitely will (they live much closer).
