I'll preface this review by saying I did not eat here, just discovered an amazing Margarita! 
I'm a tequila girl and love a good Margarita but I guess I'm spoiled coming from Miami because I couldn't find a decent "spicy" Margarita while in Vegas... That is until Javier's!  I walked in and asked the bar tender and he made me what I think they call The Jalape√±o. Wow! It definitely had the right amount of kick for this gal! Friendly bar staff, nice ambience and the food looked and smelled great (I had already had dinner or I would have definitely dined there). If you're looking for a great margarita in Vegas, look no more!
