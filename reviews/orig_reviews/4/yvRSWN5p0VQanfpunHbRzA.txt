Great Al Pastor tacos :)   After trying multiple things on the menu, my family and I have pretty much settled on these!  The pork is tender and spicy, and the fresh pineapple cools off everything perfectly!  It's nice also to be able to sit inside a nice, clean environment and eat great Mexican street food.  Highly recommend this place!
