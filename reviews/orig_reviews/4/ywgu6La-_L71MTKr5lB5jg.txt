I came to a taco place and ordered a burrito, which is typical of me to do. It had steak, eggs, potatoes, cheese and pico in it. Now as awesome as this combination may seem, the waitress suggested some jalape√±o bacon, to which I replied, "Heck yes!" Now, I'm no engineer, but I'm sure they just made a time machine, in a form of a burrito. It was awesome and very filling (And I weigh 240 #'s). The atmosphere is nice, but I didn't pay much attention; that burrito was delish. We will be back.
