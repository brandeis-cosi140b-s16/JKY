I heard about this place and had to try it when I was in town visiting friends.  Was suprised to see so many horrible reviews.  We had no problem with timing or service and the nachos were amazing!  Now, I love nachos, so that is a big part of liking this place.  I thought the staff was super-friendly and it was a good place to get a beer and some yummy nachos.
