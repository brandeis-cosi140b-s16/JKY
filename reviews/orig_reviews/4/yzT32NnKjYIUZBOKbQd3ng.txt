Even though I'm Korean, my BF has a bigger love for Korean food than I do. (And he's Vietnamese)

With that being said, he literally woke me up from my post-drunken slumber to eat some Korean/Mexican fusion for lunch. At first, I was really dreading the drive to god knows where just to eat some lunch when I could have just ordered room service and or just make the trip downstairs. But nooooo, the BF HAD to eat here for lunch!

I was kind of in a grumpy mood by the time we arrived here because we drove a good 10 minutes outside the strip to some little hole in the wall joint.  Normally, I don't mind a good hole in the wall but I think I was still drunk and super hung over. The owners are Korean and they are very kind. They're English is very fluent but I still decided to speak to them in Korean which they really appreciated and liked. They moved fast which I really liked and the owner moves in the speed of light cleaning the tables, taking orders, and delivering food. Pretty good service!

We received the menu and we ordered the musubis, tacos, and bulgogi fries. OMG. When the bulgogi fries arrived, I was in awe.  There was SO much stuff on it I just didn't even know where to begin. I dug right in and the flavors were very good! Surprisingly good! I really liked the mix of bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and the fries.  It was a first for me actually to eat bulgogi fries! I've had carne asada fries and adoba fries but no bulgogi fries! Supeerrrr good! A must get if you come!

The tacos and musubis were also delicious! The restaurant does a great job of keeping the authentic Korean flavor while putting the Mexican twist using the typical Korean ingredients. I really enjoyed eating here for lunch.  My grumpiness quickly turned into happiness because I got myself a bomb.com lunch. (:
