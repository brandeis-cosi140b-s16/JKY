The menu is fairly diverse. Most of my friends ordered some Mexican dishes but of course, I would be the strange person to order pasta. 

The mojitos here were fresh, light & delicious. 

Average entree is around $12-15.

It's only valet parking, but inside it's great for big groups. This location is right in the heart of downtown Tempe.
