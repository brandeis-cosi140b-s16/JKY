First time to Z'Tejas. I've heard a bit about it, and one of my co-workers also works here. I honestly thought it was like a fancy Chipotle. 

Really nice place, with valet (+). We got in and were quickly seated. My friend had eaten there once before, so he took the lead. We got a Corona (him) and a Midori 'tini (me) to start. Drinks are a little up there (my cocktail was $8) but let's say I was splurging. 

To start, we got the Tejas Trio (salsa, guac, and queso), as well as these guacamole, shrimp, whatever. I'm not a fan of shrimp or quac, but I gave it a try and I have to say it was a little tasty. The queso was also really good, the salsa and quac average. 

For our meals, he got the barbacoa, and I got the chicken enchiladas. My dish was really good, my only complaint is that there was hella black beans and a small amount of rice. I would have preferred it the other way, but everything on the plate was good. 

I wouldn't come here on a whim with some of my friends, but it's a really nice special occasion place.
