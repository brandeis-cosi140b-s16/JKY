So I went back. I am super glad I did.

I had the spinach feta chimi and OH MY GOD so delicious that I actually was mmmmmmm-ing at the table. My friend actually pointed out that with every bite I took I did a little happy dance.

So good!!!

Stayed as far away from the margaritas and just stuck with H2O. I'll definitely go back for the food.
