Very far from where I live but since I was around the area, decided to try this place out because of it's insane amount of reviews. Considering the ratings, was a bit surprised at it's location and the ambience but you can't argue with good food and good value.

got the 4 tacos with the chicken and the bulgogi, an imported pepsi, and something like a burrito. It was a lot of food, tasty and very inexpensive so I understand the good ratings. Probably stop by if Im near the area.
