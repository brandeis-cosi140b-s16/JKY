Upon our arrival to the Hard Rock Hotel, we were told that our room would not be ready for quite some time, so we decided to grab a bite at the reasonably priced, Pink Taco.  The hostesses, who may just have been two of the skinniest late teenage girls I have ever seen, showed us to a relaxing table on the patio.  We sat and enjoyed the sun, while pining for our pending hotel room so that we could change for an afternoon at the pool.  

We got the Vegas party started with two huge glasses of their red wine sangria.  The sweet concoction was full of fresh fruit chunks from apples, pears, oranges, and more.  The alcohol was definitely present, but the drink went down as easily as juice.  (Or was that just because of our Vegas excitement?) 

Our meal was prefaced by a bowl of extra crunchy, salty tortilla chips with three different dipping salsas - one sweet red version, one spicy green type, and another unique blend of chili oil and avocado chunks.  Each sauce was full of fresh, ripe flavor.

My friend and I both ordered the tasty Vegetable Tostada Salad.  The platter consisted of three corn tortillas that were topped with soupy black beans, chilled sour cream and fresh guacamole.  These petite shells were then loaded up with shredded romaine, "Mexican vegetables", cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and onions that had all been tossed with spicy and sweet chipotle vinaigrette.  The salad was a refreshing welcome to the Southwest.

The service was also friendly, quick, and efficient.  

We enjoyed our fiesta so much that we went there again later on in our vacation and have even craved it since.  Pink Taco was a great lunch option that steered away from the pricey pretense of most other Vegas hot spots.
