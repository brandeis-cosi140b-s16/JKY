After reading Yelp reviews we choose Casa Ramos for our Mexican meal.  Curb appeal is OK, and once inside you are treated to a big room and full bar.  Staff quickly sat us, took our drink order and then our dinner order.  Food was sizzling hot when it arrived.  I had the beef and chicken fajitas.  They were excellent and plenty of food on the plate.  My wife had the chile relleno and was happy with her meal as well.  The staff was very friendly and on task.  Both the waitress and server checked more that once to see that our needs were met.  We both agreed we would eat there again.
