Gotta love it when fellow Foodies put together tweetups that involve food and drink, even better when that get together happens at a restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives that you've wanted to try out for ages.

Kirti Dwivedi and Susie Timm decided to gather tweeps at the grand opening of Los Taquitos' newest location on 16th and Glendale avenues in Mid-town Phoenix for a nosh and adult beverages. Thirty or so twitter and Facebook users responded to the tweetvite, showed up, queued up and got down to the business of eating.

First up a margarita made with Tres Agaves tequila and freshly squeezed Blood orange juice. I'm a big fan of the tangy sweetness of blood 
oranges and am glad to see them used in this upscale taqueria.

The much talked about 'Bombiero' burrito was served up as my entr√©e, full of slow cooked carnitas, pico de gallo, and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and bathed in Los Taquitos signature sweet and fiery 'Bombiero' sauce.

I found the pork to be perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, the pico fresh and vibrant but the sauce was a bit overpowering in it's sweetness. I was really looking for this sauce to have a much higher level of heat and spice, but over-all, sweet was the strongest note that I experienced. In my opinion, this sauce would be perfect if the sweetness was dialed down and the heat increased.

Other tweeps at my table enjoyed their carne asada tacos with rice and beans and we all munched on that taco shop staple, chips and salsa/guacamole. I'm looking forward to trying several other dishes including the tacos al pastor and am quite happy that Los Taquitos has opened up on my side of the valley.

If you fancy a bit of up-scale taqueria cuisine, get to one of Los Taquitos' locations and have a go at the menu, you'll certainly not be disappointed.
