Another ASU staple. The place is actually a lot of fun, especially with a group of people. The drinks flow in abundance and I had their nachos on my last trip. So good. They had the right amount of cheese and toppings on them. Everything looked so delicious. Dang, now I am getting hungry just thinking about the nachos.
