Went here for lunch with 3 coworkers recently. We were promptly seated and greeted and had our drinks within minutes. This is the second time I've had Velle Luna food. The first time was 

I ordered the combination place with enchilada, taco and, rice and beans. The meal was solid with the exception of the rice, which I thought was a bit dry. I didn't like the big onions in the enchilada, but that is a personal preference and at least I was able to take those out.

Overall, the service level was very good and the food in my opinion was also above average.

My coworkers ordered a variety of menu items and all enjoyed their meals, but couldn't finish them.

I would say that Valle Lune has some pretty solid food and would go back there without hesitation.
