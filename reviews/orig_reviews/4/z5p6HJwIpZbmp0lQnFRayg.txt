What a great restaurant.  The location could be better but the execution was perfect.  Very nice atmosphere with very friendly and fun staff.  

I arrived at the restaurant Sunday morning around 11am.  After a short review of the menu I decide to try there Sunday morning brunch.  Which was a reasonable deal considering it came with drinks.  The brunch bar itself is somewhat awkwardly setup in the bar area.  However it was still a nice presentation with a wide variety of options.  

Being a buffet I of curse had to have a taste of every option laid before me.  I was very pleased with everything.  All of the food seemed to be fresh and didn't have any signs of being attended for hours before I arrived.  The fresh made tortillas and margaritas are amazing.

One final note about there handling a birthdays.  This particular dining occasion was to celebrate a friends birthday.  After our meal the entire wait staff came over with a guitar and sang a birthday tone in Spanish.  They also treated the birthday boy to a shoot of tequila and some churrus with a candle in them.  It was very entertaining, on the restaurant, and no one in our group put them up to it.

Overall a very nice place to eat drink and be merry.
