Very good Mexican Restaurant with good service.  The place was clean and very cozy small restaurant.

First let me start with the salsa and chips.  They bring you a mild sauce which is very flavorful and fresh. The mild salsa gets 5 out of 5 stars...simply awesome.  However, I also tried their spicy salsa and have to say it was a disappointment. It tasted like Tapatio jar hot sauce mixed with peppers... 1 out of 5 stars.... My recommendation is to stick with mild sauce which is actually spicy enough.  

I ordered the beef enchiladas because this plate can always accurately measure the skill of the chefs in the kitchen.  The plate came with rice and beans and was good.  The meat was a little on the salty side, but the portions were great.  The rice was a little dry, but had really good flavor. The beans were sprinkled with cheese and were perfect.  The plate with two Dos Xx beers was about twenty dollars.  I would eat here again.
