This place has really good food for a good price, I go there to get lunch a couple times a week. I love their hard shell tacos with beef, the are delicious, way better than any other tacos I tasted. They have these marinated carrots that you can get for free, those are the bomb! I also love their green sauce. What I did not like was their shrimp burrito, it was just plain, but the breakfast one is good. Anyways, great place, great food, try it if you haven't already :)
