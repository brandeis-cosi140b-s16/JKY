Tasty. Unique. 

I drive by this location every day and noticed that PV Burger Company replaced 2 Hippies Beach House. I checked out the reviews and my husband and I decided to check it out.

I swear we walked in to a So Cal surfer dive bar. Kitschy decor and ska music blasting. The owner was running the counter and offered us suggestions on the menu. The menu is so ineresting! A variety of burgers, including a country fried one, a parmigiana, and a brioche. All can come with a portabella mushroom or chicken breast instead of hamburger. A few different sandwiches, including a 'pulled veggie' that I'm dying to try. And a bunch of yummy sides.

My husband ordered the brioche burger that includes a fried egg and bacon. I ordered cheese burger with portabella as a replacement. The burgers come with yummy thick cut homemade potato chips but we also ordered fries and sweet potato tots.

Everything was delicious! I love the quality of ingredients, because I believe when it comes to a burger place quality is everything. The brioche buns were delicious, my portabella was juicy and tasty, and my husband was in beef, pork, egg heaven. The fries and tots were good too. The owner let us sample the french toast fries which was quite evil of him because now I want them ALL the time!

The beverage situation was the only issue. They sell soda by the can. They also had fresh brewed iced tea which I enjoyed but I imagine the soda thing could be a bummer for soda drinkers. Would love to see them get a liquor license. If they sold beer (and played some Sunday NFL games) I might never leave!

So glad we found a delicious and reasonably priced funky local joint. I forsee PV Burger Co really taking off!
