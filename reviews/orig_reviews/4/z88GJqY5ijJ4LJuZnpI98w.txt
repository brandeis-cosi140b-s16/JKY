I've been going here since I was 3 or 4 with my parents. The menu has changed a bit over the years, but as long as Jade Red Chicken never goes, I can't complain :3 THEIR BLACK BEANS ARE WONDERFUL, get them!
One more thing, their cookies used to be better (I'm talking bout you, volcano cookie!). I tend to pass on them now, though maybe it's just a preference of how I like my cookies :/
