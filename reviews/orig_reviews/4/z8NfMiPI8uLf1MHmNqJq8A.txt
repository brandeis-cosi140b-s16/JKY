The enchiladas were AWESOME. However I had read some reviews that the portions were small for the price and that is correct. Basically after tax it is $7.50 for just 2 enchiladas and I would say it would take 3 enchiladas to be equal to a Chipotle burrito...maybe even 4. I just have a hard time spending $10-$11 for 2 enchiladas, chips and guac. So for me the food was really good but they need to make an order of enchiladas consist of 3 instead of 2 for the price they are charging.
