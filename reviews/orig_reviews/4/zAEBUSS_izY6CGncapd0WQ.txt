I would only come here for happy hour! Those 2 for 1 drink specials cannot be beat!! I had two Pacificos for $6 and an appetizer platter for $6.88! The platter was enough for two people since everything came in twos! Two skewers (one beef/one chicken), two sweet corn tamales, two taquitos/flautas filled with cheese, and two cheese quesadillas! They were all good except the chicken skewer and the corn tamales were a bit too sweet for me!
