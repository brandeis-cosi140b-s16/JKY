This place is good. I got a huarache with squash flowers the first time, and a chicken burrito the second. Both times the food was super fresh, and the base for the huarache was home-made I think. A friend mentioned that they forget to add salt...that might be what is missing? Also, I like really hot salsas and theirs are extremely mild. I would say the taco truck at Bradley and Prospect is my first favorite for Mexican food here, and Maize is my second favorite. Then maybe the Mexican grocery on Green is my third favorite.
