I just left this place. It was so weird to be the only customer on a Friday night.  I'm pretty sure they think they're running a club, based on the flashing lights and the DJ. Not sure why they need five employees to make one burrito, but that's not for me to say.

I ordered a chile relleno burrito aka "the fattifier". It was delicious. Could not have asked for better flavor.  If only they made their own tortillas.... My order was to go and they gave me a nice side of warm tortilla chips. Thanks! 

Service was a little weird. Not rude or bad, just odd to have a bunch of employees standing around watching me while I was waiting for my food.
