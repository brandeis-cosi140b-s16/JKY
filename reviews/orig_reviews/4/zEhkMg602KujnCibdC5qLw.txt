Definitely come for the atmosphere. I love the location and I LOVE the way they've redone the old church. Seriously it's so cool!
The beer list is short, but all local. The cocktails are fun and inventive (c'mon, how can you go wrong with one named 'these boots are made for oaxacan'???). 
I heeded the advice of previous reviews, and did not order anything to eat. But they did bring out free chips and salsa and they were delish!
Overall, a super cool place to drop by for a drink or two.
