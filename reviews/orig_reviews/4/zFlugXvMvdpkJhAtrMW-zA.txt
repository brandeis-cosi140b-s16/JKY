Food, 4 stars.
Chicken enchiladas. 4 stars. Great flavor. The runny beans would be my only suggestion for improvement.
Crunchy tacos. 4 stars. Hubby thought the ground beef was seasoned spectacularly. I didn't sample them... They're just tacos, right? (But he did say 'wow, the meat is seasoned well' on the first bite)-his rating was 4.5
Appetizer Dip trio. 3.5 stars. Chili queso is excellent. Superb even. Also loved the green chili sour cream. The roasted tomato salsa was mediocre. I like my salsa to pack a little more heat.

Service was 3.5-4 stars. Our waiter was on point, prompt with food but overloaded with tables. He couldn't keep pace & we waited to place order & for the change on the bill. 

Hostess... 3 stars. She could work interpersonal skills & body language. She seemed to work hard but 'appeared' not to enjoy her job.
