Update ... 
Sadly had my first bad experience here but only in regards to food temperature. Sadder still, this came on the day I reclaimed my Dukedom. 

Maybe it was because I got in for an early lunch and my wonderfully flavored, if under heated, Burrito Cancun was the first thing out of the cocina? Who knows, but tighten it up back there scullery wenches. Your Duke commands it! :-D
