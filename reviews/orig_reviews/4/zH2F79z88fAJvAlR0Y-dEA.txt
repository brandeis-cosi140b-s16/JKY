The food and service is always amazing. They have multiple "healthy options" like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice. I'm bumping off a star (although I wish I could give 4.5) for several small reasons. First, I feel the prices are a tad higher than reasonable--but just a tad as it it still pretty inexpensive. Second, the store is small so this is really best for takeout which might not always be everyone's preferred option. Otherwise, food is well portioned and I like many of the items they serve. They serve mainly popular versions of burritos like carne asada.
