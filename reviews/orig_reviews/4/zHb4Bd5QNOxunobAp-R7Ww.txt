The ambiance is great! Its more of like a old western feel to it from the ceiling all the way to the floor. The service was nice too, our waitress was always communicating to us and seeing how our food was. I thought everything was great except really the food itself. First I got the BBQ Pork Nachos, and it was ehhh... it had nice presentation but the nachos were really sweet which was not really my thing. So I returned it and got another dish called Average Burger Nachos. That was ehh, the cheese was bland and the toppings were flavorless. My dad got the Mexican Street Burger filled with avocado, mangoes, onions, etc. He said it was okay too. I think the food is just a little different for us. Their choices are really unique and I've never eaten mexican food like that before plus it was a little more on the fancy side! I think this is a great place for late night eatery especially because this is a sports bar/restaurant. I don't think I'd come back here, but if I do i'll try one of their popular entrees.
