Sometimes I wonder how I have never heard of a place, I have lived in the area for almost 4 years now, and I have never heard of Carolina's. But alas, I finally found my new favorite I can practically walk there place!

I am totally impressed with the quality of the Chorizo and tortillas. And to combine them with some eggs...heaven! They "home make" their own chorizo and tortillas, and the quality out of this world!

Their Chimi's are really good too! 

If you are ever in the area, don't let the outside of the building scary you away, you will love their food!
