Thanks to Chow Bella, my friend Lori saw that this place was opening Monday and we decided to go that night to check it out.
We planned on being there by 6, and I was a bit worried. Old Town. Day off for many. New place by Chef Esparza. Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time, as the place started to get pretty busy.
Looking at the menu was a little overwhelming, as there are dozens of different tacos to choose from. Yes, there are other things on the menu, but the tacos are the selling points because of the variety. I brought the menu home with me just to write this review, because we sampled so much ! (It's ok, it's also a take-out place and you can take the menu. I am not a crook. HAHAHA!)
We started with the elote, which you can get in a cup. It was delicious! We polished it off and ended up ordering another one later in the meal.
The tacos we had? The flank steak with an egg (of course), barrio pollo y chorizo, carnitas, cochinita pibil, camaron, and camaron con coco. We also had the green chile tamale. Everything was tasty and wiped out in seconds!
Here's where the final star for the review got taken away: Service. It started out great, but after the first half hour, it seemed as if we were forgotten. It was getting pretty busy, but with a chef who has so much experience, and a grand opening, the staff should have been better prepared. We had also ordered some things to go, and it took 45 minutes to get that. Luckily, the manger was really apologetic (and super cute!) so we didn't feel like total losers.
It also would have been nice for Silvana to thank the people who came out. We saw her a few times showing people her other new place next door and even congratulated her, but we basically got a nod and that was it.
