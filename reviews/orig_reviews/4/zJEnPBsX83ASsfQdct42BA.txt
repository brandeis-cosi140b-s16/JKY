Wife and I went there for the first time.  I was suprised at the size of the place and at how modern and nice the atmosphere is.
Our waiter, Daniel, was very personable and offered suggestions to my wife as to the chili sauce that was served with her meal.  She was a bit timid about things spicy and when she heard Jalopenos she veered away.  With a little coaxing though she tried it and then ate it all.
She had a pork burrito which she gave a 4 star to.  I had a pollo fundido  which was good and certainly had a LOT of chicken in it.  I'd give mine four stars also  because I'm a pushover ofr lots of melted cheese.
As mentioned before, the wait staff was very good.  Daniel really knew the menu and shared it with us.
Will come again.
