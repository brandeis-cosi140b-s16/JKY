So glad we decided to check out this new restaurant! We went for lunch so it didn't end up being super crowded. The service was amazing- our drinks were constantly full.  The guacamole was fantastic and if you order one thing on the menu, seriously, make it the street corn. That stuff is unreal. The tacos we tried, Baja and Pollo en Mole, were good but nothing to write home about. Our only complaint was the music. We didn't think it was too loud like other yelpers suggest, but it they were playing sad, slow country ballads. Not exactly what I would think of for their atmosphere and definitely not my preferred genre.
