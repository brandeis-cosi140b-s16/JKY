We have had drinks and good here twice since our stay in Vegas and it didn't let us down either time. The first time we shared the chicken and steak nachos which was huge and delicious and we couldn't even finish the plate together!! The second time we had the tortilla chips and salsa and mild chicken wings, both so good and not over filling which is great when accompanied by beer. Not expensive and good size servings.

Be sure to get the tickets from the girl out the front though for the buy one get one free drinks as it works out cheaper than happy hour. We had great service both time and very friendly staff.
