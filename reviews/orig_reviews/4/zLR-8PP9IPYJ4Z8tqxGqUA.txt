Lighting was really poor, menu description really small, thank goodness for flashlight app. Filled up a little to much on chips and salsa. First brought out soup that was good but all it was is broth. Service slow but they did stop by our table to ask if everything was OK. Good was good, I had Chili Colorado and it was cooked perfectly. I would recommend it if you on that side of town.
