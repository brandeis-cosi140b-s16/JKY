I have been WAITING to review this place because of all the different opinions on these reviews. I didn't have any food so I can't really comment on that but the drinks were good and strong. People were very nice. Outside was interesting...never seen sand lots in a bar, but the fact that they have an outside bar as well as inside was great! I was there on a UFC fight night so it got pretty busy as it got closer but the bartender was always very attentive and waitresses came to check on us frequently. I didn't get to stay for this epic loud obnoxious DJ or the other bad things that have been said about night time but it looks like this place could be such a good time!
