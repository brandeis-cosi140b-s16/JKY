This place was awesome! My friend took me here for my surprise birthday dinner. I always drive past and have been wanting to try it out but just hadn't gotten around to it. The margaritas are refreshing, and I had the pollo relleno which was absolutely heavenly! I am so happy she chose this spot. The reason it has 4 stars instead of 5 is because the server was a little distracted and missed out on a few key items, but he was friendly and courteous when he was around and other than the occasional lapse in service, we really enjoyed his personality, suggestions and general joie de vivre.
