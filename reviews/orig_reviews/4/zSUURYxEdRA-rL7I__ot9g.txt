I've read a great many negative reviews about this place. So many that my wife and I almost didn't go last night. We decided to give it a go and see for ourselves.
I've read .... 
Slow wait staff ... We were shown to our seat right away, our waiter came by within a couple minutes. He was a nice kid, very helpful. He was helped by another gal and they stayed on top of all their tables with no problems. NONE.

Small portions of food ... I have no idea where this came from. Our plate and those of our neighbors had plenty of food, and we wound up taking home a doggy box.

Chips not good ... The chips are great. Light and tasty. The salsa was good as well.

Music too loud ... The music was perfect. Yes, it was a night without a dj going and they were NOT going for a club atmosphere, so I'm sure it can be noisy, but last night the music was good and the volume was perfect for conversation.

The food is fine. It's not four star restaurant material, but they don't claim to be. It's a cantina. 

There is some full fledged hating going on here. I'm not sure why. We enjoyed our meal and would recommend the place heartily.
