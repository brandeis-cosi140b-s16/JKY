I had a chance to go Cantina 1511 this afternoon for lunch.  This is about the 5th or 6th time I've been to this local neighborhood gem.  Its hard to  bring something new to the conversation that hasnt already been mentioned...

Highlights:
*The chips and salsa are simply amazing.
*I usually get the Carne Asada Burrito, the dinner portion is $12 and is worth every last dime.  Here's a little hint, you can get the burritos topped with BOTH queso and ranchero sauce!!  How can you go wrong?!?!  The burrito is probably a little "fatter" than what you would think (see pics) but thats only because it is stuffed with tasty, Mexican goodness!
*The table-side Guac is simply real.  Its made at your time and you BETTER ask for it a spicy!  I usually always get the side of guac for $2 if I choose not to go with the full-out appetizer.  
*Service is ALWAYS excellent.  Never has my meal been anything other than what I ordered.  I have never had to wait an abnormal amount of time for my meal to arrive once I ordered.  Drinks are always promptly refilled.  Staff is always friendly and polite.   
*Parking is hit or miss honestly.  If you go there during peak hours - Friday @8pm, parking can definitely be tight.  But usually, there is ample space is the lot directly behind the building.  
*I love that they have Dos Equis Amber on draft all day, every day!

Lowlights:
NONE

Great, upscale Mexican food and dining experience, but with reasonable prices.  Cantina leads all competition - La Paz, Vida Cantina (at the epicenter), and Zapatas, when it comes fabulous Mexican food in Charlotte.
