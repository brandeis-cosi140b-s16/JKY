Great flavor in the tacos,but it should have a little bit more beef for the price, I give 4 stars because I like the flavor of the food, but I order beef tacos thinking I was getting carne Asada but for my surprise I got ground beef, I have never see a Mexican taco with ground beef!! They change my order but charge me $6 extra for the beef or should I say steak.... 
My recommendation check your order before you leave...
