I've been to La Comida twice now and it is definitely a new trendy spot in Freemont East (and all that goes with it). The prices are on the high end but the portions and quality are better than most posting below suggest. The real draw, for me, is the vast selection of tequila they offer. It can get expensive if you want to go huge, but a few beers and a shot of something unique is worth it to me - and not going to break the bank. There are definitely kinks in the server set up, but it is to be expected at most new restaurants and should be ironed out soon enough. The service from the staff was excellent. My first visit was a sit down dinner and our waiter was awesome. Second trip was a quick bite at the bar and a few drinks and the bartenders were very friendly, fast, and funny. I will make it a regular stop on the East Freemont bar tour.
