I am mostly vegetarian and typically eat really healthy. I was due for a cheat day and was craving a burger but didn't feel like driving anywhere. After seeing the mixed reviews for this place I was skeptical ordering a burger but decided to go for it and went with the Guacamole Burger and Deluxe Oreo Malt.

For delivery this was a solid burger. I was happy with my choice. The guacamole was pretty good. It was hard to tell if it was freshly prepared at the restaurant or store bought. If it was store bought it was of higher quality. I love avocado/guacamole and I can't stand most store bought/pre made guac. The burger was good size and well proportioned. There was a good ration of bun to meat to toppings. The lettuce and tomato was fresh and the meat was slightly pink in the middle and tasty. I love burgers but they need to be well proportioned and not have a huge bun or tons of lettuce to make it look big. This was done right. Next time I'd go with no mayo. It just doesn't need it as it's already a juicy burger. The fries were ok, nothing too special but decent fries I gladly ate. The Oreo malt was pretty solid. A good blend of oreo and vanilla and a good size which I was expecting for $4.25.
I'd order from here again
