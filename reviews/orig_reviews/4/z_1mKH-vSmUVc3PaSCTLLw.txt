Baja Miguel's was a nice surprise!  Hidden away on the second floor inside South point Casino, Baja Miguels is a good choice for a nice Mexican lunch or dinner.  When they bring out the chips, they come with a combination of salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.  They have some great lunch time specials which include soup, an entree, and a Margarita.  The food was great and the prices were very reasonable.  The atmosphere was OK.  The service was above average.  Overall, 4.25 stars.
