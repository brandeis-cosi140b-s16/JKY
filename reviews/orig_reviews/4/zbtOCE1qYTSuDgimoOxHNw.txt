My fianc√©e and I decided to stop in after a few beers over at Heist brewery. Started off pretty bad ass we ended up getting a parking spot right across the street from the restaurant. We got a table right away and the waitress was there in nothing flat with chips and salsa.  my fiancee had the wasabi chicken burrito which was great it had a good wasabi flavor. She also had the cheapo margarita which she seemed to enjoy.I had the two taco platter i couldn't decide so the waitress said try one of each. So i had the BBQ mahi taco it was excellent and i also had the lemon grilled shrimp. we will definitely return here when we go back to Heist brewery or maybe NODA or birdsong.
