This place gets by on its outdoor patio and drink menu, which is great.

I do like the tacos, but I would really (REALLY) appreciate the option of flour tortillas. I can't stand corn tortillas. But this is a small issue, because I don't don't think this is really mainly a restaurant. They're just serving bar food as far as I am concerned. As for the other food, the guac is good, the chips and salsa are solid, I like the refried beans and the grilled green onions. 

Only real complaint is that beers seem over-priced and service isn't as attentive as it really should be. Just means I'm not buying as many drinks as I would otherwise, though, so I guess that's better for me (worse for them).
