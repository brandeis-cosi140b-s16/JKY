First time visitor and had no idea what to think - Chinese and Mexican food together? The servers where great, they could tell we were new and so they gave us samples of the best selling items and offered great suggestions on what to order. Between us we had a couple of Chinese items, pork carnitas and jerk chicken. Everything was tender and flavorful.

definitely going back soon.
