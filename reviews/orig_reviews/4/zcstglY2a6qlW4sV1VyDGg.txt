What can I say, I'm a fan.  It's obviously not authentic Mexican, but in my opinion, a better option than Chipotle.  I like that they make giant flour tortillas on-site.  They taste so good, I usually push my salad around to get to the tortilla.  Actually, that may be the linchpin for me.

I usually have the chicken salad, which is ginormous.  Overall, it's good and I like their creamy cilantro dressing.  It has just a little kick but is not so spicy that it's uncomfortable for me to eat.  (Disclaimer: I'm a self-admitted salsa/spicy wimp.)

I also like that they have hibiscus iced tea (i.e., jamaica).
