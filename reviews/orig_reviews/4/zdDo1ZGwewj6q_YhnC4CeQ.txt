Today was my first visit to Gallo Blanco for breakfast/brunch.  For the price, I love this place.  I like to ride my scooter on weekends, and this place is casual enough that I don't feel guilty showing up in jeans and a beanie.  I shared an order of fresh made guacamole with my scooter gang buddy, and ordered the juevos rancheros.  Yummy!  As was the melon juice drink.  Add this restaurant to your list of "breakfast" places, you won't be disappointed.
