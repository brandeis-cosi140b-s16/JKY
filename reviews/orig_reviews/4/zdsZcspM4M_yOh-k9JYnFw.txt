Came here unexpectedly when other plans fell through. Awesome place, fun decor, great food. The tacos are street food style- small but packed with flavor. The enchiladas suiza were good, though I thought the chicken was a little under flavored. Service was friendly and good. Table side guacamole was great, topped with pomegranate seeds, unexpected and delicious!
