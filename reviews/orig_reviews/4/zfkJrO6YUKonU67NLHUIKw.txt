My first couple of times at Cabo we're not impressive - in Blacksburg or in Charlotte; my husband and I were both impressed with our service and quality of food at our last visit. Waitress made sure that our drinks never went dry and that we had everything we needed throughout our meal. The food was perfect - my husband especially loved the wasabi tuna taco!
