Upon arrival at this Phoenix dive, one instantly senses tradition, history, character and the possibilities of something memorable. The food is in take out / fast food style, and the very reasonable prices match the ambience. The restaurant was packed at lunch, but the service was friendly and fast. 

I chose the green chili burrito and the butter tortilla. I'm trying not to eat carbohydrates, but how can one refrain when you are at the best tortilla factory in Phoenix? I enjoyed the green chili chicken filling in the burrito, but I do wish I had covered it in a salsa, sauce or cheese. 

This place is the real thing, and a fun adventure.
