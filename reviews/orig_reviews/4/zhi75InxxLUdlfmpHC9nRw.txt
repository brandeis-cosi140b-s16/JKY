While service was a bit slow, I won't let that stop me from coming back. I thoroughly enjoyed the food! When you're first seated you're brought a basket of fresh tortilla chips and four different sauces, all with free refill. As far as drinks there is a lot to select from, but their horchata was some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. For food I got the taco dinner with beef tongue, and my boyfriend flautas with tongue. Both extremely good though his was seasoned a bit better.

Will definitely be going back within the next week!
