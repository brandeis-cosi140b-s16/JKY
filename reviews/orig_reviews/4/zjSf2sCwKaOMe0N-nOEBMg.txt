My first experience with Border Grill was a delicious dinner with my husband. He loved his pork chop and I enjoyed my tacos. I felt that it was a little pricey for what you get, but the food was good. I love that they offer a locals discount and you can get restaurant.com gift certificates, so there are discounts available. 

One of my favorite meals is brunch and I was pleased to learn that they offered an all you can eat small plate brunch. So I immediately set up a brunch date with my girls and it has been our go-to brunch restaurant ever since. The small plates are super awesome, again it is a little pricey, but it is all you can eat! I love that they start the table with fruit and guava empanadas. The empanadas are flakey and absolutely addicting, I seriously dare you to only eat one. Some of my favorite dishes are the skirt steak and eggs, short rib hash and eggs, breakfast fries (super yum), chilaquiles, and I always order at least two potato tacos. There are a few misses for me as well, the plantain empanadas just taste burnt and the churro tots are way too dense. 

Since discovering the delicious brunch, I have been here at least four times. The last time we were seated downstairs and it is by far the best place to sit when it is too hot to sit on the patio. It's all glass so you can still see the pool outside and you get plenty of sunshine. If you want to have a fun, delicious, and laid back weekend brunch you absolutely must check out Border Grill.
