Pretty good food.  Mexican is hit or miss in this town: it is either great or gross.

I would go back.  It is close to downtown, the servers were friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was very clean and super busy at lunch time, but we got in and out pretty quickly.

The food was great quality, tasted really fresh and delicious.
