This place saved me from the vote. My brother and husband both wanted Mexican food and I wanted Asian food. We solved our delimma by going to Komex! The place was super packed so we waited about 10 minutes . 

I had their KimChee fried rice which was really good! I was nervous about ordering it because I thought it would be too salty.  It had the perfect amount of spices though. The portions were big so I had plenty of left overs!
