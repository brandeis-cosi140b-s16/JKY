Good place to eat in Vegas if you're looking for something casual and on the cheaper side. We had their margaritas, which are typical Vegas prices. They were pretty strong and had some fruit soaking in them.

I got their quesedilla, we split the salsa platter (really good!) and everyone enjoyed their food. Good service as well. 

It didn't get 5 stars for me because the overall impression with the place was good, not great.
