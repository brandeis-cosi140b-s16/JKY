Hot, fresh, and most importantly, tasty!

My burger was huge and messy, with added real, thick bacon, and spicy grilled jalape√±os.

I shared an order of fries with my sister, and it was plenty for the both of us. And judging by the amount of time it took her to eat her burger and suck down her milkshake through her giant boba-sized straw, she enjoyed her meal as much as I did!

They may be a little more expensive than their counterparts, but the quality makes it worth it.
