I had the enchiladas verdes, and thought they were very good 
*however!  they tasted just like the enchiladas verdes at Pink Taco.... which I think is a bit strange*

My friend had the chilaquilles and also found them to be very good

I was a bit put off my the lack of chips and salsa to start.

When I go to a mexican restaurant, I NEED CHIPS AND SALSA!

:)

Then when I requested chips and salsa, they looked at me like I was crazy, and then brought out a plate with 10 tortilla chips on it.  Great....

I'd go back, but don't think I'd go out of my way to do so.
