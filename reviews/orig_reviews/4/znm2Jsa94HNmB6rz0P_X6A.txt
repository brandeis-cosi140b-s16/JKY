wow, only 2.5 stars? I guess it all depends on the individual experiences + what are you looking for.

4 stars for the amazing and scrumptious large-portioned tostada salad. The Cobb salad was pretty good too, very light, huge portions. The bf ordered a fajita however and it was so-so, very meh.

Service was friendly I thought. The waiter even asked if I was 21 then gave me tickets for free drinks.

And it wasn't that loud, during the day/lunch hours at least.
For a quick lunch, why not.
