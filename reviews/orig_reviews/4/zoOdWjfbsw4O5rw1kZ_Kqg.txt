Just got back from another great trip to Vegas and I think we went to Taqueria at least twice while staying at Venetian. Bartenders are super cool friendly people, always helpful and attentive. Thoroughly enjoyed my Don Julio 1942 with their excellent chips and salsa. My girl is obsessed with their house made pineapple tequila infusion so much so that we attempted to make it our self at home. Great views too of canal and mall. We will always visit this place when in Vegas. Thanks for the great service Alex!
