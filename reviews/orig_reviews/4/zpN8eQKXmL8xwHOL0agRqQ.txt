I had the 20 vegetable fried rice and a taco here along with some wine.

The twenty vegetable fried rice was amazing. I opted for the in house made chili oil. Quality meal. There was a nice balance of rice and vegetables. Wow was it good.

The tacos was good, but pricey. I'm accustomed to two tacos per order, not one.

Overall a quality meal for a fair price given the venue.
