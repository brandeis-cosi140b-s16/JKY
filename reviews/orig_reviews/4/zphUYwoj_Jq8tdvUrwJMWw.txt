I don't live near Nacho Daddy, so it's not a place I will find myself frequenting.  I was working near the location,  and meeting a friend for lunch, so we decided to meet there. The waitress was very enthusiastic that we tried the special,  carne asada tacos on homemade flour tortillas with manchego cheese. We both got the special,  and let me tell you, those tortillas are magical. I am drooling thinking about them. The cheese was gooey and a perfect match. The carne asada was good, but nothing extraordinary.  It needed some sort of a special sauce though, like a spicy chipoltle mayo sauce, like the one Rubios uses on their gourmet taco. 
The waitress said they were thinking of adding it to the menu permanently if enough people liked and ordered it. So order it and get it added!
