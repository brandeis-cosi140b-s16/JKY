We went for lunch and the place was pretty empty.  So we got seat right away and the food came out fairly fast.  We had their taco plate and Mexican pizza.  Both tasted great ... especially the tacos.  Price-wise, it was actually cheap compared to most places on the Strip.  One thing they can improve on is how their waitress dress.  They were wearing sweatsuits ... after all this was Vegas and they should wear something more fun or something more along the line of the restaurant name.
