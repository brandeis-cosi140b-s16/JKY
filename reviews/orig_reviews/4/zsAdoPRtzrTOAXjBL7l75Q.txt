I really like this place!  The drinks are fabulous!  And most of the staff is outstanding.  I think its easy to find the 7's when you more often than not get level 10 servers!  I feel terrible I cant remember her name but Lynette? maybe? is amazing!  I adore and I have to say I so appreciate that EVERY female that works there always looks impeccable.  Great hair great make-up freshly pressed clothes great smiles!  Grooming is so huge in service and I feel like people miss that all the time.  Not these people!  All the food is great and you have to get the watermelon jalapeno  margarita!
