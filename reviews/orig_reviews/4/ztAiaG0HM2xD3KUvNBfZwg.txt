Good salsa verde, the best I have ever had. Food is mostly good, I stick to the usual tacos or enchilladas. I saw on yelp that if I checked it I would get a free Fried Ice Cream. My server didnt believe me and took my iPhone right out of my hand and went into the back with it. About 5 minutes later he came back and reluctantly gave me the free fried ice cream. Sometime you have to wait for a table even though there are many open. They must be short staffed. I'll keep going back though, that salsa is awesome!!
