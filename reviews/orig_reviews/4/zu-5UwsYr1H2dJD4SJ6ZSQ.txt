After reading all of the reviews on Yelp on how amazingly delicious this place was, I decided to try it. 

 First of all, it was good...but not to the point that every one else is making it seem here. I think with all of the hype, I was expecting little pieces of heaven in every bite!

 I ordered the bean and cheese chimi enchilada style. I can say that the enchilada sauce was really yummy! I wish i could have finished it all but it was HUGE!! it is a good lunch spot but definitely order ahead because the wait is pretty long. If it is convenient I would probably come again but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
