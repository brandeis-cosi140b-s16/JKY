I love Cantina 1511!!!!  It is that plain and simple.  

The margaritas are fantastic and fresh!  And the table-side made-to-order guacamole is AMAZING!  I could eat that and have a margarita and be done for the day.  Service is great and the atmosphere is very relaxing and inviting.  

I say it's a definite "Must-try"!
