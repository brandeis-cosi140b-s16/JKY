Great food and great service!! Our waiter Rudy was so nice and attentive , definitely will go back. Don't pass on the table side guacamole , and ask for hot salsa , has a great flavor to go with a he√°t that will make you down your oversized margarita quickly.  Fajitas were good and big enough to share.
