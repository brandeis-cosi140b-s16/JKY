Casa Don Juan has been my 'go to place' for good Mexican food.  I thought it was about time to give them a bit of credit and do a review.  Nothing fancy, just good fresh food.  I have a large extended family (over 15 of us) here in Vegas and Casa is a great place for us to get together.  We always have great service, and food. Some of my favorite picks are:  chicken taco plate with crispy corn tortillas, chicken soup great,  breakfast fried eggs with rice and beans just right, and the fish dinners yummy...Like I said, just good ole food at a reasonable price. 
I happened to stop by last night (FIRST FRIDAY) and enjoyed the outdoor sidewalk seating.  A special for FF, is an outdoor Margarita stand. YUMMM.!!!
If you haven't tried this place, grab a GROUPON and enjoy.
