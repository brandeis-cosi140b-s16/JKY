Interesting concept. Think Chipotle or Qdoba, but with enchiladas.

Smashed potatoes as a filling are great - seriously. Doesn't seem like it, but I love them. Short ribs are also yummy. Cornbread is also really, really good, and spicy, so if you have a sensitive stomach, skip it.

Both the red and green salsa are good. I recommend getting it Christmas style unless you have a strong preference for one flavor over the other. All the salsas are good, and I love the pickled onions as a touch of sweetness and freshness to balance the decadence of the short ribs. I like having the buttermilk and jalapeno ranch dressings on the side for a bit of extra flavor.

Prices are reasonable, and I'm always super full for a long time after a meal here. It gets busy during lunch, so stopping by a little early or late can cut down on wait time. Parking is right up front, and there's a patio if you so choose.
