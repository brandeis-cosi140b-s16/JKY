I live right near here, had seen it go up and never went to it.  Randomly decided to take the lovely special lady friend out to dinner and chose this place.  Needless to say, we were both very impressed.

The service was outstanding and friendly, the food was outstanding (we shared one of the huge Paella dishes - fresh and outstanding), and had a few drinks and a salad.  Pretty damn pricey, but nice to eat well and not have to be super decked out, naw'mean?  The live music is a really nice touch and the overall vibe of the place is great.  Definitely not the kind of place I'd go to every weekend, but for special occasions it is awesome.
