This place was great. Had dinner here after finding in Yelp and the positive reviews were dead on. The service was outstanding and the flavor in the food was original and amazing. We will be back here for sure at sometime in the future.
 I only wish I could have given it 6 stars because that's what it should get.
There are a lot of food choices in the area but do not miss any opportunity that you have to dine here. You will not be disappointed!
