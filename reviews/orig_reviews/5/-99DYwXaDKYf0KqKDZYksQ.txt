One of my all-time favorite restaurants here. I crave their seaweed rice and mango habanero sauce on a weekly basis. I remember the very first time I went they offered me free samples of all the meats and were very helpful. They always deliver excellent customer service and top notch meals! Like I said, the only bad side is you'll crave their flavor ALL the time.
