Jesus will eat here when he returns.  He probably eats here now; I certainly would if I could afford to sit for every meal. 

Every employee with which we interacted was friendly. Service was fast. Jaime served us and made excellent recommendations. The place is nice and is clean. The location is unfortunate but not hazardous. 

The food. Oh the food. The salsa was like sucking on a delicious curling iron; they aren't dumbing down the heat for tourists. The tableside guacamole had six or seven ingredients and renewed my love for it. I think every facet of the meal was homemade, from the tortillas to the enchilada sauce. The menu is extensive and obscure to this Tex-Mex aficionado, but I will return to try everything. 

Makes me wish I had given fewer 5-star ratings to other establishments, cuz this one is truly in the top 1%
