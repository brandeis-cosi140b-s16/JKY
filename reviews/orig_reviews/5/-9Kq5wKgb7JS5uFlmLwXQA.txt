This place was good! I had the chicken burrito (Bario Pollo) and it was definitely something I never tasted before. Very good. I like restaurants that differentiate themselves from the rest. Everybody at our table like their dish. Carne Asada burrito and enchilada's all tasted good. We sat outside, it was nice and quiet. Great atmosphere. Flowers smelled good on the patio and everything. 

Only thing was that the waiter forgot to bring water that we asked for and my wife was choking from the chips and salsa and I asked him if he could bring out a water for her. And he said "Oh thats right! Well let me just take your orders first while I'm here" 

...Moment of survival...

Maybe he thought I would just let her have a sip of my beer, I don't know but shes 4 months pregnant so it came down to let her choke or give the fetus alcohol. And I chose choke because I had a feeling her chance of survival was higher if we waited for water.
