If you want to treat yourself to authentic, creative, and just plain yummy Mexican food, it's GOTTA be Border Grill! Brought to life by the Two Hot Tamales and their amazing Chef Mike, Border Grill has something for every mexican food lover. My favorites are the Beef Brisket Taquitos, the Yucatan Pork (carnitas, black beans and grits, OH MY!) and the Tres Leches cake for desert. 

If you're a Margarita lover like me, treat yourself to a Cadillac Margarita that is topped with Grand Marnier with lots of extra salt, on the rocks. 

I can't say enough about this restaurant. The ambience is killer. The staff is attentive. The ingredients are fresh. It's just the best all around. As a native Southern Californian, this has my LA girl seal of approval for Mexican!
