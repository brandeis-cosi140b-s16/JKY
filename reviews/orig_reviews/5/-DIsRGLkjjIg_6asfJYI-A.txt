This place is incredible. Incredible Service, Incredible Food, and Incredible Prices!!!
We were served last night by Hunter D (or so says the receipt). I can quite honestly say he is one of the best waiters I have ever had. 
We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant. Within a minute or two of sitting down, our waiter came over to get our drinks started. We both ordered a beer. 
He left and came back minutes later with chips and salsa (delish!!) and our beer followed closely behind. He took our order at the same time. 
We ordered the tableside guac (which was delicious) and our mains. our waiter showed up again minutes later, and made the guac for us. He left and we dug right in! he came by to see if it was to our liking and we said it definitely was. 
our meals arrived a few minutes later. 
He was the type of waiter who knows when to approach the table, and when not to. He was there before our drinks were empty, and came by to ask how our meals were. When I asked if I could box the rest of my meal (the chimichanga is massive) he said he would do that, and also throw in the chips and salsa and the guac. 
Our meal (3 beer, table side guac, chimichanga, and 3 steak tacos) came to 57.38 with tax. This will definitely be our goto Mexican! Especially if we can have Hunter as our waiter. I really can't say enough good things about him! He was absolutely incredible!
