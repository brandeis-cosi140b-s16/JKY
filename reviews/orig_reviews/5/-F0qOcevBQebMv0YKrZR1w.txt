Had dinner here for the first time. Very very impressive!
The staff was incredibly polite and attentive. It's obvious how much they care about making sure your dining experience won't be forgotten. 
We had nachos, steak enchiladas, and steak tacos. Everything was prepared perfectly and we couldn't be happier. One more thing..I would recommend the fresh guacamole they prepare at the table. Amazing. 
If you want real, authentic Mexican food, don't look any further. The menu is huge as well.
