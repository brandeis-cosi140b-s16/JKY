Some of the best flavor combos you're gonna find in Phoenix metro can be had right here.  Best horchata ever. Great micheladas. Amazing corn on the cob w/ queso. Last night I had the pica rico burger since I've had the tacos before. It rocked. I just finished it for lunch leftover, and guess what? It rocked the next day even harder.  I love this place, they never disappoint.
