My first experience with Blanco was actually at a little one in the airport that I ate at on my way home from Phoenix. I fell in love with my food, especially the rice! Now that I've moved to AZ I make sure to keep Blanco in my restaurant rotation.

The atmosphere is really fun, perfect for date night. Great design, lighting, and layout. The drinks are good and they actually have some really interesting vegetarian options on the menu. Last month I got mushroom tacos that were fabulous!

Being a 20something who works, I tend to eat later than most people and usually my boyfriend and I just go to the bar. The place is often busy so if you want to go around super time don't be surprised if there is a wait. 

Just go, order some guac and a marg and enjoy the setting!
