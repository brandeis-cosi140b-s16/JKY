My husband and his cousin came here a while back, both enjoyed it and recommend it.  So, today, along with my husband, I am here to try it.  

We start off with the fusion bulgogi fries, half order, which is plenty big.  We have beef, mozzarella cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeno and Korean hot sauce all piled high on top of the fries.  Oh so very good!   These flavors smothered with the fries, well you just have to try them.  

I  also get a fusion burrito, beef, Korean BBQ style, with Mexican rice, green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce, with soy and sesame sauce, all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  It's big in size and flavor. It was excellent.  

The food is so good, the mix of both asian and Mexican styles never thought it would be good, but it was surprising how the flavors just work together.  Now I know this is a go too place when craving spice and a bit of "komex".
