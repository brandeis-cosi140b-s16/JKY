Best mexican food ever! I am not a Mexican food type but this was amazing. The chef brought to our table his special Flan (family recipe) and i wasnt expecting too much as all flan are pretty the same. For my surprise the flan was better than the mexican food which was pretty good. If you are in Vegas dont miss that!
