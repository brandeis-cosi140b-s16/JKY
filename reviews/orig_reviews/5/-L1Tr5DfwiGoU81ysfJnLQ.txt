Went with my husband and son today. As non fish eaters, it's always tricky to take them to a sushi type location. Oh my gosh! My son pounded his steak burrito and my soy wrapped spicy tune with creamy ponzu and thickened soy was so good I ate it all even though I got VERY full! Would highly recommend.
