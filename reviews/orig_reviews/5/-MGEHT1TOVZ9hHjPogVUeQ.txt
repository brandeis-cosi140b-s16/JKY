This place is absolutely amazing. Better than the tacos that I from my Mexican friends. Almost every trip to Vegas I've stopped here, sometimes twice in one day.....its that good. You cant beat a $2 taco.

Nice clean place, good seating, and again hands down, one of the best tacos I've ever had. Get the pork, beef shoulder, or the tongue. You won't regret it.
