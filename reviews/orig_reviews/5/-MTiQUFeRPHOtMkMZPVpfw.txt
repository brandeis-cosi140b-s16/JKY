I can not say enough good things about Border Grill. It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. My most recent visit was due to them updating their brunch menu. The weekend brunch is a fantastic deals at $30 for all you can eat tapas (add on all you can drink mimosas for $5). There are items on the menu to appeal to every taste from 'traditional' breakfast to people who want something more like lunch. If you're a pancakes person, definitely try the mexican chocolate chip pancakes or the bread pudding french toast. The chorizo sausage biscuit and gravy is great, so are the chilaquiles and the shrimp and grits. I love their short ribs, so I was super excited to have the short rib hash. My roommate loved the frittata (also new to the menu) and he normally hates eggs. I love the green corn tamales, but those are on the regular dinner menu too. Be sure to ask them to bring out the guava empanadas.

My only criticism is that I want to order everything and I end up completely stuffed. The service is always excellent - the staff and management both makes a point of getting to know their regulars. I always mock the people in the restaurant on the weekends with the lunch menu. Spend the same amount and get a huge variety of amazing food. It's Mexican twists on American dishes and some interesting interpretations of classic Mexican food as well.
