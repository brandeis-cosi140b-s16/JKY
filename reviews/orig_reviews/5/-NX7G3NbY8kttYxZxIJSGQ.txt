We live in Old Town and have been on several occasions over the last month. Great happy hour with freshly made guacamole and appetizers half price. The servers are cheery even when there is a large crowd. For those of us who like the Tex Mex variety this will whet your appetite. The cheese enchiladas are delicious and the menu has many taco choices. Wish they had beer on tap, but the house margaritas are special. Ask to sit in the courtyard, it is a sliver between two buildings with a great atmosphere, heaters and a fire pit. It is a great place to bring friends which we plan to do next week. Two types of salsa for salsa fans, red and green. Great job Cien A
