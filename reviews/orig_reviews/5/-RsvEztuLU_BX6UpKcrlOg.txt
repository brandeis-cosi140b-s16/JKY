Been here twice now. The food is great and the place always seems busy. The staff is friendly and suprisingly the best thing about this place is the Horchata. I normally have it and am sick afterwards because it is sooooooo sweet. Comedor's has a good mellow sweetness.

Food wise I had the lengua tacos it was really "spicy" not like hot spicy but like a lot fo different tastes in it. My boyfriend had oh I can't remember the burrito but it had chicken, peppers, and onion. i don't like peppers and onions but the green sauce that they had put on it was sooooo good. I wish I had got some green enchiladas or something. 

Now correct me if I am wrong, why are there no Tamales? I couldn't find any? Do they not serve any or did I miss it somewhere?  That was my only complaint I went in looking for tamales but hey I got something better so I guess it's not really a complaint then huh?
