Flavor explosion. I was like a kid in a candy store, I couldn't decide what to order. It was all delicious. Korean tacos, bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates, street corn, pad thai al pastor and Mexican pho, all amazing! The only thing I would not recommend is the Sangria-passion fruit, but bottomless Mimosas were good!
