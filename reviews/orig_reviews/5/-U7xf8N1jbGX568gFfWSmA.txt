Are you kidding me!  Why haven't I been here before! Robertos tastes like old socks compared to this place.  Fifteen rolled tacos came to $12.75...and they were so bomb! Watched the cook make them fresh,  guac was fresh too.  The rolled tacos were absolutely delicious and not dripping with grease like other places I've been.  Kitchen was extremely clean and organized. It's located in a the convenience store of a gas station, but after trying it... who cares. Try it.
