First time at Poncho's tonight. The four of us arrived around 5PM on a Sunday and it was packed. Waited 20 minutes but got a nice table in the 'living room' (Isabel used her house as a restaurant.) 

We ordered drinks and got chips and salsa while we perused the menu. Lots of choices but I went with El Crudo Burro.  My wife ordered the shredded beef tacos. Our daughter got the shredded beef enchiladas and her beau ordered the chimichanga platter. 

The El Crudo Burro: excellent. It's juicy machaca beef with a thin, light, and tasty green tomatillo sauce. It is wrapped into a flour tortilla, then topped with red enchilada sauce and melted cheese with rice on the side. Perfecto!

Everyone was happy with their dishes (my wife said her hard shell tacos had a hard shell-whatever. 

Will definitely go back. Yum!
