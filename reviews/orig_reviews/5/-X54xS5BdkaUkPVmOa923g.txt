My family loves Nando's.  Friendly staff, amazing food, and great prices! The plates are HUGE, from the regular entr√©e to the kids plates. The red chili burrito is delicious.  But if you really want something good try the appetizer folded quesadilla (grilled chicken) it comes with sour cream/pico de gallo. It's really stuffed with chicken, 4 big slices. No rice or beans, your choice on that. My dad just loves it, it's a must have for him!  

What my family likes is there's no "fillers" in the food. You know where they stuff the meat with peppers & onions.  The interior is very nice and colorful. Only complaint is about the menu, it is a little dark since the lights are very dim.
