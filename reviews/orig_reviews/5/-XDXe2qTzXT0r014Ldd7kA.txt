Casa Don Juan is a simple "neighborhood" type of restaurant located just off the Las Vegas strip.  It serves a wide assortment of basic Mexican food at very moderate prices in its large, comfortable dinning room.

A friend of my wife and me, who has been a customer for many years, took both us of there for dinner.  We started with guacamole and tortilla chips that was fresh, well prepared, and creamy.  For our entr√©es my wife had the Carnitas de Puerco (pork, guacamole, rice, beans and pico de gallo), and I had the Puerco en Chile Verde (pork, green chile sauce, rice, and beans).  Flour and corn tortillas accompanied our meals.  Our dishes were very well prepared with quality ingredients, nicely seasoned, flavorful, and fresh.  The meat was tender and delectable.  The beans and rice were very good accompaniments, and the tortillas were hot off the griddle.  The service was extremely attentive and unhurried.

Casa Don Juan is highly recommended for its delicious food, excellent service, very reasonable prices, and enjoyable atmosphere.
