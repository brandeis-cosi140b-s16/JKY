By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. This location is clean, fresh and open with plenty of seating inside and out. The service was great, food was delicious and I seriously can't get enough of their handmade fresh tortillas! So happy we don't have to make the trek downtown now that there's a summerlin location although, we would if we had to bc it's that good.
