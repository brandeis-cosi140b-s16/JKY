I had the Meatloaf and it was amazing! Usually with meatloaf its dry and over cooked this was the perfect consistency and cooked perfectly. You wouldn't think it would be some that you would order at a Mexican food restaurant but it is amazing! Very clean place with good service. This is a good call for a really good Mexican food joint. I gave them 5 meatloafs, something that is rarely given out...
