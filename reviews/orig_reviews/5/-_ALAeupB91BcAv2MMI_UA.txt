I'm not sure if I'm easily pleased when it comes to Mexican food, or if this place is really that good... I'm going to say that it really is that good for the three main reasons that makes any restaurant good:

1) The food - it's not good, it's GREAT. I've only been here twice and both times I had a burrito instead of tacos. I had one of the pork and the asada (beef). It was very more-ish! In my opinion, the perfect size for a burrito so you're not left with a heavy brick in your belly and carb crash shortly after. It comes with a side of chips and salsa with just the right amount of kick.

2) The service was friendly and fast. The first time I was there, it was for a late lunch and the food was out in about 5 minutes. The second time I was there, it was during peak lunch time and there was a line that quickly moved, the food arrived at our table between 5-10 minutes. Both times, the people behind the counters were friendly, approachable and gave good guidance in what to order.

3) The atmosphere was relaxed and it was the perfect outdoor lunch during a warm winter day. There's seating inside and outside, I sat outside on the patio where there were ample tables, chairs and heaters. With the warm (not hot) winter sun kissing my skin and my burritos, I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. I will say that the inside seating was a little sparse, due to the size of the stores in the Container Park, but I believe they made good use of the space that they had.

I'll be eating my way through their menu in the coming months... or maybe weeks... ok, honestly, it'll probably be days :)
