Simply amazing! The restaurant is casual and modern decorated. It's right on Central Avenue and busy at lunch time. We got there just in time before it got really busy. The service was fantastic. I ordered the Bandit which was a fajita combination plate of shredded meat and avocado and beans and rice (which they had to substitute for roasted veggies). I am trying to go gluten free and the waitress said that all of their entrees except for their flour tortillas they use for burritos are made of corn so another huge plus. Meal was delicious and I will indeed be back.
