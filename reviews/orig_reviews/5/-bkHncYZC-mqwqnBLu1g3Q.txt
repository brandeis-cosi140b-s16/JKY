Today my mom and I had the pleasure of eating here. The food was delicious, the customer service was excellent,  and the prices were reasonable.

I got the red sauce tamale and a beef taco and was pleasantly satisfied by the large portion it came in. Every worker acknowledged me, and smiled. The manager made sure to ask us how everything was, and even asked if we would change anything about our experience. 

Also, their lunch specials were well priced, and the quality of the food is unbelievably good.
