Had the pleasure of dining at the great Cabo Fish Taco.  Ordered the Rasta Pasta, it was simply fantastic.  This has to be one of the best pasta's in the Charlotte area! IT has generous helpings of chicken, shrimp, pineapples, bell peppers, etc.  SEX for my TASTE buds, that's all I can say about the Rasta Pasta. 

-The crab dip was awesome, as always.  The pita bread it was served with, was warm and soft.  

Service was great.  Tunes were great.  Ambiance was great.  The Sex my taste buds had was great.  Everything was Great!!  GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!
