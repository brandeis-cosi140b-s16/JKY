Great place. We found out about this place initially by driving by as so many business have come and gone at this location the past 3 years. 
We sampled their tacos at the Duck and Decanter festival and went in the Friday after.  They had $1 mini pastor burritos (I think, as a European I have a hard time with Mexican food and what is called what)
Also had the $4 Margarita and was very good for the price. Nice tang and a good amount of alcohol for the price.
Will come back.
