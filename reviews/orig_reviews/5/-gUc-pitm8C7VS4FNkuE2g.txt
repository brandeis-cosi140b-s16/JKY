My boyfriend and I visited Pittsburgh for a wedding and visited Mad Mex on a friends recommendation.  It was fantastic!  

You must have a mango margarita!  Delicious.  And half off during happy hour.

If you're going to eat anything there, try the nachos.  Delicious to split and you don't need to order an entree.  The nachos are huge.  

Will definitely recommend Mad Mex to anyone visiting Pittsburgh.
