In the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos delivers Mexican food with an old style flair.  The decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever.  First of all, they serve two distinct salsas.  I am not a fan of the enchilada type hot sauce, which is an Arizona thing, but the other salsa is fresh and full of onions, tomato and cilantro.  It tastes as though it is made right before it is brought to the table...so fresh.  We had to ask for a bowl for the salsa, which is apparently not normal at Los Olivos, but we were making a mess trying to use our little plates for the chips and salsa. 

I ordered a combo plate and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  The flavor was delicious and much like Tex-Mex, which is my favorite.  The margaritas were also great.  The prices are reasonable and truly, this is the best Mexican food I have found in Arizona.  They offer fajita meat dishes, which is a rarity.  

Los Olivos was packed at 6:30pm when we grabbed dinner and we quickly learned why.  It has been around for decades and has earned a reputation for great Mexican food.
