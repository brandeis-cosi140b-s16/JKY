The food was authentic, fairly priced & outstanding! Portion sizes are WOW! They offer menu items that aren't Mexican food...burgers, chicken fingers, grilled cheese so the kids were all happy too! The wait staff were all very polite & attentive & worked well as a team for our table of 4 adults & 11 kids 11 & under!! Most places balk when you walk in the door with that many people, let alone over double the children to the adults but they were happy to rearrange tables to accommodate us & make us welcome. Everyone enjoyed their meals & ate well. I had the chili verde, it was tender & juicy & had a nice kick for the level of spice! Perfect! The guacamole was the only thing that wasn't perfect, just avocados mashed up, but their salsa was delicious so it wasn't hard to doctor it up. Out of the way of Boulder Hwy but so worth the drive!
