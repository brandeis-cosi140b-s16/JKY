Thinking about a place that serves brain and tongue literally makes me cringe. But thinking about their carne asada tacos just makes me want to eat. I had a carne asada and the al pastor. Both were great, but the carne asada kicked its ass. The tacos here are presented here really nicely! 

As great as the tacos are, there is always something to complain about. This place doesn't have chips and salsa!!! Major bummer. Also, this place is tricky. It's $6 for a taco!!!! The menu says $3.50 but when they ask you if you want everything on it and you say yes, its an extra $2.50 or so. I wish they would include it INTO the price of the taco so there are no surprises.

Like i said, these tacos are bomb, so its worth it.
