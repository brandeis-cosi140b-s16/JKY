Everything from quesadillas to beef brain tacos, everything is tasty! I love this place so much! My friends and I were all getting tired, but we had to drive back to Saint George that night and everyone wanted tacos. We tried other places, but most of them were 21+ and one of my friends wasn't 21, so we found Tacos El Gordo. 
When we got there, it seemed to have a long line trailing outside, but it didn't take long until we were inside ordering.
Their spicy pork tacos are to die for! And if you order peppers and onions, beware! They are super tasty, but way spicy (and I can handle a lot of spice)!
I have recommended this to everyone going to Vegas because it is totally worth it and is super close to everything on the strip.
Go to Tacos El Gordo, you won't regret it!!!
