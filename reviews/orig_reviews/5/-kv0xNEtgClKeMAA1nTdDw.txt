I was here Friday night and had a great dinner! I sat at the bar and ordered a jalape√±o strawberry margarita that the bar tender Jason recommended. It was fantastic!! I would never of ordered that but Jason said it was a specialty of his. I loved the service and the atmosphere was so cool. I highly recommend sitting at the bar thank you Jason for the great recommendation I had a great time. Please sit at the bar and ask for Jason to make you a margarita!
