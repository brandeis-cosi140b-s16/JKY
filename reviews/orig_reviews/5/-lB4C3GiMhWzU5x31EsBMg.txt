Great happy hour!  2-5:30, great deals on apps and margs!

House margaritas are strong enough to compel me to write this review after just the first one!

I always judge a Mexican restaurant by their cheese enchiladas, as that is my favorite dish that I order everywhere I go.  This place did not disappoint!!  Although pretty much I could fill up on chips and bean dip - it's worth waiting for the food!
