The tacos are $4 a pop (I guess that's why they call themselves a "gourmet" taco shop), but they're worth every cent. I came here twice and tried much of the taco menu. My favorites were: cabo shrimp, fish, mayan pibil, arrachera and guacho. This place has the best salsa bar I've found in Phoenix so far, too. Great house margarita as well!
