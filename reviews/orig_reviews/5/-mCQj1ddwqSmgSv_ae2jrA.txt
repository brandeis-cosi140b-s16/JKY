Just had dinner here. Our Server was Amanda D. We got the tacos. They are about 3-4 bits but surprisingly filling and yummy. We also got the guacamole which was really good. We had no wait and our service was fantastic!!! We always had drinks and Amanda kept checking on us. Now that is service!! I'm happy we tried this place !!  We will be back!
