I came just to visit a friend that works here but OMG wow. I ate so much! Apparently the shrimp tacos won some Vegas award for best taco so I had to try them. They were very simple and had a spicy garlic sauce that I loved. Get the guacamole sampler for sure! The drinks are VERY strong so be careful! I'm a seasoned drinker and I got pretty buzzed off one drink.
