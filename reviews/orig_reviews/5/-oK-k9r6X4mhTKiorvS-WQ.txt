This may be the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food I've ever had.

I found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area, and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews. My boyfriend and I have been there for dinner twice now, and attempted a third time but arrived too late because I forgot that they close at 8pm :( One of the only negative things about the place so far. I think they should stay open until at least 9PM, but oh well.

I've read numerous comments about poor service but both times I've been, service has been just fine. Maybe a little on the slow side regarding the check, but I can let that slide as I was not in a hurry to leave either time. The ambiance is not romantic or necessarily inviting, but it's charming in its own way.

I found it a little strange that they charge for chips and salsa ($1), but it's a small price to pay, as the chips were very fresh and the salsa (both the salsa served with the chips, and the bottled hot sauce) was quite good. I think both times I've eaten at El Bravo, I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner special served with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, tomato and rice and beans on the side. The chimichanga was AMAZING. Flavorful, juicy, tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla. The toppings were a little overwhelming, next time I may ask for them on the side. The rice and beans both had good flavor and I was very satisfied with the whole meal. I thought the little crispy flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar which was brought with the check was a very nice way to end the meal.

El Bravo is a little nondescript and can be easy to miss while looking for it, but it's totally worth it!
