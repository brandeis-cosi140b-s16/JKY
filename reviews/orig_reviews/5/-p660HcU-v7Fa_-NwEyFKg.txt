I'm so glad Madison has real Mexican food! And Guadalajara does it well. Cheap prices, cane sugar sodas, Mexican cable channel blaring, an open kitchen so you can actually see them cooking your food, and a friendly atmosphere. We ordered lunch to go and it was delicious. Their house marinated pork is AMAZING. The chicken enchiladas are also very tasty. Guadalajara is also open quite late, which is great if you ever get those late night munchies.

The waitress also seemed incredibly capable and on top of things. I see a lot of complaints about the service of this place, but I was honestly impressed. Considering the restaurant was kinda packed, we received great service for being to go customers. We were greeted with a friendly welcome, and she even gave us chips and salsa while we were waiting to take home our order. I usually don't tip when I get take out, but I couldn't help it after seeing the waitress handle everything so swiftly and elegantly. I guess I just have a soft spot for hard-working, capable waitresses :)

I didn't get to try the tamales this time, but I saw some people buying them by the gallon-size bag and they looking delicious. I'll have to get tamales next time...
