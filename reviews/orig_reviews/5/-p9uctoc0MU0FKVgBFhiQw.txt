Hands down my favorite place to go for Happy Hour. Also, a great date place. I guess this would be considered a Hipster place but I just love the atmosphere, the food, the beer and the excellent staff. Absolutely never disappointed with service or food quality. Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating. $5 beer pitchers. Braised beef and crispy fish tacos are my faves and highly recommended.  Love, love, love it!
