This place is now at the top of our Mexican food restuarant list.  We were hesitant about it being next to a gentleman's club but do not let that stop you.  The food is cooked with veggie oil and they have vegetarian entrees as well.  The booths are large and comfortable and you  don't have to compete with ambient noise to have a conversation.  Our server Kai was very friendly and the service was great.  The flan is amazing!
