I can't say enough good about the Barrio Queen! I take friends, family and clients to this amazing restaurant. Great people, service, food, culture!! Please come and open in a place we have for you in downtown Mesa!! Next to the Rail, plenty of people and parking.  Beautiful location, across the Mesa Arts Center. Show us some love like you did in Gilbert!! :-)
