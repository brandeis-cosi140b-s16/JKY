Awesome place to go for a burger! The burgers are cooked to order, which makes it well worth the wait. The chicken tacos are awesome as well, despite the fact I do not like cilantro all that much. The fries are good, and the lemonade is simply fantastic.

The cheery employees helps set this place apart from any other. They really make you feel welcome and appreciated.

The Stand is also very well organized and clean. A very good indicator that the staff take pride in their job. 

I will be back, that's for sure!
