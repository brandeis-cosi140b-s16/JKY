I have been visiting Pittsburgh steadily for the past 2 years and let's face it, it is a quest to find delicious and authentic ethnic food in this city. Not saying you don't, saying you put in sweat, money and imagination.
And then you find Las Palmas.


Update: within 12 hours both me and partner got hit by diarrhea. There is no way in the world I am giving this business less than 5 stars.
