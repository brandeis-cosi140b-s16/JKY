Saw this restaurant on Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives tv show...went down the next day and had lunch with my son and future daughter in law...OMG! This is what I have been waiting for since we move to Arizona 11 years ago...Let me describe the food...no wait...I can't except to say that layers of complex and subtle flavors is unique in every dish. I had tacos...These are the real deal tacos and they do not skimp on the meat!
My son is a fine dining head chef and has taught me how to taste and eat really good food. This place is all of that and more...We ordered the Al Pastor Quesa to share...my sone that is without doubt the finest and most complete Quesa he has ever had in his mouth...It was to die for. 
I had the El Gaucho Taco...trust me...order this! it was huge and complex...I was tasting new flavors every bite...I also got the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco...pulled pork with a hint of some spice that drove us all crazy tying to identify it...I will be back for both for sure. I waited a long time to find this place...you simply must try it...you will never go back to your heavy, greasy stand-by.
I wish they had 10 starts to award. this place rocks in a way your mouth will now best!
