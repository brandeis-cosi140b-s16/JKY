Absolutely amazing Mexican food. 

One of my friends raved about how authentic and delicious the food was, so of course, I had to try it for myself.

I ordered a few different types of tacos and the Mexican Hotdog. I grew up eating a decent amount of spicy food and didn't think anything here would be a problem (as long as I didn't order anything extra spicy). Let me warn you now though, the Mexican Hotdog had not only me in tears, but my 3 friends I was with as well. 

The people working felt so bad that they gave us 'sympathy horchata'. (Which was so good - we ended up ordering more).

Anyway, you have to try it! So good!
