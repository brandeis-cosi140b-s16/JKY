I absolutely love El Segundo. As a local I'm always looking for a new hot spot with good specials that's not in a hotel. They have an AMAZING happy hour.  You can't beat $5 margaritas and you'll probably only need two at the most because man are they strong! The Big Stick is my favorite. Bartenders are friendly, helpful and cheery. The managers are always nice as well. They have quesadillas, nachos, chips& salsa and tacos on their happy hour menu. My friends and I always like to come down before we go out on the town. Great atmosphere. It's open to the strip so you can get some people watching in and the strip energy comes in. They have TVs in the bar area, so you're able to catch a game as well if that's your thing.

As for their regular menu they have delicious dishes as well. Granted, it's not at Chevy's prices but it's good quality and tastes awesome. Definitely cheaper than a lot of places on the strip! Must try the guacamole as well, it's made fresh and it's very tasty! I've always experienced excellent service as well as delicious food. I definitely recommend this place.
