Absolutely sensational food! For example, the best guacamole we've ever had. Raisins and mangoes in guacamole? Who would have thought of that! Marvelous! Everything we ordered was prepared from fresh, high quality ingredients, and was served almost as soon as our orders were place. The black mole tacos were wonderful; earthy, smokey and rich mole sauce balanced off by pickled red onions. Our server, Louis, was attentive and informative. We'll be taking friends to try the place soon. It's the closest thing to the Barrio Cafe you'll find on the West Side of town.
