It had been a while since I've eaten at Z'Tejas.  Decided to meet up with a friend and have a good Margarita and a bite or two.   Overall it was an excellent experience.

Service
-Amazing from being greeted at the door to our amazing server Missy.  She is amazing at what she does.  So amazing that I am writting this review a month later after finding my receipt.  She had amazing recommendations and I ran with them, every item she recommended what amazing.  It obvious she's knowledgeable about the menu and knows how to ask the right questions to provide the perfect recommendation.  One of the best experiences I have had with a server and I eat out tons.

Food
-Seasoned well, perfect amount of spice to it.
-Looked good and came out hot instead of looking like it had been under a heat lamp and coming out with the "I've been sitting under a heat lamp look"  
My Marg was on point! 

Atmosphere
-Busy, a bit loud but not unbearable.  It was what was to be expected during Happy Hour.
-Clean, tables being bused in a timely manner
-Clean Restrooms.

Overall I will make sure not to wait so long to come visit again.  I hope to have the pleasure of being served by Missy again as well.
