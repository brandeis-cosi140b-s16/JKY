Not a single complaint about this place! 

We decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:

~friendly staff
~nice outdoor patio
~reasonably priced drinks
~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom.
~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show
~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).

We didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!
