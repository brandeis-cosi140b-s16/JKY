Okay...so we've now been coming here for a year and this is still our number one spot in Vegas! I would say we've visted at least 8 times over the past year bringing lots of our friends to try it out. Every time it's been a great experience and every time our friends love it too. One of our recent trips in October was because we saw the show "Taco Trip" which featured the Mahi Tacos. A friend was over at our house in Phoenix on a Saturday and watched the show with us. We were already planning a Vegas trip and I told her that we'd be hitting up this spot in a couple of weeks. She said, "Why do we have to wait? Let's go now!" So we all hopped in the car at 6 in the afternoon and were in Vegas by 10pm. We had lunch on Sunday before heading out of town and of course, we were not disappointed. See you guys soon as we'll be back in December!!
