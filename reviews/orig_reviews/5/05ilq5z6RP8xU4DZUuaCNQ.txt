I've been to this cozy little spot on Indian School Road a few times. The first time it was quite busy & packed and didn't really get a chance to get a feel for the place. We only had drinks but the service was outstanding. Thanks to the good service, I suggested  to a friend that we return for Happy Hour. I love the HH menu. It was quiet this time around and really enjoyed atmosphere.

Last night, I was invited out to meet friends for dinner. Since I'm doing my best to maintain my Size 4 figure, it's not all too often that I order a full entree for myself. While ordering, I noticed a pollo entree that was being served to a table next to ours and decided to give it a try. Chicken was a heavenly delight! I sampled a few bites of various tacos at our table and everything was just amazing. Milagro Cafe will be at the top of my list for Happy Hour & Dinner. Cheers***
