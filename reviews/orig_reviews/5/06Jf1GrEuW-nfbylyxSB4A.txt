The King Sandwich (King Carlos V) is a smargasbord of Sin and Delight!  So huge and yummy.  I hadn't had anything that good in this category in ages.  Some sirloin pork, pork chops, hot dog, other fried meats, omelet, and avocado.  It is $25 and enough to feed two hungry men or possibly 4 casual eaters depending on if they had chips and salsa first.  Good quality salsa.
