After reading some of the earlier negative post I was quite shocked after visiting this place.  We've been there 4 times now and not once a bad experience.   The salsa was amazing !   The food was fresh and tasty. The service was impeccable !!!  Friendly efficient staff!  We asked for flour chips which were not on the menu and they gladly made them for us with no fuss or extra charges.  It was all delicious and they don't skimp on the margaritas !   You can actually taste the alcohol.  Prices are more then fair !  I can't say enough good about this place other then I prefer wood or tile floors vs carpet flooring.  Would definitely recommend to those who like good  hand made cold margs and excellent fresh salsa !
