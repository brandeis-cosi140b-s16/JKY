THE best beans ever!  Their Green Chili is also awesome.  Guacamole/Beef tacos are great.  I always had that in my order. I missed those when Grandma had eye surgery, but those have been back on the menu for a while. I have tried about everything on the menu and love it. I started coming here since the early 1990's when I started working at County Hospital.  I go less often now that I have retired, but still get there a couple times a month.  The staff has always been fantastic to me.
