Finally made it to this restaurant.  I have lived in Phoenix since 1985 but had not heard of this place until recently.  This restaurant did the catering at the Desert Botanical Garden for Via De Los Muertos and that is where I descovered their cuisine.  
Decided to celebrate my b'day here and it was a great choice.  Had been trying for several months to have dinner there but they were always closed on  the one night we were available to go out.  Finally!!!  
There was about a 40 minute wait for a table as they were packed.  Normally I will not wait more than 10 minutes anywhere for a table.  While waiting decided to have a guava margarita at their bar.  great tasing drink.  tV ery tiny, maybe 6 seats total.  Understand they have bought the place next door and will be expanding which is exactly what they need.  
 We both decided on their house specialty of the roast pork.  great choice.  Very large pile of deliciously cooked pork was surrounded by mashed potatoes and zucchini.  It is enough for at least 2 meals.  I will go back for more but next time find out when they are not as crowded. We were there on at Sat just before 8pm so possibly a few hours earlier or even later.
Very reasonably priced for the food.
