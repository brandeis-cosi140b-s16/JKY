I haven't been here in a month or so but it was even better than I remembered. I ordered the chicken burrito this time & it was delicious. The best burritos in town! The staff is always friendly, the place is always clean & they play great music. If you haven't been here yet you need to make it a point to visit. You will not be dissapointed.
