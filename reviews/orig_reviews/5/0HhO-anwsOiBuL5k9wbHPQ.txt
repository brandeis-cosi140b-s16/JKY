My 5 stars are specifically for the quality of the food, the meal was phenomenal. Amazing flavor and a very large portion. A tad bit expensive but what can you expect from a great quality restaurant. Hands down one of the top 5 Mexican food spots I've ever had, I'll be back whenever I find myself on the west side of the strip.
