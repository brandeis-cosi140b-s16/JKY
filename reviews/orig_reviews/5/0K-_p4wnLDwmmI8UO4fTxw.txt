I don't frequent Chandler much but I did want to mention that I was at the grand opening of this new Sandbar and know the NEW owner of this specific location.  He told me he was revamping the current menu and that I would be very impressed.

Well...he was right!  Being a lover of Taco's but not a lover of eating a lot of carb loaded tortillas, this new Sandbar has the best option I have ever seen to be able to keep the pleasure of eating a taco with your hands and not just picking at the inside of it with a fork.

They have managed to transform the tortilla into a soft jiacama wrap.  Its delicios and goes very well with their mahi mahi or ahi taco's.  Add in some black beans and guacamole and you have the perfect light and nutritious meal.

I also recommend the pork adovado and basically every other item on the menu has been revamped and has a fresh twist on what was pretty average mexican fare...
