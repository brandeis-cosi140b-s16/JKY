Another fantastically authentic hole-in-the-wall kind of place. I never knew you could have a cactus burrito (napoles) but I'm glad TYT was there to introduce me to it. Glass bottle coke is not particularly rare in Mexican fast food joints, but if they have it, it's a good litmus test as to how much effort they put into their business. Also, the el pastor pork was pretty solid.
