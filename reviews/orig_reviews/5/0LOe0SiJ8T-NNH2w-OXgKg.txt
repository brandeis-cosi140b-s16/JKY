Decided to try this place as previous reviewers were quite pleased with the food here. It was a very smart choice as both the food and the service were excellent. As happy hour lasts from 4 to 7, most diners will have the opportunity to save a few bucks and enjoy a house margarita or a beer as well as some chips and salsa. The chips come with 3 or 5 different salsas which are all fresh and tasty. The burritos and tacos have great flavor and will definitely appease most hearty appetites. Overall an exceptional dining experience. Highly recommended.
