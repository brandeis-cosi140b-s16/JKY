I always get the burrito al pastor. It's really good and around $6. The sides are also very tasty (veggies, pickles, salsa, etc). I like this place a lot. I wish I could keep going. The tacos seem a bit pricey--haven't tried them since the burrito is so good. Make sure to ask for some grilled veggies in there too.
