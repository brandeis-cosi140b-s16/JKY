If you have been to Barrio Cafe, you know what I'm going to say. If you haven't, get there immediately. You won't find better Mexican food. Ever.
But don't expect chips and salsa and a burrito. This place is authentic Mexican, with a French twist. The chiles en nogada is the signature dish here; it's a symphony of flavors your palette has never experienced. But that's just the beginning. Also try the pescada del mar, which is a wonderful blend of fish, crab, scallops and chorizo. The house made guacamole is fantastic, and don't forget the churros with goat's milk caramel for dessert. Simply the best. Chef Silvana is a culinary genius.
