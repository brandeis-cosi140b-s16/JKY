I have been eating here since my jobless just moved out here from CA and don't want to go to college just yet days.

The quality of the food has remained consistent throughout the years.  I have had everything on the menu at least twice.

The chips are always fresh, the salsa is spicy but not to bad, the burritos are great (even the red sauce ones, and I don't like red sauce), the staff is always polite.

They open at 10:30 AM, so, its a little difficult to say its "breakfast" food, but yeah, I guess I could eat this for breakfast.

They do have a "drive up" window - but its for phone orders only!
