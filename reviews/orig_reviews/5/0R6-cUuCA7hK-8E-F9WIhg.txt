Oh the selections they offer! I couldn't understand half of what I was told to try from the worker there, BUT I loved my food anyways! I played it safe and got carnitas tacos because I knew what it was by name lol and the hubby got others...sorry not much help, but we were both so happy! I think he got a chicken taco in different sauces...idk it doesn't matter because yum! 
Great street tacos and location is run by a family which is fantastic! Great job guys! I hope this place survives a very long time and brings you much happiness!
