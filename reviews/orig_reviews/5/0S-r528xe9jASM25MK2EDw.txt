Delicious food, authentic recipes, wonderful service, clean restaurant, beautifully upgraded d√©cor and a decent price for the large portion sizes.

Love the new expansion since the last time I was here! We ordered fajitas and they were amazing! Large portions and very flavorful and at a decent price too. The service was wonderful as always. The drinks were a bit intoxicating and we had to stick around for a bit and enjoy the live mariachis.

I remember back around 1997 or 1998 when the owner Javier bought a brand new corvette and let my friend David and I take it for a ride 100 MPH down Eastern Ave. Not sure if we ever admitted the speed we accelerated in his new corvette, LOL, but we returned his keys and car within 10 minutes and not a scratch. Javier was a business client of ours and a very sincere and friendly gentleman.

Although I have been to every one of his Lindo restaurants, this is and has always been my favorite location! Glad we came here again. We enjoyed a very nice dinner and overall dining experience!

Without a doubt, the best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas!
