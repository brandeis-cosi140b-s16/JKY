We stopped at Nacho Daddy's for lunch yesterday (9/28/15) and it was AMAZING! We've been here a couple times before, but this visit definitely stood out to me as a great visit! I've recently made the choice to become vegan, which means that if we choose to eat out, for the most part, I've got to get a lame salad. Not yesterday! They have a VEGAN MENU!! This made me so happy. I ordered the vegan nachos, and even my husband, who isn't crazy about the vegan lifestyle, thought it was delicious! He kept saying how crazy it was to think something this good at a restaurant was vegan, and I totally agree. Super yummy, and definitely something I'll return for. I love the location, super close to our house, and the environment is always welcoming. Our waiter, Jose was super sweet and accommodating. He kept our drinks filled, and was very informative with the menu. LOVE!!
