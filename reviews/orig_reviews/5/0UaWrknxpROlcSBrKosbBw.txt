Like other buildings in Wickenburg, it doesn't look like much, but here looks are deceiving. El Ranchero is outstanding. The owners are enthusiastic, friendly and great cooks! It all comes at a very low price. Try the hornitos - bacon wrapped chiles, stuffed with shrimp... ask for sour cream for dipping. The chile relleno stuffed with Mexican cheese will make your taste buds sing, and the enchiladas are well above average. When in Wickenburg, this is the place to go.
