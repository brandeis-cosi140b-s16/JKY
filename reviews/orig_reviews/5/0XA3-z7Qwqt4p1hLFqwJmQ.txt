Best Mexican food around the valley. Been here several times for lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. The staff is great and the food is fantastic. The chips are fresh and they bring you 3 different dips, bean dip, avocado dip and a salsa. All of which are great. The fajitas are the best I have ever had. They also have several award winning dish that when you try them you will know why. Margaritas are perfect too. Must try this place. You won't go wrong.
