A lot of restaurants send out appetizers on small plates and call them tapas, but for a truly authentic menu of Spanish classics there are only three choices that I know of in Las Vegas- TOROS, Jaleo and Julian Serrano. The only real difference between the food at the other two is that those places cost about two to three times more!
 
I have been to TOROS three times now and I have tried almost everything on the menu (including four types of their Pallea!). Having authentic Spanish food brings back great memories of the times I spent living in Spain, the amazing sights and the friendly people.  I have been to Jaleo and Julian Serrano at least half a dozen times each, and they, like TOROS, are spot-on when it comes to authenticity.  

Brian B. said that the pitchers of Sangria seemed expensive but at four glasses per pitcher that works out to $7.50 per glass.  It seems pretty reasonable for hand crafted and properly made sangria, especially since it's basically impossible to find even a cheap glass wine for $7.50 a glass.  I also read another comment about only having one beer on tap, but they didn't mention that it is Estrella Damm one of the most popular beers in Spain.  Having a real Estrella with authentic tapas is actually a thoughtful, authentic touch at TOROS.

While eating at TOROS I met several people that actually have experience with genuine Spanish cuisine from having lived or traveled a lot in Spain or having gone to very authentic Spanish restaurants, like the reviewer Anarae A.  They all agreed that TOROS is amazingly authentic.  If there is something on the menu that you are not familiar with, just open your mind to something different and enjoy the flavors and culinary style of old-world Espa√±a at TOROS!
