Nike it up with the Brulee Burger.  JUST DO IT.  Seriously.  It's amazing.

The patty was crisp on both sides yet the meat was not overdone.  I asked for the egg that comes on top to be a little more well, yet the egg wasn't dry and the yolk still smeared serving it's purpose.  The bacon was actually crispy and didn't overpower the rest of the ingredients (as bacon sometimes does).  The pink sauce that comes on it - killer - as well as the sweet pickled (?) red onions.  The bun was actually tasty on its own (rare for bread to shine!) and perfectly complimented everything - it was crispy (buttered + sugared, perhaps?).  UGH.  It was so good I can't stand it!  The flavor combo was heaven in my mouth.  I can't.

My friend got the Beach House Burger and liked mine better.  But he said if he didn't taste mine, he would've been amazed by his.  We also split the Country Fried Burger.  Yes, that's right.  As in, we had our own burger AND split another, along with a side of Sweet Potato Tots.  The Country Fried Burger was disappointingly dry, but we also forgot to smother it with the accompanying sauce - a bleu cheesy ranchy type sauce (?).  The fried onions that came atop were to die for - perfectly seasoned and salty, mmm.  The Sweet Potato Tots tasted fresh and were good.  Not sure if I would order again my next visit since I'd rather save room for more burger goodness (perhaps a double Brulee Burger) as well as the fact that I'd want to try their regular Fries AND their famous French Toast Fries.  Decisions, decisions...

... Oh, that Brulee Burger.  I want it again and again and again.

P.S. Customer service was excellent with one guy behind the counter and the owner was present.  'Nuff said.
