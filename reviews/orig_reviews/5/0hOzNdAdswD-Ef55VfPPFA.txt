This place was so much fun! Instead of just waiting in line to place my order, we were able to watch the tortilla making process. 

There were two ladies making the tortillas right there in front of us. One mixed the dough, while the other rolled it out and placed it on a spinning flat cook top. Once the tortillas were done, they were then stacked and ready to be used for burritos and quesadillas. Talk about fresh!

We paid an extra dollar for their Fire Grilled Chicken, and got the burrito. My husband loves heat, and asked for the hottest salsa, as well as 'enchilada style' with their green sauce. I love melted cheese and smothered burritos. Yum! They added greens and pico de gallo on the side. We took this home, and my husband and I split it. 

The burrito was very flavorful, and large enough for the two of us to share. Even though he asked for the hottest salsa, it was tame enough for me to eat it with no problem...and I am a wimp when it comes to heat. I admit that I had been nervous when he asked for the hot salsa, but I need not have worried. We will definitely be back. Next time, I want to try the horchata as it has been way too many years since I have had any.
