Love, love, love this place! The food was amazing, the service was very good,  and the chips and salsa are soooo good! We were also given a complimentary sweet corn tamale which were surprisingly delicious. We didn't have any margaritas but the iced tea was passion fruit-my favorite! For lunch I had the chicken tacos and my husdand had the chicken enchiladas. They were both very good, portion size was perfect, and we will definitely be going back!
