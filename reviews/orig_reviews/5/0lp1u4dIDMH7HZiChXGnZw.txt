I've been to Tivoli a million times, and this is the first time I'd ever been to this place! 

The hostess was a little iffy - not very friendly, and a bit standoffish. However, once we were seated, our server was wonderful. He was extremely warm and energetic without overdoing it. 

We had the chips and quac - of course - which, like many things on the menu, are very paleo/gluten-free. 

I had the Ensalada de Mango y Pollo. This was a great entree salad. Delicious flavors and very fresh. 

My friend had the Tacos de Pollo - again, gluten-free. 

Had a nice time - very quiet setting for a Monday night. Will return!
