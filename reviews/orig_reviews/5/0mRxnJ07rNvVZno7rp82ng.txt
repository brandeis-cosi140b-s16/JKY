Amazing, Best in Vegas!

The food at Las Cazuelas is awesome! It's the best I've had in Vegas.  Every dish tastes like it was made fresh, even the beans.  In general, I've hated every mole I've tasted, but the Enchiladas De Mole Poblano was spot on!  I'm looking forward to eating my way through this menu.
