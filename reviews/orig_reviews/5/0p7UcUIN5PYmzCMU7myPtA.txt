Anytime I travel out of AZ for work, my husband knows to have a Three Way burro ordered and ready to be picked up on our way back home from the airport.  It is my comfort food, for sure.  My company also uses them for catering and their platters are pretty awesome if you're looking for that sort of thing.  They always send plenty of chips and salsa too.  We've never had an issue with them failing to arrive on time or failing to provide what was ordered.

This location is great and accessible right off Mill Ave and Baseline.  I have only dined in a couple of times, the rest of my experiences have been with phone/web orders and the pick up window.  

Ordering online is SO easy!  I love it when I don't have to call a place and deal with background noise when placing my order.  

The restaurant is clean and all the staff have been very friendly.  The drive through staff is amazing.  They always double check the order to make sure you're getting what you ordered and are sure to include extra hot sauce.

I LOVE their chips and hot sauce.  Another reviewer said it is ketchup based.  WHAT?  No.  Honey.  Just no.  The salsa is your usual watery pico de gallo type salsa, whereas the hot sauce is all ground chilis, tomato and garlic yumminess.  I will eat it until my tongue is trying to escape the inferno of my mouth and my nose is running.  It's that good.  

My favorites are the Three Way Burro enchilada style with green sauce, or Three Way Chimichanga, if I feel like blowing my calorie allowance for the next three days.  I've also had the Rod Burro which was good, the pollo fundido, and their tacos.  Tacos are pretty basic, nothing special, standard tacos.  Get the shredded beef, they are tasty if they are hot.  Their rice and beans are also good, but it is hard to mess that up.  

Give them a try, for the price, the ease, and the convenience, your money is better spent here than at Fili-Bs, Taco Bell, or any of the other Berto's chains.
