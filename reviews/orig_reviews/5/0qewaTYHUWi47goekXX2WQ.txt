AWESOME Mexican food. And even more amazing service!

This place is super huge, so we naturally assumed we would be cramped and have to wait hours for our food. Not so! The tables are arranged in a manner where you are able to see everyone in the area, but are given enough space that you feel as if you are in your own private area. The waitress took our order in 3 minutes and we were seated within 10 minutes. Amazing. It was a pretty crowded night too, the parking situation is a little tough when the lot is full. We had to park in the back, unpaved area, at the very end spot next to the ditch. Service continued on with greatness, water refills without asking- she even brought us lemons for our water :). I like.

The food was amazingly delicious. Dare I say the best Mexican food I have had outside of homemade cooking. And I love Mexican food. The cheese enchiladas (my Mexican staple) were fabulous. You could smell the fresh corn tortilla, the cheese was not overly stringy and there was the perfect amount of sauce. The rice was also tasty and not dry. The chips and salsa were super great too. Sigh* I want some right now. I hope to get to venture here more often!! BF had the chile relleno. He states "the pork filling made the whole dish very fulfilling
im usually still hungry after eating a regular chilli relleno with just cheese."
