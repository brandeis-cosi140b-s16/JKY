Randomly ended up here on a rainy Sunday. Tried the traditional margarita (well balanced, yay!), the misty sleeve (ginger and spice, yay!), and the turista (don't let the black pepper syrup and bbq bitters deter you, this is amazing, yay!) Our bartender, Josh, was personable and sweet; the Chef was conscientious of clientele and asked us to try his ceviche recipe. All around, excellent hospitality and amazing food/spirits. This is why we love local Vegas.
