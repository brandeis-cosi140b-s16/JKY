This place is always a good time... we like coming in for brunch and getting the bottomless mimosas. Justin has been our bartender the past few times, and he is always great-attentive, friendly, and helpful. I wish the mimosas went later than 1 pm but we definitely get our money's worth because the service is good. I am not a brunch food person, so I always stick with the lunch options. I love that they actually have some healthier options (tomato queso salad with avocado is my favorite) and equally love to indulge in the tacos with a side of smashed potatoes or the trio (which is now pineapple salsa, queso and guacamole-all delicious!). If I'm going to be on Mill, this is definitely where I'd go, especially during the day time/happy hour.
