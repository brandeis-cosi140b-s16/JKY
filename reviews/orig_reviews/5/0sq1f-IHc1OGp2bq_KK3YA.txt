After having Ceviche tostadas on my trip to Coachella in Indio I have been craving them ever since.  So I decided to turn to Yelp to search for a place to feed my craving here in Phoenix.  

I found Mariscos Playa Hermosa was the highest rated ceviche in Phoenix so I figured this was the place to go.  So Sunday afternoon I was craving some seafood and I thought no time was better then the present to try this place out. 

I walked in and the place is as colorful as can be.  The artwork on the chairs match the tables and each set was different.  I was just hoping the food lived up to the reviews and the color of the place.  

I got seated and placed my order one fish and one crab ceviche tostada.  I got chips and salsa dropped off at the table and the red salsa was nice and spicy.  The green had a great flavor but not much spice.  

My tostadas came out pretty quick and WOW they were amazing.  The crab was my favorite lots of meat and just full of flavor.  The fish was really flavorful as well.  After stuffing my face with this tostada goodness I was full so I didn't order anything else off the menu.  I will be back for sure as the whole menu looks amazing.  If you haven't been and you like seafood get in your car and go NOW.  :)

They have happy hour daily from 4-7 which I will keep in my memory for future trips.
