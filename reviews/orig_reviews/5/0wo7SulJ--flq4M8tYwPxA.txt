This is literally my favorite restaurant. I've been going here since I was young. The food is a crazy combination of Mexican, Chinese, and Caribbean. It may not look like much and you may miss it if you just drive by but the food is to die for. My favorite dish has to be the Jade Red Chicken or a Veggie Quesadilla. I love finishing off the meal with their Snickerdoodles!
