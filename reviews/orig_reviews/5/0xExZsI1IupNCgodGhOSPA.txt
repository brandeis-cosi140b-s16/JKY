I used to eat here every tuesday when I was a student at UNLV for 2 semesters. I look forward to going there every time I go back to Vegas. It is a unique taco shop and I locve the menu items such as : the Texicano and the bombay. Never had any issues there, so before you jump on the bandwagon it is still an awesome taco shop and the ideas that they have for tacos are amazing.
