I've been eating at Wahoo's since the first one opened up in Costa Mesa, CA. Growing up in Huntington Beach, this is the food of beach people. When I moved away in 1999, I definitely was jonesing for their delish food. Fast forward to living in Henderson and being stoked when Wahoo's opened up here. I was thrilled when the GVR location was to go in but it's been sidelined for some reason. The next closest location is this one at Horizon Ridge and Horizon and I can say every time I've come it's been like a slice of home...the food is awesome and exactly as it is back home and the service is fantastic. I've been a little sad at this gem becoming "main stream" and popping up everywhere but at the same time, I now get to eat the food I love. While the "roots" of Wahoo's doesn't translate out to the desert, the overall feel is darn close and I'm stoked to now have this great place in adopted home. Kudos to the staff at this location for making sure at every turn my meal and experience was nothing short of perfect.
