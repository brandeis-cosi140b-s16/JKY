Some of THE BEST margaritas that we have ever had!

The food is outstanding, the atmosphere is great, the service is always fast, friendly, and accurate (they get your order right - just the way you like it), but the margaritas are absolutely fantastic!  We love margaritas and have had thousands of them all over the U.S. - and the world, for that matter - and these are the best ever.  I am sure it is the high quality of tequila they use but the bartenders really know how to make them.  You will not be disappointed.
