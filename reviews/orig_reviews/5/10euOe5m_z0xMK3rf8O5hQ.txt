Viva.  Had the family platter with two meats. Two adults and four younger children ate and we were all full.  Everything fresh, tasty and well-marinated.  For dessert shared the arroz con leche (which was great) and the flan (which was fantastic).  Great addition to the NW.  First time here - will be back.
