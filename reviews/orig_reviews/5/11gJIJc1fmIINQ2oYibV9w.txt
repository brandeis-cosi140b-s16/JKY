I always figured Mexican food was Mexican food. However this was a lot different from the Sonoran based offerings we typically get in Phoenix.  

The food was very very good. It was a perfect way to end our night. 

They brought us some chips, salsa and beans. The beans were great, the chips fresh, and the salsa had a nice fire roasted flavor.

My daughter's chicken burrito looked good and she ate it all.

They'd brought some soup out to us and while I'm not sure what it was, it was delicious. 

Everything came out great and we were disappointed that we didn't have a microwave or fridge at our hotel so we couldn't bring any of the leftovers with us. 

If you want Mexican food in Vegas, this is a must visit place. I especially liked how it felt like a place locals go to eat, unlike everything on the strip which seems to feed tourists only. 

This was a nice relaxing place to enjoy a meal.
