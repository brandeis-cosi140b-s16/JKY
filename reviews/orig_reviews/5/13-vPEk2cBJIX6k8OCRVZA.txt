Came in here after a long night of drinking one morning and I was extremely impressed. The wait is a little long, but there is an upfront disclaimer that reads "Please be prepared to wait as everything is prepared fresh", yeah I'm down with that. I got the steak quesadillas and a sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. The steak was marinated with lime and was so delicious I could have eaten three more. As for the burrito, it's rare that a place can throw potatoes in and have them be light and fluffy, but these guys pulled it off. 

Were it not so far from my house I'd be in more often, but maybe that's a good thing for my waist line. If you're in the area give it a try! 

Ps, it's kind of tucked away in the back of a little cluster of buildings, which made it hard to find. And the Yelp pin drop may be off a bit.
