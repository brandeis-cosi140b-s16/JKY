Excellent Margarita (Primorita)  We shared the tableside guacamole, the corn gordita (comes with 3 we added an extra), the shrimp tacos (also comes with 3 but added an extra) and scumptious shrimp taco.  Everything was excellent.  Great ambiance and very nice waiter who gave us great advice, thankyou Angel!
