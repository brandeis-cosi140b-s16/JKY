So i wont really review the food...it's great. But today my UNR student daughter who came to town to surprise me, but i had found out in advance and then had my wife tell her i was out of town...so she took her to cafe rio where i was waiting, to surprise her. Confused? Big tear moment...but then cafe rio jeffrey with erics (?) help surprised us with a free desert to "celebrate whatever the tears were for" Class act people!
