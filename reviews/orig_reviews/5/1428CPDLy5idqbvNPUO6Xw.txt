I read the reviews and had to come try the Al Pastor tacos. They did not disappoint and I had 2 along with a carnitas and carne asada taco. They were some of the best tacos I've ever had. They were on the smaller size and I brought an appetite so after having 4 and a Mexican corn on the cob I was full. The staff was so nice I just had to give a positive review. So the Al Pastor  taco and Mexican corn is a must try on your first visit.
