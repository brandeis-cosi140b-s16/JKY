Best mexican food in Phoenix...hands down. We used to live in maryvale so we would frequently visit the westside location, i am now very pleased that we can get west phx mexican without going back to west phx...as another reviewer said only intelligent people are the one's who give this place 4 or 5 stars. Their food is awesome (try the polo chimi with jalapeno cream cheese) and service is always great as well. Me and my wife were even given a complimentary desert by the manager one day just because he thought it would be a nice thing to do for a young couple...God bless Po Po's and i hope these low star reviewers find themselves at Filaberto's since they cant appreciate quality mexican food
