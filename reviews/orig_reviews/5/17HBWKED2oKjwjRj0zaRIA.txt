Took the 15 y/o last Saturday. Made up some story for the better half that we had to go Mom's day shopping. 

My bulgogi burrito was wonderful and huge and tasty and huge and perfect and huge.

We split an order of musubi. The kid loves musubi! I'm finally starting to come around to the idea that he might be mine after all.

The kid got the the bulgogi cheesesteak. Bulgogi + melted cheese+ peppers and onions = YES! I swear he tried to bite me when I reach over to get a taste.

Thanks Komex! You're the best! 

P.S. Still waiting the the SW joint
