So my fiance and I came here really early they open at 7am got to come in a little early they saw us at the for opened them up very nice people.) We were just going to wait the extra minutes) 
Hot or drinks,chips salsa, bean dip so fast ordered at first I thought it was a bit pricey but as soon as our orders came out oh my goodness I knew why they give you a great deal amount for what you pay so it's great not to mention their staff is on it you need something they will get it for you to make you comfortable
