My husband and I were left stranded in Charlotte by US Airways, so we had to find a hotel and dinner. The hotel clerk recommended Miguel's and we are glad! Don't let the slightly rundown look of the building discourage you from eating here. The place was filled with people in both their inside and outside dining areas when we arrived around 8 pm, so we knew the food had to be good.  My hubby ordered a plate of enchiladas that were stuffed full of chicken and he said the sauce was wonderful. My Arroz con Pollo was absolutely the best I have ever eaten, and I order this dish at almost every Mexican restaurant I visit. Also, don't forget to try their flour tortillas...they are fresh!
