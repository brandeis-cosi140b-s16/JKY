So for the past 5 years my family and I have literally lived 5 minutes from this location, passed by it at least 5 times per week, always heard great things yet decided to go for the first time today. Needless to say that we have been missing out! 

Great parking setup despite the location (tight commercial area near DI and Eastern) and wonderful and authentic atmosphere inside. Traditional attire, non-obtrusive and traditional music over the speaker and a live Mariachi band that stopped through to provide an awesome performance. 

The service was awesome and it really felt like we had two waiters since we kept getting effective follow-up from the staff. The entire experience felt like the popular El Cholo restaurants in Los Angeles...but with better pricing, selections and food portions. Speaking of selections I was shocked to see almost 10 or more entree selections for EVERY meat group (seafood, fish chicken, beef and pork). I chose the Fajitas de Res.....BUT had to get a to-go box immediately since I got full from the unlimited chips and salsa and multiple Cadillac Margaritas lol

Overall, this is our definite go-to authentic Mexican food restaurant from now on.
