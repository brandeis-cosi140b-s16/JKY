This is my 2nd time here and both times I was not disappointed. Get there early because the lines do get long but it's worth the wait. I got the carne asada tacos and mini quesedillas, total of 4 tacos and 2 minis at 8.00 is a great price. This fed both javier and I. They are not skimpy with the meat and it has lots of flavor. The red salsa also has a good kick to it. I will continue to go back.
