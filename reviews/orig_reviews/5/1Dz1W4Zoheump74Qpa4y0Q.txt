1st off its crazy all the comments about the neighborhood it is not a bad at all...its older but no reason to pull out the bullet proof vest ....anyways I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.....FOOD IS GREAT...tortillas are real good...are home made and just so good , I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas but of the ones here I can't help myself..meat has a great flavor ....fish tacos are yummy and  menudo tastes just like my abuelitas..... Very clean..everyone is friendly.... If u haven't eaten here yet u really need to try it....u will not regret it...
