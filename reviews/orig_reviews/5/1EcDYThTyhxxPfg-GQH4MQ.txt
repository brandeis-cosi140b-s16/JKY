Being from San Diego and having spent a lot of time in Mexico, these tacos are about as authentic as you can find.  I'm pretty sure they are horrible for you, but they're tacos...what do you expect?

What I like is that everything is made to order.  It doesn't sit under a heat lamp getting all dried out and rubbery.  The tortillas are hand made right in front of you.

Oh...if they only sold tacos con birria de res...one can only wish.
