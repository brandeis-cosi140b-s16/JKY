Average five star user ratings can't be wrong! They hardly need my review but I was so impressed I had to add to them. The owner lady said it's too bad we're vegetarian because her meat stuff is apparently the best. Well, even the vegetarian options were excellent. I've never had a better vegetarian taco salad, and we also had a veggie burrito with a stupendous tomato tortilla.
