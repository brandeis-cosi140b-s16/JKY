Great Mexican food with a twist! The table-side avocado has great flavor and is made to your level of spice tolerance. It comes with dried cranberries, which sounded odd but tasted really good in it. The chips are homemade and the salsa has good flavor to it. There about 20 tacos to choose from in addition to many other specialty dishes. The pork carnita and the carne asada tacos were delicious! They have a variety of tequilas and specialty drinks to choose from. A great addition to Gilbert!
