Our waiter informed us that this restaurant was more collaboration than fusion. At first this was confusing but after many small, delicious plates emerged from the kitchen, I understood. I love Chinese and Mexican food and this place brought out some great flavors from both nations. Pot stickers, dumplings, an awesome fried rice dish and a very tender Mongolian beef were complimented by tacos, guacamole..you get the idea. The hostesses graciously seated us right away on a packed night and the view from the casino/patio was outstanding. Not outrageously expensive either like most casino restaurants so overall a great choice in the Cosmo.
