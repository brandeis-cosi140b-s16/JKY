Ok, I love this place 
It has great food and great prices.
The friendliest staff "which is not always easy to find in Vegas" Raphael the graveyard bartender makes it an enjoyable experience. Always remembers me and what I like to drink. His food recommendations are spot on. Lots of laughs  Thanks for the great night Raphael you are definitely one of my favorite bartenders, see ya soon
