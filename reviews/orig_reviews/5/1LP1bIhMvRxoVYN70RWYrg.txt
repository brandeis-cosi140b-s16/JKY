This unassuming Mexican joint that serves burgers is actually pretty damn good! I found this on Yelp and decided to give it a whirl considering all of the positive reviews. The burritos are fresh with a lot of condiments to choose from in the salsa bar: 6 different salsas, whole roasted jalapenos, pickled onions/carrots/jalapenos, cilantro and limes. The tortillas are homemade and everything is cooked to order. I would usually get either a fajita burrito or the egg and potato breakfast burrito. I have quite an insatiable appetite, but it's loaded with so much food it's difficult to finish. The people there are pleasant as well. I'm going to miss visiting this place after I move...
