This place is pretty good!  They serve rice soup with the Entree's.  When they bring the chips they also bring some grilled or marinated onions and green chile slices which I really enjoyed.  Includes salsa and bean dip.  If you read my Mex dining reviews you know I'm sensitive to salt.  THIS PLACE WAS NOT TOO SALTY!!!  PERFECT saltiness.  The fajitas are great, the servers were attentive.  All in all pretty good experience.
