This is the real deal Authentic Mexican, on the Vegas strip! You don't need to know Spanish but you might end up learning some by the time you leave. Good stuff. The store surroundings is brightly lit and there's a security guard that looks like he means business. My favorite taco flavor was the one with the pineapple sliver. The way it works is you walk down the line, picking up the tacos from each one of the dedicated stands. Each stand has dedicated meats. Take all your food and pay at the cash register in the corner. It's all kind of honor-code that way. For some extra crunch, try a the whole fresh radish and take alternate-bites with your tacos.
