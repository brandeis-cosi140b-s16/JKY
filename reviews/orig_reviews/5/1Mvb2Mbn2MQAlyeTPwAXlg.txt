Need to update my review:  I went back to Distrito twice this week.  Once, while attending The Taste of Scottsdale food tour.  I was impressed this time around!  On the food tour we had guac and chips. Both were home made and delish!  We also had a stuffed pepper appetizer and a pork taco.  All tasted excellent. The presentation was nice too.  The atmosphere and vibe is better at night as well!   Great location in the heart of Scottsdale civic center!
