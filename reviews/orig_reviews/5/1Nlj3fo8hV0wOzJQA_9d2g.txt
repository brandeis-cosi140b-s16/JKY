The table side guac with pomegranate is amazing. I was skeptical for sure. A menu full of food combos that make you wonder, but are so good. The skinny margarita was delicious. Highly recommend checking this place out. The only downside is that we didn't receive very good service. Sat for about 10 minutes before seeing our waiter. Luckily we had our margaritas that we got from the bar while waiting for the table. Never saw him during our meal and had to flag him down for our check. The food more than made up for it, though. Tip - we drove past it twice when looking for it. Not well lit and very unassuming from the outside so keep your eyes peeled when trying to find it.
