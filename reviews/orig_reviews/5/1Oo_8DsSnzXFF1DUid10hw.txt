I am giving this place five stars for the food as the Tacos are the bomb and the sauces that you get with them are so damn good as well, get the beet or avocado sauce, they just make the Tacos amazing, which they already are. 

I am giving the bar staff especially Jen 10 stars for serving the best drinks, I don't know what the Snottdale crowd is complaining about the service being slow? Seems some of these reviewers are use to people catering to themselves, Diego Pops is laid back, no need for that garbage. 

The only problem we had was I brought my dog after coming from the Dog Park, the girl manager on duty was just so you know we don't allow dogs on the patio, I was like didn't know Since its a awesome patio for dogs. My dog is well behaved and people seemed to be not bothered by him. He was getting a lot of hellos and hey's, manager comes over and states " we cant have your dog here" while I was eating my tacos and drinking a beer? I told her we would leave once we were done, I've been here since the beginning since this placed opened and she's a new manager, but the way she said it  the second time was completely "rude" and there was no need, since my dog was sitting by my chair at the bar and there was so issues. Its too bad Diego Pops doesn't allow dogs here, because it has the perfect patio for it.

I still will come here after this experience, because I am about good food and great service from the friendly servers and bartenders.
