Be prepared to wait a lil bit.  We arrived around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was a line out the door, probably like 6 people ish ahead of us, waited about 5 minutes to order, and another 10 to get food, but they bring out your drinks to you while you wait so it doesn't feel like a long time at all.  Very friendly cashier to order with, explained options, then you choose a seat, and they find you and give you your drinks and food later.

The cheese burgers are excellent, get grilled onions if you get a chance.  They also have great horchata, nice and creamy and just the right amount of sweet.  You even get free refills apparently if you stay long enough.
