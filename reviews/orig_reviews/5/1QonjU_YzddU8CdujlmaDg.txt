Just like in San Diego! I am a regular when ever I visit National City and it's great to know that we have one in town... I just wish it wasn't on the other side of town! The place is setup almost exactly like the one in National City. The owner is real nice an we even had a chat with her while we were there.

If you've never been here before, Tacos El Gordo is basically like a taco stand and has TJ (Tijuana) style tacos-- small tacos but full of goony goodness!

My favorite is the adobada taco with an horchata and sometimes I'll have a carne asada taco as well. I usually don't venture outside of that because, well, everything else is made from things I prefer not to eat like intestine, "cabeza"... Uhm, yea, I love my choices lol.

Word to the weaklings to the spicy stuff, such as myself, always ask for no spicy sauce or "NO CHILI POR FAVOR" :) Their spicy stuff is pretty spicy for myself, I usually get the salsa verde on the side.

We'll be back, not sure how often since it's way on the other side of town :(
