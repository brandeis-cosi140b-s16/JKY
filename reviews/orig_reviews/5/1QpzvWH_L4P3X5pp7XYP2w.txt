This chicken continues to be absolutely fantastic. Juicy chicken, crispy skin, excellent beans and marinated onions... Ahhh I love it all. 

It's also nice that you only have two choices; beef or chicken. Somedays I don't want to waste my brain power deciding between 101 different items. 

They still only take cash. And they are still my favorite quick lunch in Tempe.
