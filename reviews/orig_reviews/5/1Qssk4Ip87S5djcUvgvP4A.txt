Being a native New Mexican, finding good food outside of Santa Fe is difficult for me, but this is as close as it gets when it comes to a great new Mexican restaurant in AZ.

The green Chile was good the red was awesome, had the enchiladas which were awesome and also the posole was great. 

Wait staff was nice,the place had a great vibe, I will definitely be going back many more times.
