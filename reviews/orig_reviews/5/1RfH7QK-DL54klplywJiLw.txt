Tia Rosas is one of our favorite places to take visitors and to get that Mexican cuisine fix.  I've never had a bad meal here and neither has any of our guests.  It's usually fairly busy so get there early.  Only thing I can complain about is that they didn't keep the location on McKellips open!  We love this place!
