What huh where is this? Completely speak easy style and definitely packed to the gills! We hit it around 4 and got lucky enough for a table to open up. Dick the owner happened to be there and assured us we would have a table soon. Got us all drinks while we waited and sure enough got seated and ordered some amazing food. My dad ordered the enchiladas I got the pork plate and my stepmom won with some sort of steak and pasta plate. All the food was amazing and the plates are scorching hot I literally still have a burn on my forearm but completely worth it. Place was just a hidden gem even down to strolling through the kitchen to use the bathroom.  If you get lucky enough to get in it is definitely worth it!
