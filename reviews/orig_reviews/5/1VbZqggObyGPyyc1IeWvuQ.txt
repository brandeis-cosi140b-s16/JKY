This is my favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much because I am a very good cook and typically just cook at home because it tastes better and saves money... But Popos... I couldn't stop going here! Their chips and salsa is the best around (and I've been to all Mexican restaurants) plus it's free! I always get a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style, the portions are huge so I always have a nice lunch for the next day. I'm vegetarian except for their tacos LOL.. I don't eat any other meat, but when I tried to stop eating their tacos it made me sad. So I caved in. Their beef tacos are so delicious! The atmosphere isn't my favorite but it's not bad. They did just redo the front waiting area, but being in AZ most people don't sit outside in the heat so that was kind of silly.. I do and would highly recommend Popos!
