This place is insane! I've never been to the SD location but heard that it's delicious. I stumbled upon the Las Vegas branch and was like I HAVE TO TRY THIS! Upon entering this place, you better know what you want and where to get it because they will get you in and out ASAP. To the far left you got the adobado, middie is the carne asada and far right is the counter for brain, intestines, stomach, lengua (my favorite!!!). You can make about anything with the different types of meat. I tried the Carne Asada fries, carne asada taco, mula con adobado, tongue mula and adobado fries. I actually had a Tacos El Gordo Sandwich (what is this??)...which involves TWO visits to TACOS EL GORDO within a 9 hour time frame with my first and last meal of the day being at this establishment with some more foodie (Korean bbq) and Las Vegas show in between. Probably my most BIG GIRL night in a long time. 

They also speak Spanish to you like you know Spanish. So brush up on your Spanish or get lost in translation. Drinks are $1.40 and there's only one size...BUT you get unlimited Ole drinks (mmmmz Orange Bang....). Indoor seating is scarce because they get filled up so quickly. Everyone wants to eat here at all times of the day, I swear. Never worked so hard to enjoy my food, but it's well worth it. If this place is too hectic for ya, try their other location off the strip approximately 3 miles away.

Anyhoo, I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! The food is delicious and everything else street Mexican is unacceptable now (unless someone proves me otherwise). Thanks for setting the standard Tacos El Gordo!
