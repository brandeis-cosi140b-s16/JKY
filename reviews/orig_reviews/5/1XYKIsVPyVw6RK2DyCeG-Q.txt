Went here for a late lunch today. Ordered the guacamole that they make for you at your table and it was awesome!! My dds gobbled it all up, we might have to get 2 next time. I had the carne asade house special and it was one of the best carne asadas I've had. My dh loved the carne asada tacos and chicken enchilada. Really good mexican food! I'm out in Queen Creek so it's a little drive for us but we will definitely be back. And our waitress Lola was really great!! :)
