Delicious! Authentic! Generous! Cheap!

First mexican restaurant that exceeds expectations since moving to arizona. Thought I'd be drowning in delicious mexican food when I moved here but it's been like a needle in a haystack finding a good burrito! I mean the fact that chipotle was the tops said it all, smh.

Fun atmosphere although the mannequin playing the piano kept me looking back over my shoulder lol. Has a chipotle like assembly line but they offer tastings of every topping and meat like an ice cream shop. Very considerate. Few beers and Mexican sodas but most importantly there was a vegan option for me and plenty of meat options for my hubby. Generous portions and very friendly staff and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh. 

Nothing says fresh and nothing to hide like an open kitchen and fresh avacados sliced in front of you to go on your burrito. Salsa bar topped if off though I wish they would label the salsa flavors, it was hard to guess what was hot or mild. We got drinks, salsa, 2 massive burritos and soft tacos and our bill was still under $30! Now if I only lived closer..
