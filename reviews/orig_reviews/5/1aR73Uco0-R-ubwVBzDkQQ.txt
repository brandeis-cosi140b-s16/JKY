It appears I only give good reviews from my profile, but really, it's cause I only take time to yelp for businesses I think are amazing! This place is one such place. The sangria knocked my socks off. The watermelon salad took me to a happy, summery place I could not imagine, and the chile relleno was unique, tasty and just, OMG. The front of this place is deceiving. The inside if kinda chic and not expected. The owner, Irma, is ready available. Service was great and the food was imaginative, and actually tasted as good as it looked! This place is a must!
