Went to this restaurant last week while visiting the area, and I love it. Very busy restaurant and great atmosphere. Our waiter was attentive but not hovering, and friendly. We had a pitcher of frozen strawberry margaritas---YUM! Enough for 4 of us to have 2 drinks each. Chips (free) came with 3 different salsas and were all excellent. Entrees were generous and priced well. Definitely recommend.
