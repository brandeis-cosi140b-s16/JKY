Yeah, I'm giving this place 5 stars. Why? Probably one of the top 5 things I tell people to do when they are going to Vegas for the first time is: "Go to the Tequila Bar in the back of Bally's. Order the marinated Patron they called the Infused."
Thank me later.
Also, $2 tacos. 
Also, many other cheap drinks & eats that can fill you up on the heart of the strip without being overpriced like so many other nearby options. And it's always open! 
Always have to stop by here.
