Great find...we decided to try this fairly new arrival to the Mexican food market, and, glad we did. The restaurant decor is very nice, including a large bar. They also have a nice patio for outside dining. We were greeted at the door promptly and decided on outside dining with the evening being nice. Our waitress was prompt in taking our drink order and returned with chips and a great roasted salsa. We choose the Green Chili ENCHILADAS, which were excellent. Creamy and spicy with moist chicken. Our other selection was the gourmet tacos. Choosing the Baja fish taco, filled with a nicely battered white fish fillet, fresh cabbage, and wonderful sauce. The other was the carne asada taco. The meat was tender and moist, and very flavorful. They are served on either corn or flour tortilla, or, as a lettuce wrap. At $4.50 this was priced right. We ordered a side of Charro Beans, which could use some spice/heat. The prices were very good. The chips and salsa, first rate. The service was very good, too. We would definitely return to try more items on the menu...
