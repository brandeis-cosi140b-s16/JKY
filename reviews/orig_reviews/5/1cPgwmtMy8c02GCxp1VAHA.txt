Having spent a lot of time in the last few years in SoCal and Tijuana, I have been to many-a-Mexican restaurant. But this one takes the cake. It's on the pricey side for what it is, but the food and service are both top-notch.

One caveat: SOMETIMES the service slips. After raving to my dad about how amazing the service was, I took him there, and our waitress only dropped by for our order and the bill, and the wait times were ridiculous. I looked like a fool!
