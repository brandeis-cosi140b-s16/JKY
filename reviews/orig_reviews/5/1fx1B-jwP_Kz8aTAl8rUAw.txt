wow. i can see why this place needed a second location! i have a new favorite mexican restaurant and its name is el encanto dos! 

let's start with drinks. my prickly pear margarita was fantastic. his beer was cold, and reasonably priced to boot! the cute little carafe of water (with a lemon slice) on the table was a nice touch as well. it was that kind of attention to detail that impressed me. next was the chips and salsa. i didn't get the feeling that the chips were made in house (boo), but the salsa tasted like it was. it had a little spicy kick and the ingredients tasted very fresh.

and now the food ... what a wow factor! the beef taquitos were our starter. they were crispy and the meat was plentiful. the avocado/tomatillo dipping sauce was super yummy! for the main event i had to take daren c. and pity d.'s advice on the fundido. when delivered, it did not disappoint ... a cheesy, white meat chicken delight. by far the best one i've ever had. he had the shredded beef tacos and said they were very good ... they must have been because he cleaned his plate before i could snag a bite. we both loved the rice and i was kicking myself saturday morning that i didn't bring it home with me for breakfast.

our meal was timed perfectly. prices were just right. our server never pulled a disappearing act. our meal for 2 was $55 including a 20% tip. a perfect, reasonably priced restaurant to take out of town guests to that will impress without being pretentious. as we left i imagined having a relaxing meal on a cool fall evening on the el encanto dos patio ... i can't wait!
