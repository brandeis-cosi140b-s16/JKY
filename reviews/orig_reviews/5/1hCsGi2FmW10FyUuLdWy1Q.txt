Wow! This is the place to get an awesome unique dining experience and some amazing spicy food.  My girlfriends and I came here for a girls night out and the staff was so friendly and inviting.  We ordered some Sangritas and they were great.  The chips were warm and salsa spicy, just the way I love it. 
For dinner I ordered the adovada ribs... Sour cream on the side.  The server suggested I tried half regular beans and half spicy (since I said I love beans and didn't feel like rice) and the beans were delicious.  One friend ordered a red chile enchilada- I had a bite and was tempted to order one to take home for lunch the next day. 
There was a great birthday celebration at the table next to us.  My only regret was not leaving room for dessert. 
Meal portions are great. Staff is friendly. Drinks are refreshing. Ambiance is fun.  I can't wait to go back!
