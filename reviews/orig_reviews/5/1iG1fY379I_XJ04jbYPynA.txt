One word: margaritas!

This is a spot I always suggest on date nights because I love the margaritas and food here!

We came here most recently on a Friday during happy hour.  Fortunately happy hour is available through the entire restaurant!  We of course got the Chambord margaritas, only $5 during happy hour.  This would be one of the most perfect margaritas in town if I never found out the calories: over 400!  Too bad because 3 of these babies will have you down & out!

We shared the shrimp guacamole bites first which were very good & not too heavy.  The shrimp has a delicious grilled flavor that really enhances the bite.  Next we did the catfish tacos, really yummy!  These are two flour tortillas rolled with catfish avocado & cabbage.  Lastly we shared the pork tostadas which were decent but not as light as the first two apps.

The best thing here is the achiote chicken chopped salad!  Usually this is what we order, and I love how they will mix it at your table.  Usually I keep the dressing on the side & don't let them mix it.
