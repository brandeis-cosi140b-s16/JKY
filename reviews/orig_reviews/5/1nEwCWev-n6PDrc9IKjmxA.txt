It does not get any better than this place, I wish they had a location in the NW Valley but it probably wouldn't be as cool.  I love the casual atmosphere (has a rocky point feel to it) and you usually get good service.  When they are really busy I just get my drinks from the center bar and it is always fast.  It is also not too loud here when you are having a conversation like many other places.  Prices aren't bad either, just my favorite all around bar that seems always to be busy just because it is too cool.  Oh and the food is good too.
