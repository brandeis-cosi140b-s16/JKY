Love love this place! We love bringing out of town guests here because the food is excellent and the atmosphere is on point. There is normally a wait however we never mind because we either grab a drink at the roof top bar, sip a cocktail by the pool or check out the live entertainment they occasionally have. The walls inside and outside the restaurant feature art from local artists - I love a restaurant that supports it's
Local community! The food is also very very good and well priced! Drink sangria, eat tacos, it's a win!
