Sure, it's pricey for Mexican, but keeping in mind it's located within a 5 star resort it's par for the course. That however is where the normalcy ends... Fantastic food, probably the best Mexican in town. Filet is incredible. Guac is as good as it gets. I've never had a bad bite of food here. The flaming coffees I literally crave on a regular basis. The service has always been great and the GM is first class. I've had a couple issues with a lost reservation once  and a long wait on another occasion during a busy time and he always accommodated us in a very friendly and proffesional manner and he made us feel very welcomed and  "noticed" if that makes sense. This should be commonplace in a restaurant that commands such a high dollar, but it's always amazing to me how seldom that really is the case. La hacienda is a wonderful experience from front to back every time I've been.
