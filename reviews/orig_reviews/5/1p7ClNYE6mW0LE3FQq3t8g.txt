This place is so adorable. I went here with a friend, and the prices are really good! The inside is on the small side, but their outdoor patio is HUGE. We ate outside on a lovely evening, and I felt like I was at a Mexican-backyard-party! It was a lot of fun, and it is beautiful on their patio! I can't wait to go back on another beautiful day!
