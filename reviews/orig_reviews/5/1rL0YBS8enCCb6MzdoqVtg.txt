This is our 4th visit to Barrio Queen since they opened and it has been fantastic every time! Today was beautiful out so for the first time, we dined outside. They have a great misting system, but most days here in summer, that's just not enough! Today however it was a lovely experience. My daughter ordered the Arizona Burrito and I had the appetizer order of seasoned fries with green chile pork. Ah.May.Zing! We actually go back each time just for those loaded up fries. Delicious!! The food was hot, fresh, attractively displayed and tasty as always. Portions large and fairly priced. Service, as always, was top notch! Our server Sherrie was attentive and very friendly. Brought refills without prompting, offered to go cup without our having to ask and cleared empties so our table stayed unobstructed and pleasant throughout. They can get busy during peak times but it's still worth the effort. 5 stars!!
