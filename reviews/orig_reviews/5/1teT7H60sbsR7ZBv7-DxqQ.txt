Very glad we found this place through Yelp!! We've been there twice now. The very first time we visited, I thought the area looked a little run down (due to road construction), but it's VERY NICE inside of their building!

Pros:
- FOOD! Things we've tried: chicken chimichanga, pork enchilada, beef flauta/taquito, beef enchilada, beef taco... everything is so good! Nothing is greasy - everything is full of flavor! Their chips and salsa are delicious! Perfect balance of heat and chunkiness! The proportions are huge! Even the kids meals are big! Such great value.
- SERVICE! Great service. We've gotten the same waitress both times we went and she is great! Plus, everyone there seems so helpful and constantly offer help with chip refills, drink refills, just checking up. It's amazing.
- APPEARANCE: The inside of their building is very nice. Nice decor, nice cantina setup. Everything looks very clean and new.

Cons:
- NONE! 

I'm so glad we found this place and will definitely become regulars here and I hope this business thrives! 

Sincerely,
A new loyal customer
