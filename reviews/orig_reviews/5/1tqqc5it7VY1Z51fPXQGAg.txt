Once again, one of my favorite gems of Henderson. Authentic, specialty Mexican items that you are unlikely to find in most local Mexican restaurants. This place is a must try. 

My personal favorietes: I order the esquites and eat them with chips(looks small, but fills you up quick!), quesadilla arabe is solid if you want simple and awesome combined, pelonas, molletes, enchilladas de salsa verde and the steak tacos are great. You may notice that the portions are not overwhelming.......that's OK, because the amount of care in preparing these dishes and the taste are both overwhelming and thoroughly satisfying. If you are a big eater, typically two dishes will do the trick. 

I urge anyone trying this place to try different things as the owner is constantly adding new items and I am thoroughly impressed each time I try something new.

Tip: if you have picky kids(I do!) the owner will make specialty sandwiches with what the kids like. I think they should try to drum up a kids menu, but know they are flexible with accommodating children.
