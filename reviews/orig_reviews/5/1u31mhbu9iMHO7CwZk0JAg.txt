Maize or what I like to call (Mah-eez) is phenomenal. Good quality, good quantity, good prices, and good service. I use to eat here numerous times a week because of those factors. Honestly, I was not disappointed by a single thing on the menu. If you're hungry, go burrito. If you're low on cash, go quesadilla. If you're looking for something new, go tostadas. One suggestion I would make would be to go at off hours because the line can be quite long.
