This place is great. They have good service, fantastic food and awesome drinks. I'm not even a person that normally orders salads, but I love the pecan crusted chicken salad with goat cheese ad warm bacon vinaigrette.  They Chambord margaritas is my favorite drink. I crave this place at least once a month.
