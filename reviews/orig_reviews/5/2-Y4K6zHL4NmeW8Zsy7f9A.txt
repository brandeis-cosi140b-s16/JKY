I've been to Vegas at least 6 times and have missed out on a simple pleasure! This place is amazing! Authentic quick Mexican food from Tijuana Mexico.  My husband and I have eaten there 3 times so far on this trip, yes I said "so far". Lol. I do warn that the fries are HUGE. I recommend ordering a small(half the price and size). Yummmmmmm
