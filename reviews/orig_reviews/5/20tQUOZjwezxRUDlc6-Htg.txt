I was really impressed with most everything here. 5 stars all around.  They put thought into their cocktail menu even barrel aging some of their cocktails, which of course brings up the price point, but my barrel aged Manhattan was fantastic!  They have an excellent whiskey selection as well!  The tacos I ordered where all amazing as well!  Each on was well balanced in flavor and cooked to perfection.  Service was fantastic as well! However, I did visit on a Monday and was only one of two people in the restaurant so I will have to visit again and see if they hold up under a rush as well.
