I was with a party of 5 last night for my friends' daughters 21st birthday!  They went over and above to make the occasion special.  They gave us a table in the corner with the BEST view in the house.  The service was 5 star all the way as was the good.  The all sang happy birthday, and gave the birthday girl a shot and dessert, on the house.  Pure Class!  She loved the margaritas and they outdid themselves on the food.  A GREAT time was had by all!
