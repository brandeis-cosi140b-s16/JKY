The Stand is simply delicious!!!!
They will hook you up with amazing tacos, impressive burgers and all natural fries. This place is a must visit!! The service is phenomenal, ever so friendly as well as informative!! This places delivers quality and value!! My favorite is the Standard with cheese, it includes two house-ground patties offering crisp hand-leafed lettuce, fresh tomato, sliced onion, crinkle cut dill pickles, american cheese and their special stand sauce with added grilled jalape√±o peppers. AMAZINGLY GREAT!! Oh and lets not forget the side of fresh cut fries and an iced cold Horchata. 
SIMPLY PERFECT!! :)
