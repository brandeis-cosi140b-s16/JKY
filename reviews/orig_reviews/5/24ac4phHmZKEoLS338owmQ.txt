OMG! La Condesa, I love you! 

If you drive too fast down 16th on your way downtown, you just might miss this little, neighborhood taco joint...and it will be your loss. 

La Condesa is a delightful little 10-12 seat restaurant with seating also available at the bar. The wait staff are courteous, helpful and knowlegable about the food. There is a salsa bar with no less than 15 freshly made salsas.. everything from your standard pico de gallo to a strawberry jalapeno and a spicy chipotle peanut. We've been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Try the Sonoran Carne Asada Arrachera steak marinated with Mexican herbs, fresh garlic & olive oil, charbroiled with mesquite charcoal or the Mayan Cochinita Roasted Pork Shoulder Taco with marinated onions and salsa habanera. If you order the "taco plate" for a few dollars more, you can get sides of their slow cooked beans and rice.

This is a place nice enough to take your mom and trendy (and inexpensive) enough to take your out of town hipster friends. 

Total neighborhood foodie heaven on a budget.
