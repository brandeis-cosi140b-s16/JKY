My favorite authentic Mexican food in the East Valley! The food is always amazing and the green salsa is worth coming for alone!! It gets quite busy so be prepared to wait. When it's busy it feels like you're in the way while walking through the restaurant because the servers are always in a hurry and they could probably save themselves some time by providing larger containers for chips so you don't have to ask them to keep refilling it. Overall, I really love this restaurant and enjoy eating there anytime I'm town.
