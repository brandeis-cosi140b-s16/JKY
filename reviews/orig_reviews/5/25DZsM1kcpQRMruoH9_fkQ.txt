Another visit to our home away from home. Can't believe how many years we have been coming here. The Red and Green Chile and frozen Margaritas keep us coming back. 

I am not a fan of the "chain" restaurants, they cater to a different crowd. This is a place that is not for everyone, but as their slogan says, "Those that like it Hot!" This is the place for me.
