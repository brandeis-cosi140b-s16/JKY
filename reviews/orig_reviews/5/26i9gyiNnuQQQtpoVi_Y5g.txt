Still great.  Carnitas tacos are probably the best in town (only been to Maize once, though).  My husband and I had a horrible realization one night when we got Taco Bell and only afterwards realized it was $1 taco night at Huaraches.  Noooooooo, worst decision ever!  In summary, Taco Bell is awful and not even that cheap anymore.  Go to Huaraches instead.
