Mucho oishii! Another great fusion spot! Sushi burritos are nothing new, but Jaburritos is easily one of the best I have ever had. Jaburritos does not make me miss sushi burritos from SF, LA, or food trucks at all! 

The menu is simple: 
1) Pre designed concoctions: *probably the most popular choice if trying for the first time*
2) Build your own sushi burrito, jachos, or rice bowl.

Items tried:
- Redondo: If you love raw fish it is loaded with yellowtail, ahi tuna, and salmon! Not the most flavorful, but flavors can be enhanced with the house soy sauce and extra wasabi! Or salsa from the salsa bar, if that's your thang. 

- Long beach: One of my favorites! It has shrimp tempura, surimi crab, and spicy tuna. The flavors of the chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce puts it over the top!

- Baja: Yellowtail and spicy tuna. Good, but not great. I only sampled this. I think it needed a second flavor profile. The yuzu guacamole alone did not have the oomph. Maybe a salty/sweet element was missing?

- Jachos with ahi tuna and toppings of your choice! Imagine the set up like Chipotle or Subway. 

- Taro chips with queso. So addicting. The whole idea of "cheese" is weird at first, but totally works! Love that these chips are dusted with furikake!

I love the high quality fish, house made sauces, fresh ingredients, and nice touches like the crunch from the tortilla strips!  

Workers are friendly and have a great attitude. My initial visit, they were less efficient and still working out the kinks. Second visit, was much improved. I would imagine it would only get even better with time. 

Be prepared to wait, but so WORTH it!
