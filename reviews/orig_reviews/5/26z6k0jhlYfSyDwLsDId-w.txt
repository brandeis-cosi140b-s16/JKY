Me and the wifey go here all the time and we are never disappointed! It's super good, they have some awesome seasoned steak that we usually put in a bowl with seaweed rice. You can do burritos, bowls, tacos ect. It's all island style. We actually talked with the owner, he's a pretty cool guy. Good place, good set up, and um, make sure to buy the coconut bark because its extremely addictingly good. Seriously, if you are hungry, go there now haha
