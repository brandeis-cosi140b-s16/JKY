This restaurant has very good Mexican dishes with friendly service.  I love that they make their corn tortillas right in front of you and the chips are always fresh and delicious.  Please DO NOT confuse this with the Lindo Michoac√°n locations as I do NOT like them at all as their quality is significantly less than Michoacan location in Centennial.  Give them a try, worth the drive as excellent food and I have NOT had bad service in all the times that I have been here.
