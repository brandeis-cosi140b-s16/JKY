There are not enough superlatives to describe this restaurant.  I cant even begin to describe how delicious my Carnitas were.  Served with warm fresh tortillas I wanted to lick my plate clean.   Killer chips, salsa, and bean dip Great service, incredibly cute bus boy, and reasonably priced.  I will be going back on my next visit to Las Vegas.
