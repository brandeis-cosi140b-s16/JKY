Let me start by saying this.....Get here and get the fish tacos! 

The fish is very lightly breaded Swai and it's perfectly seasoned with a nice crunch to the outside and a very tender flaky inside. The torilla is flour not corn and it's served with a Chipotle mayo and cabbage. You can get grilled onions and Jalapenos on the side no additional charge and it's delish! I really enjoy the mild salsa served with them. They are on the small side 3 or 4 bites tops so order 3 or 4 of these gems!

I am trying to work my way through the entire menu however I love the fish taco's so much I have just been adding things here and there or bringing a friend with me to try what they get. :)

I have had their Quesadilla's the cheese is good, the Qusadilla with Carne Asada is really good the pork is on the sweet side which I enjoyed. It may not be for everyone. The Quesadilla's are very large and cheesy!

I did venture out and try the Molote (masa fritter with potao and chorizo) It was not real spicy which I had expected it to be with Chorizo but I really liked it. The texture was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside the topping was black bean and oaxaca cheese. 

This is a great little dive!
