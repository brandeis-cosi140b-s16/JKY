So we decided to try chayo at the linq with some hesitation. Visiting the strip can be expensive, but the ambiance of televisions and easy on the eyes women made it an easy choice. The chips and salsa are excellent and my waitress Christina recommended the lobster tacos. It was a great recommend, because I originally did not see them on the menu. What an awesome dish, full of flavors and tender lobster with a generous portion to boot.  Christina gave great service throughout and I can tell she was being genuine and put forth extra effort to make my experience an A++
