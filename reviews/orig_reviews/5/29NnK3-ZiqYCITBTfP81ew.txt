One of the benefits of staying at the Wynn is it's close proximity to Tacos El Gordo.  

Tacos El Gordo is a must visit place for my buddy and I when we're in Vegas.  It really is that good.  

All the tacos are great, but the spicy pork is something special, which likely explains why the lines for pork are ALWAYS longer than the lines for beef.  Each line serves pork or beef, but not both, so you need to pay attention to what line you're in.  

This place pulls a crowd more or less ALL THE TIME, so be prepared.  But, they are set up for a crowd, and the lines move pretty quick.

Note:  No alcohol is served, only soft drinks.
