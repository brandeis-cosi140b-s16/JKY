My first impression of this restaurant was not so great but by the end we left happy. I ordered the nachos and the cheese quesadilla which were a huge disappointment. The nachos were made with gross cheese sauce rather than actual cheese and the quesadilla was just not satisfying. Our waiter asked how the food was and we told the truth and he was so accommodating and switched out our food right away. We got the chicken tortilla soup and it was SO much better! He came back to make sure we were happy this time around. He even removed all of the food from the bill. What Great service!! Great margaritas! Will come back again
