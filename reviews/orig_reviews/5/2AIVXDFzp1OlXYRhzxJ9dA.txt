So my company informed us of this little gem. The food was so flavorful. The decor was very cute. The service outstanding. Had Rick as our waiter and he made sure we were well taken care of. I had the Tamales, my dad had the Chile Reno and my step mom had the Chimichanga. My step mom is one of the pickiest eaters ever and she walked out saying it was so good and can't wait to come back. My dad is real picky about his beans, he chose the pinto and said they were the best he has ever eaten in a restaurant. The tamales were packed with the red chile pork. EVERYTHING was so delicious. They are working on their alcohol license but it did not matter once we tasted the food. It was hot, fresh and did not take long at all to come to the table.
It's a little tucked away in the corner but worth the search. I'm hoping they will be around for a long time and become very successful. You have to try this New Mexico food it is worth it!
