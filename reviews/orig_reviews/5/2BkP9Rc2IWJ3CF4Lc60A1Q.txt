I have had almost every dish in this place and so far each one that I've had has been absolutely delicious. All of the meats ( chicken, pork, fish, and steak) are are flavorful and savory. The vegetables and sides that they have available are all fresh and tasty. When they combine the two its magic. I also love the way that you can see how they prepare your dish. The staff is great and friendly. They also make you feel super welcome. I highly recommend this little taste of Hawaii to everyone.
