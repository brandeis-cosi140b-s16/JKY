I can't get enough of this place. From the stellar drinks to the kicks ass guacamole! It can get busy at times and the service will slow a bit, but not for lack of trying on the staff's behalf.  Every time I have gone (which is a lot)  the drinks a good and strong, and the food is fantastic!  I have taken both my mother and sister and they are fans!  I'll definitely continue to frequent the Cantina!!! :)
