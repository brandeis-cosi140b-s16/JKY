We arrived and it was 3 minutes until closing and they treated us amazingly.   They did not close the door on us and they insisted we come in and order and waited for us until we were done.   Customer service is not dead at this place.   In addition, the food was amazingly good.   Tacos al carbon were delicious.  The corn was spicy but good.   I will be returning.
