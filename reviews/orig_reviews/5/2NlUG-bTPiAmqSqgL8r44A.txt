Wow!  We loved this place enough to hit it twice in a 3 day trip to Scottsdale. Everything from the look, the service, and of course, the food!  Fabulous margaritas and excellent presentation on the food.  We had the guacamole several times and I did think the first batch was clearly the best but it is great anyway and is prepared to your dining preferences.
