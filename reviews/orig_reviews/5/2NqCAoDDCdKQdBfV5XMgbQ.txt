Great little homey (it's literally in an old converted home) taco shop.  Ate there for lunch before going to a busy all-day event at the Phoenix Convention Center, and couldn't go wrong with ordering three of their beef tacos.  Paired it with a delicious Mexican Coke in a bottle to make for a great lunch.  Highly recommend this place if you're in the downtown area, it's worth the little drive to it.  Arguably some of the best tacos in town.
