By far the best breakfast burrito I've tried in my 21 1/2ish years I have been on this planet!

And I am a tough judge. I generally only eat breakfast if it's really worth it. No time to cook before school can only mean limp boring toast or cereal. I'd rather skip straight to the coffee.

When I have time to make something, breakfast burritos are at the top of my list! I'm a pretty good cook, but nothing I could ever make would compare to Favoritos.

I used to order the ham&cheese burrito and have since mixed in the chorizo burrito. They are great! Filled with eggs, meat, potatoes, onions and a great blend of spices all wrapped up in a doughy tortilla.  They also will give me as much hot sauce as I need, which is usually a couple tubs. 

I would go far more often if I lived closer! I still pretend I am a regular.
