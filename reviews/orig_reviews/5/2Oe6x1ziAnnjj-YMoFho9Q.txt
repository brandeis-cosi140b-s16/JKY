SO delicious!  I am still working my way around the menu, so I am not sure yet which is my favorite.  However, there hasn't been a single disappointment.  The bulgogi tacos, tostada and chimichanga were all fantastic and service has always been super-friendly.
I could be happy just with the free chips, salsa and guacamole and they always taste so fresh.
