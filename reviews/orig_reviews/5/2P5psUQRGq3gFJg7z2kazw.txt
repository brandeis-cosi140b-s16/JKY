Had a 12:30 reservation for brunch. This place was great! Tapas (small plate) style all you can eat brunch! Rachel was our server,she was great! AMAZING service and great suggestions. A manager even touched the table to inquire how everything was! Never had to ask for anything! All in all A+++ to staff,management,and owners!
