Awesome street tacos. Fresh guac. Fresh margs.  Can it get any better? Is this really fast food? Never in my life would I have ever thought I would choose carne asada over al pastor but - well - I guess things change. Honestly, I'm still a bit more than amazed by my experiences here. Nicely done America!
