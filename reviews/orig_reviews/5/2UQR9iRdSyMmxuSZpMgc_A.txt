My boyfriend and I come here all the time! Sometimes when the bar is too full we sit in the regular dining, and let me tell you, I definitely don't recommend it. If you want good service, SIT IN THE BAR! The bar servers know what they're doing. To name just a few: Julie, Alexis and Brittany. Everyone we've had is AMAZING. My favorite drink is the coronarita and we both love the chicken tacos. If you want a good time and over the top service, sit in the bar. You'll have a great time. If you sit in the regular dining area, don't expect great service. 5 stars goes to all the servers in the bar and the bartender.
