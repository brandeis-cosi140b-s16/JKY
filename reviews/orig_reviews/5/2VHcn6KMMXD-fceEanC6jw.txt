I have only been here once; however, my experience was great enough that I am already planning a trip back. I had the best chicken and shrimp burrito ever. The corn salsa is wonderful and our server was the sweetest. If you go on a weekend in the evenings be ready to wait awhile for a table but it is SO worth it.
