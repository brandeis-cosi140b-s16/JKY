Just moved to the Las Vegas Valley and tried Coyote's for the first time a few weeks ago after a round of golf. We love this place. The staff is super friendly, efficient, quick with warm chips, salsa and beans for an appetizer. Yum! Our order was taken quickly and the food was delivered hot. My husband is very picky about his food being delivered hot and he was very happy with the results. The food was tasty and delicious. We will definitely be back.
