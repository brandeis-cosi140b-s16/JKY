This place such a great atmosphere with the live music and the excellent service by rob the bartender. I would say this is a hidden gem of Scottsdale. If your looking for an excellent entree get the Southwest meatloaf! By far one of the best meals I've had to this day. Check this place out because the drinks are strong and the food is excellent!
