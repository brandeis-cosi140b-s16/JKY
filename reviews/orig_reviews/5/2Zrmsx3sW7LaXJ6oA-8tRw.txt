Phat Burrito is named appropriately because the burritos are HUUUUGE!

I haven't been out here in years, but last night a burrito craving hit while we were in South End, so we swung on by. This place is a small place located right near the light rail. There is some seating indoors and an outdoor patio.

We ordered the fish burrito to split, chips and queso, and two Modelos.....$16! What a steal! We sung by the salsa bar next....who doesnt love a salsa bar!

The burrito came out and it was the size of my face. Literally. More than enough food for the two of us! The burrito was excellent and the mango in it was a great touch. The queso was an excellent portion. We sat outside and enjoyed our beers and food. I definitely won't be letting another year go by before we come back again!
