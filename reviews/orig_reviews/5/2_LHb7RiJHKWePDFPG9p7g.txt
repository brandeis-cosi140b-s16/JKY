Green chile stew is to die for. Complimentary valet parking. Great place for a date night and the customer service has been on point every time I come here (often). Outdoor seating on the patio with an outside bar and indoor seating with great lighting. The food has been amazing every time I order but as I said you cannot go wrong with the green chile stew. Definitely an all time Phoenix fevorite.
