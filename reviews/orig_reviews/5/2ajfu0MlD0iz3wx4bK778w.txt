I keep going back here and forget to update.

This is hands-down one of my favorite places to eat. I even started eating guacamole - and I never liked it before.

I did read some of the other reviews that we less than 4 stars. All I can say is that many people are used to low-end Mexican food... rice and bean style. This is not that.

The mole is authentic, not the out of a can crap, and it tastes VERY different. It is somewhat of an love or hate thing... but trust me, for real mole, it is VERY good.

Looking forward to my next visit.
