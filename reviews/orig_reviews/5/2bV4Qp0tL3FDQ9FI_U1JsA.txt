Always feel so welcome everytime we come in. The staff are great and the food is fantastic. Each bowl comes with more than enough to eat, that I have to get a to go bowl for my girl and I. I recommend everyone to check this place out. Also if you crave something sweet the coconut bark is so worth is!
