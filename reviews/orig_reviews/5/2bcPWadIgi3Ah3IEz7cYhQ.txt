Cool place - great name!  I've been there a few times and had a great experience on both.  The service was very good the second time likely due to the manager? who gladly rolled up her sleeves and helped out with everything.  I spent more than a decade in the restaurant biz and I really like the way she runs the floor and talks with guests.  Yeah OK and she's cute too!  :)

The first time I just drank at the bar and service is always top notch with Chris who I have seen at a few other places in the valley.  He is a professional bartender for sure.

I like the d√©cor and love the fact that they planted desert cactus and succulents outside rather than the typical landscape mix in AZ.  Nice job to the designer there.  The art and materials inside are also pretty cool.

I'm tempted to drop a star because the food is a little pricey as mentioned in some of the other reviews and the chips and salsa are average and could use some work.  I'd also like to see more awareness of specials which we had to discover.  

The place is busy so be careful about showing up with a big party.
