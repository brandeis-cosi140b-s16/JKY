I have driven past this past this place 100's of times. I never thought to stop in here until I read about it on yelp. I ordered the combo (beef and chix) although I'm usually not a fan of beef at these places cause its usually chewy. Well, the chix was delicious. For me, just below the too salty threshold, which is perfect. The same can be said for the beef. And I was impressed with the chew on the beef, it had a nice give too it and was delicious. And the grizzle, yum. Getting back to the salt factor, it winds up being perfectly balanced when you put it into the taco with the onions and salsa. Very impressed!
