By far the best tacos I have eaten anywhere. My mouth waters when someone says Tacos El Gordo... because it's that good *___*

There are 3 different lines depending on which type of meat you want so many sure you line up correctly. My favorites are the Al Pastor and Carne Asada, but EVERYTHING IS GOOD ~

You can definitely taste the quality of the meat and how much time they put making it....

Definitely try this place, because it will knock your socks off.


Now I'm craving tacos after writing this review...
