Our favorite place close to home for breakfast, lunch and dinner too. Got company visiting? We run over and get a big batch of breakfast burritos. Best local place for authentic Mexican food! We're here at least once a week and tell everyone we know about it and we love supporting local family owned businesses! Enjoy!
