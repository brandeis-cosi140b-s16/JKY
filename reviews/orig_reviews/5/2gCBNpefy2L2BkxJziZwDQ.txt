One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas! I personally love the tofu tacos, while my brother, friends and spouse go bananas for the shrimp and fish tacos; for our sides we adore the dessert style plantain and sweet potato fries. 

Very close to UNLV (right across from the student union, so eat here instead of one of the food court corporate locations at the union), and they offer a great meal discount for UNLV student's ($5 for four tacos, two sides and a drink, unless you get a specialty taco).

The ambiance is great, kinda thrown together post apocalyptic vibe going on. Rough hewn wood benches and patron drawn graffiti/pictures on the walls really make Yayo awesome.
