I came all the way from chandler to try the food and see what the hype is about. I had a wet burrito with horchata. The burrito was huge and the meat was so tender. They had so many healthy choices for tortilla. I had it with tomatoes basil tortilla. Horchata was homemade and I had to get second large drink. My trip was so worth it and I would recommend this hidden gem.
