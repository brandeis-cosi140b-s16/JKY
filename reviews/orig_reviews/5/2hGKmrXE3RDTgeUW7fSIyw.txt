I've never met a restaurant with Pig in the name that I didn't like and I'm so glad I finally tried this place. It's a little hidden gem. The food was delicious. I had the torta (the red sauce is the best I've had) and my date had the burrito combo. Their take on rice was yummy! The Paloma fresca was fresh to death! The ambience makes the place that much better. Will definitely be back!
