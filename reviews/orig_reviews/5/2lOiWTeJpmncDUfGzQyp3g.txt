Wow!  Loved it!  The portions were a bit too small for the prices but the food was great.  Hostess was especially friendly.  

Table side Gac is AMAZING but again WAY too tiny - especially for 12.00.  The Primarita Marg was super yummy - but again, pricey!  I felt like I was back in Los Angeles with these prices! Great parking as well!  The decor is beautiful and different for Scottsdale.  Great crowd. I felt like I wasn't in Scottsdale.  It had an up north feel (think San Francisco).  Cool place.  This is by far my favorite place here in AZ - I bring all my out of town guests here and have many girls nights out - and date nights with my hubby. Love that its dark and cozy - but hip at the same time. I have NEVER had bad service or a bad meal - this place is GREAT!  The owner Brian is a doll, his sweet wife works there too - wonderful, wonderful wonderful!
