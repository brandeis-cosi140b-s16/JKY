The fusion tacos and fusion burritos are very tasty.  My son is very picky, but he loves their Orange Chicken!  Great food, huge portions, awesome prices!  What more can you ask for?  Small family operated restaurant, and they make you feel like a member of their family!

If you open a KoMex in Orange County, I'll never have to cook again!  :-)
