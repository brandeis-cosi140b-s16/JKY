Tacos the way they should be. I cannot rave enough about this place. Considering myself a foodie that likes to try NEW places all the time, I found myself coming back to this gem on vacation. The mahi mahi and shrimp taco special combo were so unbelievably good, I would rank them above the Grand Canyon. Was I just that hungry?...um no. 

Salsa bar is great and there are bottomless chips, margarita was tasty. Service is average, but if you come here for service you have it all wrong!
