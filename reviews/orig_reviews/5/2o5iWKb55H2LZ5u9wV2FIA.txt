Delicious ! We went here after being at the pool all day and drinking, the salsa and chips are so delicious that I could eat them all day. I got the chicken tostada salad and it was amazing ! My friends got tacos and they said they were delicious and my other friend got chicken nachos and he said they were great, reasonably priced, I would defiantly recommend this place !
