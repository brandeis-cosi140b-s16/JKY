Loved the margaritas and the mad mex burrito is absolutely amazing. Loved the atmosphere and service was great. I can see why this place is so popular. The burritos are massive and the guacamole, sour cream and pico are on point. I'll definitely be back and you have a few different locations to choose from. Also, great menu with some awesome appetizers to choose from. Loved it.
