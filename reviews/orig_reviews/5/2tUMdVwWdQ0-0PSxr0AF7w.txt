Different name but still a great place to eat!  Same owners and staff. New menu that is delicious!  You have to try the Mar y Tierra.  So good!  We were skeptical to go because we thought that it was going to be a different experience. Very relieved to see that LISA was still there. We had her as our waitress many times before.  She is Great and is very friendly!  We definitely will go back how that we know.
