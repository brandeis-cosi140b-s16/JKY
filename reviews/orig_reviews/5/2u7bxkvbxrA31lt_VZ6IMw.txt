Aya Dioscito, I couldn't love this place any more than I do right now. And that's a lot of love and I mean it.

I am working my way through every menu item and this weekend I will have the Platillo de Carne Asada Y Nopal and a taco de tripa. I'm not one for tripe but everything I've had here is absolutely delicious and I'm trusting I will have a breakthrough and resolve my fear of the tripe. I hear one must have it extra crispy. 

I'm really excited. Butterflies in my belly excited..... like that first time when...
