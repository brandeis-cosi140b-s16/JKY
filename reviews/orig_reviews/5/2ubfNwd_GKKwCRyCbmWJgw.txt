When you first see the outside of Phat Burrito, you immediately think of a hippie burrito joint you might see if you're in Santa Cruz or Berkeley. You know you're not in for a traditional Mexican experience, but more of a phunky, philling meal fit for a hungry, money-starved college student.

The quesadillas, tacos and burritos are all big. The variety is awesome. I'm usually satisfied going on the healthier side with the veggie (which I gladly ruin with cheese, guac and sour cream options), but I've also enjoyed going for the BBQ chicken and fish. I love the choice of beans as well.

The chips aren't special. I get them for a crunch on the side, although half the time I don't really need them because I get so full fast (and I'm a pretty big dude). 

They're also an excuse to keep hitting the fresh salsa bar. I can get enough of mixing the mild and hot in different combinations. The smokey chipotle-style flavor is awesome.

All the ingredients they put in the burritos taste fresh. An unusual twist that works is Indian-style Basmati rice. They also have expanded and opened up the dining area, and now have easier parking around them.

I kind of strayed away from this place to check out other Mexican places in the area, and of course, the Chipotle not too far on South Blvd. I had this a lot when I first moved here two years ago, when I lived and worked just down the street.

I have rediscovered it, and although I can't eat here more than once a month or so, it's always a worthy trip.
