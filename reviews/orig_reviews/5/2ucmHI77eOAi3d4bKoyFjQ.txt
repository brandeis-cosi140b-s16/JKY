Best tacos I've ever had. And I lived in So Cal for 9 years. So that makes me an authority on the subject. I tried chicken, carnitas and al pastor. I think my fav was the carnitas. I was planning on one. But I had to go back for two more! I never do that. I just couldn't help myself. There's a salsa verde in the salsa bar that's amazing too. It's the medium lightest green one. There are three green ones, and no names on them. But I think the darkest one is regular salsa verde, the next is a cilantro lime verde, and the lightest is a cilantro cream dressing. That middle one is INSANE on all tacos. Ahhh I can't wait to go back.
