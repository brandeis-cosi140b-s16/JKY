uuhhhmmm BEST SHRIMP TACOS!!! my absolute fave!! i don't usually like slaw but it pairs so well with the spices in the batter of the shrimp, also has a little sweetness that i like. pescado verde, rock shrimp chile relleno are also my favorites. the fajitas are wonderful!! there's just so many good things about this place, just gonna be sad when it goes.. don't forget the desserts! tres leches and coconut flan.. aahh i dieee. i don't drink but margaritas are good.. i recommend the arandas margarita (anejo, grand marnier, parton citronage, fresh lime and little simple syrup with a salted rim) and its so smooth that you'll be sipping it so fast and the buzz will sneak up on ya haha
