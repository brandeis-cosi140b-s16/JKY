I have always enjoyed coming to Leticia's for dinner, so I wanted to go there for happy hour.  I was greeted by Tammy the day bartender and she told me about the specials...I would have to say some of the best food and drink offerings for your money in Vegas.  Drafts 3.00 and quite a selection of delicious food items as well for only 3.00 each.  Tammy was great; she knows all her customers and I was treated just like a regular.  So if you need a cool place to hang out from 2 to 6, try Leticia's. You will not be disappointed!
