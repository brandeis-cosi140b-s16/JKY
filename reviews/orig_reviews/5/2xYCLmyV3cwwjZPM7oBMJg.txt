had my 36th birthday here with a party of about 10. They were very accomodating and the food was excellent.  It is not cheap but the everything was very well cooked and about half our party were natives of Michoacan so they are very very fussy about their Mexican food.  Everyone loved it. My 3 old loved the clown motif although that may not be for everyone.  The margaritas were sassy!  Great job :)
