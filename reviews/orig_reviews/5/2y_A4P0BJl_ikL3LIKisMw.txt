Ok this was my first visit to an establishment OTHER than my doctors office as a handicapped person. So I am giving them 5 stars based on a few reasons. First the hostess saw me coming in on my knee scooter with my big boot/cast thing and she immediately grabbed the door for me, Then She sat my sister and I at the closest table with an easy access to get in and out of a chair. I was starving after my doctor's appointment and this was my first time getting to eat out since I have been out with my foot problem.  
The bus boy helped me get situated and helped me get my scooter under the table. Then he took our drink order and brought my iced tea and chips and salsa. 
I ordered a chimichanga and my sister ordered the tacos . 

Bonus: they have like 32 lunch specials. So you have a ton of different combinations to like order from. 

We ordered the fresh guacamole YUM. I could barely eat though .. But everything I had was delicious. I had it wrapped up because I KNEW that leftovers would be awesome. 

My busboy .. kept my glass filled, and helped me get my food into cartons. 

It was extremely exhausting to be out after being on bedrest for the last 5 weeks, so I did not do desert and it was good to go home. 

But I definitely will be back it was a great time.
