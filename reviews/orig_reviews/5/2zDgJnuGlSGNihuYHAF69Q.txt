WOW.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but boy is it good.  Urban Taco has an upscale feel while still remaining very friendly and welcoming.  Definitely stop by from 4-7 pm for cheap margaritas and $1 off "street" tacos.  I sampled two tacos off the gourmet tacos menu.  The Costilla short rib taco was exquisitely tender and delicious, but my favorite taco was the Baja Shrimp taco, which was filled with plump shrimp.

I think Urban Taco's secret may lie in the spices and salsas.  We tried the pico de gallo, cucumber (ended up being one of my favorites, what a surprise!), avocado and garlic crema, chipotle (lots of spice but great flavor!), roasted corn and garlic crema (sweet and unexpectedly delicious on the chips), and chimichurri (fresh and herbal, my other favorite of the night).  I would have been satisfied with a basket of chips, a margarita or two, and a selection of the diverse yet delicious salsas; the amazing tacos were just the cherry on top.

Great meal, great service, and all for a great price.  I'll be back!
