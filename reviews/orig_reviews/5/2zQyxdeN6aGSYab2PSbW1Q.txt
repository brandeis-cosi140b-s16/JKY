Incredible all the way around. I have worked in the industry for years and I have to say, Wallace provided some of the best service I've ever received. Very personable and friendly. He made my wife and I feel right at home. 

And the food. My goodness. I had the tampiqueno dinner, my wife had the #2 combo (beef and sour cream enchilada and shredded need taco). They were perfection. My steak was a beautiful medium rare, just like I had asked for, and the chips and salsa were ON POINT!! I would highly recommend this restaurant to any lover of Mexican cuisine. 5 stars all the way.
