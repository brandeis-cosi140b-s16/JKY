Just went there for the first time tonight and had the asada street taco meal. The food was great to put it simply. The rice and beans were definitely good but the highlight was the tacos. The meat was exceptionally good. On top of great food they have an excellent atmosphere and the woman who took my order was really nice and friendly. I will definitely be going again soon
