It's not intentional but we always seem to get Backyard on Taco Tuesdays. No complaint buy me though , I'm  fine with saving a little money!  We haven't eaten at the restaurant yet and my husband is the only one that ever picks the food up but he says its a nice atmosphere. Busy and a bit crowded  but clean and he feels comfortable getting food there. The carne asada tacos are so good and I love that since they are street tacos I don't even mind that they don't have cheese on them. I usually judge Mexican food places on their beans and I really like Backyard tacos beans. The carne asada burrito is huge and packed full of quality meat. I'm not sure the name of the salsa but its a roasted salsa from the salsa bar and that's my favorite. I also like the simplicity of the menu, just the right amount of items to choose from.  We recently moved even closer to the restaurant and I consider that a definite win.
