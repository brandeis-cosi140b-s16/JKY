I have been to this restaurant about 6 times and the new restaurant on Rainbow. Love them both! I don't experiment a lot with with different orders, heck it is Mexican food; all the same ingredients; meats, beans, cheeses and tortillas, it just a matter of how you like it presented and in what proportions (although they do have the best corn on the cob if you don't mind gaining a pound after one meal). I know what I like and it has always been hot, juicy and great quality. One thing I do customize is the fresca; 90% Horchata, 10% Strawberry Juice. Sometimes they mess up on the percentages but that allows me to explore a new blend...but they always get it right on the refill :). Definitely worth a visit!!!
