this place was awesome! First trip there yesterday will definitely go back. The entire staff, from the hostess at the front, to the servers and bussers, everyone was super friendly and made sure we were enjoying our meal. The tortillas are so fresh, u can see them being made in house at the back of the restaurant.  Also had live music. I order the Enchiladas de Mole (sp?) and hubby got fajitas. At first the prices seemed a little high, but when the food came out we found out why. The portions were large and the food was excellent. My enchiladas were just cheese but the mole sauce was delicious. Came with grilled chicken on top, side of rice & beans and yummy soup. Hubby fajita meat was seasoned well. Only came with 2 tortillas to rap but when he asked for more, they came out hot and fresh. 
Only downside to this place is the parking. It's behind a gas station so the parking is very limited.
