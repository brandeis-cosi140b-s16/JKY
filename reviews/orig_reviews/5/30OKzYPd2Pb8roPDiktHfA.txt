this was the first restaurant I decided to go too based on my fellow Yelpers, and I thank god I listened to them. 

You barely notice Los Sombreros from the road, but don't let that fool you. This place has a great little patio with a super friendly staff and great margaritas. Couple that with the best guacamole in the Valley and great dishes like there enchiladas de pollo this is a cant beat place. Great for a chill happy hour. 

why are you still here? go!....NOW!!!
