Love this place!! The food is always delicious. You get some chips, salsa, and guacamole for free to munch on while you wait for the food to come out. The food comes out so quick, it's awesome. The service is always excellent. No matter how busy the place is the service never seems to fall short, especially since there are only 1-2 servers. 

I always order the fusion burrito with beef and kimchi, mouthwatering deliciousness! I think the main star are the pork belly's on a stick. I promise you will not regret it if you order this. Who doesn't like pork belly?! 

We will definitely be coming back to this place.
