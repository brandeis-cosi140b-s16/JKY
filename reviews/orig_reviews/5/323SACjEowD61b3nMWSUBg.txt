Let me preface this review with a disclaimer.  This is NOT 'normal' Mexican food.  If you want tacos, beans, rice, chips and salsa, go elsewhere.  If you want cheap, go elsewhere.  If you want 'authentic' Sonoran Mexican food, go elsewhere.  But...  If you want a very flavorful food experience that has a Mexican 'foundation' in a unique and trendy environment, and you're willing to spend a few extra bucks, I think you would enjoy this place.  OK, that said, here is my [Gringo] review...

Wow.  Went here for a late lunch on a Thursday.  I had the black mole chicken enchiladas.  Others had the seafood enchiladas and enchiladas suizas.  All three dishes were excellent.  We also had the chocolate cake on ice cream with strawberries for dessert.  It was wonderful. I must admit, the table next to us had the churros, which looked even better!

 I am a sauce person.  I rate Mexican restaurants by the flavor of the sauces.  On that basis, I can wholeheartedly give the Barrio Cafe 5 stars.  Interestingly, the complimentary starter dish presented was not chips and salsa, but rather bread and tapenade, which was a nice departure.  The tapenade was yummy, although I am also a big fan of fresh chips and house salsa (again, if it has a good flavor and constitution!).  

On top of the fine food, the restaurant is decorated wonderfully with El Dia de los Muertos artwork.  Even the restroom is a kick.  Their 'throne room' is a true shrine! LOL.  I loved it!  I  will definitely go back when we are in Phoenix and recommend you give it a try.  I understand it gets quite busy at times, so I can recommend a Thursday at 2:00pm as a great time to stop by for a late lunch and avoid the crowds.

Salud!
