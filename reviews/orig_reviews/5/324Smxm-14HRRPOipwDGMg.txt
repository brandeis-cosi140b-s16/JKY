I may be biased being Latin but Havana Grill has got it going on in the realm of Latin grub! La Mezcla de Aperitivos (Mixed Plate of Appetizers) is a great place to start if you are not familiar with their menu items, providing you with a great spread of items to try out. 

I would say the two most common Cuban items on the menu would be the cuban sandwich and paella. Their paella is just okay imo. Things that they have that are amazing are...tamal de maiz cubano, papas rellenas and my all time favorite masitas de puerco fritas but make sure to dip them in the vinegar!

The sangria and their mojitos are definitely a MUST but don't waste any time, just order it by the pitcher b/c it'll save you a few bucks in the end.

The tab can add up fast so we like to visit during their happy hour (4-7p daily, I believe) bringing you select discounted appetizers and half price pitchers of mojitos and sangria as well as other drink discounts which is definitely worth the trip!
