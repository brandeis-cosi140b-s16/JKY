Been to the tacqueria probably fifty times. The main restaurant is good too, but is more expensive. My favorite place to eat is the smaller tacqueria. I drive 20 miles roundtrip just to enjoy their awesome shrimp and fish tacos (get them with guacamole). Service is friendly, food is prepared fast, and it is always outstanding. The best bean and cheese burro I've had: it has a smoky flavor that knocks me out. I highly recommend this place.
