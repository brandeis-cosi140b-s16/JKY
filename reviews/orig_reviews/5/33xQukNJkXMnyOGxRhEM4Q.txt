My wife and I went out of our way to have lunch here. We  stumbled upon this place last year when we were in Scottsdale and everything was so good we had to try it again. We are glad we did, everything was excellent once again. The food is fairly priced, tastes fantastic and usually enough that you take some home. The staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable. If we lived in Arizona we would be regulars, can not wait to go back.
