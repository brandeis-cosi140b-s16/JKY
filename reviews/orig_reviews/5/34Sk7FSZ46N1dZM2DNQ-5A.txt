This is a place that my friends from California really like to go to.  The service is quite excellent where when you get chips you get salsa as well as bean dip.  When ordering food I suggest you get the Flour tortillas to be used because they taste so much better than the corn ones where the nachos are very delicious where they don't skip out on anything in it.  I ordered the Flautas (which are nicer taquitos) and it was really really good.
