i don't know why there are so many reviews speaking badly of the woman at the register? she's always been really nice to me maybe yall just need to approach her differently? she is there literally all day everyday on her feet for hours, what is she supposed to do greet you with a hug? give her a break she's tired as hell.

anyways i come in here like once a month to order the same thing for my family every time we don't feel like cooking. my moms half mexican and we all think this place is great. me and my sister get fish burritos and my parents get carnitas burrito combo plates, it's always amazing and they make it so fast even when it's really busy it never takes more than 10 minutes. also the burritos are gigantic, especially for the price, and there's an area to get free salsas and limes and stuff.

i really love this place AND the woman at the register, 10/10 :)
