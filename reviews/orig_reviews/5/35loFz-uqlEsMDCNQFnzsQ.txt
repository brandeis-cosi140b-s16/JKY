I had an art show here last week, decided to stay for music and ended up grabbing dinner and oh my lord! YES! For starters their margaritas are FRESH. Fresh citrus, good tequila, handmade and ONLY $3!! Not happy hour prices... All day every day $3!! After drinks I decided to eat to soak up the alcohol and their nachos are probably the best in the city! The quality of food is to die for and not to mention the owner comes by to check on his customers personally! I have been recommending this place to seton rand I go out of my way to eat here (I live in Tempe!) for the food and great service!
