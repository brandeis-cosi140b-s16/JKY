We were really impressed with our dinner and the service.  We had the Carne Adovada and the Rellenos - both blew us away because the flavors were well balanced, the meats were cooked appropriately and the sides were delicious.

We are from the Twin Cities (Minnesota) and appreciate great Mexican when we can find it.  Highly recommended and we will return next time we are in town.
