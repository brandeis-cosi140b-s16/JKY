Great Place! The Mission was recommended to us by a local shopkeeper and so happy we decided to go try it. First off the decor and atmosphere is great (Love the Himalayan Salt block wall) This place is upscale Mexican and a little pricier than your normal Mexican fare but absolutely worth it. The chips they bring to the table are fresh, warm, light and crispy and the Salsa is wonderful has a little kick to it but full of flavor. I wish they sold this bottled up to go. We also got table side guacamole which may be one of the best guacamole's I've ever had. Everything our table ordered was delicious, the pork shoulder and skirt steak tacos both wonderfully seasoned, succulent and tender. The papas y chorizo is wonderful and we also got a huge bowl of the mission fries which are a must try!
