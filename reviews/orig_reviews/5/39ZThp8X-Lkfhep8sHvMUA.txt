Sort of a hole in the wall, but probably the best Mexican I've had in a long time! Fresh high grade carne asada, tender chicken and a ton of different salsas. Cream-filled churro with caramel sauce was a must-have treat. The staff were extremely friendly and all about customer service. Reminded me of Tia Garcia's home cooking!
