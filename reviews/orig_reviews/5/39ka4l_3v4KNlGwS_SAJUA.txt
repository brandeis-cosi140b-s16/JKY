I love diners drive ins and dives and saw barrio on an episode not to long ago. I live in Tucson and my wife and I decided on a day trip to Phoenix and wanted to check out barrio. We found the restaurant easy on google maps. We were warmly greeted and sat immediately for lunch. We both ordered margaritas and were brought fresh bread with a wonderful dipping salsa. 

I ordered the Cochinita Pibil their famous slow roasted pork with achiote rojo and sour orange in a home made hogey roll and my wife had tres tacos carnitas. The pibil was the THE BEST SANDWICH I've ever eaten!!!Omg I would drive 90 miles from Tucson just for that! My wife's tres taco carnitas was terrific too. 

The service was excellent even though when clearing our plates, the waiter spilled sauce on me! I think It was more embarrassing for him than me. He and the management staff were very apologetic and more than made up for the incident. Kudos to the way you graciously treated us. 
The service was great and all staff was terrific. The FOOD is out of this world good! Can't wait to come back!
