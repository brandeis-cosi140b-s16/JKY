My husband and I wanted to go somewhere different for dinner tonight and Blue Adobe Grill did not disappoint!! The service was amazing and we had the best seats in the house! I ordered the chimichelada and he had the lobster tamales. We both liked my meal the best. We will definitely return! Great service, food and ambiance.
