Super yummy!

I ate a lot of different stuff here...Tacos, pork rolls, noodles, rice
...if anything eat the "20 Vegetable Fried Rice"! I heard from several people...best fried rice EVER! Each bite was different and super awesome!

Very causal, relaxed place, great cocktails.

Everything I ate was great! Service was great! Seating was easy!

Go eat a taco, fried rice and pork buns, you won't be sad!
