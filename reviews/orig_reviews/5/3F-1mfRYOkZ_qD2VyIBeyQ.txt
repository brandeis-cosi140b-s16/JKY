I love this place! The waitresses are amazingly fast and friendly and the food is delish! 
I always order #3 which is the enchiladas with red sauce. They are as close to Mexico as I have been able to find here in Arizona without having to go to some hole in the wall place. 

Come and give it a try! This is a perfect spot for lunch, the food comes out super quick and hot!
