The most bang for your buck!! I love that the tacos are only a dollar each, I payed 8$ for a meal that filled me up more than I thought it would. They don't short you on the meat either. The staff is also friendly and very Mexican lol or should I say "authentic." The only complaint of mine would be that its hot as ballz inside there but that's what adds to the authentic experience.
