The location is awesome; we sat on the deck and could see the fountains at the bellagio perfectly! Our waiter was really friendly and efficient and did a great job with everything from taking our order to correcting a mistake on the bill...that he actually picked up on not us. I think his name was David...thanks David! From other reviews I was kind of expecting mediocre Mexican food, but I got the portabella fajitas and they were nothing short of AMAZING; the mushrooms and vegetables were grilled and seasoned to perfection, and served piping hot. My husband raved about his meal as well. We will definitely be back next trip!
