I first came here many years ago and remembered the happy hour food was good, so on a recent trip back to Scottsdale, I was in need of some good food but didn't know where to turn. I was one block away from Cien Agaves, so I came back to try it again. I got the two taco special with soft flour shell and carne asada. Comes with typical beans and rice. These are without a doubt the most flavorful tacos I've ever had. It's like a taste explosion! I think some of that comes from the fresh guacamole they put on the tacos.  All their other food looked great too, and people seem to love it.  Definitely give it a try. There's a reason they've been here in business so long!
