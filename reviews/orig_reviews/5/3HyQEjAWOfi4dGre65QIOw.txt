Thank God there were some Mesa firemen standing outside this place when I pulled up as my wife was very uneasy about exiting our car and heading in.  Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.  After a unanimous "Defnitely, it's awesome!" amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my "Is this place worth going to?", we parked the car and walked on in.  This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!  Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).  It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.  It has become my new "first stop" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night....
