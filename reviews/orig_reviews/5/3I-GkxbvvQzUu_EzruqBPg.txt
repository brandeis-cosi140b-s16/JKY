Definitely my favorite spot in Las Vegas for Mexican food. Large portions, excellent variety, and FANTASTIC service. Table side guacamole is a must. I love getting the "Erica" chicken plate. It's got a slightly sweet sauce on it. Very tasty. The view is incredible and I love the fact that it's not on the strip.
