I ordered chicken enchiladas verde with rice and beans ($7) and my neither had the chicken enchiladas mole with rice and beans. With the two entrees, horchata, fried ice cream, and flan it was $29 including tax. 

The salsa is very hot and delicious to start. The service is fast and very friendly. The flan was incredible. My cousin ordered the churros which are AWESOME.  

I highly recommend this place for a quick, caudal, affordable meal.

The sign is hard to see at night, so look for Windy City,  the sushi place, and Nothing Bundt Cakes if it's your first time.
