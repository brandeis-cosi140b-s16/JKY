Fat Boy is a hidden gem on the east side of Las Vegas. Their menu offers a range of food, but I go there for their burgers. Flavorful, cooked fresh, and quite filling, you can't beat the quality for cost -- in fact, Fat Boy's burgers may be better than In & Out! It always seems like the same guy is there to take your orders, and he's friendly and attentive as well. I'd highly recommend giving this place a try next time you're craving something new.
