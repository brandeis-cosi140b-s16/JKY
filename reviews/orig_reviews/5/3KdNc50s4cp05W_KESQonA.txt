If you haven't tried Carlsbad Tavern at Hayden and Osborn then you must check it out.  This restaurant has fantastic ambiance and unbelievably great tasting food, the best I've had in Phoenix!!!  I spent 6 years in Southern NM and go back annually for their Green Chili during the September harvest so my standards are high.  This place does everything right.  Their outdoor patio is a true retreat from the hustle and bustle of South Scottsdale, a private retreat.  Although this place is across town, I will make it back at least monthly to get my combination plate on.  Highest praises to the Carlsbad Tavern team.
