I have driven by this place many times and today I decided to check it out with some work friends. The chips and salsa was amazing. I got the chicken and shrimp street tacos and they were both yummy. My friends had salads, see pictures. They loved their food too. The grilled veggies were really flavorful too. We are going back for happy hour soon.. The Parking sucks since there are other businesses close by, but be patient and you will find a parking spot. I would suggest car pooling to this spot with friends. The decor is awesome and it was very clean. Great place to take friends.
