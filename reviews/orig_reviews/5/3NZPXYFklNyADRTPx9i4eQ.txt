Came here with a friend looking for some good Mexican food and we were not disappointed.

Got some Chips and Salsa and they were great.  I am usually into chunky Salsa but even though it was thin it tasted great.

Complimentary soup was great too.  The server said it was a Tomato Soup with Noodles and loved it.

I ordered the Huetamo.  Chicken Enchilada, Chicken Taco and Chicken Tostada with Guacamole.  They gave us so much food and I was almost full halfway through but it tasted so good i almost ate myself sick.  I don't think I can describe how good it tasted better than that, you just have to stop by and see for yourself.  

Writing this review made me hungry for it again so I'm headed there now.
