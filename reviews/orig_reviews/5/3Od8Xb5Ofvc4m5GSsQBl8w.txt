Being from Vegas, there are a lot of Mexican style restaurants that I can choose from, but none are as good as Ep Dorado's. The food was so good and the service was wonderful. We felt welcome and by the end, we were so full we could barely stand! 

I suggest the chicken quesadilla and the Mexican Burger, both very VERY well-prepared dishes. The margaritas are humongous and the flan- OH MY GOODNESS THE FLAN- is exquisite. 

If you ever find yourself on the Las Vegas Strip, please make it a point to stop by and say hello to Chef Paco, he's so sweet. 

Overall, I give El Dorado's a five out of five. The price, the atmosphere, the service, and most of all the food were on par.
