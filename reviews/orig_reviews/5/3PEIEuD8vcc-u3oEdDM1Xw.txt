First of all, you get to seat yourself.  That's kind of nice being able to sit where you want to.  But when you think of having to seat yourself, you probably imagine a fast food restaurant.  This place is pretty classy and tastefully decorated.  Meals are cheap.  I ordered the cheese quesadilla appetizer as my main dish for $3.75 and it was humongous.  I was only able to eat half of it.  Happy hour specials are good too.  I got a margarita for $3.50.  Service was great and quick. The only down side to this place are the menu options.  There is not much to choose from.  However, it does seem like you can add and substitute items which creates a little more variety with the menu.  I would definitely come here again in the near future.
