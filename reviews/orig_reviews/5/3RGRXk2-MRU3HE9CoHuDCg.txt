So let's start with Margarita's.  My girlfriend may divorce me unless I figure out the recipe for the blood orange margarita.  I have one suggestion as a foodie, braised beef tacos.  It's like going to grandma's house in a taco shell.  If it was my house, I'd serve these with poblano mashed potatoes and a dollop of sour cream.  Joyride nailed this one!  #boom #braisedbeeftacos #tograndmashouseinatacoshell
