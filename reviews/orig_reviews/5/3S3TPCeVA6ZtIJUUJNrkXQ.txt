Now a days you would be hard pressed to find a decent meal for $5 that was actually edible. While fast food joints continue to feed the nation processed garbage Two Hippies stands out from the crowd with their large portions, organic veggies, and fresh natural meats. 

On top of that, the staff has been nothing but helpful, friendly and really makes you feel like family. Brandon actually takes the time to make sure my tacos are made correctly on a daily basis. If it is Monday through Friday, you can usually catch me here. Also as far as vegetarian options go, the black bean taco or burrito with rice is probably my favorite. The daily specials are a hit as well.

Can't lose with Two Hippies! Much love guys!
