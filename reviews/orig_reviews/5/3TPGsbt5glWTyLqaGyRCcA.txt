I absolutely love this place!   I moved to Phx almost 3 years ago & discovered this place pretty quickly.   I'm now getting ready to move to DC and hosted a dinner here for my team.  They were all amazed at the quality of the food,  service, and atmosphere.   I am going to miss this place,  but hopefully I have passed it on to others who will also share.   We had a number of different dishes, and everyone raved about how good it was.
