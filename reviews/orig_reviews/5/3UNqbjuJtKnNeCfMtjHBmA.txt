Came here for date night. We had a great time!  I think our server's name is Miguel. He was really nice and friendly. He seems to love working there and said the company transferred him from their location in Dallas, I believe. Anyway, it always makes dinner extra nice when you are served by someone who is happy to be there.  The margaritas were delicious, and so was the guacamole that Miguel prepared for us tableside.  Crab cakes had a nice kick to them and fajitas were good too.  But the best part of our meal was the apple pie served on a sizzling hot plate with cinnamon ice cream and a delicious sauce poured over it. WOW!  It tasted like world peace.  mmm... we can't wait to go back just for that!
