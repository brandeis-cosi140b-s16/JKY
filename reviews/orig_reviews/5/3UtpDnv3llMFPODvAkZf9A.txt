This was above and beyond some of the best service and vegan food we've ever had (especially in Vegas). 

My boyfriend (vegan) and I (meat-eater) were visiting Vegas from Seattle and unfortunately there aren't a lot of options to find equally amazing vegan and non-vegan dishes. 

We originally tracked this place down through www.eatingveganinvegas.tumblr.com. 

Don't let the strip club next door throw you off. The restaurant is through a separate entrance. The space is comfy and approachable. Great music. 

Where this place really shines is their staff. Our server Rorke had a great sense of humor, sweetest guy ever who was very knowledgable about everything on the menu. The menu is easy to navigate through to find vegetarian and vegan friendly options. 

They made our guacamole at the table with fresh ingredients. The margarita had fresh juice and was a generous portion and well balanced. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, the dressing was really good. My boyfriend ordered the vegan veggie bowl full of brown rice, black beans, fresh veggies and was well garnished. Everything was delicious! 

We cleaned our plates and were stuffed but Rorke still offered us a free vegan dessert and we decided to take him up on the offer. We were glad we did! They were amazing. Warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, cinnamon-sugar goodness with fresh berries and warm 100% cocoa, dark chocolate dipping sauce. If you could only see the look on my boyfriends face.  

Chef Paco personally came out to greet us at our table and asked if everything was good. This man was the nicest, most passionate guy, who goes above and beyond to make his customers happy. 

Highly recommended, we will be back again!
