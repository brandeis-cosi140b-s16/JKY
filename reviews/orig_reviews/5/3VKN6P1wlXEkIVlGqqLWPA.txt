Pacos Tacos is awesome!! Beautiful home made tex mex food, beautiful 100% blue agave tequila, and a friendly, upbeat atmosphere and staff here. The guacamole is amazing, whether it's done table side or already on your tacos. Portions are large and good for sharing to mix and match and try a few things! Yee haw, Pacos! Well done.
