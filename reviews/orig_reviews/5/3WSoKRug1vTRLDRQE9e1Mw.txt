My lovely wife has never before had a fish taco and after hearing me tell her over and over again that it wasn't what she though it was, and that she would really enjoy it, she finally relented. And yep, she loved it. So much so that she now wants to go back to Paco's almost immediately.

Service was very good - we let Shauna pick our tacos for us, as long as there was at least one fish taco on each plate. Good move! She asked some questions about our preferences for spiciness and allergies and got it taken care of.

Yep, we'll go back!
