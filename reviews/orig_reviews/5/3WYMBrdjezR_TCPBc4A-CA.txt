Came here for brunch/lunch this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and priced fairly! I shared the chorizo meat balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the sauce was sweet and savory with leafy bites of cilantro. I often find anything with chorizo to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet sauce pairing. They have the healthy option to get lettuce wraps instead of corn or flour tortillas, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free chips and salsa, I didn't miss having a tortilla-the lettuce was perfect! The free salsa and chips also came with three smaller and unique tasting salsas/sauces that varied in flavor and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great food and service, the atmosphere was amazing. I loved the high ceilings and stained glass, a huge rustic chandelier and beautiful well kept bathrooms. I will definitely be back!
