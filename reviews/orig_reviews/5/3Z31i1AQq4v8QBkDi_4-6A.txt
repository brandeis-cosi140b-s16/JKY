Son and I met my wife for lunch, so glad we chose Joyride! GREAT service and fantastic food, not much else to say. Wife and I tried burritos, one chicken and one "Beast" (carne asada). The boy had a Baja Fish taco and a "Standard" taco (chicken and a bunch of other good stuff!) Everything fresh and tasty! Overall fantastic experience, go there!
