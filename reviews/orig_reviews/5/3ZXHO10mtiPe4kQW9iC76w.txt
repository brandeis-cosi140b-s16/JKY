Carolina's: An Ode to the Flour Tortilla:

I no longer live in AZ and miss fresh, amazing flour tortillas like craaaaazaaaay. I come here at least once (more if I can) whenever i visit. 

Their flour tortillas are HUMONGOUS. Like, kind of out of control. The fold them over twice to get them in the plastic bag when you order a dozen. Here's a tip! Don't store them like that or they start to crack from being folded/unfolded over and over again when you want to take one out of the bag! And nobody likes a burrito warpper with structural flaws 

They are so fresh and warm when you get them, the bag steams up with their goodness Another tip: rip a small hole for the trip home or else that steam makes them gummy and stick together - again endangering the structural integrity. Yet another tip: Don't throw them into a suitcase which shortly goes into an airplane's hold, or you'll arrive at your destination with frozen tortillas due to the moisture in the bag+high altitude cold air 

Refried Beans: Carolina's Unsung Hero
Seriously delicious. When you can order something as simple as a bean and cheese burrito and feel like it's the best meal you've ever had, you know you got something special.

Fair warning (and I'm sorry in advance veggies): both the tortillas and beans have lard in them.

If you're planning to eat in, be aware this is not really a restaurant. It's like a small tortilla factory/ordering counter that has some card tables and plastic chairs strewn about. I sort of took this for granted while talking Carolina's up to my (British) husband and mother in law. By the time we got there they must of thought I'd lost my mind. Then they took their first bite and never doubted me again :)
