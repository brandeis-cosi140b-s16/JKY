Wow, what a great surprise of incredible food!  We had the following:

-Guacamole
-Chicken Mole Sampler
-Chilaquiles

Everything was excellent - savory, well seasoned food!  The guacamole was soooo good and that's coming from someone who usually hates the stuff...it was so fresh with the just the right amount of spices and spiciness. I loved the mole sampler as well since one got to try different versions of the popular dish.

I definitely recommend this amazing place!
