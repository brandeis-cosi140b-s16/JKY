Best costumer service ever!!! The staff is so nice and attentive. My husband and I had a great evening everything was delicious. My husband had seafood parrillada and I had the veggie tamal and chile relleno with beer! I just want to thank the staff for being so helpful and friendly I really recommend this place!!!!!
