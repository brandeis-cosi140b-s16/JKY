Great find! Don't let the mini-mall outward appearence deter you! 

Went here for lunch with our employees, almost decided not to because from the outward appearence it doesn't look special.

Its VERY authentic food, which is big for me because there are a ton of super-americanized mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. This is the real deal...

I got the Carne Asada Burrito and it was excellent. Then after finishing , the waitress was so kind and brought out some free blackened chicken tacos and they were also spectacular she mentioned that was their specialty.

Great service, great food, great prices... Secretive and decieving location...

Try it out you wont be disappointed!!
