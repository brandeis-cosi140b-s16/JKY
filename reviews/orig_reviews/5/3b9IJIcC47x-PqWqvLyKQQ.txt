if you grew up on 1970's style mexican food, then this is your dream come true.  enchilada sauce the way its supposed to look and taste.  ditto on the green sauce.  tamales green or red are fresh.  they still call em "cheese crisps".  if you love baja fresh or rubios, then you're barkin up the wrong tree.
