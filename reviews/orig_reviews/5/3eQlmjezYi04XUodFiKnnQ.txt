So this place just BARELY opened up for business and I thought I would test the waters.  I travel to NV once in a while for business and needed a spot to relax while waiting for my flights.  This is like a typical baja bar/grill.  Complete with surfboards hanging, Sammy Hagar memorabilia, and slide shows of his shows down in Mexico.  It was clean, relaxing and modern (just how I like it).  The bartender was great! He drew me a tall Sam Adams and I ordered some nachos (I'll get to those gems in a minute) I don't recall EVERYTHING that was on tap, but it was typical.  Sam Adams, Stella, etc... 

The Nachos. Oh, the nachos.  I am a fan of the tortilla in any shape or form, and chips are no exception.  Piled high with the typical nacho cheeses, jalepenos, guac, sour cream, etc... But these were no typical nachos...  They had a peculiar flavor to them that I KNEW I had tasted before.  It really was engrossing my mind trying to connect my tastebuds to my memory of that taste.  Then it hit me! Pesto! They had a white, basil pesto drizzled on the nachos and it was amazing! Dare I say, these were the BEST nachos I have ever eaten.  That's a bold statement if you knew how many plates of nachos I have eaten in my life. Very bold.

If you are flying into Vegas for ANY reason... Hit this beauty located near Gate C25.  When you are done, you can stop by the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and get yourself a small Black Forest.  I promise... your life will be complete.
