As soon as we got here there was a line out the door! I was surprised. It took us almost 20-30 mins just to order our food. But it was worth it. This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Vegas. The staff is always working hard in the back and sweating there butts off because it's always so busy in there. 

The place smells so good while you wait and it teases your senses making you anxious while you get closer to the counter and then BAM!! There it is. The delicious adobada! It is absolutely delicious. It is right there in front of you spinning on a steak while the chef cuts it off fresh for every order. Try the adobada (marinated pork) on anything. It is the best pork I've ever had in my life! Like this is better than bacon and they carve it off of the roast right in front of you. The tacos are so good and fresh!

Anything on the menu you're going to like. They have a large menu and anything you can think of, they have it on their menu. Make sure you know what you want to order though, and quickly because you have to go stand in the meat line of your choice. If you stand in the wrong line, you have to get out of line and go stand in the right line. That is a huge bummer.

This place is wonderful! It's the Mexican food you've always dreamed of but have never obtained. If you're in Vegas, leave the strip and head down to this place for some good grub. It's a really good price and worth it for the wait, because they're will be one. No matter the time of day or day of the week there will be a line because it's a really popular place!
