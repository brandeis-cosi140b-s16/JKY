I get the Ultimate Chimichanga every single time. I've tried a few other items, but this is my favorite. They send coupons via email frequently, so that's usually when we come in, but the waiter conveniently forgets to add them to our bill each time. Hmm... suspicious?

Oh well, not afraid to correct that problem! We pay full price no problem, but if you can get a deal, why not? Heck, we actually come here every other time because we have a coupon.


This is our favorite spot to go to because we can't always justify going to WCG across the parking lot. I'd say we're here once every other month and we never get tired of it. Great food.
