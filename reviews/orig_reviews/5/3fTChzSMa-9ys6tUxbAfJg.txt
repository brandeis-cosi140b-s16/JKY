I was in Phoenix for some business meetings and it was recommended that we check this place out for dinner.  We decided to go here for some appetizers and drinks since it was still early and then head out to another recommended restaurant later.

The food: We ordered the Table side guac and the crispy pork w/cola lime glaze.  The guac was excellent, and we couldn't get enough, but the real surprise was the salsa that they brought over when we got there.  This salsa was AWESOME.  The waitress mentioned that they roast the tomatoes and make their own salsa at the restaurant.  If I thought for a second I could get it on the plane home I would have asked her give me a cup of it for the road.  SO GOOD.  Then we had the crispy pork, which was a perfectly cooked pork belly thing with sweet barbecue type sauce (but better!) on it.  So good.  We should have stayed here and had dinner instead of going somewhere else.  After we finished dinner at the other restaurant I suggested (only half joking) that we go back to The Mission and have a second dinner... but it was too late.

The decor of the restaurant was really cool, very dark.  Unfortunately, I was there with another male co-worker, so the ambiance was a bit wasted on us...

I highly recommend.  If I am ever in the area again, I'm definitely staying for dinner!
