I've always been too messed up to go with my friends to Tacos El Gordo at 3 in the morning when it was closer to the strip, however I've had it brought back to our hotel room a few times. I have to say that even though it's delicious to-go, it was EXCEPTIONALLY BETTER when I had it at the actual place. 

Even at 10 in the morning, this place was packed like a can of worms. I was still drunk from the night before (heh) but I remember three lines that had different meat in each line. I was too lazy so I just stood in the line for the al pastor. You go up to the window and you say how many tacos you want, and you get to admire the meat being freshly cut right before your very eyes. Then you take your tacos and get into another line to pay. They accept credit card so yay!

I ordered 3 al pastor tacos and it was SO GOOD. I was drooling as I was eating my tacos. The meat was exceptional. It was moist, tender, and flavorful; as is whatever sauce they place on top of the meat. I may have regretted eating tacos for breakfast later in the day but it was all worth it from what I can recall.

Tacos El Gordo lives up to the hype and I feel bad that there's another taco place like right next to it that may go out of business...
