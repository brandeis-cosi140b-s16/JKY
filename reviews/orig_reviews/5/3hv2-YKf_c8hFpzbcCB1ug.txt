We had a delightful experience at Richardson's today.

The chipotle ribs small plate was amazing.

The chorizo stuffed pork chop and chimayo chicken were wonderful. 

The service at the table was warm, friendly and efficient.

Frankly the New Mexican cuisine at Richardson's is better than the restaurants in Santa Fe New Mexico.

If you visit don't forget to have a prickly pear margarita or two.
