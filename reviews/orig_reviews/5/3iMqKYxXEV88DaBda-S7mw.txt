I was very pleasantly surprised tonight.  My family was about to head for the usual Chipotle's but decided to try Juan Jaimes.  Someone had recommended this restaurant but then again someone had recommended Someburros which was awful!  We ordered nachos, a burrito, the three taco plate and enchiladas and we just loved all the flavors!  We also liked the  chips and salsa that they kept bringing.  This will be our new go-to Mexican place!
