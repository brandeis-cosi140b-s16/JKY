I was a little leery trying this place - the former tenant, El Burrito, was one of Papa D and my favorite lunch haunts. We also happen to live in the hood, (or should I say barrio?) so I figured sooner or later we'd drop in to check it out.

I'm sooo glad we tried this place - def my new favorite place for yummy yet cheap food! I ordered two dak-gogi (chicken) fusion tacos ($1.29 ea) and Papa D ordered three fusion tacos, one of each: bul-gogi (beef) dak-gogi (chicken) and daeji-gogi (pork). Throw in a mexican coke ( ahhhh the sweetness!) and our total bill was just a lil over $9.00. Three salsas were brought to the table: one Chinese, one Korean and one Mexican. 

Did I mention they threw a basket of chips & salsa on the table? Oh and let's not forget the orange and fortune cookie afterwards, and we were happily satisfied. All this for less than $10!!!
