We had a bartender named Karla! I haven't seen her in a long time and it was great to come back in and see her. She's always been on top of service when there's a full bar! The food is great and such an awesome happy hour! Great pricing and yummy margaritas! Try out their chicken taquitios and tacos Tijuana!!! They got a fabulous NFL happy hr!!!!!
