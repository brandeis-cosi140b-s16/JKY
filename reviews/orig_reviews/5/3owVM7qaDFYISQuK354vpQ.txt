When all the regulars there order in Spanish, you know it's authentic and delicious.  My coworkers took me there for lunch, and it was great. Ordering sequence was a bit confusing because some people got tacos first and paid later inside the store while others paid first and ordered later.  I like all the different sauces they offered. One note on the hot sauce: they are actually spicy. Don't get cocky and slather your taco in the super spicy one thinking that it's like a knockoff or Americanized hot sauce. Their sauces are authentic and the spiciest one will burn a hole in your mouth if you're not careful. 

Strongly recommend this place.
