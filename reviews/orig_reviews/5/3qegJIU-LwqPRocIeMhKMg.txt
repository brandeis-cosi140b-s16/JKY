Taking a stand for.. The Stand! - The tacos  are a 12 on a scale of 1-10!  The flavor is amazing and the salsa makes it  just pop!  The lemonade peach tea is ICE COLD on a hot AZ day... and home- made with fresh peaches.  The staff is friendly and the space is clean neat simple and  warm all at the same time! I will be back for the burger they make from scratch!  They even have a  DRIVE THROUGH option
! I would not be surprised if this place is featured on the travel channel soon..YUM!
