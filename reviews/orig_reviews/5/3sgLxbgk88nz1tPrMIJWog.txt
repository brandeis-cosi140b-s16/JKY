Excellent tacos! We finally tried this place out this past week and I'm sorry that we didn't before. So delicious! I had one chicken and one steak and my husband had the pork - all were amazing. Warning though, the hot salsa is for sure HOT! I'm not one for super spicy but my husband added it to his and for sure said it lived it to the hot label. Can't wait to go back!
