My husband and I are here before seeing Michael Jackson one. We did the pre fixe menu and couldn't have been happier. The food was amazing. Our waiter Manuel was incredible, recommending dishes and making sure that everything we ordered was perfect. My husband ordered the Pescado veracruzano and Manuel was worried that they didn't have the mahi so suggested alternative dishes or substitutions to the dish to make sure it was perfect. The staff was so attentive and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back next time we come to Vegas.
