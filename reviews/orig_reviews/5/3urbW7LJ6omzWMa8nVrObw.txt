Bulgogi Tater Tots 
(Tater Tots topped with Beef Bulgogi, Pork Belly, Bacon Bits, Sour Cream, Tomatoes and Green Onions)

Pork belly bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich is the perfect side to the tater tots literally.

Great service, amazing food at very affordable prices. You get chips, salsa and guac for free. At the end of your meal, you get fortune cookies and sliced oranges speared with little plastic swords. It's Korean, it's Mexican...it's KoMex!!!
