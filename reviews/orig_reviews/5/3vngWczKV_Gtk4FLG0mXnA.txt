Asked a co-worker where to find good island food in Las Vegas. I was hesitant when he recommended an island-style burrito place. Man, was I wrong. When I walked in with a confused face, the person working the counter could tell it was my first time. He gave me a sample of each of their meats (huli huli chicken, steak and kalua pork) without me asking. I liked that. The meats were phenomenal. I built a burrito with kalua pork, wheat tortilla, seaweed rice, medium salsa and guacamole. It was delicious. It was clean, great staff and excellent food. I will be back often.
