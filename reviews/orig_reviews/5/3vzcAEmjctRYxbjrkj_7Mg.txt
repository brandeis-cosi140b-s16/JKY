HOW ANYBODY COULD NOT GIVE 5 STARS IS BEYOND ME. This restaurant has been a family staple for more then 27 yrs. Always excellent tortillas and fajitas.  The staff is always a step above with friendliness and attentiveness.  Good chips and salsa. Great meats and guacamole.  I am told they have the same manager since the beginning. This person clearly understands the DNA of good food and good service. Thank you for being a place we can come and bring anybody for special occasions and awesome date nights.
