I've also been to the Glendale location but this was our first experience with La Santisima. My wife and I just can't get over the food and salsa bar here! So many amazing flavors of salsas to choose from. My favorite salsas here were the Guacamole salsa (has some heat) and Mexicana salsa (salsa Mexicana, lots of lime flavor).

I had the Dogfish Shark taco based on reviews, as well as the filet mignon taco.
I wasn't overly impressed with the shark taco, there weren't any flavors that distinguished it from just a regular fish taco. However the filet mignon taco was incredible. The beef was cooked medium and tender, and the dressing/fixings was an avocado salsa with cranberries. It was delicious. There was way too much food to fit onto the tortilla (a good problem to have) so the tip is to eat a lot of the filling, then try to roll it up as a taco.
The one sad thing to note was that they ran out of grapefruit juice so the house margarita wasn't as good as I've had it previously. But you definitely need to get the house margarita, it's so good. Plus it's only $5 during happy hour!

Had to ask for a water refill since the server wasn't paying much attention to our water status. That's the only constructive feedback I have.
