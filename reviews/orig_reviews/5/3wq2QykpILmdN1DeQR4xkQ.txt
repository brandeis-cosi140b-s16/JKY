LOVE the food! I used to live in San Diego, then Houston. The Baja Mexican and TexMex are missed, for sure. Until I had Three Amigos, I had just about given up on the food here (no offense, Charlotte). I'd never had Quipe. It was delicious. The Margaritas are also superb. While the restaurant may not have the best ambiance, the food is some of the best I've had anywhere.
