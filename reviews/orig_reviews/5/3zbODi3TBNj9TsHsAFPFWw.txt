Aside from saving me from my 24/7 coworker presence at the conference center (Thanks, btw!), this place is absolutely perfect. Great selection of eclectic American/Canadian beers on tap (seasonal, regional, funky), and crazy good gastro-pubby tacos and sides. Sweet vibe and rockin early 2000s indie rock...perfect for alone time lunch or conversation. Thanks for actually saving my sanity, Tacos&Beer! Great service, too!
