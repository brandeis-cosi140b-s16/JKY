I Love the food at Manuel's I always start off with some Great Appetizers like the Mexican Pizza and I order a side of Guacamole Dip, it's almost a meal by itself but I always save room for the Sour Cream Enchiladas and I always have there Great Margaritas. The bar is a great place to sit because they always have sports on the many large TV's
