This was the first restaurant we ate at during our most resent visit to Las Vegas.  We ate outside near the canal - so you could see the gondola rides and hear them sing.  It was an AMAZING atmosphere!

We ate chips and guacamole and split some chicken tacos, they were so tasty! The chips are warm and fresh, the guac was so good you could eat it with a fork. 

The best part was the red sangria...i wish I could find the recipe!!! 

This is a great, relaxing restaurant -- you MUST eat there!
