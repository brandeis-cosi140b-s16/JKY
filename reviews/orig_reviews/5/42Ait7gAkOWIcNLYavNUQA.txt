As I sit in the parking lot in front of tacos and beer, I am floored by the level of professionalism and courtesy when I had a small complaint about an order I placed for to go food. I am so pleasantly surprised with the prompt responses from leadership, the pleasant service, and the delicious food. I am particularly picky, and ordered food without salsa, and the mistake was so small I almost didn't realize that there was salsa on the tacos. I called that night and the manager I spoke with was awesome and she offered to replace the food. Unfortunately I am a terrible customer and didn't come the night that I told her I would. Tonight, I called and spoke to Carlos, the manager at this location for tonight. He was polite and respectful and got my order prepared for me before I even arrived. He came out and greeted me himself, apologize for the mistake, and made me feel very welcome if I were to come back. He also upgraded all of my tacos to carne Asada instead of just giving me the chicken, for free. He also took the extra step to separate the cheese so it wouldn't get soggy on my way home. I am so happy and feel like I could eat here every night for the rest of my life and get this high level of service every time. This place is a total five star and definitely a place you should check out if you're a tourist or a local like myself. Also they have really cool shirts and I can't wait to buy one. Thanks tacos and beer, thanks Carlos, and thank you yelp for letting me share this awesome experience. I will be back over and over and over. Totally worth the drive from my house, and I will be sure to tote along my coworkers with me whenever I come in. -Rachel
