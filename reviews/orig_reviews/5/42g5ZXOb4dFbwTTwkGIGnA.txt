I've just remembered another benefit of Rito's!

Hadn't been in months, but whilst dragging a Rito's virgin (my friend John) for his first visit, we lucked into a rare taco day. YAY!

But that's not the benefit... the new upside is what happened to my downside. I ate about 2000 calories and spent the rest of the day getting rid of about 5000 calories. Went in fast, came out faster!

Eat delicious food - lose weight. Nothing better.
