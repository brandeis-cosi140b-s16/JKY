I've had lunch here twice and dinner last night.  The green chile pork stew is the most flavorful stew I've ever put in my mouth, restaurant or homemade, and the sopapillas that come with it are the best I've ever had and hot out of the pot.  Even the Mexican rice is tastier and moister than anywhere else, and for dessert we had one of their pumpkin empanadas, to die for.  Friendly, efficient service, generous portions.  Worth searching out and easy to get to via 60, take the Alma School Road exit.  Don't overshoot and turn into the garage next door, not a lot of room in the little lot to back and fill so you can get out again.
