Another consistent meal from KoMex in an city with nothing but restaurants serving inconsistent food.  I would recommend this place to anyone seeking good quality, fresh, home-made foods, ran by friendly and dedicated professionals (owners).  The staff are warm and friendly, the food is very reasonable, and they're consistent every time!  Anything with their Bulgogi Beef, whether it's their fries or jim's bulgogi fried rice....it's all good.  Their Tostada's are also awesome due to their asian twist.
