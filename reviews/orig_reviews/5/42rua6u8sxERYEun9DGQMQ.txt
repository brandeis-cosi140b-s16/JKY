The best experience I have had in a long time!! Our drinks were never empty, chips and dip were refilled too!! I had the chicken burrito, Chris had the chimichanga, and Elisa the carne asada. Great food! Great service! We will definitely be back!! AND they have menudo everyday!

Carlos was the best ever!!
