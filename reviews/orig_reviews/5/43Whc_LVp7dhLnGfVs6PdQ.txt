Best upscale Mexican in Vegas. We mostly come here for brunch and order small plate after small plate of flavorful quasi-Mexican options, both sweet and savory, while watching people float by on the Mandalay Bay lazy river beside us. 

The menu changes seasonally, but some of the standbys worth sinking your teeth into are the churro tots, tamales and breakfast fries. I tend to like their sweet items better than the savories. But you really can't go wrong with anything.

And making your way through a brunch-long flavored mimosa flight is nothing less than the perfect way to spend a Sunday.
