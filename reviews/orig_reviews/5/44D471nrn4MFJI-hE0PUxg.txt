Man, I am still so stuffed with great tasting food that it is hard to write this. We had scouted out this place nearby our condo and decided that tonight was the night, and then those pesky government alerts started sounding. You know the ones, dust storm coming. We managed to get in the door of the restaurant just as the wind, and dust, started picking up. 

We were greeted with a warm welcome and grabbed a table. The chips and salsa arrived almost immediately. 

After figuring out the menu, we ordered a green chile burrito combo with the creamy white rice and a vegetarian burrito. Honestly, I wasn't thrilled about ordering white rice but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it, and boy am I glad that I did! Great taste! Of course, everything else had great flavor too. 

The younger female in the party had the organic black bean burrito enchilada style, which my wife thought was the best tasting, but that is just her personal preference. 

The margaritas were also thirst quenching. 

They are working on a rather extensive renovation that will double the size of the restaurant, but don't let that stop you from going.
