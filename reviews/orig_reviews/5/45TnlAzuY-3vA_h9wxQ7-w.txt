Great atmosphere, food and service. Yeah, we went during the late night happy hour and it was slow but nonetheless great service at the bar.

We ordered street tacos (carne and pulled chicken) and a quesadilla. The tacos were flavorful, not salty or over marinated, and filled with meat! Their fresh salsas are amazing too. Safe to say we will be going back to try other menu items.

You also get free flan for checking in through yelp. Check out their happy hour or local specials. It's worth the trip!!
