This was such a great eating experience! We didn't plan on eating here, but we had to grab a quick bite before our show, and they quickly accommodated 12 of us! (6-6 seating). Our waitress, Dana, was SO quick and made sure that everyone's order was taken correctly. They were on top of filling our waters, which must've been about 10 times because we were so dehydrated from sitting by the pool all day. They were so nice and friendly, always asking how our food was. We pretty much all got the taco salad which was huge and delicious. Yes, they are a little pricey, but it is Vegas and it was actually really good for Mexican food!! I would highly recommend this place!
