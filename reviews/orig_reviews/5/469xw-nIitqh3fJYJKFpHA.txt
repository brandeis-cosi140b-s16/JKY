Been eating at Rudy's since the first week it was open. I have recently moved back to Seattle after living in east Mesa for 12 years and cannot find the quality and authenticity of Rudy's anywhere here. My family and I have eaten there, mostly takeout, hundreds of times, and never been disappointed. The owner is a super nice guy, and the food is super good. I miss it tons and highly recommend to anybody looking for delicious Mexican food.
