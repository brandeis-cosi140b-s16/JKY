This location was closed for over a year and I  am so stoked that they're back. These are the BEST tacos on the strip PERIOD. They are so good, when I would visit Vegas last year I would make the journey off strip into a real seedy part of town to wait an hour in line to enjoy these tacos. And it was worth it. I'm excited to see them back on the strip and still operated by the same owners. The quality has not changed. Before this business closed down last year it had thousands of reviews and a solid 4.5/5 star rating. Not only is this the best street taco place in Vegas, this could be the best street tacos in the United States. Besides the classics: carne Asada, pastor, pollo Asada, they also offer specialty items like lengua, cabeza, tripa, sesos, chorizo, the list goes on and on. Everything is authentic and delicious. All the tortillas are made in front of you. The meat is grilled in front of you. Everything is fresh and made to order. At their price point, it will be one of the least expensive meals you can eat in Vegas and easily the most delicious.
