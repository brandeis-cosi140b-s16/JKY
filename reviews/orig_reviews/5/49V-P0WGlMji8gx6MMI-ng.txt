Right from the start the employee was awesome. A Hawaiian looking guy a big smile who gave us some samples. He got busy while we decided what we wanted and the owner ended up making my wife's salad. He was full of energy and cheer. The food was great and you get all the benefits of a chain store efficiency while still supporting a local.
