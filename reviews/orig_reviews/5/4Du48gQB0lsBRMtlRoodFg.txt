My wife and I lived in New Mexico for over 4 years and moved to Las Vegas right after our son was born. He just turned 7 this week and we wanted him to try some food from his home state. The food was great, the best New Mexican food I have had since leaving in 2006.  The owners took time to stop by the table and talked with me and my family for about 10 minutes.  Loved the experience and will be back soon!
