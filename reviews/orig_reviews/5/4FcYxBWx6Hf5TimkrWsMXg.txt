One of the rare places I've been that has excellent food AND service! Ive been back a few times now and haven't been disappointed yet. Their happy hour is awesome and they have a great tequila selection. I definitely recommend the fresh made guacamole, they make it right in front of you! After the first time I had it I was already craving more the next day! Also my server recommended the carnitas which were amazing! The meat was so tender and juicy and basically fell off the bone, and the chipotle wine sauce on top didn't steal from the meat but added just the perfect mouth watering touch! There are so many restaurants to choose from around here that it takes a lot for me to return to the same place more than once, and I am quickly becoming a regular here. If you haven't been here yet, definitely make it a point to check it out!
