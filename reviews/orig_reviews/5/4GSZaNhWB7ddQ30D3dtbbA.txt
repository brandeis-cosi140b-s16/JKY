Love this place! 
-Amazing atmosphere. It is very unique and cool. It was converted from a church to a restaurant.
-Staff is awesome! Every person that we spoke to was cheerful and courteous. The manager rocks too.    :-)
-The food was more of a 4 star but I'm not going to give a 4 star review because overall, my experience was great. The food is not bad by any means, it was quite good actually. However, it was lacking spices and wasn't that authentic tasting. I did love the corn on the cob that they serve though!
Overall, I would say check this place out! You'll be happy you did!
