I'll admit it, as stupid as this sounds, I've been a little bitter about this restaurant considering that they moved in where El Jefe's used to be.  Yes, I am aware that they had nothing to do with El Jefe's closing down and subsequent replacement, but my mind still went to that place every single time I drive by this location.

Regardless, my best friend and I stopped by this location at the start of an all day shopping spree.  The decor is so cute.  You walk in and the first thing that you notice is the GIANT Las Vegas Blvd sign hanging near the hostess station.  If you look up at the ceiling, there are several large, square tiles that have been finished with the trademark labels of numerous different liquors/alcoholic beverages and then overlayed at different levels.  It's very chic on the inside, you don't expect that out of a restaurant called "Nacho Daddy."  It's a pleasant surprise.

We split an appetizer of the queso dip and it was unbelievably good.  Generally, you either find that any Mexican food place doesn't serve queso dip or it isn't very good at all.  This combined with the homemade chips made for a great starter.  My best friend orderd the Cheese Enchiladas while I ordered the Grilled Chicken Quasadilla.  Both were excellent.

Now, most importantly, the customer service was AMAZING!!!  From the friendly hostess that greeted us and sat us down to our waitress, the experience ensured that I will continue to visit this location in the future!  Thank you for a great meal!
