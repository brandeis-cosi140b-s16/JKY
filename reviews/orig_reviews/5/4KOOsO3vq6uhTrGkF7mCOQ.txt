Great service.  Nice ambiance.   Met several old friends for dinner and to catch up.   The side room with the 3 large tables on a weeknight was perfect.   We were not rushed and our waiter was cool with us hanging out for 3 hours.

The food was very good and is on my recommend list.  Anxious to try more of the menu
