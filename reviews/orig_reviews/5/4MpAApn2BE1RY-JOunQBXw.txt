Always great. Based off the reviews I see, most people can't differentiate high end dining vs Taco Bell/Panda Express type food with Mexican and Chinese food. 

China Poblano is a high end restaurant. Top quality ingredients and almost everything is handmade. The concept is unique and the average person seeking utility tacos, burritos and enchiladas will be disappointed.
