Gallo Blanco had me at Guacomole.....served poolside nonetheless!

Spent a night at the Clarendon after reading reviews about the hotel and Gallo Blanco attached...and I was NOT let down!  

Breakfast was amazing, delicious coffee, and hands down the most delicious Huevos Rancheros I have ever had!  I also can vouch for the fish tacos, the carne asada torta, and again, the Guacomole, so fresh, loaded with cilantro and mango, I think I consumed at least a half a dozen avacados !!

Oh! and the Bloody Mary's!  :) Ahhhhhhhhh how I have fond memories of the bloody Mary's....the fresh dill really made them something special.

Bravo for breakfast, snacks, poolside nosh, and bloody mary's!
