Honestly the best mexican food I've ever had. Chips and Salsa spot on with flavor, always eat as much as I can when it comes to that. I've tried the skirt steak. Mouth watering tender marinated skirt steak. Although they we're good, I've fallen in love with the breaded fish tacos. They look small, once they arrive but they will fill you up.

Everything that hits the plate, hits your mouth and tastebuds with flavor. Been to this restaurant about three times and it's great everytime. On top of that, they make their own tortillas! 

If ever you're in the Mandalay Bay and looking for great food try Border Grill. It's a very good restaurant that's hip. Owned by the Too Hot Tamales! They also have a decent size cantina. Overall restaurant is very clean and service isn't too bad but could use a little bit of improvement.
