Cantina has been a favorite since I moved to Gilbert four years ago. The food is so consistent and the service is good. But now Cantina is also my go-to for happy hour. My friends and I try other places, but always come back to Cantina. The vibe is just right and the food and drink are always good. -And Duke is seriously the best bartender ever. Even if the food was so-so, we'd go back for Duke. =)
