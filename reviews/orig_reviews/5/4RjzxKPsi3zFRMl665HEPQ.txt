I am always on the lookout for a good, local, friendly place to eat with great food that is vegetarian-friendly, and I found it with Paradise Valley Burger Company. The food is fresh, high-quality, and delicious. They have items that are tasty with a bit of a twist, like their tater tots made from sweet potatoes. The veggie tacos were delicious, and my son devoured the breakfast sandwich. Their service is personal and attentive, and the owner himself came to check on our food and our experience. I love patronizing and supporting local businesses, so I'm happy to have this place in my neighborhood. I wish them continued success. I'll definitely be back!
