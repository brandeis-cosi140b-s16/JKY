We came here for the first time last weekend.  The chips & salsa & beans are sooo good (a little too good because I filled up on those) as well as the margaritas.  We came early so we got happy hour pricing (even better) and the views were amazing.  We were so impressed we are going to have our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding!  The staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful. Can't wait to come back!
