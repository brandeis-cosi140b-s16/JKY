I thought, how could a place have all 5 stars. I went the same day I found them on Yelp to find out. It is similar to a Chipotle or Gadzooks in that they have a food line and you can see what's there while it's being made. Everyone there  was friendly. The lady offered to give us samples of the meat before ordering. They have quite a few to pick from. I ended up with 2 conchinita pivil and 1 adobado tacos. It was more than just good. It is a bit of a drive but I will be hitting this place on the weekends.
