As a Phoenix Native, I'm used to all the "Family" owned Mexican food restaurants like Manuels, Macayos, and Garcias to name a few. So its great to see the Vasquez family expand into Scottsdale with their newest Some Burros location. 
I doubt  Scottsdale residents know about their original restaurant, Pancho's, ( on South Central in Phoenix) and I doubt this crowd would ever venture down that way...even on a bet. 
But good news, you don't have to.
Some Burros is not one of those idiotic ____berto's chain restaurants, nor is it a taco bell, baja fresh, or any of the other lame, so-called "Mexican" fast food joints.
Some Burros is  a great atmosphere, half the price of Manuels or Macayos, takes 15 -20 minutes tops, and the recipes are off-the-charts good.
Their concept and business model is unique from others in the sense that they offer great recipes for half the cost and in a sit down atmosphere.

Scottsdale...take notice and patronize this location to insure they stick around...otherwise we will be doomed to Macayos, Manuels and Arriba once again.
