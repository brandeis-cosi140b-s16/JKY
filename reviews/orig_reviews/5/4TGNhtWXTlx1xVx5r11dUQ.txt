Richardson's has got to be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. There are several reasons for this, mainly the food, the ambiance, and the service. I've now been there six times and can say with confidence that Richardson's is consistently a great dining experience. Today I ate the Huevos Rancheros, spicy with green chili sauce and shared part of the Carne Adovada, tender and excellently seasoned. I will definitely get some kind of pork dish like the adovada next visit because I loved it. The prickly pear Patron margarita was a great compliment to the meal. At past visits, I've tried the seafood pasta, pork chops, and enchiladas all of which were very good (I went out on a limb with the pork chops and although good, I'm still not a fan in general). Definitely order a house salad and green chili potato or share one with a friend as these are truly distinctive tastes of Richardson's. The service is friendly and to the point which comes across as commonsense customer service. My favorite part of Richardson's (and Dick's Hideaway) is the mood which is set by the dim lighting and adobe style booths and bar. The candlelight flickering around the room makes you feel very private and slightly romantic. This is a great place for out of town guests, dinner meetings, or just a night out. It gets busy during the evening on the weekdays and is on the smaller side, so I like to go a little earlier to miss the crowd.  The outside of the plaza where Richardson's is is under renovation, so I'm excited to see it will look like fresh and new.  Hope to see you there!
