Definitely one of those hole in the wall type of restaurant with only 16 seats and delicious food. This is my second time here and will definitely keep coming back.

The first time I came to this restaurant I ordered enchiladas de mole poblano and it is the best enchiladas I had ever eaten. It's definitely a must try. 
The BF ordered quesadilla arabe which was pretty good also with Elotes to share.

Our second visit we ordered pelonas, quesadilla arabe, taco arabe, and Elotes. 
The BF really liked the quesadilla that's why he ordered it again. I would had ordered the enchiladas again but I wanted to try something different. 

I definitely recommend this place and next time I will definitely try the chile Renello!
