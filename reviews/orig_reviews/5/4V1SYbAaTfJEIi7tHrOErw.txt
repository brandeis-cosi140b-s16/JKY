Used to like this place a lot but unfortunately, one too many bad experiences will keep me from going back! SERVICE here SUCKS!!!!! Waited 30 mins for our bill after we were finished with all our food!  Waitress walked by 6 times without acknowledging us at all. Unacceptable!!!! Finally grabbed the manager who acted like was going to do us a favor and he returned with a comp for chips and salsa?  Are you kidding me??? Wont return here until they learn a thing or two about customer service!!!!!!

Update 8/7/13:  I returned here after some encouragement from Ross Buter (partner/owner) and I am glad that I did!  I have changed my original review from 1 star all the way to 5 now!  They have made some outstanding changes since I had visited here.  We were immediately met with a hostess and led to our table.  We had a wonderful and pleasant waitress by the name of Adeline who immediately took our drink order, and continued to give great service throughout our meal.  We also met Ross here personally on this visit, as he was helping out in the restaurant the day we went back.  We also had a manager come over and introduce himself and speak briefly with us.  Overall, great improvements to once very lousy service.  The food has always been excellent and now the service finally matches.  Great job and we will continue to be loyal customers!
