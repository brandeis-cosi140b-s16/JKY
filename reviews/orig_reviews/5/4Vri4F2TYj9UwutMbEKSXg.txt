I ate here a few times while in Vegas.. (I was there 5 days and ate here 3 of them) I was so damn impressed... The service for a start was fantastic, all the staff were so friendly and welcoming, the food was delivered quickly and the refills kept on flowing.. Now for the food, WOW.. Everything tasted so goooood! I had the Paradise rice bowl a couple of times which is just fantastic, loads of veggies, LOADS of flavour.. And the Enchiladas, AWESOME.

If you love Mexican food and are near by, drop in, you will not be disappointed! I'm looking forward to coming back soon.
