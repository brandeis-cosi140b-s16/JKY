This is the best venue in Phoenix for live music. I'm a musician and have played 5 of my 6 last shows there. It's one of the few venues where I actually want to stick around after we load in our stuff early in the evening. They treat local acts with a lot respect and really do a great job with sound.  The bean burrito is amazing with their green salsa.  I got to experience an amazing dance party here that happened out of thin air.  It changed my life forever.
