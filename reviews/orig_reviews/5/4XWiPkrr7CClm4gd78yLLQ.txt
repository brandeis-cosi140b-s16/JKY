It's not that often that I try a new place and love it so much I tell everyone I know all about it. Gadzooks is one of those places.
Being a "foody" (self-described anyway), it's also not that often that I go to the same place multiple times over a short period of time. Gadzooks is also one of those places. As of last night, I have been there 5 times in two weeks.
Maybe I'm forgetful or flakey or whatever the case maybe, but there are many times that I've tried something and loved it but by the time I get home I've forgotten about it. Not that I would call that meal forgettable, but because I am usually always on the go and  always thinking about what's next. This was not the case this time. I was texting my mom and boyfriend while I was stuffing my face, the next day at work I was telling everyone about how good everything was.
I had wanted to try Gadzooks before it even opened. I knew nothing about it, just seemed interesting and fun. So I finally get to try it and everything was so tasty. I was definitely not disappointed! Everything just has so much flavor, and the perfect textures...
What I was really impressed is that regardless of which meat or vegetarian option I got, or if I got red or green sauce (or both), or which of the three cheeses or 2 sauces I got, everything went so well together.You can't really make a mistake when building your enchilada (or tacos or whatever you get). It just all works.
The staff has always been friendly and not afraid to give their two cents when asked. The prices are fair. I paid just over $9 last night for two enchiladas and two pumpkin cookies,
I have not one complaint about Gadzooks and am already excited about my next visit!
