I may be one of few to give Zocalo all five stars, but in my eyes this place is everything you could ask for in a Mexican restaurant. The food is to the T, the margs are perfect and the people that work here are the sweetest. As ridiculous as it sounds, I rarely go to restaurants with less than 4 stars on Yelp...but this place is the exception. It's so underrated.

Overall, this place deserves more than 3 stars. If you give Zocalo a try you definitely will NOT be disappointed.
