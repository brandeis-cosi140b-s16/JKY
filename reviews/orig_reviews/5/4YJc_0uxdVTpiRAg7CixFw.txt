My favorite meet up place. The first time I came here I tried the Fried Ice Cream and I fell in love. If you are a fan or have never tried fried ice cream...try it here! They have good happy hour specials. The corn tamale appetizer is so fresh and light. My friend usually gets the veggie burrito and she has no complaints. It's always a lively atmosphere. The servers/waitresses have always been friendly. If there's a wait for a table sit at the bar and order away!
