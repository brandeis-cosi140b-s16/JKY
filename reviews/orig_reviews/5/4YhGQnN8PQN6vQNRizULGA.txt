Jalapeno Inferno still offers very good modern Mexican fare with a nice range of tequilas and margaritas to complete the experience.  I'm addicted to the homemade flour and corn tortilla chips with salsa, as well as the corn tamales that have no equal.  Good values during happy hour and they take care of locals during the summer with very good summer specials, as well as good gift certificate deals right at Thanksgiving.  We're regulars and probably will be for a long time.  I still highly recommend Jalapeno Inferno.

In recent years a few changes have ruffled my feathers a bit, however.  While the expansion is good for quicker seating, we find ourselves being overlooked in the new back room in the bar area.  Servers don't seem to see us - empty beer glass, margarita, and worst of all running out of chips when we ordered a queso appetizer. Quite a few times we would have each had a 2nd margarita but did not because by the time our server came back we had nearly finished our entrees. 

Paradoxically, we get better service when it is very busy on weekends compared to weekdays when it seems as though servers are sometimes rushed, even though the restaurant on the whole isn't very full (perhaps too many tables per person?).  We like the "hot" salsa too, but sometimes it seems like a chore to get it because servers forget, or the chips person forgets when we ask her, or it comes much later compared to the regular salsa which is served shortly after seating.  My memory could be off, but I thought that years ago when we first enjoyed coming here the tables were served with one regular and one hot salsa every time.  If so, I miss that.  The hot salsa isn't that hot anyway.  And if there was a genie granting three restaurant wishes, one would be that they bring back the salsa sampler.  Their salsas are (and were) a big hit here, but they seem downplayed compared to previous years when we first started coming here.
