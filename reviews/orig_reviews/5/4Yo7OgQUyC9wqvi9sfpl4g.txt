I was worried when I saw the giant signed poster of Guy Fieri but comforted by the giant life size statue of a Panda as bodhissatva pistolero.

The food here is just awesome. Its a Chinese/ Mexican fusion place. You can get a combo with either refried pinto or black beans and several kinds of rice and Asian and Caribbean chicken flavors plus a snickerdoodle. If you get the combo you can get your food in a quesadilla or burro. On the weekends they have special cookies and black bean tostadas.

I love the food here. Mexican in Phoenix sucks but they got it down, tasty and spicy - plus I LOVE the panda motif. Good food and a good gimmick. Sold!
