Stumbled across this place and am so glad we did!  It is not at all what you would expect.  Sharp clean interior with very friendly service.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The cheese dip is amazing!  You are given a side of chips with your burrito, so I always get a side of cheese dip for that.  I'm not sure if he is the owner or manager, but the guy in there is incredibly friendly.  We love eating at this restaurant not only for the good food, but to support him and his business as well.  My husband said he will not return to any of the chains after trying Burrito Factory.  Give this place a try!  They always have a daily special which my husband gets, and he has not been disappointed yet.  Do not let the location of this place fool you.  It is right on South Blvd, but can be missed due to all the clutter on this road.  Go here.  I promise you will not be disappointed.
