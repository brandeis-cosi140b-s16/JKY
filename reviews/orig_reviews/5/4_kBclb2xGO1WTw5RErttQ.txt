This place is great! I ordered the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich and the reposado flight of tequila and was very impressed.  The sandwich was an Asian flair of a BBQ sandwich and the tequila came with 2 great reposado's and an equally great mezcal and a palate cleansing drink to sip on.   This place is great!
