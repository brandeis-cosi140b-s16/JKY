Located on the West side of town. I have been to there other locations and they are all great, a fun and unusual menu, all manner of nachos, and for the brave you can do a tequila shot with a scorpion in it. Yes, I did it and it was delicious! The ribs get a special mention, it has been almost a week and I am still thinking about them. I think I will, keep going back until I have tried all the versions of the nachos, and I suggest you do the same. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
