I'd tell you where this place is but then you'd go there. I don't want you to find it. It's tiny and it's hard enough to get a seat there without other people finding it. So stay away and let me enjoy it.
Here's what you're missing. Food cooked right in front of you, on a grill or a spit or an open fire. New Mexican food...not hot but spicy. Carne adovada with beans and rice that melts ( well, almost). Cold draft beer, friendly customers (they have to be...the quarters are that close) and great servers.
