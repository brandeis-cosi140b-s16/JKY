Best mexican food everrrrrr.  Seriously.  Not as greasy and more authentic than Fiibertos.  Fast and friendly service, great prices, and it's always clean.  The decor in the dining room is pretty hilarious, but all the more character it adds I guess. 
My favorite part is the vegetarian options.  Try a veggie burrito with added potatoes (they're not actually just potatoes but more like tiny french fries), put a little red AND green sauce in it, and get ready for heaven.
