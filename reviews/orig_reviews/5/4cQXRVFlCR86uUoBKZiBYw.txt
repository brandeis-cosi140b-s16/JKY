went there on a saturday night on Sept 20., the place ROCKS!!!, the interior is a classy surprise when you walk in, we actually dined at the bar.  had the Tostaditas de Tinga and Shrimp Taquitos for apps, the chicken Tostaditas may have been the best thing we ate there, delicious, moist and flavorful...the shrimp taquitos were good as well, wish there had been more sauce.  for dinner my wife has the Carne Asdada (tasty, moist and a bit zingy) and I had the Carnitas tacos, probably the least impressive thing we had, but ok nonetheless.  they surprised us with a Flan before our ordered deseret, it was AWESOME delicious, perfect consistency and accented with a bit of whipped cream on the side.  our regular dessert were the Churros, awesome!!!!! with a pleasant surprise in the middle.  the chocolate sauce was good but the caramel sauce was spectacular! do yourself a favor, get off the strip, save some money and get to this place for a dinner one evening.  thank me later!!!!
