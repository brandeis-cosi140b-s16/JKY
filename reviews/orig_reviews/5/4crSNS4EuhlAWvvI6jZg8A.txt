Who would guess the one item that totally blew me away was the simple flour tortilla.  OMG.  Warm, buttery, melt in your mouth.  I live off of Mexican food and never had one like this before.  The service was awesome, thank you Perry!  The guacamole was very good, a little too much lime for me but didn't stop me from scraping the bowl for the last bits of it.  The chips were fresh, warm, salty and thick.  The three salsa selections were perfect with great flavors and just the right amount of heat.  The queso fundido with chorizo was heaven.  A scoop of that in the flour tortilla is a bite I'll remember for a long time.  We had the skirt steak and short rib enchiladas for entries.  The flavors, textures and sauces were incredible, and the skirt steak was cooked perfectly.  Finished off our feast with coffee and donuts, the donut being the best churro ever and the coffee being a wonderful espresso ice cream.  The place is difficult to get to but well worth the effort.  Can't wait to go back.
