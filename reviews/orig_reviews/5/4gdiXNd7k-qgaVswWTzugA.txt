After reading reviews on Richardson's, I wasn't sure what to expect. I grew up on New Mexican fare and it is not an easy cuisine to perfect. I was also a little reluctant toward the menu as their vegetarian options seemed few and far between. 

We visited the restaurant with another couple who are avid carnivores. We were pleasantly surprised to find something on the menu for everyone. My husband and I split the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The beans are vegetarian but the rice is not so in lieu of it, we were able to get a green chili potato (ridiculously tasty). The food was delightfully packed with heat -- the kind of heat that's cured by a bowl of ice cream or more of what caused the burn in the first place. It IS spicy so be sure to heed the warning on their menu. I dabbed my forehead with a napkin more than once. 

To me, there's something about a server who knows her stuff. Our server was fantastic. We wanted for nothing during our entire experience and she knew exactly what was safe for us to eat as vegetarians. 

I don't agree with others who think this place is overpriced. Our party of four had the same number of entrees, a bottle of wine, and two cocktails for $120. And yes, they only have valet parking. Welcome to any good restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to visit again and get my sweat on!
