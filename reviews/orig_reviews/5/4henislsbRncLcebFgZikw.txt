My husband and I wanted to eat somewhere off the strip one night and chose this place based on the great reviews and yelp deal. I'll admit we were a little skeptical on the walk from Fremont. It really is in the middle of nowhere. But we were so happy we went, the staff was incredibly welcoming and pleasant. We split a meat dish for 2 that was outstanding. So flavorful. 3 different meats with sauces, potatoes and the most amazing creamed corn I've ever had. They don't have a full liquor license yet but the sangria was very yummy. Great desserts and coffee too. If you are downtown and want to eat somewhere with great food, reasonable prices, away from the craziness, this  is the place. It's a bit of a walk from Fremont but definitely worth it.
