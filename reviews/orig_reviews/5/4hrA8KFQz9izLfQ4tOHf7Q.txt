I've never had a bad experience at Tex Tubb's, and I've been there many, many times. Are there things that could be improved? Yes (paying for chips is weird and I am always in the way when I have to wait for my table). Does the food make me blackout happy? Yes. And for this, I can honestly say I don't really care about the other stuff.

Tex Tubb's bills itself as "Austin-style tacos," and while I never had anything like their off-the-wall tacos when I lived in Austin, the sunny turquoise and salmon decorations, Shiner flag, and gooey queso do make me feel like I'm in my former home. 

I love that you can mix and match your tacos if you opt for a platter, and I've tried some really tasty things that way. The one I keep going back for, though, is the Southern Comfort. Perfect strips of fried chicken get paired up with diced sweet potatoes, Swiss chard, and chipotle sour cream on soft corn tortillas. I'm literally salivating while writing this review. Gross, but illustrative. 

Tubb's also gets points for having delicious margaritas that do not come out of a machine, though those are tasty too - I've had a couple of really fun happy hours working my way through a couple different flavors of $3 frozen margaritas. 

Come for the queso, stay for the tacos, and take a cab for the margaritas. It'll be a good night.
