Loved their chips and salsa. So kudos LOTS for the best chips on the strip. Service is excellent and our server was awesome. I ordered the carnitas platter, its served with rice, beans, guacamole and hot flour tortillas. Their meat was a little dry but overall it was really flavorful- I added the salsa served with their chips and it gave the carnitas quite a bit of a pop. Would definitely keep coming to this place!
