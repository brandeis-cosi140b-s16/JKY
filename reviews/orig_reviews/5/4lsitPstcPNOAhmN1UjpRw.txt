Hawaiian style Chipotle is how they have branded themselves and that is just exactly what they are.. We were greeted immediately by lots of friendly workers who offered us samples of the Huli Huli chicken and Kalua pork.. We decided on the Huli Huli chicken bowl & the kalua pork burrito.. Portions are HUGE and so we could only finish about half of each.. Food was ONO hehe.. I really liked the nori rice.. But you really can't go wrong with anything here.. We also got the Coconut Bark which is basically a Salt River Bar... Bad for you but deliciously addicting :]]] 

Boyfriend added guacamole to his burrito but wasn't told it was an extra charge (not that it matters) so the cashier refused to charge him for it! GREAT SERVICE and lots of smiling faces.. The owner even stopped by our table to chit chat.. Turns out he will be opening a couple more locations in LV..! They use real silverware and bowls so you can just leave your mess at the table.. Don't forget to tip! +1 for their drive-thru

HOT TIP: Sometimes they have a promotion where you get free chips and dip when you wear sandals.. Just ask them about it! And get the Groupon before it sells out!
