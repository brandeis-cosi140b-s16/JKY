I really, really love this place.  I have been eating and drinking it up here for years!  No matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me and that is a huge plus.

The food is always tasty, and the margaritas flow without end.  I used to eat the Baja Chicken Burrito or something with carne asada.  Now, I am pleased to say that I am able to easily munch on tasty food sans meat/cheese.  They have vegetarian burritos, a spinach/cream sauce enchilada dish, and more for the veg heads.  

The chips and salsa is effing delicious!  I can't tell you how many times I have had really mediocre salsa at other Mexican food restaurants.  Not here!! It's fresh and they never let our chip bowl or salsa go empty.

The food is great, the prices are super and the customer service is unbeatable!  There's no reason not to eat here:)

Gracias, dudes!
