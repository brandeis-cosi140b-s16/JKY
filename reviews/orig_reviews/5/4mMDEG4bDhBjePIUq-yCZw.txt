Honestly, love this place. The Yelp reviews don't lie. I can't get over La Santisma's  salsa variety. I literally had to dig into my memory to remember what I even ate here because I was so amazed by the salsa bar. I literally got up and filled containers nonstop with EVERY single salsa (no shame). I didn't let that go to waste, I tried them all and left little behind. Of course, I loved the spicier selections, but everything was amazing. After eating so much salsa, my pastor burrito came and was pretty good. I think it was a little dry, but nothing salsa can't fix. I tried some of Eric's shark taco and carne asada taco, those were really good! Next time I think I'm going to give a carne asada quesadilla a try! The beans were also great and I must say I left full and satisfied!  Can't wait to come back!
