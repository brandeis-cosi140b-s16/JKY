LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  

They have Buy one get one free coupons in the monthly coupon mailer book and Wednesdays are Family night which have their own specials.  Their Happy hour goes until 7:30pm which is the longest Happy hour around. Also they have daily specials for margaritas and specialty drinks(prickly pear marg is the bomb). $2.75 pints and $8 pitcher of domestic beer on HH too.

This is going to sound strange but they have the BEST GRILLED WINGS!! I would have never thought to try them, but we smelled some as they went by and had to order a dozen. They were SO tasty and flavroful! And from a Mexican place?  We haven't tried the burgers but we heard from other people that they were good too.

The Pork Verde is super DELICIOUS, and HUGE!  I really haven't had anything bad from Luna either. We are here often and each time we always see a new magic trick from Chewy - the awesomest bartender!  The service is quick and when something comes out wrong, they quickly remake the item and it's out without 5 minutes.  

The patio has the best view of the lake too since it's in the center. They have tons of TVs, fenced the ducks off the patio, misters, both pubs and tables. It really can't get much better.  I mean, maybe if they had recliners or something but for now I'm all positive and give Valle and big thumbs up!
