Love it!  Went to Milagro for the first time and was delighted with lunch.  Ate three tacos (short ribs, green Chile pork and mahi) and they were all unusual and DELICIOUS.  My hubby had Philadelphia torta.  Also amazing.  The salsa and guacamole were fantastic.  Just a wonderful meal all around and very inexpensive for a spectacular lunch.   We will be back for dinner.
