This place was suggested by my hair stylist across the street.  Best Mexican food that we have had since being in Arizona.  Had a combination shrimp burrito and shrimp tacos.  Pico was really hot but was very tasty.  My husband had shrimp quesadilla  and he loved it.  Yummy chips and salsa, though were not complimentary.  The manager or owner came to our table and talked to us about the specials and what people love to eat there.  Very friendly.  Will definitely be back.
