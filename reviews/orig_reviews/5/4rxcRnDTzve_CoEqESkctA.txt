We frequent the Javiers in Newport Bech and Irvine since we are from that area.  We were happy to try the Javiers at the Aria for lunch before we headed home to So Cal .
  Same good food and drinks as I expected.  It was nice and quiet around 1pm, pretty much had the place to ourselves which was a plus.
  It is gorgeous inside, what I'd expect similar to the Newport Beach location.  Our waiter was awesome, food great.  Will definitely go back again next time we are in Vegas.
