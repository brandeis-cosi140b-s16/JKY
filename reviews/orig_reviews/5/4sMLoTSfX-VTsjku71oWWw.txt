Brunch is the hot thing right now, right? If you didn't know, now you do. This place is hands-down the best brunch spot I've been to in LV. First, it's huge - upstairs, downstairs, outside patio. Second, the bottomless mimosas do not stop. We've all been to those places that bottomless means whenever you can get the server's attention. Well, not this place! Our super amazing server Amber kept them coming. And in a variety of flavors. The all you can eat tapas is the way to go, especially with a group. It's served family style and you just keep ordering. Everything was so tasty and there's something for everyone. My personal fav - PB & Jelly Jalape√±o Biscuit Sandwich. Try it, you're welcome.
