Their food is great, best I've had since I last visited South Tucson. Salsa is always fresh, and each time it tastes just a little bit different so you can tell (at least I think) it's made by hand.

And every Tuesday and Saturday, 99 cent margaritas with a meal purchase (limit 4, so you can't exactly get trashed) but these aren't dinky solo cup margs either, they're well worth the trip alone. 

A+ would eat again.

I have heard that the other location is not quite as good as this one, so buyer beware. Make sure you're in the right...ahem...neighborhood.
