This place has the best breakfast burrito in town! They're a little on the pricey side but well worth the money and on some days (Sunday?) they're a dollar off. Everyone who has ever taken my order has been polite and friendly. I want to try something else on the menu but the breakfast burrito is too good to pass up!  Love this place!
