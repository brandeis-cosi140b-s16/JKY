I had been to the Chino Bandido location in Chandler and loved it (I've written a seperate Yelp review about that experience).  I was anxious to return, but living in Utah makes that virtually impossible... unless I got creative.  So when my little brother in Los Angeles announced he was getting married, I knew I had to act.  While driving down to LA for the wedding, my wife and I detoured to Phoenix so we could have dinner at Chino Bandido.  That's right: we drove hours out of our way, spending an extra day on the road (and an extra night in a hotel) JUST so we could eat here.  Can you tell I'm a fan?

This time around I decided to come to the Phoenix location rather than return to Chandler.  The menu was identical and thus the food experience was just as yummy as I remembered.  This location is in an old strip mall and is a bit of a dive compared to Chandler.  Don't think of it as dirty or unclean; just call it grungy.

My wife had been jealous ever since I made it to Chino Bandido Chandler because she wasn't able to accompany me on that business trip.  Now that she finally made it, she was completely satisfied with the visit.  She loved it just as much as I did.

For anyone who hasn't been here, you've got to come check this place out.
