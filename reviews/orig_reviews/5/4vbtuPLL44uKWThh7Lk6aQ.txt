Love the breakfast burritos.  Favorites are the chorizo breakfast burrito and the bacon breakfast burrito.  They aren't gigantic like some other places, they are a manageble size and quite tasty, with seasoned potatoes, cheese and eggs along with the meat.  You can call and order ahead, too!  These are my favorite breakfast burritos by far, flavor, price and size, and I go out of my way to still go here even after my office location moved and it's not convenient anymore.
