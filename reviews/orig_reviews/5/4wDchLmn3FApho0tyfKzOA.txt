My boyfriend has been seeing pictures of this burger joint's "food porn" on Facebook, so we decided to try it. It was an excellent decision. There are so many burger places in Phoenix that provide a great burger. However, if you'd like to kick your burger eating up a notch, this is the best place to go. Not only do they have a great amount of specialty burgers, but they also have awesome fries and milkshakes. My boyfriend got the Brul√© burger, which was divine. I got a specialty burger with Havarti cheese, and it was equally delicious. I should mention that their fries are absolutely the BEST...I'm not sure what they sprinkle them with, but I suspect it's crack, some type of barbecue seasoning and sugar. (jk) Whatever it is, the fries do not need any ketchup...it will ruin them! We also had two milkshakes. He had a maple bacon shake, which was made with real smoky, crispy bacon bits, not the crappy ones that you find in the salad dressing aisle. I had the fluffernutter shake, and it was awesome...chunks of marshmallow, banana and peanut butter...Yum! If you're looking for a break from your regular burger routine, I strongly suggest you give Paradise Valley Burger Company a try. You won't be disappointed. And... don't forget the fluffernutter milkshake.
