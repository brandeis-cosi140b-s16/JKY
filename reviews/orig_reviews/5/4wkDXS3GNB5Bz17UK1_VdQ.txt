Okay first time best shrimp fajitas I have had in town yet 
Service is quick and friendly and even the wife who is not huge fan of Mexican food loved it. 
This place is much better than Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin. 
Great happy hour but get reservations or early it's so good you might there for a few till you get a table.
