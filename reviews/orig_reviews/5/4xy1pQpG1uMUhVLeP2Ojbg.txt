Doug, the manager Doug and the bartender (actually all the bar tenders) are awesome! I got off work late and I had my heart set on going here to play open mic. Well, the kitchen closes at 10pm and they have really good food, so I called in... THEY PLACED THE ORDER AND. WAITED FOR ME! I was only about 15 minutes late. Well, they literally heated it back up for me. Obviously this is inconvenient for them. But they made it seem like it was no bigs. Love this place. Good hearted people. Great good. Amazing vibe. Come to Aunt Chiladas. Cheers mate!
