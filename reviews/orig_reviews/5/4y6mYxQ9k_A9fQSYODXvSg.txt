I love discovering places like this.  KoMex is a no-frills, mom-and-pop operation that is passionate about serving up tasty food.  The real stars of the menu are their Korean fusion meals, where you can eat a blend of Korean bbq style meats with Mexican-style wrappings such as torta, burrito, chimichanga, enchilada, and taco forms.  You can have kimchi included with your meal, which I highly recommend!  My spicy Korean pork burrito was gigantic and filled to the brim with delicious tender pork, fresh pico de gallo, flavorful Mexican rice, onions, kimchi, and lettuce.  The portions here are huge, the service cheerfully excellent, prices are very reasonable, and your meal comes with 4 different salsas for you to add to your meal.  Can't wait to eat here again!
