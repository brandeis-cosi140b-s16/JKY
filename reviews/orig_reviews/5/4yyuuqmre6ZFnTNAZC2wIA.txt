This is really great American Mexican food with modern decor. My friends and I came here for Halloween night dinner before a party and all the staff were very friendly. I had the short rib enchiladas and they were really tasty. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious too. Would recommend if you are looking for some solid American Mexican food!
