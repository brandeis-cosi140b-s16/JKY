I will drive across town for Las Palmas tacos.  (Grocery store, too.)  Only possible ding is that they don't always have their pork tacos - those are amazing.  Barbacoa's always available, though, and it's almost as good.

Tip: Just found out today that you can pay for tacos inside with a credit card if you're low on cash.  (They'll mark it on your receipt to show outside.)
