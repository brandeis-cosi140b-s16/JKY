I have been to several Cafe Rio's in the valley.  But they finally opened this one close to my house.  I have been here about 20 times but have still not found a perfect time to come here its always packed and i say they could open another one right next door and it would be just as packed.  

Everything is good.  But we have settled on the Pulled chicken Salad as being the best.  Here is how I order it:  Wheat tortilla, Cheese - with both beans no rice (white carbs) pulled chicken.  Shredded lettuce its smaller pieces and every thing else.  Here is the best part ask for the House dressing and the vinaigrette  mixed.  You will not be disappointed and will never be able to go back to just one.  

I have had the tamales, Chile relleno, Nacho's, chips and salsa (get the Cheese) the tortilla soup is really good as well.  they also have a nino Quesadillia for the little ones thats free.
