Im not sure how this place has a 4 star rating because the food is the best mexican food in nevada. They start you off with chips and 4 types of dips and salsas. Everything ive eaten here from the fajitas, carne asada, chili colorado, tamales its all so delicious. Its a very far drive for me and i try to get here at least once a month. Easily my favorite mexican food ever.
