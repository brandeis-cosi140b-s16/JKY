Amazing food! These tacos are so delicious- I can't believe they're so cheap! The spicy pork fries are amazing. I'm not sure how safe everything is for those who are gluten-free like me, but I've eaten there at least 4 times, and only once had a reaction (could have just been some cross-contamination). This isn't the type of place I'd ask to see the ingredient list, so I know I'm taking my own chances.
