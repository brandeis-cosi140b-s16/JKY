My favorite is the carne asada quesadilla. The price is extremely cheap based on the quality and quantity of food that you receive. The owners are extremely nice and always have a smile on their face. They are grateful that you are coming to them instead of wasting your money at places like Taco Bell. Go there for an authentic Mexican meal.
