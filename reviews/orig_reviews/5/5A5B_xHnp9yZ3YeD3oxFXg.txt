This is my first review here on Yelp and I'm so happy that it's about this place! My roommate and I just moved out here from San Francisco about 2 months ago. Within the first week we went exploring to find some good places to go and eat or hang out. While we drove by we saw the amazing decor of this place and instantly fell in love! The owner John and his wife have only owned it for about a month now and it seems like it's been years for them. They just flow so smoothly with the customers and really make you feel special. The food is out of this world! I try to try all the different things on the menu but my heart is set on the rice bowl with cactus In it... Cactus!!!!!  Not to mention they have Lavender lemonade that's to die for!! I truly love this place and my roommate and I eat here once a week! It's a good little treat for us.  If you don't go here at least once, then you're missing out.
