Really, you guys think chips should be the basis of a good or bad rating????? wow how about the actual food, the real meal, not the free stuff in front of you to nibble while you are waiting.
Juan's has awesome food, nothing I haven't liked yet, red, green, chicken, carne asada. you name it mmmm good.
Old school eating without all the bells and whistles. They don't load the plate with a pound of cheese and a half a pound of garnish like some places (carlos O) does.
Nor do they just do 1 thing great and forget the rest- it's all great. And then you have other places that grill meat or do something fancy with fish/chicken or meat and slop half cooked rice and garbage beans on your plate. This is good home grown mexican food! Great family that has made an awesome business themselves. Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time, great neighborhood place too, that's why you see them do so many take out orders.
