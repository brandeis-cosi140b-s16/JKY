Have eaten here three times.  Twice for lunch.  It was very good but ate there last night and it was fantastic.  Arrived on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Ended up sitting at the bar.  On the previous two times service had been uneven but Sasha was our server and she took excellent care of us. (She is very nice, explained the menu and is smoking hot) The chips are fresh and the salsa is out-of-this-world. There was a guy getting takeout and I asked him what he recommended.  He said it is all good but his go-to item was the enchiladas mixta.  I got that and told Sasha to mix it up steak and chicken.  Got two steak, two chicken with a piece of grilled skirt steak.  The chicken was good but the two steak ones were beyond compare especially the one with the mole.  I think Sasha said that it was the "poblano" one.  I am amazed at the negative reviews.  The restaurant itself is not much to look at and the parking is tight (there is parking behind the restaurant) but other than those two small things I have nothing negative to say.  On my other two visits I would have given them four stars because of the service but Sasha is the best.  Nice and personable.  Food takes a while to get there but I think that is because everything is so fresh.  They even have the Mexican Coca-Cola in the thick glass bottles made with real sugar.  My buddy had a margarita which he said was top-notch.  Did not sample any desserts but saw them serving Flan and huge pieces of cake.  If you want atmosphere probably not your place.  You want great food; you will have a winner.
