Sounds weird, tastes awesome. They basically serve Mexican dishes with Korean bulgogi instead of traditional mexican carne asada and the like. They add Korean hot sauce and kimchi to some things as well. The twisted guacamole was some of the best I've ever had. I tried almost everything my first time, the rolled tacos were to die for, as was the weird tater tot bowl thing whose name I don't remember. Go here now.
