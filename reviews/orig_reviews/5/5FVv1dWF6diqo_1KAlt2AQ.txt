Ok this place is great. I love the shrimp cocktail, and the chimichangas are  amazing too!  Try the guacamole!  Also anything with shrimp seems to be above par!

Everyone on the bar staff is really friendly but by far my all time favorite is Erica!  She seriously kicks ass!  She's super nice and works to keep everyone going at a good pace.
