Just returned from Vegas and had a great time at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Service was excellent. Danny was a terrific server. The manager of the restaurant came by to say hello as well. The food was also very tasty! I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for a casual atmosphere, good drinks and great food.
