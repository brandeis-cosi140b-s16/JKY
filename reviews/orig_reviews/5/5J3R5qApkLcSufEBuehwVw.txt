Los Olivos patio is a Scottsdale tradition. My personal favorite is a plate of machaca, and chips...maybe a side of rice too. The cilantro based salsa and hot sauce compliment the machaca wonderfully. It varies typically from being very good to excellent, rarely mediocre. That and an iced tea and I am in hog heaven. It just doesn't get much better than this IMHO. The tacos are quite good too!
