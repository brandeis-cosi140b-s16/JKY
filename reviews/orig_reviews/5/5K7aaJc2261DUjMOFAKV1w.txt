Not only was our meal superb but the service and atmosphere completed the perfect night out! My husband had the flavor exploding, slightly spicy, delicious chicken mole. I had the loaded with pork poblano enchiladas. 
We sat on the front patio listening to the DJ mix up some great beats. Our server was attentive yet not overbearing. We frequent this establishment occasionally and last night I was trying to find some place new to go but thankfully I decided to stick with our usual and was not disappointed.
