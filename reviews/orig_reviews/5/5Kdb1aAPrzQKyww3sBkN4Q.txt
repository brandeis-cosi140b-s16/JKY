This place is without question my favorite Taco Shop in AZ !!!! Period!!

I had no idea what I was missing until I was brought to this wonderful establishment by a friend of mine.

So here's how it works, they grill up the meat and tortillas on a Mequite Fired Grille. You will not believe what kind of flavor it adds to the meat. They offer the standard Carne Asada for the White Boys, but I would stay away. It is far too simple.

If you want to experience some real flavor, go for the Barbacoa, Lengua, Al Pastor, or Tripas. The Tripas are deep fried and so damn flavorful.

They have a ridiculous salsa bar, with amazing salsa's, but you have to ask for the Habanero which they keep behind the bar. They also have fresh cabbage, onions, limes, and peppers with carrots at the salsa bar.

All I can say, is you have to experience the simplicity and mesh of natural flavors. The true experience and blend of flavors is truly indescribable.

The place is clean, super authentic, and always full, even in the morning hours.

it is a straight up Mexican Joint, so learn some damn Spanish and be respectful!

This place is so worth the drive, I now go there at least once a week! I'm craving this place just writing about it.

Trust me on this place, and write a more descriptive review and tell me how right I was by recommending this place. I swear that they put something in the meat to get people addicted, it's that good!

Salute! =)
