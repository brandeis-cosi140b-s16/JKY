This place is amazing!!! I crave their food, salsa and margaritas. It's over an hour round trip from my house and I have been there 3 times this week alone. Try the shrimp Veracruz or garlic shrimp... Mmmmmmmmmmmmm. I ordered two extras shrimp Veracruz to-go after dinner just for myself. I do not know why or how someone could write a bad review: unless you don't like spicy... They do cook with authentic hatch chilies and it can be quite spicy. Read the story on the front of the menu then order: they cook everything from scratch.  Margaritas are one of kind and they use a better tequila and keep in mind this is not chain.
