Me and my family have been coming to this place since I was a little boy.  Now 30+ years later, I am still going 3-4 times a month and taking my wife and child.  This is a family owned business.  The salsa is the best I have ever had hands down.  You can buy the salsa by the gallon which we do on occasion and it doesn't last a week in my house.  I haven't tried too many items on the menu because I love the few items I have tried too much to try anything else.  I love the cheese enchiladas (hot).  The soup is absolutely delicious as well.  I also recomend the green chili burro (wet).  I will never stop going to this place.  It's the best hidden gem in henderson.  By far my favorite place to eat because the food is great, and because it's a long tradition in my family to go here.  Prices are fair also, although they have gone up a bit recently, but still well worth it for me.
