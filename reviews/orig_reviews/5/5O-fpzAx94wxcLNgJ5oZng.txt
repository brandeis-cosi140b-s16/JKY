The Mission is an upscale Mexican place with a great atmosphere and ambiance.  We waited for a table at the bar and while waiting ordered a bottle of "Slingshot" Cabernet.  The wine was quite good and our wait was short.  

We headed out to a small table outside (the only downfall was that the tree was shedding leaves a bit).  The weather was perfect and the service was even better.  We had the table side guacamole for an appetizer and it was delicious.  

I had the Florida Grouper for dinner and the boyfriend had the Chorizo Porchetta.  The plates were beautifully decorated (I know that's not important...) and the food was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. The Grouper was perfectly seared and the Porchetta had a delicious flavor of their chorizo.  

We were too full to order dessert but the dinner was just plain delicious.  A++. Perfect date night.
