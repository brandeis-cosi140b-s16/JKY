This is one of our family's favorite Mexican food restaurants... Family owned and operated... Mom taught the kids well!  The food is excellent and the service is friendly!  Try the machaca meat, the green chili or the Gollo Burro!  Don't forget a tasty margarita to wash it down!  This is where the neighborhood folks eat once or twice a month!
