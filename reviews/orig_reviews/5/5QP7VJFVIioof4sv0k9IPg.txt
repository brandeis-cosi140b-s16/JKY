My husband had the Kalua pork bowl and I had Kalua pork tacos. Both entrees were delicious and the pineapple, lime, cilantro sauce on the side went with it very well. The coconut bark is AWESOME. Our cashier Nicole K. was very friendly and helpful. She asked if it was our first time there and gave us meat samples as soon as we got in line. She explained what was in all the salsas as well-- very friendly and helpful! We will definitely be coming back.
