Don't go to La Ristra expecting run-of-the-mill Mexican food (like what you can find at a hundred other places in and around Phoenix). 

La Ristra is NEW Mexican cuisine, and it's far and away superior to shredded-cheddar-and-refried-beans. 

I visit La Ristra often, and haven't had a bad meal yet.  I'm probably 60% thru the menu. The food is just great, and they are not afraid to put some heat into it, either. But for my taste, it's always perfect; hot, but flavorful, and never too hot. Close, but never over the edge. 

I think my favorite so far is the Farmer's Burrito (with pork) served Christmas Style (red and green sauce). But it's hard to choose because everything is so good. 

Add a great casual bar atmosphere, live music on the weekends (including me!), friendly staff, 100+ tequilas (and a tequila club!) and how can you do better?
