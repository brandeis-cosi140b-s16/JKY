Il make this review short and sweet..awesome food.. been here few times and every time we have received top notch service. But the winner here is the food. From the simple taquitos to the chile colorado..perfectly seasoned, well cooked, and decent size portions for the price..i enjoyed it very much and i will definitely be back..its a must try if you are in mood for some mex food in vegas!!
