Don't pass it up just because it's in a gas station!! The prices are great and the food was awesome! 

We tried a big variety of things on the menu - all of them were delicious! Loved their namesake chile verde burritio, California burrito (carne asada was delish - hardly any gristle), crunchy shredded beef tacos with beans (combo #2). Mild (green) salsa was flavorful and delicious, hot (red) salsa was SPICY (sweat it out, kids!)

Had one (super friendly) guy doing everything - he took our orders and promptly busted out our six dishes... By himself! The one man show, everyone! For working by himself, everything came out super quick and he didn't forget any items. AWESOME.
