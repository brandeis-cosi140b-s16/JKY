Gallo Blanco IS a wonderful place. I tend to be quite skeptical when it comes to 'Mexican' food, but is was such a surprise to learn that 'Mexican' food can be delicious after all. I guess they're so good because everything's freshly made and the ingredients used are first class. Highly highly recommended. We visited 3 times last week and everybody was happy. Great salad selection, great tacos, wonderful burritos, really everything we tried, and we tried a lot was a pleasure.

After so much praise can there be any negatives, ok, it can get quite noisy inside. This seems to be kind of a trend that designers of restaurants don't think about acoustics anymore. So, if you'd like to actually talk in normal levels with your friends, go out to the patio! That's the end of the negatives ;)

It's a hip and happening, one could almost say it's a happy place. Definitely coming back!
