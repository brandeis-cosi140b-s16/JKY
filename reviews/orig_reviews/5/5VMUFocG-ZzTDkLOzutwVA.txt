I don't write many reviews but I thought that the Rokerij deserves everyone to know how awesome it is. My favorite spot is down in the cellar bar for Brunch. My Boyfriend is from NM and we can never find good NM food that is close to what it's like back home. The Rokerij/ Richardson's/Dicks Hideaway is as close as it gets! The Huevos Rancheros are amazing, handheld burritos, Rokerij Steak, Steak Skewers and my favorite in the summer - Blood Orange Mimosas. I love this place and will continue to keep coming back!!!
