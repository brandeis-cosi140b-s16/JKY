Quaint, charming and yummy food! 

Was there for dinner and our party of 4 stayed till their closing time. The food was yummy and I enjoyed the experience. Again can't recall the names of the dish but the appetizers and entree were both very good! I recall having no room for dessert, so could not try the flan. 

This is not a huge chain type of restaurant and you can feel the difference here - in a good way! Service was good despite our server having more tables than usual to wait on. And the food tasted fresh - which is awesome when it comes to Mexican food and you can taste the flavors!

I will be back!
