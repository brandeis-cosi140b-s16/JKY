This Place is great!! I first had the plessure of eating at the ORIGINAL Cafe Rio in St. George, Ut. in 1997 or 1998, from the day it opened until I moved. When I saw one had opened here in Phoenix, I was pleasntly surprised. They have the same GREAT menu and a Tomatillo Avacado RANCH sauce that is truly the best sauce you will ever taste!! GET out to GILBERT and enjoy the best, most fresh MEXICAN food in the VALLEY..
