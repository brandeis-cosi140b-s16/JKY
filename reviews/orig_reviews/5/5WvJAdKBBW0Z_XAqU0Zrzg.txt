I LOVED this place! I wanted to make it a point to leave a review because of our very unique experience. It was our first time visiting Vegas and sadly, we were not receiving the best customer service any where we had been. Even walking in to Diablo's, we were not greeted at the entrance and had to take it upon ourselves to find a seat. We weren't really expecting to have exceptional service since, like I said, no one at any other bar or restaurant had impressed us. HOWEVER, we had the BEST waitress at Diablo's! Her name is Jasmine and she was awesome! She served us with a smile, answered our questions, was very attentive, and provided the best service from our entire Vegas experience! The food was sooooooo good!! The nachos were A-mazing! Can't wait to go again!!
