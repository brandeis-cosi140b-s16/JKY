Was in Phoenix on business and found a local tex mex place near my hotel in Chandler area.  Glad that I went to Juan Jaime's Tacos...great food, service and fun people to meet & talk with at the bar.  I had the tortilla soup (nice & spicy) and two tacos.  All for great value.  I will definitely be back next time I'm back in Chandler.
