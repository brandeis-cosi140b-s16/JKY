Why has no one else thought of this before?  This place is awesome!  Yes, it's a bit greasy...and your stomach is usually a little more than confused at what you've just put into it...but your mouth is damn happy!  We tend to go for spicy - so my husband would always get something super hot (pollo diablo, for one) in a quesadilla or burrito (sometimes both).  I've tried some of the sweeter ones (emerald chicken), but I think they really spicy entrees work best.  So so yummy!  They also make a pretty good snickerdoodle to finish off your meal with!
