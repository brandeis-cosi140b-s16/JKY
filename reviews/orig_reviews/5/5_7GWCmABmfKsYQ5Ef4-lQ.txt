SOOOOO legit

This spot is a transplant from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  
I had something that is called a "Vampiro" from a street vendor in East LA a few years back and was never the same.  They were some of the most amazing secrets of Mexican food I had never discovered up till then.  Sadly the vendor was robbed at gunpoint, not having enough money to buy new equipment.  

It can never be as good as those original Vampiros to me, but thank god I have come across somewhere I can find them now this side of the border.  Just order them, don't even worry about what they are.  I am sure many have given the description in their review.  

Also, the al pastor vampiro which are also called adobado.  The line for this meat is long and dedicated given the amazing taste of the meat and you will see the line form behind the giant rotisserrie for the pork, capped off with a whole pineapple on top which allows the juice to drip all over the meat.
