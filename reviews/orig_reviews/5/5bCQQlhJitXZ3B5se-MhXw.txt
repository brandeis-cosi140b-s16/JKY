Best Mexican food ever in an upscale way. It's not your typical Macayos type of restaurant it's on their own level of excellence. I love their pollo poblano, guacamole and desserts. Everything I have ate here is out of this world. Love the staff! My favorite waiter is Hugo. Everyone should come here at least once in their lifetime. Margaritas are mighty tasty here. By far my favorite restaurant for a couple of years now. FYI the name explains the location, it's irritating for snobby Scottsdale people or anyone to call this area GHETTO, it's ignorant for yelpers or anyone else to immediately judge. Chef Silvana kept it in the BARRIO/NEIGHBORHOOD of Phoenix to represent her culture and neighborhood. Read some reviews and it really irritates me to read the complaints on the "ghetto" location. But if you are "scared" of the "GHETTO" location I recommend going to their location inside the Phoenix International Airport where you will feel safe. I have been coming here for years at all hours and I have never had an issue but it's up to your discretion.
