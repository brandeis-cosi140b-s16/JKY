I agree with all these posts.  cheap, colorful, huge menu, good horchata, tres leches cake at the panaderia....

Not much more has to be emphasized, however, one reccommendation: get the ELOTE along with whatever you decide to get.  Its corn on a stick covered in mayo and queso- delicioso.  if you really want a treat, squirt ketchup all over it too.  mmmm market foooood
