Found this place thanks to Yelp! and couldn't have been happier. Fresh salsas and guacamole served with chips were all outstanding and the fish tacos and carne asada tacos were both fantastic. I want to go and steal all of their recipes because this is authentic and delicious Mexican food.

The woman behind the counter during my visit was the mother of the owner and I presume she is the genius behind the food. She lives in Mexico and was only here visiting for a few weeks and helping out but she was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back here time and time again. It's quick, clean, and delicious. The prices are decent too.
