It is the third or fourth time that we've come here and we were never disappointed. The few times that we came was a Saturday night for a concert, so we would get one or two drinks before and enjoy our night in the back room. But this Monday we decided to come for happy hour, their house craft beer is actually very good, and $3 for a pint, what a deal! They have their chips&salsa for $1! Seriously $1, who can beat that? My boyfriend and I decided to get the Lalo Burger, honestly the best burger we've ate in a long time! Their patio is very very very nice, love the high tops. I highly recommend this bar in Downtown Phoenix!
