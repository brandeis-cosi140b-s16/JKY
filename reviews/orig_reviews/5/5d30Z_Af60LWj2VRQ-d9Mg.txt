We asked the bartender for a tequila reference and provided one of the best and smooth tasting I've had.  Then we got into a discussion regarding chicken wings  and the manager provided a complimentary order of wings are you kidding me......wow what above and beyond service.  Well done this type of service is rare and above/beyond what is typical.  Thank you!
