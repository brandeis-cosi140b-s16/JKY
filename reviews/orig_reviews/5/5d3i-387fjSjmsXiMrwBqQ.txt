yum. yum. yum. YUM! This place is delicious. I mean delicioso... Err I meant to say . Okay, well whatever your language or culinary persuasion is (providing it's within the confines of Korean and/or Mexican cuisine) this place has something for you! 

I walk in with my mom and we were immediately greeted by our waitress, host, and presumed owner (I'm sure this is a family joint) & were seated at our table with a view of their awesome flat screen showing college basketball. I'm in love already. Oh wait, you want to hear about food right? Okay gotchya! 

Browsing through the menu, they have all kinds of awesome options. I opted for the korean wings with seasoned French fries. The sauce on these was incredible, nothing to overbearing, but a little sweet... A little spicy... With some sesame seed. Mmmm. My mom got the bulgolgi chicken enchiladas. The marinade on these was succulent, and the rice truly ties this dish together. 

Next time I'm getting the bulgolgi nachos or the bulgogi combo plate... With stir get veggies!!!! So epic. #supportsmallbiz
