My girlfriend had a conference at Mandalay Bay and we made reservations for lunch at Border.  The place was filled and glad we made the reservation.  We started with the Guacamole.  It was a hit.  
She had a carne asada quesadilla.  The steaks were grilled perfectly and was the best quesadilla she ever had.  She pair the quesadilla with a tasty margarita.
I went with Yucatan Pork Tacos.  The pork was fork tender.  The pickled habernero onions were not hot.  Of course, nothing was spicy after our Thai meal the night before.  Overall, this might be the second best restaurant we had in Vegas.  Definitely, ranked very high in our list.  We like it more than Mesa.  Sorry Bobby Flay but imho, Mary Sue Milliken won this throw down.
