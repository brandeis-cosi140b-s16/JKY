For being in a hotel, this place is spectacular. I had their pork quesadilla and chorizo dip appetizers and both were tasty.

They didn't dissapoint with their margaritas. I always appreciate a venue that knows how to make a decent margarita. Don't mind me for slurping down 5 of them, they are deliciously dangerous.

Around 7pm a band came out to play live Mexican music which was really cool.
