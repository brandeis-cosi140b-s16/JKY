This place was so amazing that we went twice during our weekend in Vegas. I'm sure everyone else has already mentioned it, but in case they haven't, GET THE NACHOS!! They will easily feed 3 people, maybe even 4. I don't know what kinds of cheeses they use, but it is heavenly.

Our servers were great both times, and when they accidentally made an extra margarita for another table, they offered it to be and my friend. We were happy to take it off their hands. ;o)
