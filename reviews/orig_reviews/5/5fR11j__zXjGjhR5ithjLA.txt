It's not a big secret that this place rocks. There's almost always a line when I stop by, but their service is extremely speedy so it'll only be 5 minutes before they finish making your delicious food for you hungry carnivores reading this. 

A stand-alone location that serves up some delicious tacos y burritos y gorditas, Im definitely addicted to their endless salsa bar. 
The guacamole is a miss, but can't really complain when it's free. 

Their free chips & salsa for checking in makes it a 5 star place.
