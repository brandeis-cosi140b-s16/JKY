Love this place, great prices, excellent home-style food and friendly services. Be sure and order an Agua Fresca which they blend to order are quite filling so you may want to share. The homemade salsas are excellent. My favorite dish is the Alambre de Res o Pollo, chopped steak or chicken with pepper, onions, bacon and side of rice, beans Guac, grilled jalapeno and tortillas.
