Two words....SOOOO GOOD!  A buddy of mine had told me about this place from this big Taco competition that Milagro apparently won every category in, so OF COURSE I'm going to check it out! The decor is really nice and they have a great patio, which is where we sat. The service was SPOT ON, not a dang thing wrong..at all. We ordered the house chips and salsa ($5), that was perfectly spicy without being too much. I ordered the carne tacos and a side of these white beans with sofrito and cotijo. The tacos were around $9 and the beans, maybe $4? We also got my daughter and or fries with this great pink sauce, for $4. My wife got this flatbread with manchego, tomato and greens, around $8. All in all, super impressed. the tacos were perfect, the tortillas thin and cooked to perfection. The carne was well flavored and pretty tender. Wifey really enjoyed her flatbread. The fries were cooked perfectly and the sauce was SO MONEY! My beans were undercooked and underseasoned, but they remade them and I just took them to go. All in all, I'm super pumped to come back and try some other great things on their menu! Way to go Milagro!!
