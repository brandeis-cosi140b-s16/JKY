I went here for lunch today and it was great. I first walked by the place yesterday and couldn't stop thinking how good it probably is.. and turns out, I was correct.  

I got a strawberry margarita, guacamole,  and beef burrito.  The drink was strong,  guac was fresh, and the shredded beef burrito was so flavourful and filling. I was only able to eat about half of it. 

The service was awesome, it was happy hour and our waiter was very attentive with our drinks and the food was out within 15 mins. 

I would recommend this place to any Mexican food lovers. Mmmm.
