We went to this Nacho Daddy on Sahara on a Sunday for lunch. Great atmosphere and great customer service. Wife and I ordered the moco loco nacho and the Asian style nachos, both were awesome. Had great flavor. I ordered the wings, that was the only mistake I did. It was good but didn't go with the nachos we were eating. The nachos were a little sweet, but the wings were spicy. Not a good mix. Overall, we were really satisfied with our food and visit. Will definitely go again. Wife just bought a Groupon for it while I was writing this review.
