My family and I love eating here! The food is delicious. I usually order the ceviche or Zamora plate with a pi√±a colada. The guacamole they make at your table is soooo good. My husband brought us all here for my birthday it was a great experience. They keep your cup full and chips and salsa keep on coming. The service here is phenomenal. In my opinion it's one of the best restaurants for Mexican food.
