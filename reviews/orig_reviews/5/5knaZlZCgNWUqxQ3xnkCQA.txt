This place is a hidden gem! The first time we came in there was a bit of a wait, it was taco Monday and I had no clue, the manager was quick to seat is and gave us a free appetizer, and the service was great! Now we go one a week and everyone remembers my daughters difficult order lol and Levi always is the best server, my drinks always full! Love the bbq taco!
