The staff was very friendly & the food was great. 

I had the best mango margarita here. It tasted like freshly pur√©ed mangos. So yummy!

Chips were light & crisp and the salsa was good. 
I had one of their specials. It was a different take on chicken fajitas. There were onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, guacamole, sour cream & cheese. It was amazing. I wish it was on the menu. 

We just moved to LV and have been on a hunt for good authentic Mexican food. I've tried 3 other restaurants and this one is the best! 

We'll be back again and again and again!
