My husband and I are AZ natives....so we know (and love) us some good Mexican food.  After moving to Chandler, we looked high and low for a great new Mexican spot....to no avail...until.... Si Senor!  

The food gets 5/5 stars.  But beware: this is not the spot for the faint of tongue.  You MUST like it HOT.  Like sweat-runs-out-of-your-eyes hot.  Like, oh-my-God-I'm-going-to-poop-FIRE hot.  Like wow-this-is-spicy (you get the picture) hot.  

The service varies.  Some of the servers are better than others.  Let me put it simply: you do not go for the service.  The food is what keeps us coming back (chips for 4 types of dip and free sopapillas at the end of every meal- HELLO)!  

And the restaurant itself isn't the most beautiful.  But I'm okay with that.  The prices are great, the food is outta this world, and I'm addicted.  

Si Senor is the bees-knees.  Go.  The food never disappoints.
