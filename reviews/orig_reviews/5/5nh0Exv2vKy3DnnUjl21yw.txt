Went with our hiking group for lunch. One waitress handled all 18 of us with no errors and separate checks. Everyone was pleased with their orders. My first time at this restaurant and tried the garlic shrimp served with white rice and cold slaw on a cast iron plate "sizzling" it was great! Had a bite of the green pepper stuffed with shrimp and wrapped with bacon, spicy but excellent. Will certainly return for more.
