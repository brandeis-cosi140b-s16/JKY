As a Texan I wasn't expecting to find impressive Mexican food in Central Illinois; a friend of mine from LA urged me to try it with the glowing recommendation of "best burrito ever".  I went to school at UoI and most of the places are poor Tex-Mex at best, so my expectations were low.  However, this place made me feel that I was visiting our neighbors to the south. 

The seating is minimal so you may want to take it to go but should you find a seat you'll be able to watch freshly made food fly out of their kitchen with expediency.  I had a pastor burrito that was sensational, the pork had the perfect amount of spicy without detracting from the other flavors.  Sour cream complimented the vegetables and pork well without adding to much cream and the sides of salsa wear well balanced with a little heat.  The most overwhelming feature for me was the observance of them preparing made from scratch tortillas for each order; light but interestingly hearty these had a fantastic corn flavor which was better than any tortilla I've ever had.  As mentioned before, I'm a Texas Mexican food snob and this place honestly floored me.  I don't come back to my Al ma mater often but next time I do I'll go here.
