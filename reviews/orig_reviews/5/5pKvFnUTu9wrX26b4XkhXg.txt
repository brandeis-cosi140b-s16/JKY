Don't let the location fool you!! Find it, find it now, you will not be disappointed. Exec Chef Paco is well versed in a variety of regional Mexican cuisine. The 3 salsas that come with chips are fresh, authentic, and delicious! Great selection of ice cold Mexican beers and one of the best, handmade margaritas I have had in years and I'm from Texas!! Table side guacamole is made to taste and 100% simple fresh ingredients...fab. We had everything from beef fajitas, and taquitos to the more Mexican regional Cochinita Pibil (pork and chilies wrapped in banana leaf), homemade scratch mole (unbelievable...the real deal), and Pork Carnitas.  
If you get the chance to meet Chef Paco ask him to tell you about his mothers recipes and do not miss his grandmothers 80 year old flan recipe, it's like velvet.
Eldorado is Las Vegas' culinary temple to Mexican food. Well done Chef.

One more thing, service is professional and attentive. Top notch. We had Jesse, you can tell he loves the food too!
