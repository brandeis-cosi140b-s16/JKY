Bret, the owner, contacted me almost immediately after I posted my review. He immediately owned the situation, and explained the challenges he faced arranging logistics with the Dbacks. Since, he's been on site overseeing the logistics and ensuring great service.

Though the initial experience was not good, Bret did an amazing job dealing with a situation partly out of his control. Also, to be clear, his food is no doubt 5 star worthy, as is his main location on Bell and 40th.
