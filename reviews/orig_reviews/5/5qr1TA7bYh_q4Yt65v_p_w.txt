I've been here 4 time now.  The building has a lot of turn over before becoming "The Stand".  The new owners did a great job of working with what they had to make the building inviting (paint, planters, etc) to customers to get over the stigmatism of a dive joint.  

The burgers and tacos are premium grade!  One of the best burgers in central phoenix.  The fries are also good.  One of my favorites is the Salted Malts.  It will set you back nearly $5, but it's worth it.  One added perk, they serve their malts with a wide straw!  Few things are more frustrating that having to suck a malt thru a narrow soda straw.  I shouldn't have to turn red in the face just to enjoy a malt.    
Most of the seating is outside.  It's shaded, but I'm guessing that it will be less desirable during Arizona's summer's months.

The service is also very good.  They do have modern kiosk cash register systems that are quick and convenient.  Definelty a must try if you're a Arcadia/Central Phoenix local.
