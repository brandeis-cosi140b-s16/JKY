Awesome tortilleria and fun to watch with the kidlets.  Fresh salsas, frescas, bakery items, meats, and cheeses.  Restaurant/cafeteria inside is tasty and you can make your food exactly how you want it (bean and cactus burrito!!).  We go here at least once a week to grab our non-organic stuff...kiwis, papayas, mangos, etc. and the tortillas...because they are gigantic!  Our bill's never been over $40 for four big bags of produce!
