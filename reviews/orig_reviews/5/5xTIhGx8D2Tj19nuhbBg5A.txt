Our waitress is so cute and really polite with really fast service. I love how I can find organic food in Vegas. It is a tradition that me an my friend come here one a week. The ambiance is outstanding. This place is so passionate and the head chef is the nicest! Check in and he will come talk to you with a free flan! I recommend this place to everyone!
