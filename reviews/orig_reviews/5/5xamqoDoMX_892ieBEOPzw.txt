In a previous review I made of Roberto's in Las Vegas, I don't think I mentioned Roberto's here. This is part of the Roberto's chain that can be found in Vegas and San Diego. Please don't confuse it with Filiberto's or Rigoberto's or any of the other 'berto's here in AZ. This Roberto's in the gas station uses the same recipes as the ones in Vegas.

It's a huge trek for hubby and I to make from where we are, but it's worth it.

The owner told us that it is indeed part of the Roberto's chain in Las Vegas, but they had branched out and decided to settle in Phoenix...the recipes are the same and I could taste the consistency in the flavor and the menu.

I had always loved their chicken chimichangas and their super nachos...along with their carne asada. I never knew I would crave it!

What I've always noticed about Roberto's is that they're always clean -- their kitchen is impeccable. Although the layout isn't like in Vegas (you can watch them cook your food and see exactly how clean and exacting their standards are), the food that comes out of the kitchen certainly is just like it is back in Vegas.

It's 40 miles from here, but it was worth that drive. Pity it's not 24 hours like the ones back in Vegas.

The owner and the workers here are just as friendly and wonderful...I can't rave enough about how much I love the Roberto's chain.
