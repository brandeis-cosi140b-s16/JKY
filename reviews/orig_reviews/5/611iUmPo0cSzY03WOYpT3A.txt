I tried one of each taco. & I have to say the middle line was my favorite. you get a choice between all the things you don't really want to eat, but the tripa was by far the best taco I have ever had. After that I would say the beef head. everything there was very good and the drinks are uncommon, so if you're looking for not the same ol' mexican food you have to try this place.
