By far, one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to! I had a wet burrito which was amazing, and the side of rice was even delicious beyond words! Err enjoyed one of their fruit waters, the mango, I've never had anything like it. For desert we had flan and tres lecha, both AMAZING! I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. Do not let it being attached to a gentleman's club steer you away. The environment is very relaxing and elegant
