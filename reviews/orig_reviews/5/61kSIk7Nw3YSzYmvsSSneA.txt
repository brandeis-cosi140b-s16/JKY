I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to Saturday brunch and both of us were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is great and the food even better.  I had the Benedict and Enchiladas (Richardsons Combo) and was a bit surprised (in a good way) by the burn of chili peppers.  The smoked pork loin on the Benedict was also noticeable and overall it's probably been one of the best meals I've had in quite a while.
