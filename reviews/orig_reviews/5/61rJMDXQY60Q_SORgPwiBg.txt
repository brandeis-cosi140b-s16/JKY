This place is good, really good. They have 5 different meats ranging in spice warmth - each with their own distinctive flavor. I enjoyed all five. I chose the three taco plate with pastor, green chili and one other beef. Incredible flavors on all of the meat. Then you have the opportunity to select various toppings, cilantro, lettuce, red onions, white onions, hominy, sour cream, cheese, cabbage (a few more I do not recall). A few salsa options are available also. Note: these are not street taco size they are full size soft shell tacos. I will be back to support this awesome restaurant
