Here's the scenario...
You're hungry
You're on the way to a BBQ
Host of said BBQ is going to be 20 min late...
What do you do? What. Do. You. Do?

You say screw the BBQ and pick up a burrito at Taco Taco! Done deal. I had heard about this place during a late night Yelp menu reading session (it's a problem) and when I saw I was in the area, there was no turning back. 

Upon walking in you're greeted with the biggest taco shop dining room you've ever seen. Soccer playing on the TV, salsa bar to the right. Perfect. Problem? It was at least 100 degrees in the place. With griddles fired up in the open kitchen, you need that AC popping! I was forced to take this meal to-go. 

The menu is fairly simple. Burrito, taco, bowl, gran taco (taco with extra toppings). Fill with toppings and meats. Done. I rocked a burrito filled with al pastor (which you can see marinating in the corner), cheese, guac, pico, black beans, lettuce, hot salsa and a bit of rice. $7. Size? Perfect. A single meal wrapped up. Not a small baby or an app. Taste. WOW. Easily the best burrito I've ever had. The tender, moist spiced meat mixed with all the ingredients well and there was no 'filler bites' of rice or toppings. There was so much flavor, I barely used the salsa I took with me. Typically, I wouldn't give a place 5 stars based on one menu item, but considering the while menu is what I ate wrapped in different shells, I think it's OK. Skip the BBQ. Grab the burrito. Everyone will understand.
