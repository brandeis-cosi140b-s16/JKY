So delicious!

It is kind of in an odd location but once inside you would not know who there neighbor was next door. The inside is very clean, kind of dark but overall good ambiance. The employees were all very nice. The GM personally came over to our table to introduce herself and was very inviting. She gave us her business card to let her know what we thought of the place. I thought that was very nice, it definitely gives you the feeling that the employees care about the restaurant.

As for the food, I had the veggie tacos they were so flavorful you would have no idea that they did not contain meat. The rice was just ok. The re-fried beans were perfect.They do bring chips and salsa to the table like other places but what sets them apart from most is that they give you 3 different salsas to try. It's great having a place that actually has a spicy salsa, so many place the salsa is just basic and bland not here. 

I am looking forward to coming back and trying more items from the menu as they really have a large selection to choose from.
