CHEAP EATS ALERT! I love the menu here...tacos, cheese crisps, and burros.  Everything is made fresh, tastes great, and is inexpensive!  The fish tacos are standouts here along with the burros. Grab yourself some fresh salsa, plop down on a folding chair with your Negra Modelo, and try not to splash anything on your neighbor!  :-)
