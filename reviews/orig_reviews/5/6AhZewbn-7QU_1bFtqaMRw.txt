Excellent and affordable Mexican food right on the strip.  Once you are tired of the chains and the buffets, come to DJ's for their 3 taco plate with rice and beans for $9.  If you check in with the Yelp app, it's 10% what is already a really affordable meal.  

My personal favorite were the lengua or beef tongue tacos.  If you have never given lengua tacos a try, do it at DJ's.  You will not be disappointed!  So flavorful and tender.  

Such a treat to find authentic, delicious Mexican food right on the strip!
