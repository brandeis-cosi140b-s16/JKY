Sometimes, you just need a drink.  Like when it's a Tuesday.  I mean come on, I put a good 2 days worth of work in, it's time to relax.  

We headed over to Dos for Happy hour, and I was thrilled to find killer specials. $2.00 Pacificos and margaritas really hit the spot.  We sat at the bar, and it was clear our bartender was a real pro.  She remembered that I didn't like the lime in the beer, and seemed to know many of the other patrons by name.

We took advantage of the happy hour food prices as well, and I got the quesidilla, with steak.  It was delicious and melty and cheesy, all the things it should be.  Sadly, I was so stuffed from that that I couldn't try the amazingly loaded Rocky Point Nachos or the tasty looking queso dip my friends got.  

Great value, great service and a good atmosphere, this Dos Gringos is a happy hour must.
