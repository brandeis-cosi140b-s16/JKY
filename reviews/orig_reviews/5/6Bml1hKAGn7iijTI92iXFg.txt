Had my second visit to Tex's and it was better than the first. First visit was Tacos on a busy Friday. The sat me at the bar and the food and service was excellent. Went for lunch and had the enchiladas. The variety of items is awesome I had three different  enchiladas with three different sauces and the food was great. Can't go wrong at this place.They also have a great bar selection. Parking can be difficult but well worth it for a great meal.
