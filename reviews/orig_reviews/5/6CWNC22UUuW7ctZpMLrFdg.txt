We were drawn to this place because of the ambiance but ended up really enjoying the food.  To start, margaritas were perfectly strong, chips were warm, and salsa was  delicious and had a kick to it.  For the food, we tried the nachos with shredded beef, steak picado, and arrachera.  All were cooked perfectly and served with fresh tortillas.  The server was nice but not overly attentive, yet there were enough other team members that we never really had to wait for anything.  The menu is large for those of you who are more on the picky side.
