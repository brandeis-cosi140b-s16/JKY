Awesome place for lunch in the area. These people know good Mexican cuisine.  I had the carnitas burrito with red sauce. Chili sauce "wet" is the way to go, trust me. Carnitas were tender and juicy. Also, it's family owned/operated. Nothing "commercial" about this place at all. Just real, flavorful food.
