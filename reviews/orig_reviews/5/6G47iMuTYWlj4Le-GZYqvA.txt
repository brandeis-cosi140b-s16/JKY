Isla has been rated as being the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.

I was in the mood for Mexican and it was just perfect that Isla was located inside Treasure Island, the hotel that I was staying at.  So, I treated my partner and friends out.

I had the Enchiladas which had chipotle tomato sauce and oaxoca (sp?) cheese.  My partner and friends enjoyed their dishes as well.  

I had ordered a margarita.  It came in a small glass and was charged $9 bucks.  At first, I thought...what a joke!  Holy moly!  I was like not even 1/4 done with it and I was already sporting a buzz.  They make strong shit yet delicious!  

The restaurant is pretty with enough decorum for you to look and comment with your friends.  The wait service is satisfactory.  Food is wonderful.  Just be prepared to shell out a good wad of money.
