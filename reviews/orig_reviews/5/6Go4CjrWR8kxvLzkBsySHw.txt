My boyfriend and I are trying out a bunch independent places in our new neighborhood. Based on the reviews we saw for Santos Lucha Libre, we knew it had to be one of the first ones we tried. 

Upon walking in, we we're warmly greeted by the staff and asked if it was our first time. They allowed us to sample the different meats to make sure we ordered something we enjoyed - awesome! I got two tacos a la carte, one spicy chicken with lettuce, cheese, corn salsa and sour cream, and one spicy pork with lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, pineapple tidbits, and sour cream. My boyfriend got the three taco plate (a mere $6.99), and had two spicy pork and one regular pork taco. I also ordered a large horchata based on the Yelp reviews.

Everything was amazing! The horchata was so delicious, my spicy chicken taco had a lot of kick, and the spicy pork with the pineapple was just incredible. The meat is juicy and delicious, the toppings are all fresh, and the tortillas are slightly grilled before the tacos are assembled.

This will definitely be in our rotation for local joints to return to.
