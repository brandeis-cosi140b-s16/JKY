Muy muuuuyy bien! I'm going to say that Frank & Fina's is the best mexican restaurant in town (well...on the west side of the strip). I absolutely love this place. The tortilla chips and salsa are fresh, the food is amazing and the servers are very friendly. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, my favorite is the carnitas tacos. Juicy, crispy pork on fresh corn tortillas. It's a small location in summerlin and perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Five stars. Go try it.
