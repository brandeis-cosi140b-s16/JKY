You can't get anything not amazingly delicious from Viva Mercado's. I've been dining here for the last 15 year, the food is very flavorful and authentic  and the margaritas are splendid. They have the best  Toriadas I've ever had. They have a great food special if you eat in the bar and they're a great choice for catering options.
