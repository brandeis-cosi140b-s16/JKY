Wow... what can I say... so deliriously good. We had some very good margaritas and then the calimari steak appitizer.  Wow. Divine! Tender and the sauce had a good kick to it. Loved it. I ordered the layered enchiladas. .. with the egg... christmas style. Awesome! My husband had the pork ribs. Fall. Off. The. Bone. Great!! If we lived here, we would be regulars... enjoy!
