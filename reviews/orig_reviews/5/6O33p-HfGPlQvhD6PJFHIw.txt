Yelp hot spot for sure that actually lived up to it's expectations. The atmosphere is definitely not the best considering the location is in a run down shopping center. Oh well, it's all about the food right? Although on the plus side they did change the tables and chairs since my first visit which was last year. My first time here I tried the fusion burrito with chicken, pretty delicious I must say and wayy cheap too about $5ish. A little on the spicy side, but most chicken dishes that are Mexican are typically spicy to begin with. Most people like the heat, but for me I definitely drank all my water before finishing the burrito. My second time I came in a huge group with 20+ during lunch on a Sunday. Fortunately they had an area that was reserved, I don't know who it was for, but they obviously had to seat us there since there was no where else. The service was really good considering how big our group was and they accommodated all of us having separate checks. I had the bolgogi fries, which I had high hopes for and it was good but was missing the "fresh factor."  I don't think I would order this again and stick the basics next time I come.
