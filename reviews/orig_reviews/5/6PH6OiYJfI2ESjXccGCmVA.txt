I go to Vegas several times a year, have eaten at restaurants galore in this city (yay, expense account!) and this restaurant has become my standard go-to.  Mexican and Chinese street food both done well.

I dream of the Pozole Rojo soup here.  Out-friggin-standing.  The broth is rich, a little spicy, with big, huge chunks of pork.  Alongside you get a plate with avocado, finely sliced cabbage and some pork rinds.  I cannot express my love for this soup.  It is my meal of choice in this city.
