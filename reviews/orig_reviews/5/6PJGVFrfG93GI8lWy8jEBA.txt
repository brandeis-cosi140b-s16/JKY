My favorite spot in town.  They're always having great deals, specials and events. Service is always good & Chef Paco comes out, always checking on his customers and asking about the food. The carne asada is amazing, awesome margaritas and tres leches is the best desert. I find out all their great deals and specials through FB....until Thursday, where I'll post about their tacos and beer for $19.99!
