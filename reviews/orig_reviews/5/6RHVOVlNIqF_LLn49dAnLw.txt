I love this place. It's everything I look for when searching for local food joint. It's a little hole in the wall place with phenomenal food. The place gives off a great vibe with  all the random artwork and cool posters hanging around. The staff/owners are great people with a great taste in food. I was recommended their shrimp tacos; I tried them and I am in love. But their homemade green chili tacos are to die for. Great place, great people, and amazing food!!!
