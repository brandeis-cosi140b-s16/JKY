I've tried ceviche at numerous restaurants, some overly priced! Reyes by far have the BEST ceviche I've tasted. Everything about it is perfect. Their tacos are awesome as well. I personally don't care for tortas because it's too big and too much meat for me but my friends all love it. Service is fast, staff is Ã¼ber friendly, reasonably priced, a very casual place to take your family.
