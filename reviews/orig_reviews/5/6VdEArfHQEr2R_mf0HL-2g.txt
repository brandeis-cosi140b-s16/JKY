I grew up in Arizona and have lived in Mexico, so I grew up on real deal Mexican food. That being said, Taqueria La Unica is where I go for the food I grew up on, my "soul food" if you will. Their "authentic" tacos are just like the El Chino taco stand I used to love on the beach in Puerto Pe√±asco. They have 5 or 6 different kinds at La Unica. Everything I've ever had is A++. When I take my Dad he gets what I call "Gringo-Mex" dishes like the "Speedy Gonzales" or one of their Chimichangas. But literally EVERYTHING is good. I would especially recommend the Carnitas dinner and the Ceviche. They do both of these dishes as well as anybody. Breakfast is KILLER, try a burrito. My wife loves their shrimp plates and fajitas. My little girl (7yo) LOVES the enchiladas. The prices are more than reasonable. If you like avocado, make sure you ask for some of their avocado salsa when they bring out the mild and hot with the chips. If I ever have to eat Mexican food anywhere else in Charlotte-Metro, it never measures up to La Unica. You might have to wait to be seated, but they are fast and it's SO worth it!
