Whoa. Pretty blown away by my experience here. To be honest I really didn't know what I was going to do for a week in Phoenix. I was hoping to visit some hole in the wall Mexican places, drink some mezcal, and have some fun. Unfortunately I ended up in a pretty ritzy hotel in an area with no holes in the wall. I was not very hopeful for being able to get a great experience without taking a taxi across town, but I was pointed the direction of this restaurant when I asked where I could find mezcal. They have 2 kinds to try. Aged in oak and not aged in oak. Both were good, but I would go for the not aged I think. We started with some seviche with beet and sweet potato chips. It was pretty good and a big hit around the table. I thought it was about normal except for the chips which were a nice touch. As for the meal, I got a few different tacos which were all good, but the vampiro taco was absolutely out of this world. I mean like buckle your knees nothing else matters in the world good. Tender, juicy meat and a mixture of wonderfully different, yet familiar flavors. I've been thinking of them every day since I had them. My friend had some cheese thing with chorizo I think that you put in tortillas which were great too. We all had margaritas  as well and they were great. They're not made with some cheap mix and served in some martini glass, but a classic, good quality margarita that you just want to drink all night. The staff was very good too. Nothing that sticks out really, but attentive and accurate and friendly. Also, just have a mention that any menu that mentions epazote multiple times is a hint to a great experience to come!
Thanks so much for giving such a great experience on my trip!
