Sweet Wife scouts for a cool restaurant on Yelp and announces, "I want to go to Kotex".

*Record scratching*

"Whaat?"



There was only one waitress so she was pretty frantic but the tacos were amazing. Deliciously flavorful. And the torta was severed on a perfectly toasted bun. We got one taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla. That was a fresh, crispy little surprise. The nachos and burrito at the table next to us looked so good that I almost asked for a bite.

We've got a new must-go in Vegas.

Now what was the name again? Tampax? Always?
