Love the place.  Have been going at least once a week for the last two months.  Their enchiladas are amazing and the stuffed poblanos are out of this world.  Only downside is that they sometimes run out of the poblanos. I learned to call ahead and make sure they'd have them on hand and they always will. If you're a first timer it can be a little confusing but they're quick to help and explain.  Always a great experience!
