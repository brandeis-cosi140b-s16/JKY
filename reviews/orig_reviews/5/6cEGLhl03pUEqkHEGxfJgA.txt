One of the best restaurants in the East Valley. I've been going to Blue Adobe for about five years, and it's as good today as it was the first time I visited. The service is first rate and attentive, with seating prompt, and the restaurant is clean (including the bathrooms).

Blue Adobe is a great option for someone who likes Mexican but wants a healthier option. Nothing is smothered in cheese, is refried, or is greasy, even when fried. Portions are huge, but they aim for quality more than quantity.

My favorite dish the Adobe Salad (a large with added shrimp will put you back about $15, but it's worth every penny), made of baby greens, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, tortilla strips, and the most amazing and addictive orange/chipotle dressing and your choice of protein (tenderloin, shrimp, salmon, chicken, or none at all).

Another great dish worth mentioning are the tenderloin rellenos. Typical Mexican restaurant chili relenos are eggy with greasy filling; these are lightly breaded and filled with high quality cheese and meat. These rellenos hold their pepper shape well too; you won't find a chile flattened across your plate here.

The negatives: it can get kind of loud from conversation. I also thought their pizza was mediocre, but I think the pizza dishes aren't on the menu anymore.

Pay no attention to the rash of one-star reviews. Blue Adobe seats about 30-40; if the group had actually tried to make a reservation for a group that big, they'd have been told to rent the whole restaurant for the night. Shame on them for showing up with more people than promised and then flaming this review board.
