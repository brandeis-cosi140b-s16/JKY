We finally stopped in here for lunch today.  The owner was friendly.  The restaurant appears very clean.  There are lunch specials from which to choose in addition to the regular menu.  We ordered from the lunch specials.  For $3.99 your choice comes with refried beans and a side of rice.  While we were waiting, a basket of tortilla chips and salsa were brought out.  The food was very good.  This is definitely a keeper!  I'm sorry it took so long to get there!
