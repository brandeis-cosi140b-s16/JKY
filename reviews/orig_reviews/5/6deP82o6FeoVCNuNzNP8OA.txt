This place really is a hideaway! Hard to find and with no sign, just a menu posted next to a door. Best kept secret in Phoenix. Been here several times now, and love it more every visit. It is small, dark and cozy inside...with some of the most amazing southwest and New Mexico style food. They have a full bar, happy hour food and drink specials, and open late! I always get the New Mexico Enchiladas, and the Carne Adovada. INCREDIBLE! Their red and green sauce are to die for! Daily specials also available...just check the board. I can't say enough good things about it. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean. The place is small, so get there early, and parking is ample...located in a small strip mall. See you there! :-)
