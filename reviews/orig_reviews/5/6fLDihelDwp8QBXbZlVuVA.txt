I was in Arizona for the weekend visiting my cousin and this was the best last meal we could have together! I can honestly say those are the best fish tacos I've ever had plus their cilantro/lemon/guac salsa is amazing! The waitresses went out of their way to make sure we where comfortable and that my cousins kids where happy. Plus, the place wasnt packed at all and the atmosphere was wonderful with all the bright fun colors.
