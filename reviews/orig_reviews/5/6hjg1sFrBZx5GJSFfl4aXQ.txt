Fantastic burgers where the size of the burger doesn't matter much.  The patties are smaller than you would normally get, but the ingredients that are used make each burger unique.  I had the burger with the egg on top and it was such a nice addition.  I am always a fan when you utilize an egg on a burger.  Combines my favorite meal of the day with a burger.

Location is fairly small and it always seems like it is busy when we were there, but they bring out the food in a timely manner.  Definitely a place to come back to!
