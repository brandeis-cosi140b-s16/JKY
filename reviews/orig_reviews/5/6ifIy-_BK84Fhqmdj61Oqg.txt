Our food was great, but what set this restaurant apart was an incident that happened with my debit card. I accidentally left it on the table after paying and did not discover it was missing until 2 days later. Checked online and there were no fraudulent  charges. My wife called and a lady named Mary told us they had my debit card in their office. Thanks, Fajitas!! Your honesty is exemplary.
