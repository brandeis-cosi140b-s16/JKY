Blue Adobe has become one of our favorite restaurants. Their daily specials are always my go to, either the Ancho Salmon, Chorizo Stuffed Chicken or the Stacked Enchiladas! The salsa is one of the best around also! I highly recommend checking this place out if you are looking for good food, and a local spot!
