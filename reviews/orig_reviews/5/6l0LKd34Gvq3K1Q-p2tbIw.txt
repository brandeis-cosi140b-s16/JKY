Just ate here with a couple of my friends. Never heard of this place until one of them told me about it. What a tremendous establishment. Everyone was so nice. Our waiter was the best. Friendly people, excellent ambience, terrific food, etc. You can't go wrong with Viva Mercados. Highly recommended! It's also in a great strip mall. 

5 stars!!
