Wow! This place was awesome! The food was great, the drinks were great and the service was good. The price is high but other than that it was great. I got the taco combo plate. Next time I'll get either all carnitas or all carne asada because their chicken tacos aren't great. The free chips and salsa tasted great! I plan to visit here again!
