Holy cow!! This place is insanely good!! Bulgogi fries and bulgogi tostada are to die for!! The tostada has a crispy rice cake in place of a crispy tortilla. Insanely delicious! I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I can't vouch for the "non-fusion" items but the fusion items are awesome! Reasonably priced and excellent attentive service makes this an even better dining experience. If you haven't make the trek to try this place, stop what you're doing and go now!!
