My wife loves their chicken flautas so I was forced to give them another try snd I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Service was efficient food came out hot and very quickly. I even got to meet Christian the general manager who was extremely pleasant and seemed to be genuinely interested in how our experience was coming along.  Very happy with this visit, hopefully things are turning around here.
