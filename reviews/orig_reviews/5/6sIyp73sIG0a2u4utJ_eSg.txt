I have to give 5 stars just for the tacos. They have the best tacos I have ever had (I have tried a lot). Every single one is good but my favorites are the chicken, braised beef and ahi tuna. Misters outside are a plus. They have valet and located in between 2 other good restaurants, postino and a pizza place (can't remember the name).
