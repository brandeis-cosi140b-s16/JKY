Amazing!!! The torta was so flavorful and delicious. I had the regular size carne asada. It was the perfect size especially with the side of fries that came with. My 7 year old daughters each had a mini torta and that was just the right size for them. My picky eater asked me after she took her first bite, "mama can we come back here?  Please". She loved the torta. Both my daughters did. We all had agua fresca of mango!  Excellent!   We will definitely be back!! Plus!!! The service was friendly and very inviting!
