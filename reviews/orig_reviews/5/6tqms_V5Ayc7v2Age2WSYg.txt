I took my parents here when they came for a visit. We celebrated my birthday with fajitas and margaritas! I had the chicken fajitas and they were cooked to perfection! The noodle soup that comes before the meal is one of my favorite appetizers! My mother and I had traditional margaritas and we both agreed they were definitely made with love and great skill. All margaritas are not created equal, some leave you feeling weighed down with all the sweetness, not these! They were made perfectly! The service was great and my birthday tequila shot was awesome (not much of a shot person, but it was sweetened with some lemon juice and it went down smooth). The cinnamon churros with whipped cream were a nice end to a wonderful birthday dinner!
