Love The Stand!  Their short rib tacos are literally the best in town.  I love the sweetness from the red cabbage thing they've got going on in there and it's just super delicious.  The shakes are totally amazing and my husband and daughter love their burgers and fries!  We go at least twice a month! super yum!
