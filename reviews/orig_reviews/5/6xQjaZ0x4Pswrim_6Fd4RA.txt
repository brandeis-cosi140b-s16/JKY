Cinco de Mao lunch. 
Busy and on top of it! 
Had Nachos. Really great taste with "blanco sauce".  My friend, who does NOT eat Mexican food.... Enjoyed his combo plate.
Upbeat vibe! Everyone from hosts, bartenders, and bussers were friendly and attentive. The manager was working with the crew. 
I'm in the food business and don't leave reviews often. Looking around here, the experienced staff were engaged with each other (teamwork) and anticipating needs of guests! 
Must say, very happy with my visit!
