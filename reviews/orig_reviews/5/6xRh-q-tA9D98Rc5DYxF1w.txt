This place sets a new bar for complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are a cornucopia of crispy warm blue corn, white corn, four, sweet potato, and wonton style flavors sprinkled with yummy seasonings. The freebie salsa is thick and delicious, far beyond freebie grade.

The Grand Canyon frozen margarita was tangy and superb. First time I've had a margarita dressed up with bits of fresh orange zest.

The table-side guacamole is pretty good. I think I'll ask for extra spice next time.

The outdoor seating s great...overlooking the courtyard mini waterfalls & fountain.
