I've been eating here since I moved here in 2000. As far as the 5 star rating "as good as it gets", well, it's as good as it gets for what it is. I think some of the other reviewers just don't "get it".  Is it extremely good mexican food? No. Is it extremely good chinese food? No. Are there booths and waiters? No. Does it have good food, for a good price, quick, friendly service, and a good casual atmosphere? Yes!

And to the people who say "I don't think I want chinese and mexican at the same time"... Are you stupid? Then just order one! Duh! No one is forcing you to order both. 

And then to the people who say ordering is confusing... have you never ordered off a sushi menu? Very similar. And, the staff will help you order, if you're just way out there and don't understand.

And to the ones who say "I don't see how a snicker-doodle cookie ties in?" Dude - you're getting a free cookie! Who cares how it "ties in"?

Sorry for the negativity, but I hate it when people don't "get" that this is a dive joint, with a concept - one of the best dive joints/concepts in North Phoenix.
