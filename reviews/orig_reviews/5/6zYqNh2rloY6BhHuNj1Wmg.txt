THAT salsa! THOSE tacos! THIS could be a dangerous problem of yummy proportions! 

Challenge accepted! 

Someone give me a stamp card and lets get started on a beautiful journey covered in the salsa bar's guacamole with a twist of lime. BYT is simple food that is done impeccably well. And it is apparent by the hoards of loyal lunchtime business they do. 

THAT insanely large line moves fast and smooth! THOSE employees give beyond friendly with a smile service! THIS needs to be your next lunchtime meal! 

Bonus: Taco Tuesdays mean tacos are only $1.49 each!

So grab yourself the biggest horchata I've ever seen, and accept the challenge that will have you hooked on BYT.
