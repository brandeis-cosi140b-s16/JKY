Man, I love tacos. I do. They're so good, basic, and most of the time they're a great bargain. I love tacos more when I have to drive and hunt and search for the best tacos in town. It makes the tacos that much better. 

Los Tacos is consistently one of my favorite places in Las Vegas for Mexican food. It's good, their menu is pretty varied, and the guys there really know their stuff. 

As stated in Bella C's post, this place is in the same lot as Tacos El Gordo, so you've got options here. Los Tacos is a more premium-ish place than Tacos El Gordo, and their meat shows it. The meat is more tender, delicious, and is fully complemented by their delicious toppings. (El Gordo is a lot more no-frills!)

I personally come here and always order the carne asada burrito with a drink. The prices are a little higher than Tacos El Gordo, but they're still pretty good. When they ask you what you want on your burrito, and you say "everything," that adds like $2 to that item. They charge you for the guac and stuff, which seems dumb to me. It's not my favorite pricing scheme.
