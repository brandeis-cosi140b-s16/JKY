This place was awesome!! I saw a episode of diners drive ins and dives and my gf suggested we try it out. 

Me and my gf spent a loooong day in Sedona AZ and drove two hours to this spot hoping to feed our hunger!  When we arrived the gentlemen at the counter asked if we were first timers (probably because we stared at the menu forever!!) not only was he very patient but he let us try 4 dishes off the menu FREE!!! 

We ended up ordering the Jade chicken over jerk rice with sweet pork (see attached pic) long review short, it was absolutely worth the trip from CALI to try this awesome Gem! 

IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACES 6 STARS I WOULD (not only for the food but the amazing customer service)
