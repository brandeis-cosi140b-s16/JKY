Like a lot of people, I went here because it was seen on man vs. food. I was not ready to try the challenge or the sandwich. It looks like too much is going on in it. I had half the torta nortena and torta nortena del polla. They were both satisfying. The salsa provided gave it the right amount of flame. The restaurant has an open kitchen setting. Going to a mexican restaurant, i was set on getting some chips and salsa. To my disbelief, I had noticed plates with ruffles chips on them. Couldn't they just cut some tortillas up and deep fry them? 

I'll probably be back to try another torta or some other entree.
