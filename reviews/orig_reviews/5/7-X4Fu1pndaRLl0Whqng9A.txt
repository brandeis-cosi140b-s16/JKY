Me and my girlfriend were going to go to Stripburger, but we saw this place and decided to check it out.  We're glad that we did.  This place had great food and great service.  I had the short rib tacos and my girlfriend had a short rib quesadilla.  The portion sizes were very filling.  The meat was served in a small container and I had enough for about 5 small tacos.  I'm not a fan of rice and beans, but these were excellent.

The best part of the meal was the guacamole.  It was by far the best I've ever had.
