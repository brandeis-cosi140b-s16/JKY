I can not get enough of this place! Been here 4+ times and each time it's exceeded my expectations. From the staff to service to food everything was amazing. Each time me and my party orders it takes maybe 5 minutes max before all the food comes flying on the table. The shrimp tacos are to die for and my all time FAVORITE thing they have is the bread pudding for dessert. Amazing is all I can say :)
