I've been eating there since the 1980's and probably go there almost every week.
WARNING: The food is very addicting-go at your own risk!  In other words, it's my
favorite Mexican food place of all time.  The staff is friendly, service is good. The most
authentic food in Arizona.  I think I'll have my birthday party there....
