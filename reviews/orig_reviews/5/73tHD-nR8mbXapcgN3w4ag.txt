Seeked out a different lunch spot in downtown Phoenix. Fuego was easy to get to; parked at the City Scape Garage (Fuego validates - a plus!). Arrived just before the lunch rush on a Saturday at about 12:30 p.m. I wish I would have asked his name (I usually do), our waiter excelled at his job. The whole time we were there, folks were lining up at the door waiting to be seated (inside or out).  The waiter, greeted & seated folks, took orders, delivered meals, refilled beverages and never stopped.  We were impressed by his energy and great work ethic. He moved very quickly and was polite and thorough the entire time.  Yes, the cuisine was original and tasty. I had the Fuego Salad with grilled shrimp and my husband the meatloaf. Did I mention that the "Superwaiter" serviced all the tables in the restaurant, I'm guessing 15+. He hustled!  The second waiter who started his shift later, was slow in comparison.  Kuddos to the Superwaiter; I hope the owner realizes the gem they have employed and will compensate accordingly.
