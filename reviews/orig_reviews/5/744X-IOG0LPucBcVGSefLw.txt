The food quality is probably a 4.5, but I'm giving Fiest Burrito a bump for the value.  This place is great - I can routinely walk across the street for lunch and get a filling meal for under $4.  Everything I've had here has been tasty, but I'd specifically recommend the California Burrito.  Being from the east coast, I had never really had one of these until recently, but let me tell you - it's DAMN good.  Pretty much any burrito with meat and potatoes will end up being good, but add in the pico, cheese, and salsa and it's borderline delicious.  I've left a few lunches in the fridge at work because of cravings for the California Burrito.  The Green Chile Burrito (Pork and Green Chile) is also great and highly recommended.

Bottom line: not necessarily the first place you'd think of if you're craving mexican food, but it's well worth a trip.  I will be frequenting this place from now on.
