Music venue: I believe this is the best one in town. Perfect combination of intimate standing and seating areas, and the sound is awesome. Every show I've seen here has sounded fantastic. A.

Parking: easy enough. Plenty of metered street parking that becomes free at 8. Pay lot across the street for $5. Also very close to the light rail stop. B+.

Food: Decent. Priced right. Had the barbacoa burrito and it was pretty tasty--better than Chipotle's, anyway. Good chips/salsa too. Wouldn't go out of our way to eat here, but if you're there and you're hungry, eat up. B.

Bathrooms: There is a one-seater in the lounge (sucks for the people just hanging out in the lounge--the line can get long) and a large, extremely clean one in the music venue area. Never had to wait in line or hold my breath. A.

Drinks: We were there the night they were sort of creating the Honey Badger and were lucky enough to be given a free sample. Hooked. They do cocktails right there. A.

Beer selection: Meh. Probably the only thing I'm going to find to complain about is the beer selection. Two bars--one in the lounge and one in the venue--and they have slightly different beers on tap. So you can get a Hoegarten in the venue but not in the lounge. They have a Sierra Nevada on tap along with a couple of Four Peaks beers and Stella (I think) and that's it for the taps. A few more crappy domestic canned selections rounds it out. I think they could do a lot better here.  You're using local chefs that use local ingredients to create menus here--why not take advantage of the local beer scene? Four Peaks is overused and overrated as far as I'm concerned, but people like it (I get it). How about some Sonoran? Prescott brewing? Nimbus?  C.

End of the day--I'm thrilled this place exists. I hope it puts the Clubhouse under.
