This place is great! We went during restaurant week in the fall 2014. ( this is very late) and we haven't stopped talking about it yet. The decor is perfection! I love it. The cocktails were very good. The food was well thought out and very tasty.We had the guac with dried fruit in it and I could eat it everyday. I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberry gazpacho. It was good,but gave me instant heartburn. Not their fault. I couldn't finish it and had to send it back, sadly. I told the waitress what happened and they happily took it back and brought us more guac instead ( insert happy dance) I had Al pastor pad Thai and that was fantastic. This place is all my fav cuisines in one restaurant. Will be back soon!
