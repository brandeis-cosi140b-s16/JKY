Favorite restaurant. Gilbert location was amazing as well, almost better experience than the central location but just about tied. Amazing drinks and food. Glad to see Mexican food modern and yet still a little traditionally represented. Experience is great at the bar or a table, from the first time they set the chips and salsa down!
