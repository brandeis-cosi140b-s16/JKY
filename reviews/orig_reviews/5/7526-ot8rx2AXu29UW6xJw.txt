Oh my goodness....I love love love this place!! I've been trying to find good enchiladas and chile relleno since I moved and came to Wisconsin and they have both. The food was hot and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful. My husband enjoyed the steak tacos. They give you two types of salsa with tortilla chips when you are seated ...one was very hot but both were tasty. Qdoba, Chipotle are fast food compared to this place and I can't even go in those places with a straight face after going to this Taqueria. I will definitely be returning!!
