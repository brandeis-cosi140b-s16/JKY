Brought my parents here, and encouraged them to get a little tipsy on sangria and margaritas while we waited. They did, I did -- off to a good start.

I am all about the Ensalada Cortada. You might be thinking, to hell with corn nuts, what is a Yulu seed or a zamorano, these do not belong in my salad.

We don't know each other that well, but (and don't take this the wrong way), but you're trippin'. Just get the 1/2 price, 1/2 serving-size of the Cortada, and thank me later. And set aside the fact that the rich, creamy ranch dressing nearly negates the health-factor of "getting a salad," and focus on the crunchy tangy deliciousness up in your mouth.

My parents also watched on as I tore into the elote as if it were a weak, sick antelope in a PBS documentary. Get your buzz on before hand, so that instead of inspiring terror in those around you, everyone sort of giggles without making eye contact.

(My parents also got things to eat. I am sure those things were good too.)
