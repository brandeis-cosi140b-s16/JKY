Affordable Mexican food with an authentic Mexican taste is hard to come by. Viva Zapata's is just that. A great atmosphere and even better food, Viva Zapata's has become my go-to restaurant for Lunch and Dinner. The customer service is head and shoulders above any other restaurant in the area. The front desk staff, the wait staff, and the bus staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. The food is prepared quickly and I am always able to get in and out for lunch in less than 45 minutes. When I have a big group the staff always accommodates us and we always leave satisfied. I will continue to support this wonderful business and I will always recommend it to my friends!
