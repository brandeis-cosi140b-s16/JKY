It's Ahwatukee. There are some awesome Mexican restaurants (Los Dos Molinos, Z Tejas if New Mexican works for you), but they come at a price.  This is not where most people would go for authentic Mexican food.

Los Taquitos is just about perfect for what it is.  The food is delicious and the prices are on par with Filibertos, without tasting like Filibertos.  It makes complete sense Food Network featured this restaurant once you take a bite.

Cons: It's in a strip mall between a Safeway and haircut place and a Walgreens and dive bar (Cactus Jacks), service is rushed, and condiments and hot sauce are available only if the restaurant isn't packed (usually isn't) and they're at the stand up front.

Pros: Everything that matters.  Food is authentic and tasty, you can come here anytime for a hangover "breakfast" or lunch or dinner, and you can expect that whatever you order off the menu will come exactly as you'd hope (or better). 

Highly recommended.
