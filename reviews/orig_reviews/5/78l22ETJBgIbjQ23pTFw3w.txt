Not your run of the mill mexican joint. In the surrounding area, there must be at least 20 craptastic, dirty, and downright disgusting mexican joints. This one DOES NOT fit in that category. Don't be turned off by the location (high Hispanic population) - this place is GOOD. The inside is actually CLEAN and the food is outstanding. Try a carnitas quesadilla...or for the seafood lover have the Cocteles (cocktail). DELICIOUS!!
