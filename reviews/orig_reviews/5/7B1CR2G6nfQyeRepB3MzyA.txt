This place was phenomenal. Huge potions, great chips and salsa, and this delicious chip thing that they gave us for dessert. Service was also superb -- there was so much food that we had leftovers, but they didn't bring us a bag, and I was just about so say something when a waitress came over and quietly bagged our boxes for us. Can't wait to go back!
