This is by far and large one of the best restaurants in the State! Chef Robert is a culinary genius and the place is gorgeous.   From the appetizers to the skirt steak the fare is unlike no other! Great place for dinner and then downtown or Smith Center! Highly recommended and I've been eating there since its inception and it's consistent!!
