Been eating here since they opened Dos. In fact, to get there, we drive right by El Encanto in Cave Creek. We like Dos better!

Very efficient wait staff (we always eat in the bar). I love their chicken burros doused in mild salsa. That mild salsa is made up of nearly 20 different items and has never let us down. Our chips are always great! 

Love the place and the staff, Just wish El Encanto was as good to save us the miles!
