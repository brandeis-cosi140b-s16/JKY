Great, cozy ambiance. Great service. Complex, unique, and absolutely delicious flavors on everything that I've tried (tacos, quesadilla, salsa, margaritas). The quesadilla is unlike any other I've ever seen or tasted, and absolutely the best. The margaritas are the best I've had in the valley, and the happy hour price for them is amazing. 
Their menu is so awesome too, so many things that are unique and not commonly found.
