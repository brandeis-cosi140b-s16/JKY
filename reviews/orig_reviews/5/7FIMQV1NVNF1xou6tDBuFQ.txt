This is one of my favorite Mexican "fast food" joints ever.  My company caters from them quite often, and whenever we order from there, people love us!!! We get the chicken fajita , carne asada and carnitas burritos. The meat is so flavorful and delicious.  They always do such a fantastic job. Very hard workers. It is owned by Arturo and his sister, Maria. Say hi to them next time you stop in.
