Some other cranky New York expats and I were bemoaning the food around here, so I started thinking about my favorite places to eat in the Valley. Places where I haven't been disappointed, and where I don't leave feeling like I paid for a great meal and got a good meal.  The Mission is one of them.  Go there and eat.  Eat anything on the menu.  It will be good.
