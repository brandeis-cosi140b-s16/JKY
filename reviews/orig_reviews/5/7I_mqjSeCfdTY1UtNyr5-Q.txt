Tried vegan menu. The fajitas the enchiladas and the chili relle√±o. All of it was great. Haven't had fajitas in forever, but the gardein chicken and beef was great. They explained everything vegan very well and while they didn't have a vegan dessert they suggested a nearby Italian place that did. 

Nice to have edible vegan options at a reasonable price on the strip without resorting to salads. 

Great job David our waiter.
