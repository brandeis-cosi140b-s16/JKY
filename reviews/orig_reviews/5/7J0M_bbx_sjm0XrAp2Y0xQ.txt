Man vs Food featured restaurant!   How dumb of me to think that I could come here and eat the same amount of food as Adam Richman?!

I was visiting Arizona and decided to do a search on the restaurants that were featured in Man Vs. Food or those who had a James Beard Award Nominee or Winner.  Nice comparison, huh?!

I got to Los Reyes De La Torta at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and this place was PACKED!!!  I was quickly seated by two young and bubbly waitresses.  Did I mention that this place is always packed?!  I found out why!

I started my meal by ordering the Aguas cremosas - $4.50.  I ordered the Canteloupe (choices of  strawberry, mango, banana, papaya, or canteloupe). The fresh fruit was mixed with carnation and sweet cream.  It tasted like a canteloupe shake with delicious condensed milk!   INSANE!!!!   Grade:  A+

For my lunch meal, I ordered the Del Rey - $9.50.  It was ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, with refried beans, hot dog meat & chorizo omelet, tomato, onion, avocado,& chipotle sauce. Served with chopped onion & cilantro with garnished salad.  HOLYSHAMADIGIGGIDY!!!!  This sandwich was HUGE, delicious, and insane!   I literally ate only 1/4 of this sandwich.  My Yelp friends know how much I can eat, bit sadly will I admit.....

FOOD WON!  :(
