Great Mexican food that is authentic and fast. I usually get the carne asada tacos a la carte with a drink and its under $11. Frank is usually working the register with family in the kitchen. The seating area is small but the turn-over is pretty quick. For lunch it can be a little hard to find parking since Popeyes opened.
