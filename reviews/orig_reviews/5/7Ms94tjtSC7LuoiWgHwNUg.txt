One of the best two in one spots I have ever step foot in! Their tacos are full of flavor, my favorite is the chicken tinga- perfect blend of sweet and salty. Then there is their late night partying, holy awesomeness! Full of energy and good vibes along with some confetti ;) who doesn't love confetti?!
