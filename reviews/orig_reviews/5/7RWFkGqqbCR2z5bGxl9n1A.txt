I went here for brunch on Sunday.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was sooo delicious.  I also tried the huevos benedictos and they too were outstanding. Loved the bloody marys and sangria too! I'll definitely be back to try this place for dinner. Great service and fun atmosphere! Very easy to make a reservation through Open Table on Verde's website!
