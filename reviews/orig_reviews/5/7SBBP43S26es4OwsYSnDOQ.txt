One of my families favorite restaurants, love the trendyness of the decor and setup. To start off the guacamole is very fresh and has a good taste, second the ceaser salad has to be one of the top best i'v had, always chilled and i love the spicy taste it has. oh and don't forget the egg it comes with it! a lot of people say it's not kid friendly but i bring in my kids and we have no problem, the people at the bar dont judge. overall great place for everyone.
