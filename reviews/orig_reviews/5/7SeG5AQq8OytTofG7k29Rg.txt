My husband and I met friends there for dinner last night and the food and service were awesome. I ordered a carnitas burrito wet and it was one of the best if not the best burrito I've ever had. At 65 I'm no spring chicken and I've grown up on homemade and restaurant Mexican food so that's saying something. My husband ordered the tamale, enchilada, taco combo and enjoyed it very much. He wasn't a huge fan of the tamale saying it was just OK. It wasn't our first time there and it certainly won't be our last!
