The Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla is life-changingly delicious. It is so good, you'll consider suicide right then and there, because you know nothing will ever be this delicious again. The first time biting into a Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla belongs on a list of rare life experiences like your wedding day or the birth of your first child. These things only happen once. After that, your entire gastronomic life is downhill, I'm telling you.

Look, this is my favorite restaurant in the world. This hole-in-the-wall slinging greasy food in disposable takeout tins rules the roost when it comes to EFFING DELICIOUSNESS. This is a destination restaurant disguised as a dump. This is a place that with the proper business minds could be the next mindblowing, world conquering fast food chain. Sadly, the husband/wife team running this joint aren't really interested in world domination, so there is just this one lowly location in West Phoenix (there was a location in Chandler, but it was the single worst located restaurant I had ever seen. You could use Google Maps on your phone and still drive by it six times and not know it was there... not really a shock that it's closed. Too bad, the East Valley is deprived of the culinary genius of this place).

So, you go here and you have no idea what's going on. You know what? Just go to the counter and tell them you've never been there before. They'll give you a tasting tour of the menu.

But if you trust the people in the know (in other words, me), the get a Two item combo with:
Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla
Jerk Chicken
Pork Fried Rice
Cuban Black Beans

Alternatively, you could swap out the Jerk Chicken for Pollo Diablo and the Pork Fried Rice for Jerk Fried Rice, but that's a SUPER heavy meal, so only indulge if you have a cast-iron stomach.
