The food was amazing!

I tried their oysters which were not dry nor watered down. When ordering a michelada the waiter then asked me how spicy i wanted my drink. I love how I was asked because some places make them too spicy that it over powers the drink. My cocktail came out within 15 min which was served in a molcajete (a Mexican traditional tool to make sauces) the portion was just right. The hand made tortillas were delicious. 

My overall experience was great. I am glad I decided to eat off the strip to eat something more homemade. I will absolutely be returning back once I get the chance to go to Sin City.
