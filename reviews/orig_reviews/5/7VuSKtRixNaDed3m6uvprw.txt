We were all from out of town and one of the guys had researched the restaurant.  Frankly, we were reluctant to go inside as the place looked like a hole in the wall and there was no parking out front plus the neighborhood was somewhat iffy. Anyway, once inside "wow" what a pleasant surprise. The best Mexican food I have ever had. This is Mexican gourmet dining at its best! The wait staff was terrific too! We'll be back no doubt!
