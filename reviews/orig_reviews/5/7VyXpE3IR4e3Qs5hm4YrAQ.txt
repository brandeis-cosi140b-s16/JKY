Excellent enchiladas, especially for being on the strip. Drinks were strong and delicious. I kinda laughed though when the waitor made the "fresh" guacamole in front of us. I dont really think that was necessary...but the hostess was amazingly hot and there are a few good people watching tables in the restaurant
