This place smells great: mesquite grilling.  Brought out the carnivore in me and was rewarded by ordering the asada burrito enchilada style with verde sauce.  Yum!  Manager very friendly and accommodating.  Had items on menu for my vegetarian friend as well.  I look forward to trying other choices but the steak asada is definitely the way to go here.
