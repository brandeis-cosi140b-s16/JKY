Just passing through on our way from WI to Indy, we stopped because of the positive yelp reviews and we were trying to make time on our trip.  

A few things stand out:

1.). Yes the place is small...however we found seating as soon as we ordered as the turnover was quick +1

2.). The staff was very friendly +1

3.). Chips and salsa were delivered almost instantly (and free) when we sat down and noticed that's the standard here.  The chips were firm and thick, solid combo with the spicy two salsas they served +2

4.).  Prices and food both good, bordering on great! +1 (I had the burrito and a taco americano with chorizo, the burrito was delish and would have been enough by itself )

5.). Speed - we were in and out in 20-30 mins
