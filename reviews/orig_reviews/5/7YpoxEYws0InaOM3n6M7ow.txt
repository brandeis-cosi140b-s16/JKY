Holy wow! Home made tortillas and everything is so fresh. 
Order a drink- you will thank me later. I could easily drink one of theses a day for breakfast. One of my favorite non alcoholic drinks hands down. 
While the tostas are what they are known for, the casadillas are more than amazing. The customers come in waves but the wait is short and worth it. While you are waiting you can watch the food being cooked and press their own homemade tortillas.
