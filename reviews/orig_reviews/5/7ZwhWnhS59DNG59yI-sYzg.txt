For anyone who says that Phoenix has no culture and is just a desert wasteland... please take them to this amazing restaurant.  This place is owned by the same folks who owned Richardson's (which burned down a few years ago- I was devastated - but is being re-built next to Rokerij).  

This place is dark, hip, inviting with great music and outstanding service.  The food here incredible... New Mexican cuisine meets Wild West flavors.  So good, you'll be kicking yourself for not going sooner.  Was there yesterday for brunch... carne adovada with scrambled eggs.  Seriously, the pork is the best I have ever had.  But everything on the menu is fantastic - steaks, seafood, tamales.  Yum.  Go here.
