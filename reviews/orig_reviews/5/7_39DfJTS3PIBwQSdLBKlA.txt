Better than Chipotle. 

Step One: Got the bowl

Step Two: Got the Pulehu Steak. (choose from huli huli chicken, kalua pig, steak, grilled fish, grilled veggies)

Step Three: Got the seaweed rice.

Step Four: Got mango and roasted corn (medium spice) and tomato with grilled maui onions (hot spice)

There's really not much else to say. They give samples, they are friendly, the steak was so flavorful, the corn and tomato toppings were so good. They take time with each order so if there's a long, expect to wait but it's worth it. Also, the coconut bark is so good. However, it depends on how much room I have after my meal.
