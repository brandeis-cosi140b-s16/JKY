Super excited Diego Pops opened up in this awesome spot in Old Town. Went last night and enjoyed every minute of our experience. My girlfriend and I had a great server, wish I could remember his name, he was super friendly (but not overly annoying) and explained the entire menu and drinks to us!

First of all, the set up in here is perfect and so fun! The whole place is a 50ish diner theme with a twist (Mexican food) and the patio is great. Lots of space to sit and a great fireplace.

The food was great especially when you consider that they just opened - I'm sure they are still working out a lot of kinks. We started with the corn queso, awesome flavor, could have been much warmer but still good. I had the house salad that was topped with a ton of awesome veggies and had some sort of garlic vinaigrette that was delicious  - I chose the steak as the meat and definitely glad I did. It was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Poke and also liked her food a lot!! 

The alcohol selection is good- they make all their margaritas fresh and don't use any pre made mixes. They also have tequila flights, we opted out of this but I'm sure it's pretty legit if you are a tequila lover.
For dessert, they have an ice cream bar!!!!!! (Obviously I really liked this part- even though we didn't order anything). It was super adorable and you can just walk in and order at the ice cream bar if you don't want an entire meal. 

This place was great, we will definitely be back! Check it out- I really want Diego Pops to stick around :)
