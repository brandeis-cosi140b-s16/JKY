This place was great! Mexican doesnt seem too attractive for Brunch but our party of 4 really enjoyed it! Rachel was our server,AMAZING experience. She helped us by explaining how the all you can eat brunch worked, as well as giving us the low down on what was the best plates. Will definitely return! THANKS GUYS
