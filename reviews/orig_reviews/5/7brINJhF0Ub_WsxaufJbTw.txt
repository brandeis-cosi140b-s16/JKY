I title this "5-stars, even though I have thrown up my dinner while still at the restaurant twice".  It is the experience.  I think of it as Mexi-Disneyland for adults and realize that this construct is based primarily on the excessive use of seafoam green paint and the beer shack where you can get drinks while you wait for a table.

The reasons:  I've been there many more than two times, I probably had too many coronitas while I was waiting, too much of my margarita, and too much hot salsa, and I ordered the shrimp both times -- I never really eat shrimp (but how many times can a girl eat a chile relleno when the buttery garlicness looks so so good)... but those are just hypothetical reasons that may explain the throwing up.

The reasons I like it:  My bff (best food friend) is "famous" there.  She can call and order a particular dish 24 hours in advance and it goes on the menu as the "Angela" special.  I think the story goes that she was the only person to order it the first time it was offered and she loved it and Cheryl (or Sheryl... I don't know how she spells it) loved her.  I've heard the food is a little better if you go with my bff than if you go without her.... but why would I ever go without her?  She's my best food friend and she's famous there!

There aren't a lot of vegetarian options...in fact, my bff recently told me she thinks there might be beef stock in the salsa... which leads me back to the beginning and my hypotheses about why I've thrown up in their restroom twice now.  I think we're going back next week.... so I'll write with an update....
