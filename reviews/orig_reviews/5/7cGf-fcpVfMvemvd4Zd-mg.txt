This time I decided to go to Chino and eat light.  "Impossible!!!" you say and normally I would agree.  

However, there is an off menu choice to substitute salad for rice and/or beans.  (For the regulars; just write salad over the rice and bean options).  It was awesome, I was not stuffed and hating myself at the end of lunch.  

After lunch feeling light as a feather I ate the snicker doodle... D'oh!
