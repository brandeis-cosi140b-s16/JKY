I've just moved here from San Diego & I've been searching for good Mexican food... Which I found in this place! Everything about it authentic & tastes like Mexico. The waitress was very nice & you could tell the waitstaff worked as a team being that numerous waitresses visited our table & would fulfill requests despite not being our primary waitress. The salsa was tasty & I loved the presentation. I got the enchiladas, which were tasty, & also had a coconut margarita that's not on the menu but was recommended by one of the waitresses & it was SO good! Will definitely be back!
