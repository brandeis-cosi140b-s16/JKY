Delicious food. Inexpensive too! I am from California originally just moved to Las Vegas and this place is hidden treasure. My husband had the Carne Asada torta was amazing good. I ordered "enchiladas divorciadas" one red and one green with rice and beans. Really good too. There al pastor or adobada is delicious too. Won't be disappointed. We keep coming back for more.
