Fifth time here, so I am really getting to know the menu and I usually insist on sampling from my guest plates. Chips and salsa free, but I also automatically order the guacamole which is chunky and rustic. My new favorite is Paella and at $8.00  a perfect meal The Al Pastor tacos get 6 stars, the best in town. A strong recommendation; The Inca salad with Quinoa as the main ingredient is a must order item and great for sharing. The space is beautiful as well, very clean and contemporary lines, uncluttered and a beautiful view of the kitchen where the magic happens.
