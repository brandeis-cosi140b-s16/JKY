There is no equal to Los Dos Molinos for out of this world Mexican food.  My son loves the shrimp quesadilla, and I love the adovada.  The pasole is like my mother used to make, and what they do with just simple beans and flour tortillas is pure joy.  

If you like it hot you'll be right at home, and if you like it not quite that hot you can still enjoy this sensational menu with a side of sour cream.  Recommend you always check the chalk board for Wild Hare specials as these are usually something special Victoria has put together.  My favorite is their Mac & Cheese (probably a little too spicy for children) which for a fire eater like myself was an experience I'm privileged to have enjoyed.

Much of my family is from New Mexico and when they visit Los Dos is always on the agenda.  Regardless who's visiting we're still in there once or twice a month.  

There are a lot of good places to catch a bite in Ahwatukee, but Los Dos Molinos is a cultural treasure Ahwatukians can sink their teeth into!
