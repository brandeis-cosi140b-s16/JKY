This is my FAVORITE Mexican place!!! Their salsas are INCREDIBLE (especially that green salsa.. hhmmm... could eat that for a whole meal!)

I highly recommend #14 and any of the hot plates. The mini chimis are also off daaa hook. Happy hour is a great time to go because of half-off apps and decent deals on drinks/margaritas. 

Sometimes the service can be a little off, but I feel as if that adds to the authenticity of the place lol. I get it over it really fast when I get more chips and salsa, which they just keep bringing by the way. And if they don't, don't be afraid to ask for more :)

Go there. Try it. My husband and I take everyone there. ENJOY!! Eat salsa.
