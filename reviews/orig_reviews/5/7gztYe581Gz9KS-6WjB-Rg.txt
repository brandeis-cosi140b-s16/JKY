I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean. 

I ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.

What really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.

To conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food.
