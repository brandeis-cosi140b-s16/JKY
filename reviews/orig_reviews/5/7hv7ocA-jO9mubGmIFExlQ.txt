Firstly, the people posting 4 and 5 stars are the only intelligent ones. Let me explain. The others are saying that the food is the same greasy Mexican food you can find anywhere. Evidently these people don't have a very developed palate. I don't think they can distinguish between fresh and frozen goods, proper spices and just extra cheese, or anything else. This was the best Ameri-Mexican food I've had in a LONG time.

As for the service, we sat at a table in the bar because they were so busy and we were served CONSTANTLY by not one, but TWO servers.

....This place rocks, the haters just came here with a predisposition to not like it....
