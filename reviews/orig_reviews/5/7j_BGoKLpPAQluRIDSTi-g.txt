I had dinner here Sunday night with family and it was AMAZING. 

It was late around 8pm and it wasn't very busy in the restaurant which was nice. We sat and had prompt chips/salsa and ordered some guacamole. The guacamole was wonderful and each of the salsas were very tasty. 

My mom ordered cheese blue corn enchiladas, husband ordered the New Mexican burrito, dad ordered the green chili stew and I had stuffed sopapillas. Every one loved their food. Each plate was equally tasty and the beans and rice were so great. 

I would definitely compare this food to Dicks Hideaway or Richardson's in Phoenix. I loved this restaurant. The food was so good, the service was awesome and it is close to my house. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK.
