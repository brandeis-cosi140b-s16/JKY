Easily the most authentic Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Their carne Assad tacos makes you want to freeze time so the deliciousness can infiltrate your taste buds. They have a pretty stellar salsa bar. I love their dark red chipotle salsa. It's got heat paired with a nice smoked chipotle taste which makes the pain of the heat totally worth it. The only thing I would say is, I am a little skeptical of the cleanliness of the restaurant. The building itself is old and could use a good remodel to liven the place up a little. Well worth the trip!
