We just got back from Milagro Mother's Day.  They offered a huge all-you-can-eat buffet that was fresh and good!  My companions did the buffet and I opted for the carnitas enchiladas, which was huge portions and spicy goodness.  I took one shot of the dish before and one after when I took it home.  This will last me through tonight and tomorrow!  Service was  great.  Patio was perfect.  Nice!  I'll be back to try those tacos everyone has been raving about.
