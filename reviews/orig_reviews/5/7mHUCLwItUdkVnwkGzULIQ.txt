ATS is down to 3.5 stars now?  No way!  This place rocks.  My lady and I have a ritual of sorts now for this place.  I'm here pretty much every Sunday afternoon

The tortillas here are so fresh and delicious, probably my favorite.  This place is not your greasy Mex place, it is clean and well thought out.  The menu is small, but I never am craving anything they don't offer (i.e. everything they have is good).  I have tried a bunch of similarly priced mex places in the valley and ATS outdoes them all.  

You can spend more money to get a higher level of Mex, but at $3.25 for a bean and cheese burrito from heaven, this place is perfect.
