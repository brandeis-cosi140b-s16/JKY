We ate here while traveling.  I had purchased a Groupon and we got a huge amount of food: yummy guacamole with chips, 6 tacos, 2 sides, and we ordered beer from the happy hour menu. We ordered the tacos our waitress recommended and they were really good: fish, crunchy, and pork with 2 sides: rice and corn salad.  We loved it all.  The food came quickly.  We'd eat here again and especially would come during happy hour.
