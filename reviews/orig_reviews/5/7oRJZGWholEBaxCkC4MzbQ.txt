Great spot for a casual dinner.  We were lucky to be there for $5 Monday margaritas and they were great.  Had pork and shrimp tacos for dinner as well as the chips and salsa. Both were delicious!  The wait staff was super friendly and attentive.  Nice place to sit outside to dine and enjoy the weather.  Will definitely return!!
