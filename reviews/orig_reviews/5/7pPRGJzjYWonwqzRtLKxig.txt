OK, I was suspicious that Maize was writing their own reviews, but after a Friday evening visit in October, 2011, I now understand why their growing but new fan base is over-the-top loyal and giddy about the joint.  The atmosphere was intimate, the parking lot was packed, there were no available stools.  We overheard a customer who had been there before gushing to his friends about what to order.  So I get the impression this is one of those start-ups that folks feel strongly about supporting and want to see succeed. Me too.
Small portions, but very reasonably priced (most things under $3).  Spend $8 and you will have a full meal.  The free chips are unique because they have dark specks in them and seem drier and crunchier than other Mexican restaurants in this genre. The free salsa is excellent.
