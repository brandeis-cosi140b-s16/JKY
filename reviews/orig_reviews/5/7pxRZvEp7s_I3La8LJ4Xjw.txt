Wow! We love $2 tacos. Good selection of meats.  We had the asada and spicy pork, with a side of the grilled peppers. 

Tip - each type of meat has its own line. So, don't stand in the lengua/tripe line if you want spicy pork. 

I had three tacos but should've had five. :-)

This place is a huge bonus to staying at the Wynn/Encore. It is literally across the street.
