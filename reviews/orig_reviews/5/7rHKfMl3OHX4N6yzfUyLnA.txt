Came here because of a classmates recommendation. Ordered the barbacoa burrito.

Pros-speedy service, flavorful burrito.  I recommend the mild sauce.  A great mom&pop store (5 stars).  Will go to again.  

Cons- the spicy sauce is very, very spicy.  I wish there was a scale from 1 to 10 for more options instead of only 1 option.  However, I was impressed with their level of spice.  (4.5 stars)
