I am now officially full, and five pounds heavier than when I entered Manuel's!
On this visit we received very polite and fast service from two different waiters. More than polite, they were friendly. 
I tried out the Rolled chicken quesadillas, which were well more than I could & should eat--I saved part for later. 
I was hoping for tres leches as dessert but unfortunately they do not serve that. Feeling an urge for something sweet I opted for Apple pie with ice cream which surprisingly came out on a boiling platter. The caramelized sugar added a nice flavor to the dish. To my figure's regret, I finished it alone. Couldn't waste a bit!
