How could I forget to write a review about this place!?

Me and my teammate stopped in for "tapas style brunch" after a tournament.  For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.

Food: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.

There were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.

Service: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.

Atmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.  

Maybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience.
