This place is really cool and unique. First the salsa bar is insane with like 12 different salsas. From sweet to mild to hot. The food is amazing I told the server that whatever they would order is what I want. I got this quesadilla empanada thing that was out of this world. Very small restaurant and the bar is like 3 seats but loved it.
