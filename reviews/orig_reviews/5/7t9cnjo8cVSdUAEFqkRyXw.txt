Drooooooling. 
Totally drooling.  It was everything that I thought it would be.  I wanted to come here for the longest time, but it's so damn far.  

It's located in a small plaza, but you can't miss it.  You can categorize this spot as a hole in the wall for sure-  You won't miss it.  You can't miss it. 

The fusion is amazing.   Mexican and Korean!!!! are you kidding me?  It's like two of my most favorite food worlds colliding and having a baby.   like a Brangelina baby.  

My daughter was who knows where on what trip, but this visit consisted of me, my husband, and son.  We love korean food as a family.  Mexican... me and the daughter are pretty much the only ones that will suggest it.   So that being said... here we go.  

So here's my order:  and don't think i'm a heffer, I did say it's far right?  I had to try EVERYTHING while I could.  So I did.  :P  
They start you off w/ Salsa and Guac-

Fusion Bulgogi Fries:
Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Spicy Korean Hot Sauce-  
DUDE.  yes.  it's ALL of that... and more.   like, I could've just walked out w/ ALL that in my belly... but of course I ordered more.  It's good.  Lots of meat, and a very large plate full.  

I had 3 tacos!  1 of each! pork, chicken, beef! fusion tacos Dak-gogi tacos-were my fav of the 3 marinated tacos: Flour Tortilla with Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream -- DROOL.  I love tacos.  like, my 5th love.  

We also had Kim Chee Fried Rice..... YUM!  I make a pretty mean fried rice... so this... is ooooookaaaaaaay....  It's a little oily, but still very yummy. 

You know what, to be honest with you I don't remember what they had... and it doesn't even matter because I requested we go there this night.  And I was very happy.... I think they were too.  ?  Idk. but I was.  and when mommys happy... everyone's happy.
