Places like this are why we keep coming back to Las Vegas. The food here is exceptional. If only food of this quality was more widely available. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere of Container Park is wonderful. I wished I had multiple stomachs because I wanted to eat so much more from their menu. I had a tortas with al pastor and my wife had the taco combo plate with carne asada, carnitas and al pastor. Everything was delicious and fresh. Thanks Pinches. We can't wait to come back again.
