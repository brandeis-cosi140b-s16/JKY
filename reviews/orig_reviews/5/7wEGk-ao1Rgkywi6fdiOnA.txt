My family and I went to this restaurant for the first time last night.  I was worried that we would be waiting for awhile since the parking lot was completely full, but we were able to get right in. It's true the tables are a bit crowded in, but the service was excellent.  They had this lovely mariachi band playing live music and the decor was full of Mexican pottery and plaques.  Very fun atmosphere in which to dine!  The staff was so friendly and nice!  The food was just amazing and very authentic tasting!  My family can't stop talking about their experience dining there!  We will definitely go there again, soon!
