First things first, this place is clean top to bottom, based on my restaurant mgmt background the A rating is for real. The  food is amazing, the sauces and the salsas are obviously family recipes (unlike your standard taco shops) The staff is friendly and helpful.  This place is a step above your everyday Taco Shop, and the prices vs quality is unequalled in this part of town. This place is the real deal, and I've eaten my share of Mexican food! Don't even hesitate, just go!
