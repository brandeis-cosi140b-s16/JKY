Cinco Estrellas?? That does not do this place justice. This jawn is Heisenberg level Mexican cuisine, at a Los pollos hermanos price point.

Every time I have eaten at maize, the food has been consistently fresh & consistently delicious. The proportions are generous, with no corners cut that I can tell ( except lettuce at the bottom of the guacamole to make it appear as a larger quantity, but that's common practice everywhere)

The only thing this place needs to do is obtain a bigger space or open another location.. It kinda cramps my style
