Just an incredible combination of mexican and asian food and flavors. I'll admit I really wasn't sure if I was gonna like it. But I'm so glad I tried it.

If it's you're first time, tell 'em and they'll give you several samples and explain the menu.  I loved the black beans with just a little spice.  Then I had ginger chicken and the jerk chicken.  Oh so good.  The chicken was moist and not fatty.  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were just fantastic.

Yes the inside is a bit rough, but not dirty.  Clearly people come for the food and friendly service.  I'd have been perfectly content sitting any where as long as I got to eat the food.

Then to top it off you get a free snickerdoodle cookie...yum. I left completely stuffed, but didn't regret a single bite. In fact I want to go back again to try more tomorrow before I fly out.
