I've eaten at many Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas, and the world for that matter!  Lindo Michoacan is on of the best in Las Vegas.  (Olamendi's in SoCal is the best in the world, just sayin...)  If you enjoy spicy, hot salsa, ask for their "Habanero Salso" when they bring the chips.  It's good AND hot!  Great fajitas, crunchy tacos, and GREAT MOLE!  Can't say anything bad (except the music is a bit loud in the main room.)  Enjoy!
