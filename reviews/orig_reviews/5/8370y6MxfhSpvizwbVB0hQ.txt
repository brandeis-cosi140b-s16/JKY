This place has the best Mexican food I have ever had.  It's really like home cooking.  I don't think they even own a microwave or a freezer, because everything tastes really fresh and flavorful.  The free chips and salsa is perfect, fresh made chips and just the right heat on the salsa.  I always get a salad with the house dressing, which is like a creamy vinaigrette. Yum.  I try to get something different every time and it's all very good.  Have never had a bad experience here.  The only "bad" thing is that the potions are big and you don't want to stop eating because it's so good and before you know it you've eaten too much and want to sleep the rest of the day away.

If you like fresh and healthy mexican food, you MUST go here!
