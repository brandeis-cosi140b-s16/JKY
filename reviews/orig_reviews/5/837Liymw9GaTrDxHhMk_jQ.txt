This is a family favorite, and my 5 stars represents that as such.

If you are looking for an old-school Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, with a good assortment of foods on the menu, this is the place.   You will get the good old fashioned, better not be on a diet, combo plates, fried goodies with cheese,  and likely leave with a to-go box.  You will certainly be able to find lighter fare, but we go for that margarita, cheese crisp, and whatever else is looking good that day.

The chips and salsa are amazing.  

Incredible happy hour specials- 1/2 price on most appetizers in the bar.  And the bar is very relaxed, sports on TV's, etc.

Food is very reliable, service is familiar, friendly and efficient.  

Frequently a wait on Friday nights, so plan your time accordingly.
