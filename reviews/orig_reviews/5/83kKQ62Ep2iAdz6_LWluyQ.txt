There are some pros and some cons, although the cons really aren't that bad at all. My dish was excellent, I had the pork belly ramen and would definitely recommend it. Friend #1 had the Chinese Chicken Salad and said it was pretty bland (but he did say he'd come back and try something else). Friend #2 had the spicy crab roll and the salmon avocado roll, he said the were excellent. Odd thing, they'll only give you one free refill on your beverage, incredibly strange. I don't remember the last time I went somewhere and they charged you for refills.....especially because this is a moderately priced establishment, I don't think they'll be losing any money if they offered free refills....come on, this is 2014 after all. One last thing, our waiter. He was kind, prompt, and very helpful.....he just had an issue finding the door to the patio....let's just say the window won that battle! I will say, they were quick to clear his face print off of it though!
