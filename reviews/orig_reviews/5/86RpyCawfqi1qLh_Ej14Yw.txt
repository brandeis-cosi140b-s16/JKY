Incredible food and service. We had a young man named Jared, who was one of the best waiters I've ever encountered. The house margarita rocks big time. It was happy hour, and ALL appetizers were half-priced. We had 5 appetizers, and all were fantastic. Can't wait to return for entrees someday. Thanks, Jared, great job!
