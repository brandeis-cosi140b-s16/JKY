My friends and I went here for the first time on Friday. All six of us loved it and already can't wait to go back. We started off with drinks and the guacamole. I had the spicy cucumber margarita for my first drink and spicy passion fruit margarita as my second. Both were equally delicious. The guacamole was so good that we actually ordered a second one. I had the scallop taco special and it was amazing. They should make it a staple on their regular menu. The service was great and so was the atmosphere. My only complaint is that it was really dark in there. Can't wait for my next trip there so I can try more things on the menu.
