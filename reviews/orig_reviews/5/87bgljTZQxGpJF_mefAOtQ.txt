I was really surprised to read the bad reviews on this place. I love Mexican food and this place blew my mind! So much so that I ended up going back for dinner 2 days later. They have a huge selection of amazing dishes. Its rare that just reading the menu items description has me salivating. Both times I got the super delicious Steak Ranchero (I think its called) I was highly impressed. Its a new york steak sitting in red and green sauce smothered in cheese. I cant begin to explain how amazing it tastes. 

Great view of the city and very authentic Mexican feel. The staff are so on top of things it makes you disappointed with almost any other staff at other restaurants. I'm a busy guy and its rare I can take my mind off from work even while out eating but each time I'm there I get lost in the atmosphere & food. The live mariachi band was the tip of the iceberg for me. This is one of my new favorite places to eat.

One last thing. This place seems a little expensive at 1st but when you walk out you will feel fully satisfied with your experience. They also have cheaper items in the back of the menu (maybe that's what all these complaints came from) but I recommend going with one of their signature dishes.
