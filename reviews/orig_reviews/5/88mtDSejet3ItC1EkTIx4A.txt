First, off I don't understand the negative reviews this place gets.  I loved it for lunch!  

We sat outside on the patio and it was nice to watch folks at the pool and enjoying the scene of the great beach and pool area Mandalay Bay has.

Food wise I really liked it.  I'll be first to say I have no clue what real Mexican food is so I can't say if this even comes close.  However, walking into it I knew it would be different than the Mexican we have in Atlanta.

We started out with Queso Fundido and it was good.  Very much different than the Queso i'm use to.  But, good none the less.  Also, got Pomegranate Halibut Ceviche.  OK this was to die for.  I loved the flavor the Ceviche had.  As for Lunch I had Steak Nachos and they were very good and filling.  Again everything was very different than I'm use to but, very good if you know this ahead of going.

We got Ceviche, Queso, 2 Nachos, Cochinita Pibil, Chicken Adobo Quesadilla, and a few drinks we split the tab and each of us paid $37.63 with tip included.
