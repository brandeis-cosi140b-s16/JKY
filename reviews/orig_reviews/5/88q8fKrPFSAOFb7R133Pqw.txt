I was in Az visiting from CA and I found the New Mexico Grill on yelp and thought I would give it a try. My family is from New Mexico so I love to cook and eat the traditional cuisine which is difficult to find in California restauranst. Plenty of Mexican Food places but there is a big difference between the two which I think people often dont know. The fried bread was perfect and the green and red chili tasty A great find!
