Wow... Freakin wow... These are hands down THE best tacos I've ever had. 

They have this huge rack of meat cooking and when they scrape off pieces for your taco I could see all the juices ooze out of it in slow motion! It was soo beautiful, gracefull, even magical... The way the natural juices glimmered and sparkled from the ceiling lights. It was love at first sight, I had dreams about that for nights to come.

The tacos are best enjoyed with some lime and salsa (green and red) with some of the thicker guacamole they have. Be warned that it will get messy as the tacos deliciousness will drip all over the place.

Honestly I would return to Vegas just for these tacos alone! Trick the nightclubs, the shows, the strip clubs, it's all about these tacos right here...
