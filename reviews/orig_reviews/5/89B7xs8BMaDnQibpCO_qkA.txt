Best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Although I'm biased towards these little "hole in the wall" type eateries, you really can't beat the taste or the price of Las Palmas. Up until a few weeks ago, I thought Reyna's in the Strip District was the best. But I gotta say, there's something about the corn tortillas that makes the taco taste so good. Like others have mentioned, it's just a little food stand run by nice people in front of a mexican grocery store. You can get pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, and chorizo followed by some toppings of your choice. I like onion, cilantro, guac, and one of their hot sauces. Ain't nothing fancy, but go for a taco and a jarritos soda, you won't be disappointed :)
