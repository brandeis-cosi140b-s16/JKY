This is the venue downtown phoenix has been waiting for! Go for a show, or just to chill in the lounge and down a cocktail or two! The food is also spot on, and the service is as good as it gets! The owners went all out on the sound system and the acoustics in the main room and in the lounge... this place was built for MUSIC! 

PS. Try the Honey Badger!
