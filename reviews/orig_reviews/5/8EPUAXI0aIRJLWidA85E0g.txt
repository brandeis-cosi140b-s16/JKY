Isla is quite a find.  If you're in Vegas, Isla is a must!  Fabulous margarita's. Service is attentive and friendly. I've eaten there several times, and can't wait to go back!  The sampler appetizer is excellent, hearty, and a great variety. The Chicken Mole Poblano is beyond belief. By far, the best mole I've every had.  I'll go swimming in the Chipotle sauce, any day.  Every single item on the menu is delicious.
