My favorite restaurant in LV. I am a regular at this place. Chef Paco is always so nice. If he is not in the kitchen, he is greeting his customers and making sure everything is good. They have different events/specials, it's never a boring night at El Dorado Cantina. Thanks Chef Paco and all the El Dorado Cantina staff.
