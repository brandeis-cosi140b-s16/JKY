My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on stacked enchiladas, sopaipillas and posole. When I heard Chile Addiction had opened in the southwest side of town, I was so excited to give them a try. 

I was thoroughly impressed by the food and the service. So impressed, that we ended up coming back not once, but two more times.

I have tried the stacked enchiladas with pork verde, posole, stuffed enchiladas with pork verde, chile adovado, huevos rancheros, sopaipillas, tamales, breakfast burrito, churros and fried ice cream. Every single thing I have tried has been great and definitely has that nostalgia factor going for it.

The service here is beyond wonderful. The servers and owners are so friendly and welcoming and make sure refills are plentiful. They've even offered us free dessert as an apology for our food taking too long. The funny thing is we didn't even notice a delay, but they insisted that we order dessert on them.

I plan on making this a regular spot and I hope others take the time to experience this regional cuisine that holds a special place in my heart. Just skip the desserts as they are not good.
