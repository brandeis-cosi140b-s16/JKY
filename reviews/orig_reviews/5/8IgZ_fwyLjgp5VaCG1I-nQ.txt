Oddly enough, I'd never been to a Cabo Wabo before just recently. I honestly don't know why, because the food was delicious and the atmosphere was lively.

The wait staff was extremely helpful and exuberant. Our waitress was attentive and kind, even when we had to wait on a late member of our party. She continually checked if we needed anything and gave us great recommendations for the food. We were really pleased with the service, especially since it was a packed restaurant on the Vegas strip.

I ordered the "Three Way" (I know, it sounds terrible) as my beverage of choice. It was one of those icy, mixed cocktails from the slurpee-looking machines in the front of the establishment. And let me tell you, it was far from terrible. In fact, if the alcohol didn't pack such a punch, I might have ordered two. The drink is a mixture of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry flavoring. It was light, fruity, and very refreshing on a Vegas summer night. 

For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Combo, which includes rice and beans. And if you just look at the picture I've supplied, you can already tell that it was amazing. I loved the verde sauce on top of the enchiladas themselves. The chicken was succulent and full of flavor. The rice had a good amount of spice and the beans were fresh. The cheese was also yummy; thoroughly melted and mixed. 

We also had several servings of chips and salsa before our meal. The fact that we kept asking for another heaping has more to do with the fact that the chips and salsa were both crisp and fresh, rather than because we were starving. 

Finally, the food is heavy. In other words, be prepared to pack a to-go box. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Cabo Wabo. And I look forward to my next visit.

Happy feasting!
