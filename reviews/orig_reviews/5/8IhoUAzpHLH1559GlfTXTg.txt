We randomly picked out a place for lunch while headed north for a raft trip, and holy guacamole!  This is one hell of a spot! 

The atmosphere is 1960's meets open air Mexican cantina. Whoever designed this joint needs a medal.  It's funky, clean, and makes one want to consume the delicious drinks that are both affordable and aesthetically pleasing.

The food was great. Get the guacamole. It's worth it. We had a group of 8, all different tastes, and there was not a single plate that wasn't delicious looking. 

Great service. Well worth getting off the beaten path, but don't take my word for it. Try it out for yourself.
