Hands down best taco joint I have ever been to in the United States... EVER!  This place is near the Wynn, I just wondered in here after a night of partying and wow!  They have every amenity that they have at taco spots in Mexico... Without people getting kidnapped... I found my new after party spot in Vegas! I definitely recommend this to the discriminating taco aficionado.
