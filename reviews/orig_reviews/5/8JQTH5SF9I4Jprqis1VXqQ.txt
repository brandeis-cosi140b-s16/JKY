Damn - I don't throw five stars around often but how fun is good food at a good price with a cool vibe restaurant?  Mexican meets local markets with your taste buds being the winner.  If I lived here I would frequent this place on a regular basis.  Phoenix you are lucky with this one - its a keeper.
