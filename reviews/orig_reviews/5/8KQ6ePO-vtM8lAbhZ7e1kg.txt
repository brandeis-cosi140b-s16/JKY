When it comes to Mexican street tacos, the first places that come to my mind are Taco's Mexico, late nights in TJ and the best hang over food ever. However, no more.... well at least not Tacos Mexico. Anyway, lets just get to the good stuff. 

Tacos el Gordo is amazing place. Hands down the best street taco's ever. Being that they are orginally from Tijuana, they are already off to a good start. Personally I am a huge fan of their carne asada and ablongida (sp.?) tacos. They also have more exotic delights as cabeza (head) lengua (tounge) and a few other goodies I have yet to try. Plus, their cane asada fries are nothing short of amazing in my mind. 

And on top of all that great food, you can wash it down with unlimited refills of Orange Bang! Or Pina or horchata if that floats your boat as well. 

Buenos timepos!
