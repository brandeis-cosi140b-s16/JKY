I dined at Canyon Cafe while I was on a business trip there last week.  The atmosphere was layback and pleasant.  I had the Naked Chile Relleno which was amazing and different from the typical breaded one.  The mango margaritas were amazing as well.

What really amazed me is the staff service all around.  The bartender was attentive. I inadvertently left my iPhone by the bar and didn't realize it was missing until an hour after I left the cafe.  I called the cafe and sure enough they found an iPhone which I went back for it and once there the manager verified that I was the rightful owner and got my iPhone back.  Today I needed a copy of my receipt for my business expenses, which I forgot to take with me, and I called for it. The staff person who answered and general manager located the receipt and e-mailed me a copy of it.  Again, I cannot be any more happier with the customer service all around.  Pleasant experience!
