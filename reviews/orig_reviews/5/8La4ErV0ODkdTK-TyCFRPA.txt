Fast, Fresh, Tasty, Abundant portions, Clean and Friendly, excellent value!  Where else could I have gotten change from a $10 bill and eaten 6 fish tacos and 2 fountain drinks?  The fish was very tasty and their salsa bar over flowed with home made goodness.  Help yourself to chopped cabbage, cole slaw, assorted peppers, pico di gallo, ranch dressing, avocado dressing, chipotle mayo, tartar sauce, and many bottles of hot sauce.  A great addition to the neighborhood Elliot/Priest.
