I came in here i think i was last Monday and god are these employees a pare of happy campers! The guy that makes the burritos sort of rolled his eyes a bit on me but happy overall, the other tall young man who says his name is George i think or Jorge if that's how you spell it in English was as friendly as he could be! It was almost as if he was reading my mind when i needed something he was there! He introduced himself and even told me a bit about what was the best item on their menu and i'm loving it! The food was top class, top notch, #1 you name it! But definitely going back there just to be treated right by that young man Jorge hes REALLY nice and his service is PERFECT! It be a +4 from me if Jorge wasn't there to provide his service so +5!
