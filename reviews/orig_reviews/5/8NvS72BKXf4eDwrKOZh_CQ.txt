Leticia's does it again. Delicious, authentic Mexican cuisine and great customer service.

Their carnitas burrito is my favorite...enchilada style of course. With a side of guacamole to go with my chips and salsa, it's always a great combination.

You can't go wrong with Leticia's. Everything on the menu is a winner and you won't be disappointed.
