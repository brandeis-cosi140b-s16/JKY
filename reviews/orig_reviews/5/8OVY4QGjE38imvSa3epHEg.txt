Went here for the first time because I missed out on eating a sushi burrito at foodie fest this passed weekend. Ordered the long beach & redondo, & my boyfriend & I split so we got to taste both. It was busy, went around 6pm, but it was bomb af! Honestly worth it & it was cheaper than foodie fest prices. Definitely a place to go back too.
