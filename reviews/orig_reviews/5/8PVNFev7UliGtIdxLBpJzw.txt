HANDS DOWN! BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER! I did go to Chandler High, that was my first of many encounters with Elmer and his yummy food. I usually go about once or twice a month but have been known to hit it up weekly in the past. I've even turned the fam onto it, my kids usually get the bean and cheese burritos... ( I have to say, I am not a fan of bean and cheese burritos, but this place adds their salsa in them. One word. AMAZING!) I always get the cheese enchilada's and the strips. Ah the strips. Even if it is only chips and shredded cheese, the salsa makes it! I think you can even buy their salsa. They have always have specials, and my husband loves theier taco specials. Their bright building helps attract passerbys but if ur not looking u prob wont c it... I love how it's family owned and operated too. Just try it, U wont be sorry.
