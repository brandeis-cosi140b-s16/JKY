I've been in Vegas for 5 years and I've never found a Mexican restaurant I've loved until I came here this afternoon!!! The strawberry margarita is amazing!!! But the food takes the win!  Chef Paco has such amazing menu, we ordered the fresh - table side - guacamole,  AL pastor tacos,  Carne asada platter and pineapple shrimp... dessert is on its way!! I will definitely be back !!!
