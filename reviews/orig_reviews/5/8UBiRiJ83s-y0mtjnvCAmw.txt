Well, it is what it is.  If you want those little tacos with sizzling meat slabbed on as it's grilling, topped with veggies, pico de gallo, and other sauces all in about 10 seconds flat, tasting all delish with proper grilled taste, this is the place to go.  It's a close facsimile of El Taorina, except I think it's better.  

Line doesn't move terribly fast but once you get up to order it goes quickly.  Then you line up at the pay line and that can take a bit also, but all in all not a bad wait overall.  I guess it all depends on when you go, and if there are 15-20 people in line I can see it taking a bit of time before you sit down to eat.  As it was for us, there were only couple of tables open as we were cashing out but we only spent total of less than 10 minutes through the entire process.  That's pretty good for that level of busy-ness, I think.

The Asada and Adobada were both very good, but the the spicy adobada took the cake.  Outstanding stuff.  $2 each, thinking 3 will be enough for most, maybe 4, so not a bad price for lunch and definite bargain for dinner.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Well, it is a fast-food type of place so it's certainly fine, but you'll have a hard time feeling good about taking a whole table all by yourself with all those people waiting...  Take it to go.
