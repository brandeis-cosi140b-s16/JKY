Today we decided to have Mexican food for lunch.  We have been here before, but I have never reviewed this restaurant.

We started out with the chips and salsa along with bean dip.  I could actually make a meal out of these alone, but I paced myself.  Unlike my last review I was able to get my favorite Raspberry Iced Tea, and it was delicious.

Mom had a Chicken Chimichanga, our daughter had a Steak Burrito, and I ordered a Chopped Beef Burrito.  All of them came with the usual rice and beans.  We ordered a side of Guacamole and to our surprise, our server Lorenzo brought out all of the ingredients including the fresh avocados and began to prepare it right there at our table.  He seasoned it just to our liking and wow, delicious.

Mom and I spooned the fresh guacamole on our burritos, mmm, a nice added spice to an already delicious burrito.

Lorenzo was a great server, very attentive to our needs, and of course, our drinks never went dry.

Overall, Bonito Michoacan is an excellent restaurant and we will certainly be back.
