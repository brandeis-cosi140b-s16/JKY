Love the sandbar!! Ordering their complimentary chips and salsa is a MUST. The green salsa is so good, I crave it all the time. They have an awesome Taco Tuesday -- $2 for each taco (and the tacos are delicious) and $2 Dos Equis lager and Amber. 
This is my favorite place to go for lunch on Tuesdays. It's also a bar on the weekends, but that's not really my cup of tea.
