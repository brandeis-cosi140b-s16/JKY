At here about three weeks ago on a Wednesday night, visiting from out of town on business, our decision based on Yelp ratings. We walked in just before 7:30 PM and were the only two in the place. The woman at the counter answered some questions we had and took our orders. We both had the carne asada tacos and the chicken tortilla soup. As we were eating, the woman who owns the place came over to see how our food was and we got to chatting, telling her how much we liked the food. She then started telling us about how she makes everything fresh daily and that these were her own family recipes. It was obvious that she puts a lot of love and pride into her food. When we commented that we were surprised that no one else was there, she told us she normally closes at 7:30, but stayed open just for us!

Even though they are known for the carne asada, DO NOT miss the tortilla soup. It is by far the best I ever had.
