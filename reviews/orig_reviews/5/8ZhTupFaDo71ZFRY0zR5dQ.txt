I came down from Oregon for the UO vs. ASU football game and told my brother we had to stop in.  This place did not disappoint us.  The beans and rice looked bland, but they were not.  I had a fish taco, delish. My brother had the chicken fajfitas, loved them.  I can.t to come back down for Thansgiving and bring my husband to enjoy. Go Ducks!!
