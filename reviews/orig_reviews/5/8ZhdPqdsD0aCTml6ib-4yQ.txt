We came here after watching a play at the Hale theater. First we started off with margaritas and I ordered the Blood Orange....omg it was tasty. They don't short you on the tequila either. I ordered the standard taco, carne adobada and the shrimp tacos. I have to say they were all amazing but my favorite was the carne adobada! I would definitely return. Very nice outdoor seating too!
