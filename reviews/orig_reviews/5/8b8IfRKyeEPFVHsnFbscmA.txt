Awesome food at a reasonable price. My wife and I are in love with their chicken tortilla soup! It is always made fresh with fresh avocados cut on top.  The small tacos are also very fresh and non greasy.  They are trying to get a license to have margaritas and beer but they are still waiting for that.  Overall a must check out yourself restaurant!
