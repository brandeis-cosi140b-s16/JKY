I travel to Phoenix for business a couple times a year, and all you need to know about this place is I make a point to eat dinner there at least once during every trip.  Love this place, as well as their other restaurants Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's.  If you live in Phoenix and never tried this place, do yourself a favor and check it out - you won't be disappointed.   Go during happy hour and save yourself a couple bucks.
