My mom suggested this place after church on Sunday. She said it was like Chipotle but WAAAAAAYYYY better. Seeing how I wasn't a fan of that style of restaurant I was hesitant to go...but hey...it was free (mom was buying) and it didn't break my no eating out challenge (again...mom was buying). 

We roll in...monkeys in tow...and notice how festive and colorful this place was. Very nice for kids. I ordered one of each of the special tacos (mahi-mahi and spicy crispy shrimp), rice and beans, and a drink. We also shared the chips and queso. Holy cow! The tacos had fresh made tortillas, creamy tomatillo dressing (think tomatillo ranch), huge pieces of cilantro and generous portions of meat. The drink bar was amazing. Not only did they have Diet Dr. Pepper and orange soda (my favorite)....they have fresh mint limeade! It was so freaking tasty. My kids had 2 cups each (and lots of potty trips after). 

I pounded down my food like it was my last meal (super lady like). It was like Heaven and I now am a fan of the designer burrito concept again. Thank you Cafe Rio. 

PS: Don't tell them its your first time eating there...they will break out into song.
