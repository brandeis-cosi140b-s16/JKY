Finally a restaurant that actually serves New Mexican food that tastes like New Mexican food. The red chile "looks" the way good red chile should look, dark red. Not bright red like california red chile.  The enchiladas and the green chile pork burro were awesome. Although it's 30 miles from my house it's well worth the trip and I'll be back-soon! Thanks 'Don S.' For the review that brought me here.
