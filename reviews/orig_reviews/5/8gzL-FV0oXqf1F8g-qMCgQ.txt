Went here with family and had a great time!! We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day but were told that the time we wanted wasn't available to so we took the risk and walked in with a party of 6 on a Friday night at 7:30. And to our surprise we were able walk in and get a table! Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable. ALL of the food was fantastic and super authentic! They have a great patio area that would be great to check out when the weather is right! 

Would definitely go back again!!!
