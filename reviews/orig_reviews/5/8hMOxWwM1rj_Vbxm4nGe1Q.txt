Hussongs was a very welcome surprise for us.  We were walking to Mandalay from the Luxor.   Since I had been to Ensenada numerous times to the original Hussongs,  I talked my wife into stopping off for a  quick margarita.   We found the mariachis,  the chips and salsa,  and especially the margaritas to be authentic and great.   We ended up staying for over 4 hours,  joking and laughing with the wait staff.  The only thing missing was the car battery test from the original place in Ensenada.

We ordered tacos,  quesadillas, and  other than being a little too salty, everything was just like Ensenada.  .   the servers all paid attention to us and as to the little I remember,  the drinks were especially strong.    This was one of the highlights of our weekend in Vegas.    Since we don't visit South of the border because of all the crime,  whenever we need an Ensenada fix we will visit Vegas.
