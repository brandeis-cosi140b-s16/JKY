Five stars for the lunch-special margaritas.  Four stars for the food.  Five stars for the service.  This is about as good as gringo-style Mexican food gets in Las Vegas.

Chips are always fresh and tasty as are the salsa and beans.  Personally, I love the crispy tacos at Coyotes, and the chile verde is different--served with potatoes--but still a cut above the chile verde most other places serve.

This is a good place to eat, relax, and have a good time.  The staff at Coyote's make the whole experience very pleasant and memorable.
