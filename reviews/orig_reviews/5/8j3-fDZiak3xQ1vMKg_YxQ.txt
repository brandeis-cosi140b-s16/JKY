Great find for Mexican cuisine, I've eaten here about 5 times so far, each time leaving equally impressed. Mundo definitely has a talented chef. 4 1/2 stars for the cuisine. Carne asada tacos, rib eye steak, Chilean Sea bass, authentic flan, these are a couple dishes not to miss.  You will not find a better a Mexican restaurant in Vegas.
