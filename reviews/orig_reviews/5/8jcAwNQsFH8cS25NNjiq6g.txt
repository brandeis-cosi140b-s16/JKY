I love this place, great tacos and burritos. The carne asada is very tender with just the right amount of seasoning. I don't live in this part of town but will go out of my way just to stop here. If you like bean and cheese burrito's and carne asada tacos look no further, this place has the best ones in town! The owner is a great guy too, very nice and you can tell he loves his business.
