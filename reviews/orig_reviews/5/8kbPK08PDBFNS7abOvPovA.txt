The staff was very helpful in letting us taste the different meats prior to ordering. We got the 5 street tacos with mostly spicy chicken pork and beef. For the money, it's hard to beat and that was all it took to get full. The interior decoration is worth the trip, especially if you like Mexican professional wrestling ( or Jack Black's Nacho Libre).
