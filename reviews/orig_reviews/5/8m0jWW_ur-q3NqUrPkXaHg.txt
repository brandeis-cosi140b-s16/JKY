This is only my 2nd review ever but I have to write about Taco's El Gordo. With the exception of going to TJ (I go to TJ at least 4 times a year) these are the best Taco's I have ever tasted and I go to a lot of Taco joints. Going to Vegas means going to Taco's El Gordo. What you need to get out of all the posts are that the Adobada sometimes also called Al Pastor (Pork - Not spicy at all even though they say it is) is perfection in a corn tortilla. Let me be clear I am not a fan of pork and I don't make a habit of eating it but the things this place does..... when it hits the lips. What makes this epic is the Guacamole Sauce that they put in it. Everyone I take has always loved it. For those daring enough to handle the wait you will always agree.... worth the wait. Oh and can't miss my shout out for the Asada Fries, think Nachos but with fries instead of tortilla chips.
