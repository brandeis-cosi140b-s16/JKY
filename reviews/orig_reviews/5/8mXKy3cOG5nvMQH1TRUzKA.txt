My girlfriend and I wanted a cheap, family style Mexican dinner off strip, without breaking the bank. Casa Don Juan delivered it!   If you don't get the carnitas platter, you're crazy!  Tender, succulent braised pork with delicious homemade tortillas, pico, roasted jalapenos, and fresh guac.  Every bite was heaven.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat this every week.  The margs were great--healthy mix of fresh juice, mix and tequila.  They went down easy and were reasonably priced.  In Vegas that's under 10 bucks!  

We went back for breakfast.  And I'd give them 4 stars for it.  Potato burrito was tasty and she had potato tacos with eggs.  Taters a little under done.  Would like it spicier next time.
