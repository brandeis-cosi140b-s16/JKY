I love the food at LuLu's and have never been disappointed.  Their tostadas are SO FRESH and the taste is so clean.  I crave them!  The place is just a little hole in the wall local place, but the food is great and the quality is excellent.  We found them by eating at Flancer's across the parking lot, where we also go often for their sandwiches.
Love LuLu's tostadas and beans and rice!  Way better than Filiberto's!
