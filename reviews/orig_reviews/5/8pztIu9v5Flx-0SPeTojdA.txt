i just made my way back from Vegas and like the blackjack table and the pool, i had to make my way to tacos el gordo.  still the best tacos i've ever had and not very far from the strip (a block past Encore).  This place is simply a must try for anyone who even remotely likes tacos or authentic Mexican food.
