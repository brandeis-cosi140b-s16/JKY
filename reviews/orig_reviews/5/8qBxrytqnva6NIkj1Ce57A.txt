I love this place. The food is to die for, the atmosphere is perfect and the drinks are awesome. The patio is so relaxing and the service has always been fun and friendly. We had their flatbread with beef al pastor that was really favorable. Their PB and J seems to be really popular (not your regular PB and J, by the way) but I have yet to try it. Overall, Milagro is one of my favorite places in Arcadia.
