Excellent food & people!!  Can't say enough good things - our favorite!

I always eat waaay too much in spite of my best intentions!  Bowl of chips after ordering, then to salsa bar for your choice of 'heat' & texture.  Over to beverages; take your pick.  Find a booth or a table, enjoy chips/salsa.  Staff brings food - eat!!  I suggest you leave room for one of their great desserts - my favorite is the cream cheese filled dessert chimmies drizzled with honey -- see what I mean?  Did I mention that it is easy on your pocketbook...and outdoor seating available if desired.

Others must also like them - rumor is that they have acquired more space and will expand soon!
