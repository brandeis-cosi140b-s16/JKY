Hussongs was a very welcome surprise for us.   Since I had been to Ensenada numerous times to the original Hussongs,  I talked my wife into stopping off for a  quick margarita.   We found the mariachis,  the chips and salsa,  and especially the margaritas to be authentic and great.   We ended up staying for over 4 hours,  joking and laughing with the wait staff.  The only thing missing was the car battery test from the original place in Ensenada.

We ordered tacos,  quesadillas, and  other than being a little too salty, everything was just like Ensenada.  .   the servers all paid attention to us  ,  the drinks were especially strong.  Whenever we need an Ensenada fix we will visit Vegas.
