It's my aunt Gloria's kitchen right at the edge of a legendary city! Sure, it's quite a trek for people visiting but if rented a car you should DEFINITELY make the trip over the Leticia's.

First of all, the ambiance reminds me of my mothers homeland- MEXICO. The decor consists of pottery and brightly colored paintings along with cheerful tunes. I sense a familiar sound; it's mariachi music- a sound I can only tolerate with a full cultural experience (not one I experience on the radio or anywhere else lol)
At last- I am surrounded by a blanket of my mothers culture. Now I am ready for some authentic Mexican food!!! AYYYY YA YAYYY! (I am allowed to do this- It's in my blood)
 
I love practicing my first language here- makes me feel cool. I ALWAYS order a delicious margarita- done just as my uncle Jesse would make them. 
FOOD- ODM (means OMG in spanish- Oh, Dios Mio!) I will only let you experience this yourself...but I have a few key points here that could probably illustrate how much this place seduces me to take another step deeper into the nostalgia it inspires when I pass through the doors...

1. I am gluten INTOLERANT- This does not stop me from having ALL of the wheat based foods. NOW, don't be disheartened ,oh fellow GF kin- there ARE options and they are drooliscious!!
2. Honestly, I think that number 1 fully encompasses my thoughts on the contents of this place....
3. I asked for EXTRA salsa TO GO!!! You know, the salsa that comes with the chips and salsa at most Mexican restaurants?? YEAH....I went HAM on that salsa.
4. They didn't charge me for it like other places would...super thumbs up. 
5. It's family owned to the point where the owner HERself comes out to greet the customers and even cooks some of the food alongside her chefs- GIRL POWER!!
