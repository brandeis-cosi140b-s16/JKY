This was not the best restaurant I have ever been to.. The food was mediocre at best. However, the service was PHENOMENAL it made up entirely for the food because my experience was so great. Our server, I believe his name was Jordan, was very attentive and had great energy. I truly enjoyed talking to him. In addition to being a blast to talk to, he was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful. Thank you for a great night Chayo and Jordan
