This is the 2nd time i have been here. Once for dinner and this time for lunch.
It is absolutely fantastic!!   I have lived by this restaurant for  14 years and just recently discovered it.   
Wow,  , Delicious,  tasty and incredibly good.   Even the chips and Salsa are so good.  They brew Coffee for me, which is my most favorite beverage with Mexican Food.    Coffee really enhances the flavor of the spices.
I absolutely love this fabulous place. It is spotlessly clean as well and smells really good inside.    Lots of parking in the back of the building. Bathrooms are very clean. Nice and cool inside even though it was 112 degrees outside, yes and it is not even Summer yet.
