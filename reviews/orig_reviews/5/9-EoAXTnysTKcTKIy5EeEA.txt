Mexicans in town like to complain that Los Tacos is not authentic, they don't make their own tortillas etc, and maybe they're right...but the food is really good nonetheless. I have not found a better carnitas taco. I get it with everything and it's great. In fact everything I've sampled has been excellent. Somebody else posted that they didn't like beans on their taco...then don't order it with beans! Duh!! Opinions vary widely when it comes to tacos but you should definitely give this place a try and make up your own mind.
