Great food.  And our server Arturo was awesome. And even the busser was quick and had a conversation with is.  Really liked that the owner himself came by to ask how everything was and to thank us for coming in and to chit chat for a minute. Being in the restaurant industry myself I hold high expectations and this place did. Great job guys. Keep up the good work and great tasting food.
