This might be my favorite place in all of Arizona to eat !!!
My favorite are the grilled fish tacos and shrimp tacos. They have an Americanized spin to them but they are sooooo good !
Every time I have guests in from out of town we bring them here. I also love the decor, it's such a happy place :)

Prices are great too !
