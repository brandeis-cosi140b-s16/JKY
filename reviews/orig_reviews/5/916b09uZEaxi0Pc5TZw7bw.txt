Awesome! I went in for the first time and my server was very attentive. I asked her what her favorite appetizer was and she said the calamari so I ordered it, as I was already contemplating getting it. I absolutely loved it, I'm a huge calamari fan and can I just say it's hard to find good calamari. So glad I checked this place out, the atmosphere was great and the service was on point. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu.
