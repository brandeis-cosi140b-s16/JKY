The tortas are amazing!!! It's not all bread like I have had at other places. The bread is thin and perfectly soft yet slightly crunchy.We also tried the chili verde and it was very good. They give you three small cups of salsa to try out; a green one, a smokey one, and a regular pico type one- they were all packed with flavor! Prices are very reasonable too. Best taco shop I have had in Vegas.
