Blancos is a winner!

Tacos & Tequila - does it get any better?  Very nice decor, patio and indoor seating, super nice hostesses, bar service while you wait for your table, this is one great place.  Things I thought were great: the energy, the people watching, chips & salsa, $4 draft beers, and my Machaca burrito ($16, albeit pricey) -- but overall a great place!!  I would go back anytime!

2/16/2012: Update...the machaca burrito has been lowered to $13.  Thank you!  Had it again, sooooo good!
