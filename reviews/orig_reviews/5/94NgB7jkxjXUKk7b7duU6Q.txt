Really great Mexican cuisine! The menu has great variety and the pricing is excellent, especially if you're used to heading to Roberto's. My boyfriend and I ate and had a dessert for under $30! The service was excellent; the wait for food was pretty average but there was always a server checking on us and making sure our drinks were full. 

My boyfriend had a beef burrito that was so large, he had plenty to take to work to eat! And he loved it, also said it was even better as leftovers. I ordered the carne asada mixed greens salad; there was a bit too much dressing for my liking the meat was cooked beautifully and I really liked the lime dressing. we had sopapillas for dessert and they were delicious! perfectly flaky and the sauce was very yummy. I really wanted to ask for another order!

we can here on a Thursday night (7:30pm) and there was plenty of seating and no wait, so didn't experience the rush. all in all, we really like the place and plan to come back next time we need a Mexican fix!
