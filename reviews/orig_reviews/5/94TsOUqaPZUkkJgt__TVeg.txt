Great, authentic New Mexican style Mexican food, available with three levels of Hatch chile spice (mild green, hot green, and red chile.)   Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food.  Platters are served with chips and three types of sauces - including a unique creamy white salsa.  Make sure you leave room for the complimentary sopapillas (either cinnamon sugar or plain) for dessert!

The restaurant has an independent, family-owned feel (rare in AZ!), and is a great place to take visitors from out of town that want to try real Southwest style food.
