We chose this place based on other yelp reviews! We were not disappointed! Our food was awesome, particularly the chicken and the pork! Our service was awesome, the people behind the counter were very knowledgeable on explaining what the ingredients were and how it worked to build your own enchiladas! I will definetely be back!
