Five star breakfast all the way!! Gallo Blanco is the restaurant housed inside of the Clarendon Hotel (boutique style). 

We met some friends here for breakfast after reading the reviews on Yelp as well as delving into some seriously delicious guacamole the night before. Most of us took our waitresses recommendation on the Chilaquillas and I, personally, was SO glad I did. I think I literally licked my plate clean. Now mind you, it was not your typical soggy, enchilada sauce soaked, casserole of tortilla chips. This was an out-of-the world, new age way of making Chilaquillas. I'm not going to give it away, I will just say you'll never look at the traditional dish the same way again.

The restaurant is quite 70's modern as is the entire them of the Clarendon and the servers and staff of the restaurant are top shelf. Always there when you need them and not there when you don't. Perfect service. If I were in Phoenix again and needed to find a place for breakfast I would certainly go out of my way to get to Gallo Blanco again.

On a side note, we did not get the chance to go in the evening, but they do serve dinner, they do have a full bar and the one night we saw it, the place was packed so I'm sure it's just as good in the evening as it is in the morning.
