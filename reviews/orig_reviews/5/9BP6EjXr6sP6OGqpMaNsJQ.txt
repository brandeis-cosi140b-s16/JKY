The best kept secret and deal in Vegas !!!!! As a frequent visitor to Vegas  and self proclaimed foodie, I have tried every celebrity chef restaurant up and down the strip. This is the jackpot, I do not like mass made food like buffets where food gets overcooked as it sits under heast lamps, here everything is cooked to order and is worth the wait. At 29.99 with an extra $5 for unlimited mimosas, not a better bargain
