The best Mexican restaurant we've been to in Las Vegas! Seriously.

After reading the reviews I was a little bit skeptical of their authenticity. Most of the Yelpers have very few reviews, several have only one, and they're giving 5 star reviews to a new business. Seems a little suspicious, right? Well, they were right on the money and Juan's is super close to our house so we'll definitely be regulars from here on out. Admittedly we were Viva Mercado's fans, especially for the service, but Juan's has better food, in my opinion, and the same great service.

You can judge a Mexican restaurant in the first 5 minutes by how fast they get the chips & salsa on the table and the quality of those. The grub hit our table in no time and the salsa is excellent and they use quality chips, good start! They also brought complimentary bean dip and grilled onions & jalapenos, yummy!

We opted to have the steak fajitas for two and they were indeed flaming! Most restaurants seem to take the lazy approach to marinating their fajitas but that definitely wasn't the case with Juan's. Great flavor, tender and lots of meat coupled with plenty of onions & peppers.

The guacamole that came with our fajitas was fresh, flavorful and we really enjoyed it as well. The flour tortillas were hot, soft and the right size for fajitas as well. The rice and beans were good and the 2 year old devoured the rice so that's a definite plus as well.

My only small complaint was I wish the onions would've been cooked longer but it's a tiny complaint and a personal preference. Next time I'll just request they scorch'em and I'm sure it won't be a problem.

I would highly recommend Juan's if you want great Mexican food and great service.
