I went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago. The service was super fantastic. Nadjanna and Guillermo were my bartendars for the night and they hooked it up nasty. The raspberry margaritas are to die for (but strawberry is my favorite!)  Suffice to say I walked out of their feeling really good. Im actually going back their this weekend and I cant wait to drink! :P
