We traveled to KoMex from the southwest side due to all the great Yelp reviews of this place.  I really love the infamous Kogi taco truck in L.A. and have tried to replicate the Korean fusion tacos at home to no avail.  Once we heard about this place, I knew we had to go immediately.

This mom and pop shop has modest d√©cor, but is still comfortable.  A lot of that has to do with the wonderful service from the owners... I didn't catch her name, but one of the owners was so nice and honest!  Since it was our first visit there, we were going to order too much food - and she told us that it might be too much for us since their portions are big.  I really liked the sincerity - you would never find that anywhere else!

Anyway, we ordered a bunch of the bulgogi tacos and also the Korean style pork with rice.  This was more than enough food for two people.  The tacos were DELICIOUS and dare I say better than the Kogi truck.  The pork was awesome.  Period.  I'd eat that same meal over again anytime!  I also have to mention the complimentary chips and salsa (and guac!) for dine in.  Its tasty and free, can't go wrong!

I mentioned to the owner how much I love Chop Chae (this Korean noodle dish)... and although they didn't have it on their menu, she said that they could special cook it for us if we let her know in advance.  How nice!

Their menu is huge and includes the Korean fusion Mexican, regular Mexican, and Chinese dishes.  Their prices are outstanding... actually unbelievable in my opinion for the quality and taste of the food you get.  I think we ended up paying 12 bucks for the rice dish and 5 tacos.  12 
bucks?!  Nice.

We are definitely going to make this a regular spot.  Looking forward to trying everything on their menu!
