After a five star experience with co-workers, I opted to take the family for a five star adventure of their own. After all the hype about how good my burger was the first time, my son chose a carne asada burrito. It was good, but if you are going to Fat Boy for the first time, I recommend a "Boyger". The burrito was more on the "Americanized" side, but good none the less. The ladies got burgers and were very impressed. 

I kept my word and saved room for a milkshake this time. We got a chocolate and a vanilla and split them four ways. Definitely enough for four people. They were both outstanding. Even the milkshakes here are some of the best I've ever had.

We arrived around brunch time on a Sunday and there was absolutely no waiting. The service was as friendly and efficient as last time. A few customers came in to pick up their phone orders while we were dining. Phone orders would be a great idea during the week, especially if you are under the gun with limited time for lunch.

Two visits and two five-star ratings. I'm a big fan of Fat Boy.
