This place is so awesome! Found the place with no problems with GPS. It's not that far from the outdoor outlet. We greeted by the employee and asked if we needed a menu in English. Yes please! I ordered a strawberry margarita and it was delish. I also ordered the 2 taco combo.. 1 chicken and 1 chorizo. And the empanadas was so good! It had shrimp in it and it had a side of sauce to go with it. The sauce was tart and spicy. also ordered side of guacamole (made fresh when you order) all was very good. The food took a while to get out but it was worth the wait and we munched on some chips and salsa. I didn't finish my food and the guy said they don't do take out and I really thought he was serious. LOL! but he was nice and I was able to take my left overs back to the hotel. I would definitely come back next time and I would recommend anyone to go! Can't wait to try other stuff on the menu.
