I had my dad's birthday here. The staff was above and beyond accommodating. They allowed all 20 of us to sit and drink a while before ordering. They let us bring balloons and decorations. They split our check into small parties. I cannot say enough how much I appreciate their customer service. To top it all off, they sang happy birthday and gave my dad a 60th birthday shot! Great food, great service, great atmosphere...GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!
