I had not realized that I have not reviewed Tacos El Gordo. I've been to both locations, and I must say that I prefer this one. There aren't any drunken tourists. Although if you have been out on the Strip and are craving some delicious tacos, it is centrally located. Bonus, the prices are the same.

I only come here for one thing, the tacos al pastor. Everything else, except the tacos de asada are good, but for me it's al pastor all the way. I can eat five of them without any problems, they are so good. I have friends from Tijuana that say that these taste exactly the same as El Gordo in TJ. Get some cebollitas and chiles asados to go along with your order. Drizzle a little lime juice over them, and you have yourself a full feel for under 10 bucks. I've read some reviews that say this area is shady at night, hardly. You'll be ok. 

Nuff said, for an authentic taste of al pastor tacos, check out El Gordo.
