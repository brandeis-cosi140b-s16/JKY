There are few places I love to go to more than twice a month.  Sandbar is the best, I love the service and the food is quick and delicious.  I suggest getting their guacamole. Also, the baja tacos have this delicious sauce.  It is AMAZE BALLS!

Drink wise - their cadillac margerita is strong and delicious.  For dinner and drinks its great, especially taco tuesday ($2 tacos)! 

At night it comes alive and is always a good time.  The bartends pour heavy and they are really quick with how few there are and how many people are always there!

I have never had a bad night or meal at Sandbar!
