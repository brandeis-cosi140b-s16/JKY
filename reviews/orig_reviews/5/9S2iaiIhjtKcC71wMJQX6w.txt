This place is dabomb.com! I always order the al pastor tacos and eat a few bites of my husbands cow tongue tacos. (The cow tongue is extremely tasty, but I can't get rid of the mental barrier enough to eat whole ones). We've tried random taco places and vendors around town, and none of them are as good as this place so we keep returning. My husband lived in Mexico for a few years and even said these are the closest to authentic he's been able to find. You can get flour tortilla's instead of corn if you just ask.
