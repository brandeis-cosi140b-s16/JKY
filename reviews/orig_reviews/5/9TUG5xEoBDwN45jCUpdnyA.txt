Hit the spot perfectly. Been craving tacos the further into the states we got, and these were awesome. Had a gran taco, guac pico de gallo sour cream and soy chorizo. It was fantastic to see vegetarian options offered, and though I typically don't go for soy meat substitutes, this one was authentically tastey. Would wholeheartedly recommend.
