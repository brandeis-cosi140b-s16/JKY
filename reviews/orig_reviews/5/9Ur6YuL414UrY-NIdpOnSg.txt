I would give this place 100 stars if I could. I travel a lot for work and get to eat at some great places, and live in a great food city so a true 5-star review is tough to come by for me. I knew I was in for a treat when I saw the giant Rey Mysterio mural greeting me when we walked in! 

The churros were absolutely to die for, the guacamole was absolutely incredible (coming from someone who actually HATES avocados and guac), and the Filetito torta was beyond good. Everything was cooked perfectly, the staff was great, and the drinks were boozy.  This will be my must eat at place every time I return to Phoenix in the future. Do yourself a favor, and definitely eat at this place!
