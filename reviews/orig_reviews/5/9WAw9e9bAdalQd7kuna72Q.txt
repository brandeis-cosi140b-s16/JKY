My Big Bang Theory.....

Imagine if you will......A food court Food fight.....somewhere among the chaos a Quesidila and rice bowl Collide!....

That's in my imagination how Chinos came to be.....

In this great Hole in the wall place You can mix and match not just Flavors but entire cuisines....

want a Sweet and sour Burrito...sure......Jerk Chicken in your rice bowl.... what ever you want....

Oh as a side note watch for them on Food Network on the Dinners and dives show....

I love getting Emerald and Red Jade Quesidillas...makes me feel a little Healthier...then the Burritos....

The staff is really good at explaining things, Eddie  was extremely helpful.....and Cookies are a great treat....

They have more options then a Crayola box....don't get intimidated
Go in try the samples......feel free to eat out side the lines.....
