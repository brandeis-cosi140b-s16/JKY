This place, is SO BOMB. I have never had Mexican food this good! It's a little confusing to order if it's your first time there because they have separate lines to order from depending if you want to order fries or tacos, toastadas, etc. Basically it's one line for the "main course" stuff - tacos, tostadas, etc. The other line is for fries and side orders (I think). We had the Carne Asada Tacos and the Campechana Fries. They were AMAZING. I am craving them both right meow! Take me back to Vegas for the Mexican food!
