This is by far the best mexican restaurant here in las vegas! I live far from this place but still make the far drive just to have my Carne Asada. mucho bueno! Also order their Horchata it will quence your thirst! The staff are very friendly and the food overall is great! I had my 25th Bday here. I highly recommend this place!
