My favorite Mexican restaurant by far in Vegas. I love how (cliche) the place is decorated inside. The servers are always friendly. Guacamole always made fresh! The Fideo soup prior to your entree always tastes delicious! I love the salsa, beans, and chips they give you to munch on while you wait for your meal. As for the Entrees I always order Enchilada combo or Chicken Fajitas. Always great! And on birthdays it is so much fun! They put a sombrero on you, sing, give you a tequila shot (if you're of age) and dessert. The Churros are a must if you love sweets! They have a live band there and it's a very fun, friendly atmosphere. I always recommend this place and have been going for years :)
