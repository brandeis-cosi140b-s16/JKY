This cantina is located directly on the strip and is super easy to access. It is located around other bars (Double Barrel Roadhouse being directly across from it) making this as a bar hop spot. On the street employees were giving out two-for-one deals on drinks, which in the end only saves you $1.00 on two beers since they cannot give you the happy hour price on the beers too. When I checked in using my yelp app on my phone I was granted yet another two-for-one deal that I was able to gather from the host and hand to the couple next to us since my boyfriend and I already had one each and that is the mx coupons allowed (one per person). 

The beer is the usually imported and drafts--no glass bottles I believe? Also I learned here that there is a new rule in Vegas, that you are no longer allowed to carry glass bottles on the strip--all beer has to be placed inside a plastic cup. I think this new law is great since the first night we got here, my boyfriend and I saw what looked like a drunk or delusional homeless man throwing/chucking glass bottles at cars on the highway. Scary! Anyways... the bartenders here are very nice and super attentive. We had two beers each and shared an order of nachos that were absolutely massive and delicious!
