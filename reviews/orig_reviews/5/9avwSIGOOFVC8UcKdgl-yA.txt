ATTENTION: Jaburritos is not closed, per se. They just did a name change to SOHO SushiBurrito. They're still located in the exact same location, same employees and management team. They claim they are still using the same ingredients and such but I can't comment on that since I haven't tried it for myself. Expect a new review on their SOHO SushiBurrito Yelp review page shortly.





No more waiting for the Foodie Fest to be here so I can get my Jokasaki fix. We now have JABURRITOS here in town!

In a nutshell, it's sushi in burrito form. Please take a moment and take a look at the many pics already posted here. It taste just as good as it looks...if not better.

Our first time here, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We wanted to try everything to our hearts content. You can choose between soy or seaweed paper for your burritos.

I ordered the Rosarito $5.25: spicy tuna, cucumbers, cabbage, tortilla chips, rice and their diablo sauce. Whooo!!!!! Just a word of caution: I LOVEEEEEE anything spicy but that diablo sauce made my lips burn. Yes, it was more of the spicier foods I've eaten in a while.....but it felt sooooo good! ;)

Boyfriend ordered the Rockport $10.95: soft shell crab, spicy tuna, cucumbers, rice, tempura and chipotle mayo. He LOVED IT!!! This seemed like the more popular burrito because while waiting in line, two separate people in front of us AND one in the back of us ordered this.

Then as if that wasn't enough for us, we also ordered the Long Beach: spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, crab, romaine lettuce, cucumber, tortilla strips, guacamole, chipotle mayo, sweet anguilla sauce $10.95. We split that one. This was just as delcious but we rather stick with our first choice.

Only downside is the seating arrangements. Very few chairs and tables. If you come during peak hours, hope you can find a seat. No doubt this place is going to do really well so they need to sort this out somehow...someway.
