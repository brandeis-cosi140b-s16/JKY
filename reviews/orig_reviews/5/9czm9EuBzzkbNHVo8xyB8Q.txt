This our go to spot! The service is so friendly and attentive. The food is awesome, great flavor, large portions which is great for leftovers, favorable margarita selection, and excellent atmosphere. Whether, it's just the hubby and I, or we bring the kids, everyone has an option and leaves happy. We've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a table, which is surprising since it seems they are always busy when we go in. And I love that they take Sunday's off to give their outstanding team time with their families.
