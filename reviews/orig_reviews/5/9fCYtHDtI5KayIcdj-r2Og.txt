Dined at Javier's for a bachelorette dinner with a group of 14 ladies. Our waiter, Angel, was thoughtful enough to send over a shot of tequila and dessert plate for the bride to be along with 2 additional flan dishes for girlfriends that were celebrating their birthdays as well.  

For dinner, I ordered Carne Tampique√±a. It's probably one of the top 5 steaks I've had in my adult life. It was tender, juicy, flavorful and perfectly cooked to medium. The Chicken enchilada and taquito that accompanied the dish were great as well. The house chips and salsa are addicting. I'll definitely dine here again.
