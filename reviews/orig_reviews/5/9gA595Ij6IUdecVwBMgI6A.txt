I love this place!  it's a cultural experience!  I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!

I love the tortilla department!  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!! 

the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!

The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.

I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.

I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.

My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door.
