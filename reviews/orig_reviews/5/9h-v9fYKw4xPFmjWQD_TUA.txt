Expected a lot less upon entering here but looks can be deceiving, it was great! We were seated immediately although the place was packed we got lucky and did not have to wait. Staff was quick and helpful. During the meal(other restaurants should take note) the staff, all of them asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. They kept our drinks (water) full and we never once had to search put our server to get more of anything. I see a few bad reviews here citing bad service and have to think they have never been to any other restaurants in Vegas because this service was the best we have ever had. The food is "old" school Mexican food made with the same recipes handed down for three generations. This place has been here for over 40 years, they are doing something right.
