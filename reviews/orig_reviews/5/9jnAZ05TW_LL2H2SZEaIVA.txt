Wow!!! This place was a treat, I have no complaints service was friendly quick and hospitable. I was surprised when they welcomed us to our table with complimentary soup salsa n bean dip. But what really made this a great experience was the shrimp plate, I have never experienced a taste like that. I'll be back soon!
