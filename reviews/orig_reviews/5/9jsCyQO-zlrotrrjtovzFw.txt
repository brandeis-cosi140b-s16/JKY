Excellent food -- probably the best mexican restaurant in the area. This place is not a tex-mex place and so you won't find greasy refried beans and cheese, and sour cream. 

Their huaraches are amazing and they have this cactus dish (name escapes me) which is also fantastic and quite healthy. They always 4-5 different kinds of salsas which change every time I visit.

On top of that, this place is very cheap.
