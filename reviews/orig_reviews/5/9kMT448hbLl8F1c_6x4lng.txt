Wow. I was in Tempe for 4 days - aside from hitting up the usual faves like In-N-Out since I made the mistake of living in a state that doesn't have one, this was my other highlight.

Space is limited, but going early (i.e. 4:30 pm on a Sat) seemed to beat the rush, we left past 5pm and it still wasn't packed yet, but did hear it fills up quickly.

My only complaint was that I wish I had a bigger stomach to try all the different tacos. The friend that took me said they never has ordered off the first page (Taco Page) because its so good, and now I can see why. 

Tip: Once you get your table, make your way straight to the salsa bar and start filling up your little cups. They'll bring chips to your table ASAP.  Don't waste time sitting there waiting for your server, go get your salsa! 

Also, I'm not a huge Horchata fan, but the Horchata there was super tasty. It's also 32oz, so share, or go pee a lot.
