Best lunch ever!!! We ate here 4 times while in Phoenix. It was an easy 5 minute walk from the convention center within the shopping/eating center. Get the stuffed pepper (Carnitas Relleno), the tuna, stuffed chicken breast, and/or chicken quesadilla. You won't regret it!! Also, they serve AMAZING chips (thick homemade sweet potato, tortilla, and baked chips) with the best homemade salsa. And the prices can't be beat for what you get!!
