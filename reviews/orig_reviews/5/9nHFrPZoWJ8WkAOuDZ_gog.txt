I have only been to Crescent to see live music, never for food. But if you're looking for a fun venue to check out a new band, this place is great. It provides an intimate setting to see music and it's easy to get up close to the band if that's your style. It is a bit of a "hipster" scene, but that makes the people-watching more fun. Also, the drinks are fairly priced. I'd like to go back for Trivia night and to try some food.
