First time visiting the Vegas location and I must say it was really tasty!!  We had the guacamole and Baja ceviche to start......

Guacamole = good flavor but it needs more heat since I like spicy guacamole.
Ceviche = was really good with a good blend of flavors. 

Dinner 
HERS - Sautéed Shrimp n scallops = both shrimp and scallops cooked perfectly.
MINE - Grilled skirt steak = cooked medium rare was like butter melting in my mouth, the organic black beans, roasted corn and veggies were a perfect flavor compliment to the meat, and the monster flour tortilla was awesome!!

Drinks
HERS - Prickly pear piña colada = delicious with the toasted coconut rim
MINE - Blood orange Margarita = was a refreshing drink with a little bit of spice!  

Service/server = Ryan S. was very attentive, courteous and had a pleasant demeanor.
  
Overall this place is really good and we'll definitely be back on future trips.
