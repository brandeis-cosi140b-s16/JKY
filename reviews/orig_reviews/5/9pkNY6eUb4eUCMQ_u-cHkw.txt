We ate brunch here on the last day of our trip - it's $35 flat and you can order as many small plates as you want.  They are all Latin themed and realllllly good!  Some favorites: Bananas Foster crepes, fried chicken with a blue corn waffle and spicy mango sauce, egg white oysters rockefeller, anything with the bacon (it was awesome, thick and crispy without being overdone).  You can order multiples of the same dish if you like it (oh you can bet we did this).  I think I had three of the egg white oysters....  Between three of us, I think we ordered almost everything on the menu (to share) and left stuffed.  We were less impressed with the red velvet johnny cake and the churro tots, but loved everything else.
