Fabulous for what it is.  A great place to have a glass of wine (huge pour) outside in appropriate weather.  Oysters Rockefeller are extrordinary and the shrimp tamale is so good it is hard for me not to order it every visit.  Guacamole is best in town.  Part of the Uncle Sal complex (Sal's, Side Door, and now the Pig) you just can't go wrong regardless.  Highest recommendation.
