Usually airport restaurants don't stand out, but Barrio Cafe in the D gate area definitely does. When I have a layover in Phoenix I go out of my way to eat there. Food is excellent and service always fast, friendly and efficient. I always make a point to order their French Press coffee. It is the best coffee I've ever had. Barrio is worth the long walk from the C gates.
