My husband and I spent the day in Charlotte last week.  Apparently my husband had bookmarked this place.  I'm so glad he did.

It was a little scary at first.  There wasn't anyone in the parking lot, it looked desolate.  It was 11:30 and we had just beat the lunch rush.  Right after we ordered and sat down, it got busy.

They don't have anything labelled Gluten Free (GF).  When I asked, they were more than happy to accomodate.  They made me a bowl, a steak burrito without the tortilla, not on the menu.  

We were fortunate to also get to meet Isaac.  He made sure we were satisfied with food and service.  Zero complaints....thanks for the great lunch!
