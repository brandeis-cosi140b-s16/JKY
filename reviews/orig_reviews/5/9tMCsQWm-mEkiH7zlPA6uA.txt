We came here on a Friday evening and ordered 
1. Flour burrito with Kalua pig $6.95
2. 3 tacos with Huli Huli chicken $6.95
3. Quesadilla with chicken $3.50 (4 slices)
4. side of guacamole ?
for the price of the groupon ($10 for $20 value). It came out to $20.27, but waived the change

- Next to McDonalds and Buffet of Asia. 
- Dead on, Hawaiian-style Chipotle.
- Very generous. We told them that it was our first time here and they gave of a free sample of the Kalua pig with mango and roasted corn in an actual serving bowl for us to sample! Haha. 
- Clean. Fast food. Friendly "ohana" service. 
- Choice of flour or wheat tortilla for burrito. 
- Sour cream isn't extra but guacamole is.
- Burrito is delicious. The pork was flavorful! I taste the island-flavor! Salty and sweet.
- Tacos were crispy and fresh.
- Chicken taste like a mix of pineapple, sugar, and ginger. Sweet. 
- Quesadilla was a bit disappointing. Very cheesy but also really greasy. 
- I recommend the Mango and roasted corn salsa! Excellent!
- Great creativity. Love the fusion. 
- Only wish that they have a salsa bar, chips, limes, and jalepeno peppers. Now, that would be truly amazing. Otherwise, the Groupon made it terrific buy for what it's worth.
