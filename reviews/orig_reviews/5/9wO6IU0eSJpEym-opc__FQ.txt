What an oasis in Scottsdale. Even though this restaurant is on a main road, sitting on the patio you would have no idea. The multi level patio has a waterfall and is tastefully tacky. 

The margs were good. And if you check in you get free chips and salsa! The salsas look very homemade and the salsa verde was very very good. 

We got a restaurant week special and an extra entree and both waddled home with a lot of left overs. 

The enchantment platter was perfect for someone who can't decide on just one thing. The lobster enchiladas had great big pieces of lobster in them.

The prickly pear flan had a great consistency and was not too sweet!
