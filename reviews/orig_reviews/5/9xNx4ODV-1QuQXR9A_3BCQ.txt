Hola amigos!  Ever wish you could find that delicious border Mexican food like you had on that side street in Nogales or Hermosillo?  Have you learned the delicate difference between those rubber flour tortillas they sell in the grocery store and truly well made Mexican flour tortillas?

Wish no longer and welcome to Rudy's!  Real border chow made the way it should be!  They also sell homemade flour tortillas Momma makes on site!  Mmmm!

One of my favorites (and it's odd perhaps for a Gringo), is Rudy's Menudo.  Served with tortillas, onions/chopped cilantro, and lime this is the life!  

So, here it is; best border Mexican chow on the east side of Phoenix.  (And don't forget your dozen flour tortillas!)
