I went here after driving by on Bell Road since it is less than a mile down the road from my place of business. Since there isn't a Chipotle close enough to grab lunch, this mexican grill seemed like a great alternative. 

When I walked in I soon realized it was nothing like Chipotle, and was a sit down restaurant with chips and salsa and all that jazz. I was feeling fancy so I decided to stay even though I was the only one there at what was approximately lunch time (I think it was around 1PM).

The chips, as most reviewers have echoed, left a lot to be desired - I was expecting fresh out of the oil goodness. The salsa was one of the best I've had, pretty spicy, and I know spicy! I really couldn't stop eating the salsa to be honest, luckily the waitress constantly refilled my small water glass.

I ordered a steak torta - can't remember the exact name but it was a house specialty of some kind. It came with country red potatoes which were DIVINE and the steak was SO TASTY. I took my time eating because I didn't want to waste any of it but it was a ton of meat. 

Overall, great meal, really flavorful and authentic - just a little pricy. I think my plate was around 10 bucks or so, I just remember leaving 15.
