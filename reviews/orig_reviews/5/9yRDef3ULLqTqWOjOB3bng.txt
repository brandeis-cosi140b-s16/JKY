Before coming here I heard great things about the place, not only about the nachos but also the other food choices that they offer. (Pizza, burgers, sandwhiches, salads, etc). I came here with my family and we all wanted to try the nachos and for the price I would have to say It wasn't too bad. The average price of the nachos were about $10 bucks and it was a decent size. We also ordered their special carne Asada nachos which was pricey ($15). All in all I would recommended and go again in the future
