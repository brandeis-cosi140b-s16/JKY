I have been waiting for a great "New" Mexican food restaurant in Surprise for 8 years.  Rito's is it!  They use hatch green chile and know how to make Mexican food like I'm used to back home in Albuquerque, NM. I had the green chile beef burrito enchilada style and it was heavenly!    I called for take out at 4:50 and was informed they close at 5.  They made it anyway and waited for me to get there to pick it up.  I met the owners and they were fabulous!  We discussed hatch green chile and "new" Mexican food.    I will eat there every week.   Super excited there is finally good Mexican food in Surprise, AZ.
