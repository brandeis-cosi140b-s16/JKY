Carolina's is a local neighborhood spot where those in the know travel to munch on tacos, burritos, tamales, etc. The restaurant isn't much to look at - bars on windows, busy counter where you can look in on tortilla making and the assortment of booths and table/chairs. There is a big line of hungry patrons and people jockeying for tables so that was good news. 

You will find the MOST amazing homemade flour tortillas here! They are chewy, soft and sensuous. This is the stuff dreams are made of. I haven't had a tortilla like this in years and may have to make sure I stop through Phoenix more frequently. Pretty much everything my friends and I tried were awesome. Green corn Tamales, tacos with beef, machaca plate with beans and rice and burrito stuffed with chorizo and potatoes. The beans and rice are perfect - you can't overlook those staples. I think I even noted some lard - perfection! Writing this review is making my mouth water - I could really go for some Carolina's now.
