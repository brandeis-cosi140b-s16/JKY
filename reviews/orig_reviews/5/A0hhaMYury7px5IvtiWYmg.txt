First time here, came on a Sunday night for dinner. The inside is fairly small, but cozy. They have a large patio dining area with nice lights up, but it's too cold for that so no one was out there. 
They have some interesting menu items that I've never seen before. My husband and I got the fig and panela cheese salad, the hibiscus enchiladas (yep, the flowers) and the huitlacoche crepas which is apparently a type of mushroom, or fungus, that grows on corn. Sounds like we eat weird stuff huh? Maybe so. 
The salad had nice bite-size pieces of dried figs and cheese with a balsamic dressing. The hibiscus enchiladas had a sweet/tangy flavor to them with a nice side of sauteed vegetables. The crepas were soft and tangy with goat cheese and pomegranate sauce. I was impressed by all three!  They also bring out chips with two types of salsa. 
Good service as well!
