BOTTOM LINE: Great prices for both unique and authentic Mexican food. It's not the typical northern Mexican cuisine we're accustomed to in Arizona, but rather Mexico City-style. The staff is very friendly.

If you don't know what torta is. it's the Mexican word for sandwich (though in the rest of Latin America it means cake). And these guys really are "The Kings of the Torta." My favorite one is the Hawaiian torta. 

The aguas naturales are amazing fruit drinks. Watermelon is my favorite.

And for desert the fruit with nuts and honey is a great finish to this meal.
