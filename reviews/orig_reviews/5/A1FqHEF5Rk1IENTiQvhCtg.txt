So people say ya.. chino bandidi is kind of sketchy.. it is not a date place.. it is UNIQUE. And i didnt believe it.

I was kind of put off guard by how it was.. with the raving reviews i expected an exrrnisve fusion menu and sit down style eating. But no... and i wasnt upset. 

Basically you come to chino for a bowl.. choose your beans.. choose the type of rice and the meat. If you arent sure about the meat, they will let you try it and give you tips. And you will not be upset. Best part you get two helpings of meat and if you want you can quesadilla style it! What what!!

I really did live this place and completely agree... it is UNIQUELY SKETCHY BUT AMAZING
