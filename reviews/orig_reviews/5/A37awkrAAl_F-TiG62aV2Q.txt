After a night drinking, which is like every night basically, i do try to stay on the slim side but honestly... we are in the US and slim is not really a typial american trade now is it? 
Anyways, thank god for this great country to allow us to be freaking fat, globby, jiggly bitches and being called sexy because we have a lot of junk in the trunk, and according to german people fat on a woman, even one ounce, is waaaay to fat... 
Anyways, thank god we are in the US and after boozing all night we are allowed to visit such great establishements like Robertos.
If you want to stay on the german skinny side, order the sides without any carbs. If you want the full american experience, get the full load :)

It is delicious, very inexpensive and more delicious as more you boozed.
