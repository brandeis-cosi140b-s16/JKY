My buddy brought me here for a quick lunch. He ordered something for me that I never would have tried: the crazy potato. I was genuinely surprised; in the words of Dora the Explorer: "yum, yum, yum... delicioso!" 

The place was clean, the staff pleasant, and atmosphere above average for a quick-stop eatery. 

If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss this place!
