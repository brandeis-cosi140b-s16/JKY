Phat Phrank's was a lovely lunch spot.  It's a simple restaurant a little off the strip but WELL WORTH the trip!  The fresh guacamole had ample amounts of avocado and is seasoned just right.  The braised pork  (adobada) is super flavorful with a little bit of a bite.  Their hot sauce spices it up nicely.  The fish tacos were on point.  Lightly fried fish, home-made creamy sauce, and loads of fresh cabbage and green onions made the perfect combo on a soft corn tortilla.  Hubby usually doesn't like fish tacos, but he blessed these, and added an extra to his order.  We're giving this a five because you get really GOOD food and SOLID service.  I'll be back!  If I lived around here, it would be a regular lunch spot for me.  :)
