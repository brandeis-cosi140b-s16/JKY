I have been going to this restaurant since I was a child, and it only gets better! Carolina's is definitely not known for the 5 star accommodations it provides. Rather people come here again and again, simply because it is INCREDIBLE food. The tortillas especially are to die for. One of the best tortillas I have ever had (La Purisima has good ones as well).  I ahve never had a bad meal at Carolinas! The prices don;t hurt your wallet either!
