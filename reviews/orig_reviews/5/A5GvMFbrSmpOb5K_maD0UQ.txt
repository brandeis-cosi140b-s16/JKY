Simply delicious. I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while and I am happy I finally did. It's easy to miss this restaurant as there is no signage on the outside, the interior is pretty dark, and there are about 3 tables and a small bar to sit at. However, the staff is great and the food is amazing. I ordered the carne adovada, Christmas style w/ fried eggs. It was divine. My wife ordered the swordfish special and it was also delicious. We both ate about 1/2 of our meals because of the humongous serving size. This place is now permanently bookmarked for me. It's awesome.
