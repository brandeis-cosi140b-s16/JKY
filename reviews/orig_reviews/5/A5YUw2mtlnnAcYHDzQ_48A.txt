This is my favorite local burrito and taco shop! My husband and I have tried many of their burritos and have loved them all! They have a great deal on fish tacos on Mondays - and those are amazing too! Their salsa is excellent, although sometime the red one is too hot for my weak taste buds (but I still eat it). I like to pick up a package of their tortillas because they are large and tasty. Make sure to preorder their tamales during the holidays - yummy!
