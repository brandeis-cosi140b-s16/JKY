I am from Mexico City.  This is the best Mexican food I ever had in the whole U.S. I don't know where these people get their funky ideas for giving this restaurant 1 star. This place is an 11 out of 10! The food is amazing and the people are very welcoming and hospitable.  If you want authentic and real Mexican food, come here.
