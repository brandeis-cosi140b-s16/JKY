OMG these burritos are amazing. We were just about to return our rental car at the Phoenix Airport  and I was trying to find a place nearby to stop for food before hitting the airport. Thank you Yelpers for recommending such a great place!! I ordered the Red Chili Burrito with the tortilla warmed on the grill giving it a great texture with a red chili sauce with carne on the inside. This did not disappoint and I might return back to the Phoenix Airport just to go get another burrito. Remember this is a cash only place!
