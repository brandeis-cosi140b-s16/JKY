Really delicious and inexpensive mexican food.  Great staff who love the food and know how to describe it. Our favorites include tamales, fish tacos, cevich toastadas, shrimp quesadillas and steak tacos. Excellent salsas and sauces. Has a popular drive-thru and catering too. The best mexican food we have had in the east valley.
