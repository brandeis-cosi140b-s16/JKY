This is my second review of El Segundo.  My first review was less than stellar.  The great part was the owner and general manager reached out to me to discuss the problems I had at the restaurant.  These guys are terrific and have excellent customer service skills.  They very politely asked if I could come back and enjoy the restaurant once again because I was an avid advocate of this establishment until I had a poor experience on my last visit.

First let me state that my return trip was excellent.  I went there with a friend and everyone from the hostess, the waiter to the manager provided excellent service.  And the food was perfect.  For the appetizer I ordered the traditional chips and salsa.  If you have not tried this you should.  The chips come with three types of salsa: a hot, mild and a Verde.  They are all excellent.  I ordered the tuna tacos which came with rice and red beans and a few mixed drinks.  I ordered the tacos since that is something I've not had before and wanted to venture into uncharted territory.  The food did not disappoint.  I highly recommend  El Segundo to anyone who likes Mexican Food along with a fun environment
