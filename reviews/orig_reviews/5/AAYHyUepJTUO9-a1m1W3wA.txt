Haiku to the Oaxaca Special Burro:

Oh how I crave thee
Chorizo, potato, beans
Breakfast perfection.

LOVE Carolina's. Authentic Mexican food, reasonable prices and tortillas that are big enough to sleep under while you have steamy dreams about them. Buy extra to take home and have one for breakfast with butter and jelly!
