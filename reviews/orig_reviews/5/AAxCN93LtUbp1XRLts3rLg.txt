5 star service, food, and price.

I love mexican food and eat it all the time living down in San Diego, but I was very surprised to find the best tamale I have ever eaten at a place just off the vegas strip.  I tried the cheese and jalapeno tamale.  The masa was moist and flavorful and there was a perfect amount of filling.  I also had an awesome vegetarian burrito (only like $5) that was simple and delicious.  I got a side of mole to dip it in, as I love to do with any place that has mole,  it was very good.  As you know, moles vary quite a bit.  This one was dark, smokey, and had a stronger balance towards a rich pepper flavor as opposed to a sweeter chocolate one.  

They start you off with some great salsa and a bean dip with chips.  Love it!  I only regret not trying a margarita from this place.
