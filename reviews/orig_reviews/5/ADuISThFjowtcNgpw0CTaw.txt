How have I not written a review for this place?? Shame on me. 

This is one of my favorite restaurants in champaign because it's delicious and affordable. I always get their tlacoyos with pastor and it's the best ever. I'm craving it as I'm writing. 

I haven't tried much else since I'm in the tlacoyo phase but will update when I try other things.
