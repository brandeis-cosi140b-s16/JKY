Awesome food. This little place just sprung up a few months ago, and it looks like it is here to stay (I sure hope so at least). Maize always seems like it is busy, so I decided to try it out. Great food. I like how the burritos are prefect sized - I can eat one without feeling stuffed (unlike a Chipotle burrito, not that that is bad though). Really friendly staff, and a small bag of Chips and salsa comes with every order. The inside is small though, so if you walk in and order, be prepared to wait a little (less than 10 mins though) in a small space!

I used to be an El Charro fan, but since Maize moved in I haven't gone since... and I haven't really missed it either.

Pros: Great food. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Chips and salsa with every order. Orders don't take long (I can call an order in and by the time I walk over it will be ready!)

Cons: Small location, not a whole lot of room to wait around for your order or to sit down and eat. Really busy sometimes.
