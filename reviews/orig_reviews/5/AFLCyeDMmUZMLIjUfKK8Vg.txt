Welcome to the neighborhood!  Had the marlin tacos and the carne asada, and they were some of the best I've had.  Great atmosphere.  They serve beer and margaritas so they are perfect as a late afternoon destination.  The salsa bar is well equipped with different tastes from all over Mexico, and the owner Felipe is a food guy at heart.  He made it a point to come over and say hi and introduce himself.  We ended the meal with a Horchata to go, and I have to say I couldn't have left any happier!
