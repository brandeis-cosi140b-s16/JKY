An excellent Mexican restaurant in Vegas.  My wife and I weren't actually expecting much given that it's in a casino / hotel but we were very pleasantly surprised to find out the food, service and prices were excellent.  Quite authentic Mexican cuisine and service was very personal and attentive.  Probably the least expensive sit down restaurant in this hotel.  Overall, a great value, decent atmosphere, and food and service that we're be sure to come back for when in town again.
