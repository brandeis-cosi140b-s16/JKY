We were a party of 9 coming in for some late night dining, and Meg's service alone deserves 5 stars. She was so genuine and hospitable, even in a late night rush, where other servers might check out and become apathetic. Not Meg--she made our night a complete breeze with her attentive presence and positive disposition. The tequila list is long and diverse, but I'm more of a beer and whiskey drinker. The tap beer and bourbon selection is quite varied and extremely well priced, and I was happy to imbibe on some local beer and delicious bourbon. The food is fine. However, I think the menu could be paired down. Maybe a little "less is more" could go a long way. There's hints at quality ingredients and preparation but the menu is just too long for any one thing to stand out.  The atmosphere is fun, loud music that begs for some dancing. 
Thanks Meg, for making our dining experience easy and fun!
