This place was awesome! Everyone was so friendly! I must of looked confused because I was asked if it was my first time! I got the steak tacos and told the guy to make it how he would eat it, it was soo good!!! The hot sauces they had were amazing such great flavors! You also have to try the coconut bark! It's so good! I'm hooked
