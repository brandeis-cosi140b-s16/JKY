I had friends in town and they had seen this place on Man Vs. Food and were dying to go. I have to admit I hadn't seen that episode, so this place wasn't on my radar at all. It's located in a little shopping center and you couldn't tell from the outside, but it was packed and this was just before 11am!

The food looked and smelled amazing as we were seated. My girlfriend and I went for the quesadilla's because frankly everything else looked so HUGE! Her husband got the sandwich that was mentioned on Man Vs. Food - La Reyna, and it looked and smelled awesome! It was massive but he finished every bite (and didn't eat for the rest of the day).

The staff was friendly and the food was good and fast! I will definitely have to bring the Hubby here!
