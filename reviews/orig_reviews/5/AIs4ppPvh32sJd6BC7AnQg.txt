If you want some good food at a good price, this is the place!

Eating at many mexican restaurants, this is by far my favorite. The chicken enchiladas are good, the beans, the margaritas and the chicken mole.

Not a swanky place that fits into the Scottsdale area, but just down right good food. Come here for the food. The patio is quaint. I like it here. I have never sat inside and would not recommend it. It feels cramped.

I live in Denver now and wish Frank and Lupe's was here.
