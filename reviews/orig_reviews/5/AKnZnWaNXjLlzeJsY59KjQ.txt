Awesome food. First time here so I can't guarantee all the items, but what I tried makes me think the menu is promising. Wow. Yum. And they have a daily special that's happy hour prices. Not to mention the awesome chips and dip (mild, hot hot, and spicy bean dip) that come out as soon as u sit. Yum!
