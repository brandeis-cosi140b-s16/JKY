I was born and raised in Texas and moved here 3 years ago.  Mexican food has been my favorite since I was in the egg.  
What you people here in Arizona call Mexican food is equivalent to a gas station taco in Texas, no offense, but you know how Mexican food differs from state to state and everyone loves what they're used to... even when it's shameful!
I rarely eat Mexican food these days unless it's a burrito, cause you can mess up a burrito... very often. 
I don't remember the Abuelo's back home being this delicious, so maybe I'm just homesick, but the first time I ate here, I had to excuse myself to have a cry in the bathroom -- I was so happy.  Tex-Mex has it's own name against the rest of Mexican food for a reason. 
The atmosphere here is soft and comfortable, and the service is exceptional.  It is a bit pricy, but the portions are... Shall I say it? Alright, Texas sized and it doesn't taste like it been rolled in dirt and places under a heat lamp for 12 years. 
Take it from a Texan, this is Tex-Mex, and if you don't like it, then you're simply partial to your own state's form of Mexican food... which makes me a very sad man.
As far as the bar is concerned, my mojito was overpriced and too sweet and my beer was just overpriced but still delicious.
