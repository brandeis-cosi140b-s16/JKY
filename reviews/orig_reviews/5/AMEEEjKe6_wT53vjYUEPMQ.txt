What else is there to say about La Condesa that hasn't been said in the hundred other 5 star reviews of this place?  Not much, so I'll just add the following for extra emphasis...

1. The tacos.  Oh the tacos...  even living out in California, the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark tacos are made of dreams and sunshine and sugar plum fairies.  If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious, beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces.  With just a little cream sauce and lettuce so you don't miss out on any of the shark.  And the Cochinita Pibil tacos... there's fall off the bone tender, then there's meat that's pretty much as  close to melting as meat can get.  But these are just my favorites... I've tried all the tacos on the menu, and they're all delicious.

2. The salsa bar.  If I can give this place any criticism, it's that they run out of salsas far too often.  Late in the day.  Just before they close.  Look... sometimes I'm in a peanut salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a chipotle salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a strawberry salsa mood.  I can't help it.

3. The horchata.  Just order it.  It's big.  Bring guests.  Share it.

I come here far too often for someone that lives 1000 miles away.  Love it.
