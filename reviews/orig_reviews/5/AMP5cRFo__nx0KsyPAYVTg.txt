Had Happy Hour on Monday at the Borgata location.
Loved the appetizers.The ceviche is outstanding. 
Had the Quesadilla with Chicken (very good) and the tacos with pork. Delish!
I had the berry margarita. Loved it. My husband has a beer.Beer was OK. There are better brews in Phoenix. 
Service was very good.
Will be back!
