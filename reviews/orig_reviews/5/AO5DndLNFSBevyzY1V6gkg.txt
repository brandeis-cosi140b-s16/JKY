Wow! Just got back from Ko Mex. Wife & I spent a whopping $19.55 for 3 fusion tacos, 2 tacquitos & kimchee fried rice!  Ko mex is just as most reviewers see it, a small shop in a strip mall that I would have easily passed had it not been for Yelp.

We drove the 10 miles from our hotel to try Ko Mex. All I can say is I wish we had one of these in Torrance. The Fusion tacos, both beef & chicken with kim chee were absolutely DEEEE LISH ISSS! But my fave was the lettuce wrap with pork! I let my wife taste it ( she had the kim chee rice ) & she wolfed 3/4 of the wrap while I was sucking down a Pina Jarrito! 

Great service, we were so lucky it wasnt too busy so service was extra qwik. I love hitting these places during non peak days as you feel unrushed and can really enjoy the food....Oh btw, we had to bring half the rice home cuz we were so full! Add in orange & fortune cookies for dessert & you have one Fantastic place to Eat. So happy we found this treasure!
