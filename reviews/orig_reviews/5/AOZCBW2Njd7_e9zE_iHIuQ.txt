Unbelievable.      Fantastic experience all around, including the wonderful waiter Ruben who was willing to work with my vegetarian preferences.   My husband (not a veggie) reports that the fish he ate was unbelievable.   And a half dozen mexican beers on draft.  So good!     I can't wait to go back!
