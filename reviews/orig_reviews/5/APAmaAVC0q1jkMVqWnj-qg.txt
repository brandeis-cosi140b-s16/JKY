Had dinner here as date night, great choice!  We were immediately served water and chips and salsa which was nice to snack on while we decided what to order.  We started with an appetizer of guacamole which was a great choice.  It had just the right amount of creaminess and lime.  I tried the Fish tacos which were grilled Mahi-Mahi with a mango salsa.  Very good.  We also had the shrimp taco, the Baja fish, and my wife's favorite, the bean and cheese.  It was made with a soft corn tortilla, beans, cheese, and some fresh veggies on top.  As simple as it was it was full of flavor.  We also particularly enjoyed the cilantro lime rice.  Overall the staff was friendly and helpful and made sure we had enough beer at all times.  Great menu and friendly staff!
