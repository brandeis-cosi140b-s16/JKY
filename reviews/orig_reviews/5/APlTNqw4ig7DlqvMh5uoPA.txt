so, i finally had my experience. the best food, i have eaten, thus far in my life. 


i literally couldnt even handle the amazingness of the cochinita. it was, well, amazing.

while eating the elote i kept saying shut up. but no one was talking? thats how good it was. my friend asked if it was for real.  both of our faces were covered in corn juice and our teeth full of corn bits. oh, yes, it is for real. 

the service was awesome too. our waiter was so great. he let me 'taste' the agua frescas. ummm YUM! 

we ordered the chips and salsa too- the bomb dot com for sure. 

i need to go like everyday. and i will. jk i wont but i'll think about it daily.
