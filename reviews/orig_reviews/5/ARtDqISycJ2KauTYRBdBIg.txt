This place is FaBuLouS!!! We walked in & we're immediately greeted. Two glasses of water & chips & salsa within barely sitting down! LoVe! Restaurants forget the importance of water now a days & I always have to ask for it 3 times! So this was a delight to me.

The chef/owner? (Guy with a curled mustache) explained the menu very well. Everything made fresh, tortillas & torts & even their buns are local.

My boyfriend had the Carne Asada, Pork Belly, Taco Del Mar & a Tinga tacos. He said they were all delicious! 
I had the house salad with Carne Asada & the street corn. Being on a diet...salads can become so drab! Not this one! It was sooo FreSh! & the ingredients & dressing went so well together! I could eat it everyday!

Chef/Owner guy checked on us again mid meal & chatted with us as we were in town for work. Told him we wish we lived closer as I would come in often.

He gave us a flan dessert that they grind fresh coffee into that was PHENOMINAL! 

If you are in the area DEFINITELY check this place out! You will not be disappointed!
