I have been to La Tolteca several times now and have had a similar experience every time. I walk in through the bakery part, ogle some of the baked goods, wind through the other customers, and go order myself a burrito and a taco. Every single time I pay under $10 for my food, get it in under 15 minutes, and enjoy a great meal. Everything I have tried so far has been exceptional. A personal favorite is the carne asada burrito with a taco de papa. Delicious and only $8!

The reason I prefer La Tolteca over other local Mexican eateries is because the quality of the food seems superior and the staff is much friendlier. Even as critical as I usually am, I have nothing bad to say about this place except for that it is across town from me.

Definitely worth a stop if you want some quick and delicious food.
