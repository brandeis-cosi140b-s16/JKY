Stopped in on a Saturday night and as expected there was a 45 minute wait so we just decided to sit at the bar and have dinner.

As always the service was terrific at the bar with two or three bartenders taking care of us.

I had the chicken Fajitas and as always was very satisfied. Portions are always generous and I get to take some home for a Sunday afternoon lunch!

We love the atmosphere and the food.
