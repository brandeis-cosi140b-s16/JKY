Alright forget los betos , forget chipotle, forget most of the burrito shops which are step above fast food. Phx burrito is the place to go for a great burrito the house special is on point, but my favorite the chicken burrito just makes the mouth water. So the burritos come with rice , your choice of beans , your choice of meat , along with the other usual stuff sour cream and so on but they do not skip on anything . This is the spot to go. Also a big thing I love about the place are the people that work there, funny folk which remember your name, now that might be that I have been there to much which in that case I may have an addiction but trust me give it a try.
