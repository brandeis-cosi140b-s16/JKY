STELLAR! They even have healthy options.  Had a steak burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. Totally loaded with veggies and steak. I love the salsa bar, in my opinion if the chips and salsa suck I will pass on everything else. Looking forward to a return visit soon. Stoked on what they are doing on the patio.
