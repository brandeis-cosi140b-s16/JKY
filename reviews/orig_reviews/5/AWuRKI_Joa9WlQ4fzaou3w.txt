I've read so much about this place and finally decided to go after work today, and wow I was impressed!

Other reviewers talked about how there's a wait, but when I got there at around 2:30 (prime lunch hour) there were only two other parties there! I was seated promptly, given my beverage, a menu and complimentary tortilla chips, guacamole and pico de gallo. 

I ordered the Bulgogi Nachos and wow, if I had known the servings were so huge I would've just had a half order! The prep for my food didn't take very long, maybe 10mins tops and it was delicious. The bulgogi in the nachos were generous and were strayed all over the top along with some pico de gallo and jalape√±os. The bulgogi itself was marinated to a balanced sweet and saltiness that it almost made me want to order something else that had more of it. 

The waitresses constantly refilled my water and were very nice. The price for my entire meal was very generous and the service was all together very pleasant. 

Next time I will definitely be trying the other fusions on the menu (mmm pork belly tacos). 

If you haven't had the chance to try fusion food made right I'd definitely recommend you pay a visit to this place! Just be sure to call ahead of time to reserve tables if you have a fairly large party, the place itself is very small and I could imagine it getting filled very quickly.
