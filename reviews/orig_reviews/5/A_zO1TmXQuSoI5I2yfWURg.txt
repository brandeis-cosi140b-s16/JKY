Barrio raises the bar.

I feel...like every other place that I gave 5 stars should be knocked down a star. This is what real 5 stars is. 

I don't know what I liked better: the service, my enchiladas, my margaritas, or my churros. I'm totally serious.

I loved this place.

Holy hell. Could you imagine if this place was closer to me? I'd be broke as a joke and obese.

I loved this place. I don't know what else to say about that.
