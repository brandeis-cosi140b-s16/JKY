Everytime I visit Lenero, it is an exceptional experience. Service is always great and the ambience alone keeps me coming back. 

Now the food-- oh my gosh, so delicious! You can tell everything is thoughtfully prepared and fresh. 

The skirt steak and shredded lamb are my favorite entrees and a must try. 

The queso fundido app--melted cheese, chorizo, and fresh flour tortillas-- how could you not love it?! House specialty cocktails are incredible also. Try the A La Luna, made with fresh basil and cilantro vodka (all their cocktails contain no artificial additives, awesome)

There is something for everyone to love here and it is a great addition to the neighborhood. I will continue returning to Lenero because I'm always guaranteed a fabulous dining experience and what more could you ask for? Keep it up, Lenero!
