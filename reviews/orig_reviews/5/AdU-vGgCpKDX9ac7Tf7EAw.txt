My new favorite restaurant! Wonderfully authentic food - Jose Andres is a true genius! Guacamole is to die for! Flying Pigs dim sum ROCKS! Chicken mole tacos are sooo good! Tres Lychees cake is almost too beautiful to eat... almost! The lychees on top of the cake were really good and complimented this dessert wonderfully. I can hardly wait to go back to Vegas to eat at China Poblano... many times! Super delicious! Btw, our waiter, Marques, was really great.
