After hearing many rave reviews about the milkshakes at The Stand, I returned yesterday with a girlfriend of mine to try one. I ordered the vanilla and she ordered the banana one and decided to add chocolate to it. We were both thoroughly impressed! The shakes are made with delicious ice cream and had the occasional specs of ice in them that separate the "real" shakes from the "made from mix" ones.

Friendly, professional service as usual from the owners who are dedicated to making their new business a success.
