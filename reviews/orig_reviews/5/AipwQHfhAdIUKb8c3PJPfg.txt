Great ambience (loud and spirited, so no quiet dates here), amazing salsas (am still dreaming about the avocado salsa), and delicious food.  The shrimp tacos were to die for.  In fact, the only thing sub-par were the vaunted margaritas, but I'll get over that.  I'd go here again next time am in Vegas.
