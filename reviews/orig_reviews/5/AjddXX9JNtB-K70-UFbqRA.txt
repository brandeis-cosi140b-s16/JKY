We arrived on a Friday night around 6:40 and promptly took advantage of the happy hour specials. Ordered 3 street tacos, one of each, and a blood orange margarita. The margarita was great, excellent flavor and gave me a nice little buzz. The tacos were delicious... so good that we both went back for another full order at 6:58! The place was doing a solid business which is nice to see in a small place and filled with all types of people - a couple families with small kids, elderly and young people.
 
Looks great too - 
nice open door patio with lights, restaurant is clean, nice bar and tv. Only wish that there was a salsa bar. Service was great and attentive. We will be back for the daily 4pm -7 happy hour for sure.
