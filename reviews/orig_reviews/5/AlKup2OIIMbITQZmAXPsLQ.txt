My first yelp post ever because this place is ahhhhmazing. The unlimited brunch is so delicious. Glad they have one of these in California. Had lunch yesterday from the ceviche bar, so fresh and tasty. Do yourself a favor and come here. It's in Caesers Palace in the forum shops on the bottom floor. Not very visible especially since it's new. Glad we found this place!!!!
