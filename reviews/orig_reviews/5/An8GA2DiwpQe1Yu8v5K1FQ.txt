First time at The Stand and the burger my wife and I shared was delicious.   The fries are hot, crispy and tasty.  We shared the chicken and short rib taco as welk and both were great.  All the food tasted fresh and well seasoned.  The could do with a little more indoor seating during the summer but other than that I will be eating here often.
