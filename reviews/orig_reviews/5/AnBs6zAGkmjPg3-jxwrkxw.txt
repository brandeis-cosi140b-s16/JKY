Where should I start? This place has great Mexican food for Las Vegas! The bean dip compliments the chips very well. My boyfriend and I visited this place mid November and we didn't know what we wanted to eat for breakfast. It was already passed 10am when we realized that McDonald's would stop serving breakfast at 10:30am! I decided to google some Mexican restaurants and voila'! This place is close to the Las Vegas new strip. I had the machacado plate and he had the chorizo with cheese plate. Everything was great, the customer service and the price. I will definitively be coming back here every chance I can when in town. I am from Texas and it's sad to say the food here is better than some back home. Now, you know! When in Las Vegas stop by here for Authentic Mexican Food....Only a 10 minute drive from the (new) strip.
