I'm very picky when it comes to good Mexican food. I'm not a fan of TexMex... nor can I stand food so spicy I have to pop a couple Zantac's when I get home. If you're looking for amazing flavor at a reasonable price with a downtown feel... THIS IS THE PLACE! While we were in line to order we met a couple who has been eating at Mango's for the past 15 years! Now that's saying something!  I ordered the cheese enchilada and shredded beef taco and my husband had the same. The staff and people were so friendly and down to earth... I can definitely say we will be back again and again! Thank you Mango's! It was delicioso!
