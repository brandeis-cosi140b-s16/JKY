What a fantastic afternoon of day-drinking. Sat at the bar and Shane was our server. Such a fun guy- lots of conversation about the area, kept us hydrated with his phenomenal cocktails, and the food was tasty as well. Going back tomorrow for breakfast. Check it out - great drinks, great food, and GREAT TIMES!!!
