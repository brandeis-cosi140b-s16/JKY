For me, the food is more important than the service so the unfriendly staff has never bothered me. I've been going here about once every two-three weeks for two years. The food is always fantastic so they deserve a high rating!

Food:
The food at Auntchiladas is close to authentic, but that isn't necessarily their goal. They serve a variety of dishes, like the chipotle chicken and the fish tacos, that are somewhat Americanized but are still very good. The el pollo fundido and chipotle chicken are my favorite dishes. The beans aren't loaded with lard so they are not very fattening and the rice is excellent. I order queso or abondigas soup for an appetizer. The free chips and salsa are great!

Service: 
This is where Auntchiladas loses many of their customers. To be fair, we have had some fantastic servers, but the majority of servers have been rather unfriendly. The food comes quickly, but don't expect to have time to fully enjoy it. If the restaurant is packed, the waiter will rush your meal by continuously trying to take your plate. The female servers are often dressed to attract attention. We have been at the restaurant on afternoons where all of the women were dressed in bikini tops! This destroys any attempt at a family atmosphere.
