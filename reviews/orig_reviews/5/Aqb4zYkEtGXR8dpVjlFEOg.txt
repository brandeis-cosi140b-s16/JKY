Okay. I must admit I was more than a little skeptical about a Mexican-Korean fusion place. Walking in didn't inspire much hope either. The place is tiny and was completely empty. What have I gotten myself into??? I was shocked! They start you off with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The four of us started off by sharing a half order of nachos. These were truly THE BEST nachos I have ever had! We tore them up! The chicken Bulgogi plate was fantastic! I got the half order with vegetables and couldn't finish. This is a definite must visit.

Update:  By the time we left at noon, the place had a line out the door and every table was full! Get there early!
