Wow, this place was seriously amazing! 

My friend and I went after work for Happy Hour and because we remembered their tacos at the Devoured festival. Our server Taryn was also super sweet and friendly, and answered all of our questions. I ended up getting the crispy fish taco, which turned out to be the best taco I've ever eaten! Also, because we got there before 4pm, we got to take part in their lunch special, (2 tacos and a small bowl of soup or salad for $10)!

I also got a $5 Mexican 75 cocktail and it was so good, I didn't even realize I'd had the whole thing in less than 5 minutes! 

Definitely added to my list of favorite places, and I can't wait to go back!
