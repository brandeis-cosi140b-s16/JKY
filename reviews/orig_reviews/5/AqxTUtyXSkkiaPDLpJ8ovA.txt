This place is our "go-to" Mexican spot.  Each of the many times I had gone, I have had only great things to say and eat!  The service is always very attentive and friendly, the food is cooked perfectly and the margaritas are out of this world good.

I enjoy the Mahi Mahi tacos and tamales for quick stop-ins.  I also am unable to stop eating the 3 selection salsa and chips.  Both salsa and chips are made on site and rather tasty.

The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating.  Views of the duck and turtle pond are offered from each seat selection which also makes it an entertaining atmosphere for children.  Kids of all ages seem to love feeding the huge ducks.

Stop in, you will love it!
