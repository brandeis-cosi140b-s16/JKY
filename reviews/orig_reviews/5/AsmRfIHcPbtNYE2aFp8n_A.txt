Oooooh Myyyy Gooooodnesssss! I've been searching for something similar to San Diego's taco shops since I moved away from San Diego back in 2011 and...THIS IS IT! As a matter of fact this chain of Roberto's started in San Ysidro (in south San Diego) according to their banner inside celebrating 50 years of service!

WOW Am I impressed!!! They are a very clean establishment and have huge windows to view the back kitchen where you can see them actually preparing your order!...Goodbye hole in the wall mystery meat! The staff was super courteous...can't say much about the other customers that came in after us but I'm not reviewing them so who cares! Their salsa bar was clean, stocked to the brim and just excellently FRESH! 

I ordered a carne asada burrito and OMG that first bite!...AMAZING! You can taste the fresh off the grill carne asada and it was spiced just right...no extra saltiness like most of these Mexican restaurants out here in Las Vegas. I can't rave about this place enough! I told my hubs that he was going to love it at the first bite...totally did! 

Coming from San Diego my standards on Mexican food are pretty high. So...Right on Roberto's! You definitely delivered in taste quality and service! I commend you! (^_^)
