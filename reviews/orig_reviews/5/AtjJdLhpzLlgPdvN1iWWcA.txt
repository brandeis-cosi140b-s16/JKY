People write reviews because of great experiences or terrible times. They feel so passionate of how the business got it right, they have to share their moment. I was not one of those downtown project followers, until now. I love the container park and their mission. I just wish it was bigger and had more shops. It's sort of an eclectic type of mall that has great eateries, notably Pinches Tacos. I ordered the combo taco plate, with chicken and shrimp... and corn. You rarely find street tacos with good meat. I've found a place. And, the corn was so good. Im writing a review of my second experience...
The prices are a little high for the portion size, but once in awhile I find myself craving some Mexican food... I can see myself coming back for more. Like now!
