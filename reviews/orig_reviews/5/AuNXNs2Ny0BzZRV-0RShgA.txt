I've reviewed it before, and I returned a year later, only to review it again: This place is amazing. I love the Mexican dishes much more than the Chinese, but the service, food and margaritas are all first class. You MUST have the carnitas taco with verde sauce --I could eat these all day. The tortillas are homemade here. The salsas are perfect. The margaritas are fresh with no mixes or syrups. I love it so much I ate there twice this week. You will too.
