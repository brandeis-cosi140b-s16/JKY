Oh my Jeezus Lord! Tripa? Cabeza? Suadero? Lengua? Grilled Jalepenos con cebolla y nopales? This hole-in-the-wall joint is where it's at! I now live in SF and the one thing I had to let go of in SoCal was good Mexican food. So when I stumbled upon this place in Vegas, I was like oh, let's try it. And next thing you know, I was in the zone...In...The...ZONE! This girl was like "Leena, I can tell when you really like your food...you're really into it and it looks like your really like it!" Uhhh...yea! That was this moment. 

There are a bunch of lines so just go to the shortest one...I went to the older man because he looked like he knew what to do with a giant cow and a grill. Then you can speak to him in your broken Spanish and ask for errrything. I notice that the non-traditional folks ask for cheese and all but if you want it really legit, then all you need is their special salsas and cilantro. 

OH and I forgot about the spicy pork! So good, so good so good! I do like the fancy pants restaurants. But it's places like this where I'm like, why did I just drop all them dimes on that meal when i just enjoyed these tacos and they were just as delicious...if not more! ::sigh:: #foodieproblems

Oh...but the drinks...I would suggest either BYOB OR a bottled beverage that they have....I would like to go back though and try their homemade beverages but as you can see, with 2 different animals and 5 different parts inside me, I was a bit occupied ;)
