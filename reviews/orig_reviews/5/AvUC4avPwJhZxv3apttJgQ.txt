I'm from Las Vegas and every time I am home I try soo hard to get to Havana Grill!  

I am absolutely OBSESSED with their black bean soup!  It's amazing.  I always order a bowl instead of a cup because it's a large portion, and it takes everything in me to save half to take home.  Something about the spices in this soup are too perfect.  I also always ask for extra onions on top. I love it, I love it, I love it!

For lunch, I will always get the Bistec sandwich (half size).  It's very tasty and very filling, especially after my soup.  The bread it comes on is buttered, garlicy, and toasted.  For my side, I usually get fries (I don't even like fries that much, but I do like them here at Havana Grill), and my Mom always gets the plantains.  Their plantains are on point!!  

I only wish they were open on Mondays, too!
