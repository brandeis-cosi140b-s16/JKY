We were seated quickly and we had water, a pitcher, chips and two fabulous kinds of salsa within minutes of being seated.  The wait staff was well trained and attentive.  Our server even checked to see whether we liked our drinks.  Our salsa was replenished without request.  The margaritas were delicious, as was the food. We ordered from the lunch menu, but the portions were dinner sized. I had a small piece of saran wrap in my food, which wasn't a big deal.  I did mention it to the server when she came by to check on us, and within minutes, the manager was at our table.  I didn't request it, but he comp'd my meal (love that pollo rico!). Even the beans and rice were delicious!  Loved the decor and really enjoyed a lunch at a very well-run restaurant.  I will be recommending Nando's to everyone!
