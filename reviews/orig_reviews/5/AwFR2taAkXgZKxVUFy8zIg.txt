Stopped in after a meeting,  thought about reading the paper, then the lights were lowered to kinda dark.  Decided to get my food to go.  Wait staff, Emily, was very sweet and understanding.   She made awesome recommendations, too.  If the food is as unexpectedly superior as the service provided by Emily, I will most definitely update this review.
