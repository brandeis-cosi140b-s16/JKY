So after having taking about a year off from going to fun new places due to my new fabulous baby , I had been wanting to check this place out for MONTHS. Finally I made it in with a few of my girlfriends (the hubs was a little annoyed to miss out, sorry guy!)

First - this place isn't huge. The staff is super accommodating and tries to make it work, but just know that if you have a large group or if you are heading over during a busy time, you may have to wait. 

I had heard that during the day there is a butcher shop inside, and while we sat & talked I took a peek at that menu. I am planning on heading over this weekend to pick up some steaks to grill at home - it all looked delicious.

We all split a bottle of Pinot Noir, and ordered a bunch of items to share. The guac appetizer is delish, and we shared the mushroom quesadilla which surprised me with how good it was. I'm normally not a fan of quesadillas, so I'm always happy to be proven wrong.

We ordered the pork sandwich (I don't remember the name) and HOLY CRAP it was incredible! I had a hard time sharing and felt guilty that the hubs wasn't there to try it. 

We'll definitely be back. Loved all the food and the friendly atmosphere.
