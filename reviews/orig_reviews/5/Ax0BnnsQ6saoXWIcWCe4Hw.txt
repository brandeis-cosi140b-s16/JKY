Completely blew my expectation even after seeing 4 1/2 star.

The cashier was extremely friendly and welcoming.

I had the lingua (Tongue) quesadilla with everything on it, which was $5+additional for the avacado (worth it). I also had the lingua torta with everything on it, which was $4.5+additional for avacado. 

It was the best quesadilla i've ever had, and also the best torta i've ever had. I highly recommend both of them. 

My friend had a taco and burrito. $3 tacos are on the pricey side, but they are filling. Burrito was around $6, it was slightly smaller than i thought it would be, but the taste was also great!
