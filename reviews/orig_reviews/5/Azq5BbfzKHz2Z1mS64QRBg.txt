This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Every time I go, I tried to order something new exciting and different to me. I have my staples that I order every time such as the Viva Chinna taco which includes crispy beef tendon and lightly poached oysters. Delicious. The carnitas are very tender and flavorful, and served with a salsa cruda and pork rind on top. This visit my fiancee and I tried the steamed pork buns and quail egg shu mai for the first time, and both were immediate favorites! The buns were filled with sweet and slightly spiced barbecue pork, perhaps a little too sweet, but the toothy chewy dough made a great balance. The shu mai is something I will order again and recommend heavily.. there was delicious and delicate minced filling in a tender dumpling with a just very slightly steamed quail egg nestled right in the top of each one. It made for one epic mouth experience, salty and creamy with an appealing texture. The agua fresca was a perfect compliment.
