I just want to say I don't really even like Fajitas unless they are with lettuce, tomato and cheese.  Juan's have the best Fajitas I have ever had and I ate them just like they said to.  
This place is off the chain good.  The staff and the food are better than most of the 5 star places I have been at.  the chips and re-fried pork beans (on the house by the way) are the Bomb....  You MUST try this place if you are in Vegas.  You won't be disappointed.
