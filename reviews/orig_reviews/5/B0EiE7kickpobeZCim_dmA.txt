Aunt Chilada's had me at the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips are tasty, made out of flour. Then there's the blended margaritas. They have the perfect kick. The food was also delicious. Can't get enough of the cheese. I like that some dishes serve fideo as the side instead of rice. The only bummer: I haven't been able to try the flan. They always seem to be out when I'm there.
