Love this place! Mexican food finally back at red rock & way better than the previous, Cabo.  Taco Tuesdays here! Absolutely love the tacos especially the pancita (pork belly) & the baja fish tacos! All the variations of guacamole are delish as well as the Dorado ceviche. We came on a weekday & it was popping! Awesome atmosphere especially for a drink specifically the cheeky cheeky boom boom after a long 10 hour day of work ! Did I mention the Mac and cheese and the elote were mouthwateringly flavorful?! I will definitely coming back again & again. Plus it's awesome bec they've got great service.
