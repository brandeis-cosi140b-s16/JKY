Excellent! The bacon dates in fois gras were amazing! Everything was perfectly balanced. The sumo salad, ramen, mushroom and Korean beef tacos were also great. I wouldn't recommend the tempura cod taco, it kind of fell flat with too much mayo. The decor is fun and fresh, and the overall flavored unique and exciting.
