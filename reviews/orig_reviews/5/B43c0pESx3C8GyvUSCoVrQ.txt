They had me at waffle fries and carne asada. Man they take carne asada fries to a whole other level here. It's not your typical carne asada fries you get at filibertos or any of his cousins shops. The cheese is like gravy, everyone has to try it you'll never want it any other way. And they have decent drink specials. The margaritas aren't pre made because it was super strong the next round. 

The chicken wings are good and their enchiladas are good too. I gotta try their pork tacos next time since there's a huge trophy outside for first place at the taco festival. If you're expecting authentic Mexican than this is not the place but the food is still very good. The chips and salsa weren't all that great. The chips seemed stale and the salsa was watery. 

This place is clean. It's about what you would expect out of a bar/restaurant on the boardwalk, it definitely has that feel when you are inside. Service is good and I bet this place is great at night. Perfect drunk food.  

I would recommend the Carne Asada waffle fries!
