Best new enchiladas anywhere in Arizona, period. You get a dish of deep, cheesy bubbly enchiladas made the way YOU like it, and it is an absolute treat. Wonderful!

Update: after coming here for more than a year, the food is still ALWAYS consistent and delicious. I tell all my friends to come here and no one has been disappointed! Don't be afraid of heat, here: even the hottest salsa, "Habanero Lava", provides an appropriate heat with a pinch of deep, toasty flavor that really adds great dimension to the dish. Get funky wit' it and be sure to mix the fillings! Add cheese with chicken and spinach, or try the short rib with the jack potatoes. Yum!! Just writing this makes me want to jump back in line and order more!
