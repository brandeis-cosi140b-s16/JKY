Can we talk about how good these Tacos were?

I mean, seriously, just for a second?

Ok. Here's the skinny - You go into the Las Palmas Mexican Market, where you pay $2.50 per taco and hope they understand enough of you English to complete the transaction. You then come out to the street and get said taco(s). You then top them at the toppings bar (that was amazing), afterwards you ascend to a higher plane of taco existence.

On a crowded street in Pittsburgh. A sunny Sunday afternoon. Standing around a tree. This was the environment in which I had the best taco I have pretty much ever had. It was perfect though and through. i had one chicken and peppers, the other steak peppers and onions. They were perfect. I will be going back many more times.

I totally took the YELPers' collective advice on this one and was not disappointed. If you like eating amazing tacos on a sidewalk, its 5/5 - would taco again.
