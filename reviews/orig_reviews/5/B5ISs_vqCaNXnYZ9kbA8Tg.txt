Day trip to Phoenix.  We asked a girl at the car rental counter for a good place to eat.  She recommended Comedor Guadalajara. 
The place was packed and it was Tuesday at 9am.
I ordered the Chilaquiles, Machaca and Huevos. 
it was delicious.  Last time I had chilaquiles this good... I was in mexico.  
The beans were delicious...the flour tortilla was huge.  
I definitely will be back!
