My husband and I had stopped by for a drink and appetizer last weekend. I have always heard about it, so this was my first time. The atmosphere was very relax, I wish my husband was not sporting a NASCAR t-shirt. We sat in a comfy booth and with the candles all around I said this is kind of romantic. We had some chips and I got guacamole, we shared a quesdilla and my husband is an enchilada lover so we ordered a platter of those as well. Needless to say our eyes were bigger than our bellies and we took leftovers home. The quesadilla was very good, little bit of a kick but not too spicy. My husband enjoyed his enchiladas and ate the leftovers the next day. The whole drive from work all I could think about was finishing up the guacamole and was not happy when I saw he consumed before I got home! Looks like we'll have to go back!  A must if you live in Ahwatukee and if you are planning a bridal shower or rehersal dinner they have a great back room that would seat 20-25 people very nicely, and its private too which makes it nice! Staff very friendly.
