This is my favorite taco spot in all of Charlotte! Since moving here, I have been on a quest to find amazing tacos, and rock taco hits the spot. I've been here numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. Some personal favorites are the Korean BBQ taco, tequila shrimp, chicken tinga, short rib and mahi mahi taco. I'm big on fish tacos and all their fish is fresh and not greasy after it's fried. Their spicy cilantro fries are delish, and the Mexican street corn is always a winner! Overall, it's a great little taco spot in Montfort that I can't recommend enough!
