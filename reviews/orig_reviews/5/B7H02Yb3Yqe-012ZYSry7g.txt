I've been wanting to try this place out for a while, so I gladly accepted the invite from a friend. We were greeted so kindly by the staff and immediately offered samples after finding out that it was our first time here. That's definitely a plus when you're looking at the menu like how do you even pronounce that?

After adding all of our fixins to our bowls and retrieving our sample of coconut bark for checking in, we headed to the soda station. I wanted to try all of the interesting choices of hot sauces they had. Kind of like what chipotle offers but all island themed. Decided not to since I already had a side of their salad dressing (forgot the name). 

The steak itself was a little sweet, something different for a change which I appreciated. And adding that salad dressing made it even sweeter. Not regretting it at all. 

Staff came over plenty of times to all the patrons in the restaurant to see how everything was going and to offer more assistance if needed. Overall impressed with this establishment and can't wait to get my tongue on some more of that coconut bark!
