I'm from Philadelphia and was in town to visit friends after some business in Vegas.  Every time I come out here, I just have to have the Mexican food, because although we have some good Mexican spots in Philly, it just isn't the same as the Southwest.

The Mission didn't disappoint, it was awesome.  The margaritas were very good, I have a cucumber jalapeno margarita and thought the combination of a little bit of heat with the margarita flavor was great.  Another of my friends had a martini which she said was good and my other buddy had the house margarita, also good.

Let's talk about the food though, the star of the show.  Street corn, with this spicy mayo type sauce on it, wow, awesome.  Grilled to perfection and the sauce was incredible.  For dinner we shared three dishes:  a flat iron steak, very good, tasty, well cooked, mahi mahi tacos, which were friend to perfection, crispy and very tasty and the dish that I would fly back for tonight, the porchetta stuffed with chorizo.  This pork dish was braised for 16 hours, literally falling apart, juicy, tender, tasty...was the best dish I had in Scottsdale.  To top of the meal, we had churros, that came with a milkshake...great way to end the meal.

Overall great experience, our server was awesome, food was on point, drinks were tasty, would definitely go back.  Price was reasonable, three people, appetizer, two drinks a piece and a meal and bill was around $200 total.  Not bad at all.
