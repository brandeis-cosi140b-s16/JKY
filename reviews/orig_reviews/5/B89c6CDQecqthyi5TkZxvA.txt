Fantastic place! The minute I walked in I knew I liked it. With four or five taco stations, people manning each station making your taco to order with fresh ingredients was fantastic fun and an eating delight. Don't hesitate to ask questions they are very accommodating with their explanation of how the meats  are prepared and their tastes.  I really liked watching how cheese is fried onto a tortilla. Everyone working there was top-notch accommodating and friendly; pushing my rating to a full five star.
