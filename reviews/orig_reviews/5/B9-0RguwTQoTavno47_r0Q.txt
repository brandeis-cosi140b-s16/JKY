My parents and I went to Chuy's this past Sunday evening.  My Mom had been wanting to give it a try for a while, my Dad is typically not a picky eater and I had a gift card I had been meaning to use. 

This was my third time to Chuy's. During my first visit, I was there for an event and got to sample all of their salsas and sauces along with a number of cocktails and entrees.  I loved everything that we sampled and was just as in love with how knowledgeable all of the staff was.  Learning about the history of Chuy's, how the kitchen operates and the training that each staff member goes through definitely made an impression.

To my surprise when we arrived Chuy's was featuring their Green Chile Menu.  As soon as the bartender pointed it out, I recalled the staff at the event in June to make sure we came back when they featured these dishes.  Ordering from that menu was given.

My Mom opted for the bartender's recommendation of the Holy Quesadillas (handmade flour tortillas with fajita chicken, caramelized onions, green chile chorizo and jack cheese served with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo).  I chose the Green Chile BBQ Chicken Tacos (crispy mini taco shells (bartender recommended soft tacos so I substituted) filled with roasted chicken and Green Chile BBQ Sauce, spicy coleslaw and cilantro - served with green chile rice and refried beans). My Dad stuck to an "all the time" menu item and got the Southwestern Enchilada (Homemade blue corn tortillas stacked with freshly-roasted, hand-pulled chicken, cheese & Green Chile sauce, topped with a fried egg). I recommend all of these entrees.  All three definitely have a kick to it, so if you don't like spice these may not be your best bet.

Looking forward to the next trip to Chuy's.... oh, and I might add delicious cocktails as always!
