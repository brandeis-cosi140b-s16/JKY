This place is the best authentic Mexican food you can have. I wish they had one like this is California. This place is truly amazing has a Mexican feel to it but very clean and the staff is friendly. Our server Raul was very friendly and helpful. The
Enchiladas are to die for and the Mexican hot chocolate. The price is great for the food you get. I truly recommend this place anytime of day.
