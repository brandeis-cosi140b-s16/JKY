Best expirence you'll ever have in a grocery store, yeah i said it,  someone give this place a low star review with a real profile photo. 


Five starts all the way for the ability to make a Market place a destination location.  People come from all over the valley to enjoy themselves and family to a food adventure. Clean, fun, great music, and a lot of people watching entertainment.   Personally I don't know what most the stuff is inside here but the smells and quality speak for its self.  Take a step out of the box and into Hispanic culture.

I recently ate at the restaurant inside it is definitely worth the try.
