Found this place while wandering inside the Venetian. We asked a few people that worked at the Venetian about a good place to eat and a lot of them recommended this place. We got a table next to the "river" so we were able to watch the people on gondola rides while we dined. They have a great margarita selection and I remember getting the house margarita that had silver patron and it was really good. The food was excellent and the portions were quite big. I guess you get what you pay for over here. I was immediately in a food coma after I finished my dinner here!
