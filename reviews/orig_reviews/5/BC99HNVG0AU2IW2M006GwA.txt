I bought a Groupon.com deal for this restaurant... I am so happy I did!

They had amazing food and it was super cheap! Get the green sauce, your life will be changed forever! :) Staff was very friendly and the food came out quick!

Churros are good here (most places churros are soggy or overcooked), they had the perfect crispyness to them!
