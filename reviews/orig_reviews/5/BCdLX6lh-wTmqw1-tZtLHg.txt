Came here when I was in Scottsdale for Spring Training. We were craving Mexican food and this was the closest place to our hotel so Los Olivos it is. 

The Chips and Salsa were brought to our table as soon as we sat down, chips were very fresh, thin and crispy. They served the chips with 2 canister-type things of salsa. They were both very good but I liked mixing the two, it made for one damn good salsa! My dad was in the drinking mood so he ordered a pitcher of Margaritas and man oh man that was a great way to get our meal started! 

For dinner I ordered the Pollo a la Queso Crema, a flour tortilla filled with chicken, then fried, and lastly topped with a seasoned cream cheese and melted cheeses. This meal was phenomenal!!!! The seasoned cream cheese gave this just enough tanginess along with all the savory aspects the chicken has. Thinking about this, makes my mouth water and wonder if Los Olivos delivers to Northern California?!?!?

Next year when I am back in Scottsdale this will be my first stop as soon as my plane lands and the last place I go before I head to the airport to come home. AWESOME FOOD. Good wait staff. Wouldn't change a thing about this place.
