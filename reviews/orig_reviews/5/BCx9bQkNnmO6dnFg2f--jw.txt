I thought my eating habits were already bad; and thennnnnnnnnnnnnn, I had this place.

I had been seeing pics of their "orange bang" drink on Instagram so wanted to come here to taste it for myself...hoping that it's like a drink back home in Hawaii.

Came here one Friday after Tao. Got my fave tripas tacos and their orange bang. My drunk friends got a plethora of tacos and carne asada fries. Omg --- SO GOOD! Orange band included; it wasn't as frothy and creamy (more watered down) than I would like but, it'll do.

In fact, El Gordo was SO GOOD that we came here the next night after The Bank. lol
This time, we decided to change up the meat and had TRIPAS FRIES ---- oooOOooooOOOooooooooohhhhhhHHhhhhhh. Talk about LIFE CHANGER right there!

It's pretty busy with the afterhours crowd with long lines but, the wait to order and to get your food isn't bad at all.
Note: there are THREE lines in there. Each for different kinds of meats. Make it easier on yourself and have each of your friends (if you have more than 3) stand in each line to order things.


Honestly, felt sick to my stomach with all the bad food I ate that weekend (including El Gordo); but, I'd effing do that again! 

If imma have a heart attack after that food; at least, I know I died a happy woman =)
