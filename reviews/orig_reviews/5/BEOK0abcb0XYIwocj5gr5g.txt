My new favorite spot!   I've been in-search-of a great relaxing CenPho Sunday breakfast spot, ever since Palatte closed (as I may have mentioned in just about every review lately, sorry)... and I think I've finally found it!   Oh my gosh the Huevos Rancheros are lovely - just the right balance of egg, cheese and salsa, with perfect little slices of advocado too.  Yum.   I don't eat meat but the kitchen happily left the chorizo out of the Egg Torta - this is such a yummy egg sammy!   Bowl of granola and yogurt - all fresh and chock full of yummyness!   They'll serve breakfast items all day if you want; and I haven't done it yet but I'm told I could get just your basic eggs cooked anytime I want, too. 

I've also been there quite a few times for other meals.   Absolute crave-memory formed immediately for the "eco friendly" fish tacos... at only $2.50 a piece, I was full with only two of them!   I've also tried the "Elote Callejero" - $5 - ("street corn", I guess?) it's amazing -perfectly charred corn on the cob, lightly coated with white cotija cheese.   Served with a sharp steak knife, carefully slice the kernals off onto the plate and scoop them up - yummy!  The flavors  immediately sent me to this wonderful camping trip, sitting around the fire, pulling food off the outdoor grill... ahhhh! 

Please go !  It's never been very busy when I've been there and this is a gem, we need to keep it in business!
