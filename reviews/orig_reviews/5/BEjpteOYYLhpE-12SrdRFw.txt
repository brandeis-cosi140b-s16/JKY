This place is wonderful from start to finish. When I walked in I was greeted with a warm smile and was told I could sit wherever. I was the only person there so I grabbed a seat in front of the TV. It was 5:58pm and the nice lady quickly grabbed me a beer so I could get the happy hour price that ended at 6pm. How cool is that?

I loved the chips, salsa and guac I was brought. Everything was fresh. I ordered the beef fusion burrito. I'm not a fan of lettuce in burritos (gets too soggy) so I asked for Korean slaw instead and it was wonderful. It kept a nice crunch. All the flavors combined, sweet Korean flavored meat and spice from the rice, was amazing. I couldn't even finish half the burrito. I ordered the kimchi fried rice to-go. I'm way too full to eat it. It looks and smells amazing. That will be my meal tomorrow for sure. Yum!
