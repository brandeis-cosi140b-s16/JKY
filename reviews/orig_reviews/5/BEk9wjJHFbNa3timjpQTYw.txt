Omg this place was soo good! 

I ordered  the salsa and chips with a steak  queasadilla. 

The chips tasted freshly made the salsa had a good roasted flavor.
 
my queasadilla tasted so authentic like someones mexican grandmother was in the kitchen cooking a receipe passed down from generations.

I also ordered  a strawberry magarita that was awesome not too strong but had a kick.
