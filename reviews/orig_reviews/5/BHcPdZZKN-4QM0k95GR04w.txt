Came here on a Friday morning - we literally sat outside waiting for 11 am to hit so we could run inside. We intentionally came to this location so we can see how the new Komex is doing before heading out of town. 

What I'm happy to see is how much bigger the seating area of this Komex is. I always felt a little claustrophobic in the main one. There are still complimentary chips w/ salsa & guac, and the cute orange at the end of your meal. These are both awesome, and I hope they stay forever. 

The real testament was the Chicken Bulgogi Enchiladas ($7.50) - they were as fantastic, if not even better (!) than I've always remembered. :-) Big pieces of perfectly grilled dark meat, a ton of gooey cheese, and the mild sauce that lets me jazz it up with the 4 sauces they put on each table. The service is still friendly and awesome. 

Really wish we had Komex out in CA, I'd probably eat there everyday. Keep expanding, please! :-)
