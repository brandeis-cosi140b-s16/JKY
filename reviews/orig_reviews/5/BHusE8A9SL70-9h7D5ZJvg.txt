This place is a must, when I come to Vegas. Its located inside tge Cosmopolitan hotel. The decore is modern Chinese/ Mexican influences art. 
 It is side by side Mexican and Chinese dishes. Most of the dishes in the menu are meant to share. However, I love the Chilequiles so much, I get my own. They also have a great selection of tacos with traditional mexican flavors, as well as chinese inspired flavors.
I definatley recommend this place
Can't wait to go back
