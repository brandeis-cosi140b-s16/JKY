This is the best Mexican restaurant I have been too. The atmosphere of this place is very family like and loud (if you don't like loud places) with live music. We start off with the oysters. So fresh and amazing! All their food is fresh. I had the fried fish, I enjoyed that, but I love getting the pasta brava, it's a seafood soup, comes really big, has pasta, fish, shrimp, clams, and more, I highly recommend that. Also try the fried ice cream, the best.
