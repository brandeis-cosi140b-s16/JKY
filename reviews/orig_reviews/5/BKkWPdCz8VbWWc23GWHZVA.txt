Mundo is a wonderful, modern take on Mexican food. The decor, dishes, and service (and price) are all a step-up in quality from a normal Mexican joint, yet it is still approachable. Yeah, you might feel a little out of place in a raggy t-shirt and jeans that a mom-n-pop joint would gladly welcome, but it is not overly stylish and cold, it just has a bit of modern flare. I have been to this place about a dozen times and have been satisfied each time. However, it should be noted that about a third of those times I have ordered the sea bass tacos, so menu diversification is not a strong point. But let that be a merit on the side of those lovely tacos that are just oh so hard to say no to. I am a sucker for fish tacos and have tried many. Being a connoisseur, it should be taken with some weight that I throw my vote for these tasty, over-loaded tortillas as the best fish tacos in the Valley. They are brimming with different flavors and a touch of spice. Do up the sea bass tacos and your good belly will thank you!
