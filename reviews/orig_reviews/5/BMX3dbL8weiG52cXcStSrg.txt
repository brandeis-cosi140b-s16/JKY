Stayed at Ballys for the first time and tried out this restaurant since my girls and I got really hungry after checking in. 

We got the the El Jefe's Grande Nacho. This plate was ginormous. There were five of us girls and we didn't even finish half of it! OMG so I would definitely recommend to get this for a party of 7 or 8 people! Overall, it was really good! I love the guacamole, sour cream and we got it half chicken and half beef. So yummy! GO HERE for nachos!
