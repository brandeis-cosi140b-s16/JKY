We have passed by this restaurant a few times and never stopped. We finally stopped in and we were greeted by the son of the owner. He was great! Very knowledgeable and very friendly. He gave us samples of everything to try. The food was great! The service was amazing! I recommend them to anyone who wants great Mexican food! You won't be disappointed.
