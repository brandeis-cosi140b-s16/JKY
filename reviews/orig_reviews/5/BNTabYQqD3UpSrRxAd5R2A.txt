Outstanding food! Great service! Neat place! Live music! Nothing negative to say. We went on a Saturday around 6pm and I think that's just right on time before it get's crowded and you have to wait. The place it's small so big parties may have to be patient and wait. First thing we ordered was the Kuali de Camaron; amazing taste! A combinationof spicy and creamy and all things good, with tastefull chorizo and a perfectly marinated shrimp, the goat cheese just adds perfection to it, all on top of a crispy totopo.Your tastebuds will be very happy; just typig this makes my mouth watery! 
You def have to try the tamarindo agua fresca. It's a must. Doesn't feel artificial at all and you can tell it's freshly made, you get the tamarindo pulp in it and the sweetness to it it's the right amount. 
Our main entree, fish tacos and chicken suiza enchiladas. The tacos are a very good size and they are great option if you're not adventurous to try something different. They're def satisfying, though. The enchiladas: you get 5-6 enchiladas so it's a very generous portion. They have to be the best I've tried. Just look at the pictures. Oh, this place is not you average price, not a 10dll plate but it's totally worth it. Our check was about $65 for two.
