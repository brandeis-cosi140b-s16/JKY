I love when I have an unexpected culinary  which brings a new taste in my life. I'd never heard of Green Dacha Grill & Hookah till today.  
I was very hungry and didn't have much time to walk around.  I used Yelp to find some restaurant where I can get something fast "to go" before work. 
In the area where I stopped Green Dacha Grill & Hookah was the closest restaurant. So my choice was just right!!! Staff was very friendly and helpful. They recommended to try the potato and Pork Steak and the owner suggested the Oliver salad.  I couldn't chose and I decided to get both.  The total price came to $22 and it was a lot of food:) 
They both were right! The steak was just  amazing!!!! Crispy outside and creamy inside with the perfect amount of seasoning. The Oliver salad was great as well... Well done!!! I cannot wait to visit this place again and this time I am going to bring some friends to enjoy with them wonderful food there. I am sure there is a lot of other delicious dishes to discover in Green Dacha Grill & Hookah. 
Normally I don't repeat my restaurants since there are so many to try. But I have already told my friends come back with me!
