When we got there at 5:45, it was packed!  One high top table available with two chairs.  After checking in for 3, the hostess kindly put a chair up to the high top to accommodate us!

Waiter Alex was amazing - food amazing!  Our absolute FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.  Oh, and btw - Sweetheart Margarita was amazing - had to order a second!!
