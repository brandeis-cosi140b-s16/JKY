The service was great! Horchata was awesome and the tacos were also great!  We got some quesadillas and some enchiladas ( different than az mex food) It's not your typical American Mexican food you would find at Manuel's or macayos, it's actually real Mexican food from Mexico City.    I really liked. The tortas are huge here!! 

I don't know is they brought me out 2 tacos by accident or not, but they said I could just have then as a "regalo ". 
The restaurant is kept super clean and the service was awesome.  
As we were leaving one of the waiters gave is a discount coupon to come back! I will be back here again!!
