Wow, thanks to Yelp I would have never stopped into this place.  I never find myself in this area much and would not have gone out of my way unless I read some great reviews on Yelp first.  So I bookmarked it Tuesday and 2 days later here I am.  Man the food was great, I had the number 100 which was recommended by the nice waitress.  It was a red beef tamale, beef taco, cheese enchilada, beans & rice.  My 3 year old son was with me so I got him a chicken taco with rice.  I have to say that the taco was the best i have ever had for authentic Mexican.  It was a homemade taco shell (which is really key) and full of meat, cheese, & lettuce.  Not to mention the hot sauce/salsa was spicy and very flavorful and went perfect on this taco.  I loved the tamale too, it wasn't dry and was packed full of meat, the cheese enchilada had a great red sauce and the cheese over everything was not overwhelming.  The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is...well that and the chips and salsa which were addictive too.  The atmosphere is casual with lots of decorations and pictures, you can tell it has been here a long time but it does not look old and run down.  The service was just awesome which is rare for an authentic Mexican joint, and the owner or manager came over and made my son a dog out of a balloon for him and it kept him busy the whole meal.  Thank you "Mi Patio" and thank you "Yelpers" as well.
