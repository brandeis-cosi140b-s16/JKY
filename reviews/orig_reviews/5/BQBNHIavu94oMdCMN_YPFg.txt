Came here for a quick lunch thinking it would just be ok...  Ordered the Baja Burger with garlic fries and was FLOORED. This burger is the best burger I've probably ever eaten and topped the burger I had at Gordon Ramsay's BURGR, which I had really looked forward too.  Came back a second time for another amazing Baja Burger.
