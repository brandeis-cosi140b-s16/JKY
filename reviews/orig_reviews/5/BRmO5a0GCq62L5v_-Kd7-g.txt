I had a great business lunch today. I really like the new lunch menu. Great choices for a great value. 
I usually just get the cheese enchilada & taco combo but decided to branch out & try the chicken fajitas. Holy moly, the was enough chicken for 3 people & the tortillas were really tasty. They tasted like they were made from scratch.
Heidi was our server and took great care of us. Kept our soda glasses full and never interrupted our conversation. 
Thanks Heidi for a great lunch today.
