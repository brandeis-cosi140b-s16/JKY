By far one of my Favorite Restaurants to eat Vegan at. 
I can't believe I haven't updated my review, the first time I reviewed Gallo I was not even Vegan, it's been a long time. 

The Veggie Tacos are out of this world, I usually order 5 or 6. 
They are pretty small in size but not in flavor. Fresh tiny corn tortillas stuffed with a varying mixture of grilled veggies like, onion, red pepper, green beans, mushroom, corn and spinach topped with guacamole and the best part is they are only $2 each WHAT!! That's right only $2 each. 

It gets better, during Happy Hour which is now 7days a week from 
3pm-6pm, My beloved Veggie Tacos are only.......wait for it.........$1 each!! 

Not to mention the $5 (HH price) made to order Guacamole, loaded with roasted tomatoes, chunks of citrus and spices, (be sure to say No Cheese if you are a Vegan.) It's my professional opinion that this is some of the best Guacamole I've had, try it f you don't believe me.

All this talking has got me craving it, I gotta go, See you at Gallo!
