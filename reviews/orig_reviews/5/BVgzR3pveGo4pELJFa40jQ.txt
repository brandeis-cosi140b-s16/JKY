I'm a server and I have high expectations. We waited a little bit before we were greeted- which was fine I've never been here gave me time to look. We had Anabel she recommended drinks and food. We saw she was really busy but she kept checking on us :) Nachos were great and can't beat $2.50 beers!!! Great I will be back to try more tacos :)
