The place is so much bigger then the other shops. The tacos are amazing! The workers are super nice and sweet. They where are really helpful. The tacos are really good. The place is always super busy. However, I went on a Wednesday around 5 it wasn't that busy the place looked really clean better then the other shops they have.
