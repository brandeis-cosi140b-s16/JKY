Yum!

Finally decided to pull the trigger and try Vida tonight. I have heard mixed reviews but decided to try it myself. We made a reservation on OpenTable and were promptly seated. They had Coronas and Coronaritas on special but I opted for a Blood Orange Margarita because I love blood orange - it was great!

The salsa was really good and they will refill it whenever. I chose to get the Tortilla Pie even though I wasn't quite sure what to expect. It was delicious! Filled with mushrooms, chicken, spinach, and a great tomatillo cream sauce. I also liked the cheese on top. Great that you can choose two sides instead of the typical rice and beans. The grilled corn was yummy!

Also I must say our service was awesome. Our server was super friendly and attentive and gave great advice.

Can't wait to come back.
