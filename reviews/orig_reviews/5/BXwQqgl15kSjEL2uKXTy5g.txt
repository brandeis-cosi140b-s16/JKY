Wonderful place,very friendly, we had a large group and they were very accommodating, even when I couldn't decide where I wanted to sit either outside or inside. Decided on inside and really enjoyed watching the bar tenders take care of everyone. Truly enjoyed the food. Will definitely be coming back.
