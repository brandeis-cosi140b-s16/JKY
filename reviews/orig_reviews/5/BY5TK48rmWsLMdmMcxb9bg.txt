i didn't leave a scrap of my huge order including the chips, salsa and guac! 
(plus to go fried ice cream)
i even had the street corn which i admit is a delicious if not an acquired taste...i will get it again but a second maybe more traditional version would be great. 
i will be back, hungry for more!
