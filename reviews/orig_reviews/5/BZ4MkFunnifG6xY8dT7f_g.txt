I am from New Mexico and the original Si Senor is located in Las Cruces NM, and so when I moved here and found out that the same owners also have a Si Senor in Chandler I was pumped, by the way other restaurants claim they are New Mexican style food they are not they are wannabes.

So if you want true New Mexican food this is the place, price wise it is great you get alot of food for pretty cheap.  You get chips and 4 dips to start, the main course and to top it off sopillas for free.  Anything is great on the menu, i love the burrito plate, tasting it brings me back to new mexico.  Also if you love one of the dips you could buy some to take home, the white chili dip is the best dip!
