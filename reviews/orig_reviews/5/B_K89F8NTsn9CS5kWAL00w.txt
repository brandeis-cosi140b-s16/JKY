I try to stay away from 5 star ratings. So I waited a few days to write this review. First of all re-tasking this old church is by far the greatest idea and lends it's self to thoughts of monks making ales in the basement. Headed here to taste a tapping of Cartel's Tequila ale. That is a hole other review, Let me just say it is one of the most original brews I have had the pleasure to enjoy. They have pork taco's on the happy hour menu at $2.00 each. I ordered one with the brew and I could not tell you what made it so good. So I finished the brew and ordered another taco to go with brew.
This will be my go to for tacos so I suggest you try it when you can still get in.
