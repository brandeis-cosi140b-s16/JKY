The food is good, really good! But I must be truthful and admit that I really only drop in for the tortillas. These are the most amazing tortillas I've ever eaten. I was raised on Mexican food, having lived in the Phoenix area for over 44 years. These are hands down the best tortillas around. Do yourself a favor, stop in and pick up two dozen flour tortillas. A good portion of the first dozen will likely be consumed on your way home. Then don't waste them making burros, rather lay one out on a cookie sheet, spread a sparing quanitity of shredded cheese on one half and fold the bare half over the cheese. Now place under the broiler set to low until a few golden brown blisters appear. Remove and flip the entire  tortilla over and return the the broiler until this side looks like the first. Remove, slice and enjoy a little slice of heaven right there in your very own kitchen... mmmmm... Yep, they're THAT good... Now excuse me, I've gotta make a Carolina's run for a few dozen...
