The guacamole prepared table-side and the pablano pepper stuffed with cheese, spinach and shrimp wrapped in steak was fantastic.  First time there, will definitely come back. Hadn't noticed it before on the corner of Scottsdale and Frank Lloyd Wright.

Service outstanding, chips were crisp and light could eat two bowls and still have room for dinner.  The salsa was fresh, the hot-spicy was outstanding and so perfect.  Atmosphere was authentic, and food is so fresh, the general manger was ordering the next day vegetables as we were coming in.
