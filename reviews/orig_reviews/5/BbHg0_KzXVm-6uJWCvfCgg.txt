Great food. I don't typically eat at chains. I have been searching for a restaurant that has an enchilada sauce close to the sauce my dad used to make me , growing up in Texas. The cheese and onion enchiladas are amazing and the ranchero sauce is so reminiscent of my Dads sauce, it was even derived in Del Rio , Texas , where my Dad was from! Most Mexican restaurants in Charlotte have a brown goopy sauce they put on everything, not here. The boom boom sauce is  also delicious on chips or rice . My husband loved the fish tacos.,I have already been twice! It is a huge restaurant, I hope they are here to stay,
