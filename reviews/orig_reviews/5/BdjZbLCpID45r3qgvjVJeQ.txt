Came here on Halloween night and the place was completely empty which we didn't mind at all. There was Spanish music playing in the background and the lighting was dim. The server was very attentive and recommended some items that weren't on the menu. I ordered the mushroom enchiladas that came with a large portion of rice and beans.  The enchiladas did not disappoint. The rice and beans tasted like they were homemade and not the canned stuff which is always good to see in an authentic Mexican restaurant. I highly recommend this dish for the vegetarians out there. The place is very intimate it's a perfect spot for a romantic dinner. Can't wait to come back soon!
