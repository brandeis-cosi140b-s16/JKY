I love Nacho Daddy! Hands down they have the best margaritas...you've got to try the raspberry mmmm! I always go on Wednesdays for trivia and I really like the new way they are running it. It's a great place to come to relax with some friends, drink, eat and play some trivia. As far as the food is concerned they have everything from salads to nachos to even a vegan/vegetarian  menu. The BBQ chicken nachos and chicken quesadilla are some of my favorites. Service is something I'm very big on and it's always fast and friendly. I always end up in Angie's section and she's great!
