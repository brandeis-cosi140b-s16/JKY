Took my parents to dinner Saturday and it was outstanding. I ordered the duck and it tasted like angels cooked it in heaven. Margarita was clean and delicious and not too sweet. Guac was extra tasty because it had toasted pumpkin seeds. I can't wait to go back. Get a seat inside because it is chilly this time of year.
