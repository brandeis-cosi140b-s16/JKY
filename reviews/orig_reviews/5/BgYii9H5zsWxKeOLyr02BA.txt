I hadn't been here in quite some time and I don't know why.  The food here is great, the prices are cheap, and the atmosphere is greatly improved since they remodeled the place.  

The tamales and tacos are both excellent and I didn't get a chance to try the quesadilla but I couldn't stop staring at the one on the next table.

Taco Tuesday provides $1 street tacos on 4 different varieties (Pastor, carnitas, chicken, and marinated chicken when I was there).
