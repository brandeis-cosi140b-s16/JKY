OMG! Great food and great concept! I would have never found it if a friend didn't tell me about it.  The red chicken quesadilla and the cheese relleno were to die for! I also noticed the poster on the wall from Diners, Drive-ins,and Dives autographed.  He said he would eat there 3 times a week if he lived here! Oh, and you even get a snickerdoodle cookie with your order .:)
