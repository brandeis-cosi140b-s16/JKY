The best Mexican food I've ever had in Vegas and I've been here a decade. Super fresh ingredients kept simple and delicious.  Fast and friendly service and very reasonably priced.  The Mexican Corn and Carne asada or carnitas vampiros were outrageous. The salsa bar?  It's a 10. 

I've seen some crazy complaints on here and I'm super confused. The ordering process is pretty straightforward if you have the ability to look up AND the ability to read. It's like a casino buffet in that you go to separate counters to order different items and then hit the cash register. 

And the atmosphere is fantastic. Super casual,  a lot of seating and yes there was a DJ playing music. So if you're looking for a place to bring your Nana who's hard of hearing or a place to propose to your beloved,  this would not be a good choice. Also if you're the dick who likes to talk on your phone so the rest of the restaurant is forced to listen to a one sided conversation,  blissfully this place is also not for you. 

Perfect place for friends and family to chow down on delicious, affordable grub in a fun atmosphere with great extended hours.  Love me some Taco y Taco!
