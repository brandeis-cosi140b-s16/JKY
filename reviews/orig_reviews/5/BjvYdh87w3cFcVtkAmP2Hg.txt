We stopped at Cantina Laredo our first evening in town.  Our meal was wonderful.  I had the salad with prawns.  My husband had chicken breast stuffed with shrimp.  

We went back for Happy Hour the next day.  The happy hour margaritas were great and the crab cakes were wonderfully presented.  We ordered the apple pie, and loved the way they prepared it at our table.

The third day we went back with relatives. We all had great food.  I had the chicken salad this time.  We loved the way they made guacamole at our table, and were able to exclude the peppers and onions.  We had the chocolate brownie and apple pie for desert prepared at our table.  The meal for 4 was great, and was less than $100 including tip.  

When we go home, we will miss Cnatina Laredo.
