I had a great meal here. It was exactly as I expected. Hole in the wall good food. Those are my favorite places. It wasn't dirty but it wasn't spotless, it was hole in the wall clean. 
I loved how I got to sample everything. So many different tastes to try.  I loved the food. And I loved the cookie. My meal was perfect. I got the chicken that all the reviews rave about. It is like orange chicken with less sweet orange taste and more savory. Soo good. My husband enjoyed his chicken dish  with cilantro but he was wishing he had mine. I gave him a piece but that was all he was getting from me.  

It was packed on a Sunday night with a diverse crowd with the desire for good food as the common ground. 

Highly recommend!
