Is this love? 

Ever since I first stepped into Tacos El Gordo, I couldn't stop thinking of the adobado taco. As soon as I laid eyes on that twirling mountain of spicy pork slowly being marinated by the roasting pineapple up top, I knew this was the one. It was love at first sight. 

I was confused upon walking in though. As an Asian who struggled through Spanish 101, I felt foreign here. Everything seemed so fast-paced and busy. I stood back on the sidelines to evaluate and plan how I was going to tackle my first taco order. 

I stood there, staring at the menu for a few minutes in confusion. Apparently, the counter is divided into sections which serve the particular meat desired. Luckily, English got me through just fine. People behind the counter are friendly and very quick to construct your taco. I wasn't really familiar with any of the meats on the menu, so I just pointed at things that looked good.

"I want two of that one."
"Can I get two of that?"

Apparently, my point and get method served me well. I ended up with two adobado tacos (spicy pork)  and two carne asda tacos. $2 a taco. Not bad.

These tacos were some of the best things I've eaten in a long time. They were so good, in fact,  that I went back up for more. Authentic tacos made with love; my favorite kind. 

Tacos El Gordo, you will see me back very soon. This time, I'll know what I'm doing.
