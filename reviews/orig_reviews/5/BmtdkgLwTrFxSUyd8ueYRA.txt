I absolutely love this restaurant, as has everyone I have ever taken here.  The restaurant and its staff are clean and lacking any pretensions whatsoever.  The food is as fresh as it can get (they have no freezer) and it is local.  I have never had a bad meal there and the fact that many items on the menu are gluten-free is a huge plus for me.

I highly recommend the tacos Chilaquiles Verde.  The grilled vegetables superb.

I work nearby and Gallo Blanco is my new go to spot for meetings with friends, family and clients.  Now, if only there was one in the Ahwatukee/Chandler area.
