Went last night with some friends and had an amazing time.  Wait staff was helpful and very friendly.  Three ordered the sea bass and said it was amazing.  The scallops were divine!  However, the Mexican street corn (off the cob) was the best I've ever had, UNBELIEVABLE!!  Can't wait to visit again!
