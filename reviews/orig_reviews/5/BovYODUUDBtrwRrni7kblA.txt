Inside the MGM, what a great location & awesome venue this place was.  Staff were friendly with an upbeat crowd.  Great time with girlfriends & danced until our feet hurt.  The crowd can really move to all beats.  Wish we would have found this place sooner instead of clubbing at overly-crowded clubs like JET at the Mirage.  Can't wait to replay my experience at this club, maybe eat here next time.
