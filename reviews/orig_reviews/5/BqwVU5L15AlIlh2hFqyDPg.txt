Fun atmosphere,  large portions and delicious salsa choices.  The habanero salsa is only for the brave (and those who freeze their TP).  

This has quickly become our favorite Mexican restaurant since moving to Las Vegas.  You typically end of taking much of your food home because of both the portion size and the attentive nature of their servers who keep the chips and salsa coming. 

Plan ahead Saturdays as every time we have gone there is a 30 minute wait.

They have family style which we are yet to try but it looks like a really good option as well.
