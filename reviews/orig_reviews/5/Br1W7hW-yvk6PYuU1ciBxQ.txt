Hidden gem! I was absolutely blown away by their service. From the outside, it just looks like a plain Mexican food joint next to a truck stop. Then inside decorations,music, and lighting transport you to festive Mexico. 

The table side prepared guac was amazing. The staff are quick and friendly. Chips, drinks, sauces were refilled without havering to flag anyone down. Host was knowledgeable about the menu since there was a large selection of authentic food. 

I've literally passed by this place hundreds of times on Craig. And now I think I've found my new local spot.
