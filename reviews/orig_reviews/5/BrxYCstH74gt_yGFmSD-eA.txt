We found this restaurant because there was a coupon in my Las Vegas Advisor coupon book - and boy was i glad we did! The best meal of our trip, hands down. We came for lunch - we ate the Chicken Enchiladas and the Banana Leaf Wrapped Pork. Hands down, the best Enchiladas I have had. And the guac was yum yum yummy! We sat on the patio, overlooking to pools which was nice. The waiter was friendly and attentive. With the coupon, lunch came out to about $30 total - awesome! I would go again. :)
