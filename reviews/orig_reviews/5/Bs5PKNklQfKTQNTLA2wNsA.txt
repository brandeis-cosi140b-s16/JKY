After reading all the rave reviews I had to check Maize out and finally this past week I had a chance.  I ordered for take-out, knowing that it would probably be packed and when I got there it was indeed filled with people. 

I ordered a handful of items for me and my roommate.  I got a rib-eye taco, a chorizotaco, and a pastor taco.  The rib-eye was thinly sliced and was of good quality.  The grilling gave it a little bit of char and was tasty.  I did feel that it was a bit underseasoned and could have used a touch more salt.  The chorizo taco had your standard ground chorizo, but was delicious.  The pastor taco was the best of the three, great flavor and a touch of heat.  As others have mentioned the tortillas are handmade and they're fantastic.  A bit chewier than your typical store bought tortilla and adds an element of texture to their dishes.  My roommate got a fish taco, a carne asada taco, and a grilled chicken quesadilla.  He seemed to enjoy everything as well, but don't have much commentary beyond that.   

Definitely a place worth visiting regularly, seeing that their prices are low and the food is great.
