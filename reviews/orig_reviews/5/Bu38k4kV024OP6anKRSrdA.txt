Excellent Mexican food, was visiting Vegas from LA and so far found this place to be the best Mexican food in Vegas. The food quality like I said is Excellent. The service and the ambiance is just as good. The tacos are great, can't say I have had better, and living in LA I've had a lot of experience with tacos. I would be surprised if anyone has a problem with the food at this place.
