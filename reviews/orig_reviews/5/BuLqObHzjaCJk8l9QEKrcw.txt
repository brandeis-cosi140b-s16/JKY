Wowzers!  This place is a winner and I can't wait to go back... in fact I think I will be going back tomorrow for lunch!

First off, the woman taking orders was sooo friendly and helpful and it was obvious she enjoyed working there.  While i was waiting for my order She told me about the owners and then talked about their most popular dishes and even brought me a sample of their pork green chili.  Holy crap, that was frickin amazing!  Spicy (which I loved) but seriously great flavor!  I want it so badly now!  Sooo friendly and sweet so huge kudos to her!

Ok now on to the important part... the food!  Yummy!  Homemade tortillas were very obvious since they tasted amazing and super fresh!  The chips were freaking fantastic and were thick but light and crispy. .. again they were obviously homemade.  My carne asada burrito was good but could use some grilled veggies... my bad but I will ask for them next time.  Without a doubt I will be trying their pork with green chili next time since the sample is still dancing in my taste buds.  Ohh guac was superb too... nothing fancy or over the top like some places attempt to do.  

Great prices too!!!
