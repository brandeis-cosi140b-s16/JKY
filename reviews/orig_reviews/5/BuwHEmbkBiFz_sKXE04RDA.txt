I am a huge fan of the Fox restaurants and this one did not disappoint.  The service was amazing, the food was great and by mid-meal, we were discussing the date of a return visit.  Everyone from the hostess, to the bartender, and the servers went over and beyond to make sure we had an amazing experience.  I had the fish tacos and they were delish!  My hubby had three different tacos and enjoyed them all.  We topped it off with sopapillas - also yummy.  Best lunch experience I've had in a while.
