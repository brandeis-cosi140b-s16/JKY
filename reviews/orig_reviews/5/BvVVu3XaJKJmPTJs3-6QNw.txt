I cannot say enough about how WONDERFUL Elmers Tacos is! The burritos, the strips, the cheese crisps, the everything!!! YUMMM! I live in Colorado now and every time we visit we order at LEAST a dozen burritos frozen so that we can enjoy them until our next visit. My whole family goes there, all my friends go there from all around the Country because it is so good! We never miss an opportunity to go there and we take special trips just to go! We try to go at least once every couple months just to get what we can't take with us on the plane! They even have a myspace...  www.myspace.com/elmerstacos  where you can share your memories and possibly find people that you haven't seen for years. 
We used to live in Chandler when I was just a kid and Elmers was on the corner and even though my parents aren't in Chandler anymore and we are in Colorado we still go there. 
Great food, good times, and great memories! Easy on the pocketbook too!
