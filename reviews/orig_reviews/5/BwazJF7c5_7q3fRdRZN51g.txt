yup--this is the best burger you'll ever eat.  It's simply amazing.  I am a purest when it comes to burgers.  I like simple hamburgers without a lot of stuff on it.  This was the exception.  Their basic burger has tiny slices of cucumber, a small amount of sauer kraut and tomatoes.  If someone told me I was having that on my burger, I would never have come here.  Instead, it was unbelievably good.  The fries were perfection and the milk shake was extraordinary.  The place is a dump but the food is the real deal.  To the owner, not only are your burgers the best but good job by having salt, pepper, and squeeze bottles of ketchup and mustard on each table.  I hate the tiny packaged ketchups and mustards that some places have.
