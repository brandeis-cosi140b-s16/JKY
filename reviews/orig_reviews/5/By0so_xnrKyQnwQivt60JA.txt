My boyfriend and I went there for dinner last night. It was simply awesome!! The food is very particular and delicious, a mix between Mexico and Asia...yummy!! the service is even better! I've heard that one of the detriments of this place is the loud  atmosphere...well, in my opinion the noise average is not quiet but not too loud either. It's a place for young people, with two huge tv screens for watching games, so it's perfectly ok a little bit of noise. I recommend the Suzuki sushi, it's special! 
I definitely understand why SumoMaya is in the top 10 best new restaurants in the Valley! We loved it! And we'll be back soon!  :-)
