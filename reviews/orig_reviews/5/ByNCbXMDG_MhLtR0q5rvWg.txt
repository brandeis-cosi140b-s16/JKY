First things I look for when visiting a place are the cleanliness and hospitality. They had both. I liked the owner a lot. He is down-to-earth and genuine. Before my family and I finished our delicious food, he invited me out to shoot hoops (basketball). I might get too fat frequenting this place before I can confidently take him up on the offer. The food is that good and will have you returning in no time. Thank you for great dining!
