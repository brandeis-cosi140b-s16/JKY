So happy I stumbled upon this burger place that offers vegetarian options. It is obviously very popular with a line almost to the door at lunch time. I was thrilled to see the "pulled" veggie sandwich on the menu, a unique and yummy meatless version made with cabbage and green chile. It would only have been better with some veggie meat strips thrown on, but I'm not complaining!  It's awesome that this place goes beyond the norm to create something special for the non-meat eaters. With fries and a Dr. Pepper, I had a very satisfying veg dining experience:) Thanks Paradise Valley Burgers!
