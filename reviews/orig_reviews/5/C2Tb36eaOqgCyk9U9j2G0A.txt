I absolutely loved this place. So much that I ate here twice and got drinks here 4 days in a row.

While this is upscale Mexican food with an amazing and very large tequila menu, I have to urge you to order the Sangria... TDF (to die for)....I craved these every single day I was in town....Although Sangria seems like a very easy drink to make without screwing it up, I'm pretty particular about how it tastes. The Sangria at Diego was made with the perfectly-in my opinion- This is the perfect drink after laying in the sun all day. It's as refreshing as it gets. 

Of course the margaritas are amazing here with lots of various choices, including my favorite Skinny Margarita. So, these aren't to be missed either. 

Like others have said, the chips served with 3 salsas and 3 blended salts are awesome! I had these on more than 1 occasion...

We also ordered the grilled chicken salad and chicken enchilada suiza. Both were very good. The kids meal was actually a great deal at just 7.00 for beef taquitos with rice, beans and churro for dessert...They thought there meal was the best they've had in quite awhile when eating out..

Service was terrific and the ambience was very inviting...

Now, we stayed at the Signature at MGM, so Diego was very convenient and kid friendly. Had we not stayed here we may not have made a trip just to eat here. This is simply because there are just soooo many restaurants to try in Vegas that you can usually just stay at your own hotel and find great places check out...

If you are staying at Signature or MGM (or somewhere nearby), you should definitely check out Diego....
