This place has some of the BEST tacos in Vegas! And I've tried pretty much every place in this town! Tacos El Gordo doesn't even compare!! This is my favorite place to get a fantastic taco! They are incredibly packed with flavor and served traditionally but with a great little twist. I don't know how they do it, but they are consistent every time. 

I always order the tacos Al Pastor with everything on it! Thee most incredible flavor in a taco you will ever try! It doesn't matter how packed the place is late at night, they are quick, consistent, and above all very friendly people! Ask for the grilled veggies too!

What else is there to say...THEE BEST TACO JOINT IN VEGAS!!!
