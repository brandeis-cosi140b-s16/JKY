Best Mayan Cocinita Pibil this side of the Border!! I've been coming to this place since they served tacos on wax paper in plastic baskets, and though the atmosphere has changed, the food has not. Solid menu, great salsa bar, delicious albeit expensive margaritas, and very friendly staff in a cozy, genuine atmosphere. Be prepared to wait -this place is small, with only a handful of tables, but very worth the wait!
