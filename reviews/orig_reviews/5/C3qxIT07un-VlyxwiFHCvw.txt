Thank you, Yelp and fellow Yelpers! My partner and I originally went to eat somewhere else, but didn't feel like waiting in a long line. She was in the mood for a turkey burger, so I opened my trusty Yelp app, searched nearby places and voil√†...Fat Boy! I, too, am kicking myself for not knowing this culinary gem existed sooner.

She got the turkey boyger and a Caesar salad, I got the monster boyger combo and upgraded it to the chencho fries. Hers was well seasoned (she deemed it very yummy) and the salad was simple, not too strong and swimming in dressing like some Caesar salads tend to be. My monster burger was also seasoned well, tasted homemade, and all the toppings were perfectly balanced with the size of the patty and bun.

Those fries...oh how dangerous they could be...were scrumptious! I am a fan of green chilies/salsa, so if you are too, you will love them even more. I opted for the fat fries (steak) instead of the skinny fries, because I am a steak fry fan. They were too hot to eat as soon as they hit the table, so I let them cool down while I munched on my burger. During this time though, they absorbed the juices from the green sauce, so when I did get to dig into them, they were full of the green chili flavor - YUM! They weren't over cheesy, which cheese lovers might view as a bad thing, but I think it was a plus because you get a balanced forkful of goodness in every bite.

The burgers were so good that as soon as we swallowed our last bite, we wanted another one. So, being the gluttons that we are, we ordered another turkey boyger and a pastrami boyger ToGo, looking down on our phone like we were reading a request for food by hungry people at home...as if!

Thank you again, Yelpers. You've made two fat girls happy in our quest for burger satisfaction.
