I only ate three bites of my entree. Must have been terrible right?! Nope. It was the most glorious plate of Mexican goodness I've encountered in as long as I can reliably recall. The chili verde pork was perfection. The chile relleno bursting with flavor. The guacamole, out of this world. 

It was the chorizo queso that did me in before I ever set eyes on my meal. A dish full of cheesy chorizo served with homemade tortillas made about 4 feet from our table. 

Also, the best damn margarita I've ever had in my life.
Did I mention the homemade tortillas?! Still fresh and warm. 

Ask for Nohemi, she rocks!
