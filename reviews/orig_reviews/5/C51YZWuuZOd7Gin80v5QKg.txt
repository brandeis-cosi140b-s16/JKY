Five stars for the chef,
The bartender, five more.
And five for the mezuzah
hanging next to the door.

No, I'm not Jewish
But know of their ways.
So as long as I'm here
I'm out of harm's way.

So I drink your tequila
all one hundred brands
till you ask me to leave
then mezuzah be damned.

I'm now in harm's way
No mezuzah, unsafe.
And what of St. Christopher
who hangs from my neck?
Well where was he
only moments ago
when I stood up too fast 
and back down I did go?

So they pack up my pork and my chips and my bread
to send me off packing where soon I'll find dread
from tequila and pork, and guacamole with berries.
And from this girl at the bar who I now know is married.

Barrio, I dedicate this plagiarized passage to your 120 brands of tequila.

Tequila, scorpion honey, harsh dew of the doglands, essence of Aztec, crema de cacti; tequila, oily and thermal like the sun in solution; tequila, liquid geometry of passion; Tequila, the buzzard god who copulates in mid-air with the
ascending souls of dying virgins; tequila, firebug in the house of good taste; O tequila, savage water of sorcery, what confusion and mischief your sly, rebellious drops do generate!
Without doubt, it was the tequila that made Bernard impatient, that befuddled him into mistaking the UFO conference for the Geo-Therapy Care Fest."

Oh please let me in
I promise to be good.
Not tell dirty jokes
Or make fun of your hood
As I sit at the bar 
and play nice, oh I will.
Eating all of my food
as I lay off the swill.

WIth love.
