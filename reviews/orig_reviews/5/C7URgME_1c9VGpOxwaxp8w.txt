I promised to go here And I did. Went for the fish tacos, my sister got the Flautas we shared and it was absolutely excellent! The flautas were cooked perfectly & complete with top notch guacamole. Rice and Beans rocked & The fish tacos were great too, fish was mouth watering and I loved the way they chopped the cabbage. Oh BTW to the poor dunce with the one one star review, (fish tacos traditionally come with cabbage so your "trip around the world" obviously didnt include Tijuana). Frank was an absolute pleasure and has definitely won the hearts of myself and my family! See you soon!
