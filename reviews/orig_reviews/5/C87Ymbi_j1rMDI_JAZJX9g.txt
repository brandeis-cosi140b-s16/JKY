Been here three times now and loved it every time.  We ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer and were glad we did.  Great chips and the tomatillo/avocado salsa was perfect.  I also really enjoyed the bean dip.  I have ordered both the shrimp and tilapia tostadas and the Chicken Rojo and would highly recommend either.  Service was the right  combination of friendly and efficient and they played good music, old time-y style country (don't worry, for those of you not into country, it wasn't too loud.)  Nice lighting, nice atmosphere.  We think we're pretty lucky to have a place like the Spotted Donkey Cantina in our neighborhood.  Stop by and you will see why.    

PS: They have nice outdoor seating as well.
