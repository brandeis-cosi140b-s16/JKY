WOW, what a hidden gem. I probably walked pass the place a bajillion times and never tried it. Now, I hate myself. lol

Great menu with great employees like our server Jose and the restaurant manager Mark. 

We ordered several items; gaucamole(which was prepared at table side), Fish and Shrimp Tacos, ahhhhmazing!!! i loved the fish tacos more than the shrimp and also ordered the Daily Special which was Chilean Seabass omg to. die. for. So succulent and doused in this yummy sauce omg i want some right now just thinking about it!

Cant wait to go back!!!!
