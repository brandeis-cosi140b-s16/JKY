You know you've found a good deal when you see undergrads lined up out the door.  I don't know how this place turns a profit at the prices they charge.  I got two items, both under $3 each, and they gave free chips and salsa (good and spicy salsa at that) with my order.  Their chorizo is excellent and all the ingredients tasted really fresh.  It's impressive seeing the waitstaff team go to work during rush hour, running with the speed, friendliness and efficiency of a championship McDonalds staff.
