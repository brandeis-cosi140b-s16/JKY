This is the best meal i've had since i've been commuting to AZ from NY.  the food is so so good and the setting is comfortable and warm.

I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this place.  I think it will become a weekly haunt.

I had one of the fish specials and the sauce was just amazing.  Everything I had was great.
