Best Kept Secret in Phoenix! If you havent been here, then you need to give it a try! This should be on your bucket list of things to check out in Phoenix. I have been here several times and the food is never disappointing . I have tried almost every appetizer on the menu ...lots of love in the food. Very dark and romantic in the basement area.
