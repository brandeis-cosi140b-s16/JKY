This place is like no other place in Phoenix! The tacos have a luxurious taste & every single one has a unique flavor. You must try the cherry braised beef one (personal favorite)! You can choose between corn, flour, or lettuce for the wrap- I recommend the corn! The prices are very reasonable & when you buy 3 tacos, you get a free side. The seasonal veggies are flavorful & locally grown. The service is on point too. Every time I come here, I am greeted promptly by an upbeat server that is down to earth & really knows their stuff. You can trust their recommendations, no doubt! And if you don't check out out for the tacos, go just to experience the rad architecture & art because it's an old cathedral.
