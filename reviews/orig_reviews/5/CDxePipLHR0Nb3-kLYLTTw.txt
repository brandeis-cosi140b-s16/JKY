We came back for the fajitas......and weren't disappointed at all!

The fresh chips, salsa and beans, and grilled onions & peppers were delicious and a great way to start the evening.
We both ordered the fajitas for two with pork and chicken.  My pork was packed with flavor, tender, and most amazing.  I'm totally not a fajita kind of guy, but you give me this place as an option; We'll be back!
