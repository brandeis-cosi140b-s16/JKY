Stopped in here for the first time today, and I'll definitely be back. This is authentic Mexican food with a nice enough atmosphere. 

The service was quick and attentive. The guacamole, which they prepared tableside, was hands-down the best I've ever had. Everyone in our party enjoyed their dishes (and the tasty soup they served beforehand).

The only problem I can think of is that I ended up eating way more than I should have.
