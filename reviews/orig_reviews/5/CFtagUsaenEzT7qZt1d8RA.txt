My husband & I ate here yesterday.  The ambience was perfect and the seating was comfortable.  The waiters were very attentive bringing us chips, salsa and bean dip right after we arrived. as well as taking our beverage order.  The food was delicious & you could see that they take great care in the preparation.  We had camarones rancheros & camarones mojo de ajo.  They were excellent sized shrimp & we loved the sauces.  I can't say enough about this restaurant & we have now found our new favorite Mexican restaurant.
