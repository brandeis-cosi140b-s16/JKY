I just had lunch here with my parents about an hour & a half ago and boy let me tell you, this place was great! I was definitely surprised with how nice & attentive the waitress was (That's definitely something you don't get all the time) On to the food, I had the bulgogi plate it was absolutely delicious and the serving was huge! I can't wait to heat up my leftovers for later lol. I'm definitely coming back with friends.
