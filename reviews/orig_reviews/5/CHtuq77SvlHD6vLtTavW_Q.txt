Wow! Here visiting the kiddos in Vegas and used Yelp to find something different to try this trip!!!  REALLY glad we did.  Drove from N Vegas, had to kill an hour before they opened at 11:30....SOOOOO WORTH THE WAIT!  Had the Bulgogi Nachos, wantons, street tacos and Marks Fav noodle dish with all 3 meats....everyone was SOOOO pleased with their selection!!  WE WILL be back, and the kids said they found it so worth the drive !!!  5 new fans for sure!
