One of my all time favorite spots! The basement bar is fantastic. The atmosphere, the service, the music, the fireplace, the comfortable bar stools, the clientele, are all great.

Generally my wife and I have gone here for reverse-HH, $5 wine and $5 small plates. (You cannot miss with the Tri-color roasted pepper bruschetta). Truth be told, we rarely stick to just the HH items. I can't resist the Rokerij salad (a magical wedge...get it with the turkey) and a good G&T (a nice pour and a 4.5 oz bottle of Fever Tree tonic). If HH isn't your thing, go for brunch or....dinner...as we finally did last Sunday. 

A group of six of us came in for dinner, aside from an awesome meal and great service (thank you, Jamie), we lucked into coming in on a day when they were serving green chile stew (spice-tastic) and 1/2 off bottles of wine. What?!?!? It was fantastic. My wife loved the smoked turkey and the green chile pork enchiladas (thanks, Richardson's) and another member of the party claimed the top sirloin was "the best she'd ever had." A great night was had by all. If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out.
