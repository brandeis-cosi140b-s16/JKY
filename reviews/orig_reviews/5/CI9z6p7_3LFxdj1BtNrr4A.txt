Absolutely love this place!  I stopped in on my lunch break yesterday and had the carne asada torta and it was incredible, the service was the best I can recall in a long time and the price was not at all bad.  I went in again for lunch today and ordered the carne asada burrito.  Phrank warned me it wouldn't be as good as the torta, but I beg to differ!  I enjoyed the burrito twice as much and this is now one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas!
