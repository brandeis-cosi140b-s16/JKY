My husband and I absolutely love this place! It's really hard to find a place that has good green chili and this place I believe is the best in Vegas! 

On Tuesday they have taco taco Tuesday and tacos are only a dollar. Not to mention the tacos are delicious.  I typically order the smothered green chili combo burrito with calibacitas. Their margaritas are good here they are 3.00 I also like to order the chips and guacamole which also comes with green and red salsa (green being my favorite). The carne Asada fries are delicious too and will definitely feed two people. Every time I'm here it's busy which is a good thing in my opinion it means the food is good. The good thing is that the staff is friendly and they are quick to serve. My only complaint is they need a bigger place! If u want that New Mexican flavor this is the place to go
