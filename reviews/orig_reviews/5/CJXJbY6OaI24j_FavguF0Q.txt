Food is amazing! Huevos rancheros are to die for! Mini sopes are real good also. Carne asada in them is so tasty. They start you with fideo soup. Which like noodle soup the Mexican version. We have been coming in the morning so not sure if they serve the soup all day. Honestly food here in las Vegas is amazing. So many hidden treasures. This is one of them. Moved from San Diego. California they aren't very many good authentic Mexican places. Not pricey either.
