Quite possibly one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. They never disappoint. We have taken lots of out of town guests there as well as locals who hadn't yet been (where have they been eating?!). 

Can't go wrong with any of their dishes but I love the carne adovado. Super smoky flavored and delicious. Their fish specials are to die for, wine list is killer and the atmosphere is super chill.
