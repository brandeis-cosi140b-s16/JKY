What a great find!  The food was good and the service was outstanding.  Very family friendly.  The entire staff was really attentive and nice. I went with my young nephew and little niece after a couple hours of play time. They were starving. The staff let us order while we waited for a table. They gave the kids a cold drink while waiting. I had the lobster tacos special and the kids each had mac n cheese and quesadilla (they call it crisp). We all three finished our plates. In the 30 minutes we were there. The server came by three times to check on us and to chat. The kids and I agree that we will be coming back.
