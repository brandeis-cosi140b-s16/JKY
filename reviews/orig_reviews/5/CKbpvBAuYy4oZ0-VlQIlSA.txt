My dad and I stopped in for breakfast this morning. We ordered two chorizo burritos and I must say this has to be some of the best I've eaten in a while. From the customer service to the food I would defiantly be back again. The women at the cash register was kind enough to bring us samples of the green and red chili. I would defiantly be back for both!
