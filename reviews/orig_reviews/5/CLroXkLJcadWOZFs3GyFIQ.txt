I saw a review that likened Gadzooks to Chipotle.  As I made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch, I can see how that comparison can be made - in process alone.  

I love that they have limited items on the menu (basically, enchilada, taco, tortilla soup) but then there's an option explosion for what you put in them.  I had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada.  Both were terrific. It was the best bison I've ever had, in fact.  The house-smashed guacamole was delicious also.

I thought I was smart by getting there at 11:30 (avoiding the noon rush) but they were already very busy.  I got the last parking space and the next to last interior table.  Thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way.  There are misters on the patio if that's your only course of action.   

I will certainly come back and I'll bring friends.
