I saw this on yelp a little while ago, and said why not try it today? Well, I'm glad I did. My girlfriend and I got to restaurant and it was very nice and open. We were greeted in a nice and friendly manner and ordered our food. It was a slower day because our food came out really quick. That's not a bad thing. I had the pork tacos and she had the carne Asada tacos. All we could say was WOW! Those are really good tacos! And I mean really good! The carne Asada tacos were really good! We had like three plates of them. Also it was taco Tuesday:) long story short, if you do go, go on Tuesday for the tacos:)
