I love this place.  The atmosphere is fun and casual. If you like spicy food, they have it covered.  There's also non spicy food for the less brave.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests, as there's no other place like Los Dos Molinos.  You have to experience it for yourself.

The kick-ass margaritas are amazing.  I personally, recommend the "sangrita" which is not on their menu.  Carlos makes the best sangritas.  

Los Dos Molinos is family run.  They remember their customers and this personal touch only adds to the dining experience.  I look forward to going back again soon.
