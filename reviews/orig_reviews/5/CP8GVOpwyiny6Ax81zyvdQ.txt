Who would have thought great food could be found inside a gas station!? I've heard many great things about this place so I had to try and it did not disappoint. The food is great, everything is prepared fresh and right in front of you. It's pretty amazing it is all done by one guy who runs the place solo. It takes a bit to place the order/ get it but it's worth it!
