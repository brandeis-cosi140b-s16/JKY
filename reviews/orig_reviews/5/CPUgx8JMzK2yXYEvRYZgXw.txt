I am knocking this place off by funding a location here in effen SF.

I am calling it... El Chino Bandito.  Instead of a mexican panda, I'm using a Chinese iguana with chinkie eyes.  He'll still carry two BIG guns a la John Woo and he'll be standing on a magic carpet cuz there'll be curry dishes too.
