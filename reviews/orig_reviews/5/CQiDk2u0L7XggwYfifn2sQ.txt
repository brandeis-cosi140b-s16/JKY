Love this place!  First time checking in and reviewing (because I'm trying to give back to the Yelp community more), but I've been here a bunch of times.

Start out with the Pig Wings - best BBQ ribs you'll ever have (well, pork ribs - my beef ribs are pretty hard to beat).  Never was much of a 'dipper', but the dipping sauce for the Pig Wings has got me dipping wings in blue cheese now.  

Then, go for the Shrimp Tamales.  Grilled shrimp on sweet corn tamales, smothered in a creamy sauce that's got a citrus-tart kick that contrasts perfectly with the tamale.  Amazing.

Then, finish off with the Key Lime Pie - best Key Lime Pie I've had anywhere!!
