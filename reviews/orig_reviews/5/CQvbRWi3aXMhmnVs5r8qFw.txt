Drove past this place for a while before I decided to try it out for lunch and I wasn't disappointed when I did. The carne asda is fresh, tender and perfectly cooked. The burritos are amazing and the green salsa is like crack. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and great food. New favorite lunch spot!
