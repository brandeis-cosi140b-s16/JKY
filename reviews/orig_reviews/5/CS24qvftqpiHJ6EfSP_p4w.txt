They have VEGAN options! Yay! The vegan nachos were huge and awesome. A bit steep compared to the rest of their non-vegan nachos ($17 versus about $10), but that is usually the case with such things, as vegan cheese and what-not is more expensive than regular. I had a cucumber margarita, which was also delicious. Can't wait to go here again!
