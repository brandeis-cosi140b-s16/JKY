Several months ago we came across a groupon for a restaurant on the strip in Planet Hollywood called Cabo Wabo. It's a Mexican/Cantina type of restaurant with some great dining options.

As we approached my birthday, my boyfriend asked where I wanted to have my birthday dinner. Without hesitation I said," Cabo Wabo!"  Lucky for us, they have another Groupon going for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks!

Last time we went we shared a 3-Choice Fajita. It's a bit pricy for $45 but it is well worth it! Both times we selected the sirloin, chicken and shrimp. Both times they were fantastic!! There is the perfect amount of food for two people where you leave full and satisfied. 

During our first visit I went with a margarita on the rocks which was soooo yummy!! This time we went with the buck of beer, 5/ $21. It was a bit frustrating when we walked in to the hostess and they have a little bar with a sign for $5 beers but when you go inside to dine, they bump those same beers up to $6-7 each. Not that it's much of a difference, it's more of the principal. I guess they try to get the tourist as they leave the resort with the $5 beer? 

Moral of this post: Eat at Cabo Wabo's but get your beer at their bar near the host area.
