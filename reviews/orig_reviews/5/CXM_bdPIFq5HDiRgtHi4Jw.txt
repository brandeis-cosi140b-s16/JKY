Where to even begin.... I guess with the chips?

Their chips and salsa are always good, definitely try the hotter salsa! So yummy. 

The chicken is probably the number one reason why I keep coming back here. Whether it's in the chimichanga or in the escondidos, you will not be disappointed in any dish with the chicken. 

*Try the lunch chimichanga topped with queso instead of ranchera.
