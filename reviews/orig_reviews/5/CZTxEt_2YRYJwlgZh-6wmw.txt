This place was so good I had to come again. The Tomatillo salsa first off is amazing! Bright and citrusy and the chips are obviously not Tostidos. I had the Yucatan Pork and it was just delicious. I hate yams but the yams it came with were amazing and complimented the warm home made corn tortillas wonderfully. A little pork, some yams, and those tortillas was heaven. Love on a plate! The second time I went I had the special which was Short rib tacos with a roasted corn salsa and cheese grits on top of their home made corn tortillas. It was dry rubbed so it had a nice spice to it and just fell apart. Delicious, amazing, delicious, no words can describe how amazing it was. I will def. be going to the Border Grill close to my house in Santa Monica, I am a customer for life. Autumn was amazing. One of the best servers I have had since I was in Vegas though the 2 days I went to Border Grill the hostesses were sub part. One was suppose to bring me a bunch menu and just completely forgot and it wasn't even busy. That aside this place was pretty much flawless!
