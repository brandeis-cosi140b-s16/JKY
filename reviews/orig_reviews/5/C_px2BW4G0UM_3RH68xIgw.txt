Family owned restaurant with very large and safe parking lot. Inside, very clean, friendly staff, and easy to read chalkboard menu. Menu is very simple yet provides lots of choices. Chips, salsa, and food are brought to the table.  The salsa is the bomb!  Spicy, not to chunky, and compliments the lightly salted chips.
