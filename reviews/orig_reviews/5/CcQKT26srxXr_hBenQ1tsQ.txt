Came here with my girlfriend and we loved it. Price, portion, food, and service were all great so it deserves a five star in my eyes. Our server was really attentive and nice and so was the wait staff assisting him. 

Some tips: Unless you're dangerously hungry, an entree should be enough for one person. We got an appetizer, entree and drink, and boy, were we filled. We ended up taking a lot of to-go.

The food itself is awesome though. What we had:

House Margaritas ($3.50 during happy hour from 3pm-7pm. Felt like a generous portion of tequila. I like.)
Juan's Sampler (Tasted great, but wow did it fill us up.)
Combo Beef & Shrimp Fajita for Two. (Great flavor and very tender. Comes with a good portion of sounds. They even light it on fire before they serve it, awesome.)

There are also the complimentary chips and dip. Honestly, one of the best dining experiences I've had. Great place. Our server even mentioned they were planning on increasing the store hours for later nights since they have a full bar and all.
