I love Dos Gringos! Its my favorite place to grab a beer and do body shots at (kidding....kinda)! Super casual, super fun, and super chill. Woo is amazing behind the bar and security does their job well. The deep fried taco is delicious, but what isn't delicious when deep fried? I've only really experienced Dos at night, but the few times I've enjoyed an adult beverage during the day has been fantastic as well. 
They have a DJ on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights spinning dance tunes for the small, but lively "dance floor" area. There is an upstairs, but most of the fun is downstairs so I rarely venture up there.  I'm happy the weather is cooling down cause I really enjoy sitting on the patio without my balls sweating off. Also, they have a giant Jenga available all day and night long while the bean toss is available during the evening but put away when the night approaches. Good times at Dos, woot woot!
