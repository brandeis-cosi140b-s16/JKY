We loved this place!!  The service was spectacular!  The food was unique and delicious. They still had traditional items but some very creative dishes as well including beef tongue.  
Maybe it's because we have been mostly eating on the strip where service is wakeful and the food is way over priced and bland. But this place with its festive decor and very very friendly and attentive staff really made our night! 
We come to Vegas often and plan on making it a regular stop'
