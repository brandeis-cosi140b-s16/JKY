Ono! I was a little skeptical when I first got here because the guys working there weren't "locals", as in they didn't seem like they were from Hawai'i. I mean, the place is called "Braddah's" and they serve Local Hawaiian Style meats in a burrito/taco/bowl, so gotta be from Hawai'i, RIGHT?? Well, it didn't matter who was working there, cooking the food or even opened up this food chain because the food here is legit. How can you go wrong with Kalua pig, Pulehu steak, Huli Huli chicken or grilled fish in a burrito, taco or bowl?? ALL the meat choices are ONO (delicious) and taste like they were cooked in the 808. Go here. Order something. Anything. You won't be disappointed. Garanz. Oh but be careful... There's this stuff they sell there called "Cocnut Bark". HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. Don't say I never told you so!
