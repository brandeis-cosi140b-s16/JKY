I have to give Juan's five stars. Our party of four was immediately seated, and we had immediate service though the place was pretty busy.

They have a number of different Mexican beers on tap, and they had a happy hour going when we were there at about 6:00. 

Chips and salsa came immediately and they were excellent. We had chicken fajitas that can be ordered for two, and they came out with a spectacular sizzling, flaming, presentation.

They were dynamite, and the portions allowed us to take quite a bit home for later.

The server was real and down to earth but very professional, polite, and competent.

I will certainly return the next time we feel like eating Mexican when we go out.
