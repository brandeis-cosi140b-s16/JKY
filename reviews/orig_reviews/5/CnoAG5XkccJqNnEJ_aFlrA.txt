My boyfriend and I just moved to Vegas from San Diego and this place is right down the street from us. We love Mexican food and this has got to be one of the best we have ever had. The prices are incredibly reasonable, the food is so so delicious, and the quick and friendly. My favorite are the Enchiladas with chilli verde sauce. For that matter anything with the verde sauce is good. They have good mole sauce too. Only tiny tiny issue for us is that we are night owls and have tried to go close closing time and it seems as if they close a little earlier than 9 sometimes. Having been worked in food service for ages, and given that they are a family run restaurant I totally understand, but just a heads up for anyone else thinking of going towards closing time.
