I love Abuelos!  My friend from Texas first told us about this place and we were not dissappointed!  We gladly drive to Peoria for our "Mexican fix"!  (We were sad when they closed our nearby Scottsdale location.)  Their salsa is the best and my son loves the extra spicy one.  Chips are always fresh and warm.  My personal favorite is the cheese and chicken enchiladas - with the pappas!  Yum!  My hubby and son love the Pescaro Guerro (Mahi fish dish).  Although we are pretty predictable with our choices, they are always great.  Margaritas are very tasty and there is no skimping on the alcohol.  Highly recommend a visit to this one...
