I love this place. Happy hour could be expanded but it's way decent. The chicken tinga taco-amazing. Beer prices for happy hour-amazing. The service? INCREDIBLE. We went for a celebration in my dads memory and dusty lee was our bartender, Orlando was our waiter/bar back. I can't say enough about how attentive they were and when they realized what we were gathering in memory of they just made it more special. When strangers go out of there way to make your dads memory special....I don't care if it's your job. Thank you.
