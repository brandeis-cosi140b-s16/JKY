'Ono grinds! Mahalo for the great food and service! I had the three tacos with all the fixings and I was very pleased. I have family from the big island coming this way and I'll be sure to bring them by to enjoy the food and atmosphere! 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for that island flavor, a welcoming and professional staff and a place to sit back and relax. 

I'll be back!
