Hot damn, Ja Burritos nails it.  The first standout is the portions. These are large burritos stuffed full of greatness.  Along with the substantial size, they are crafted with the same precision as fine sushi. 

The price is more than fair, and less than $25 filled two of us.  Friendly staff, quick service, and great flavor.

For sure a new spot to become a regular at.
