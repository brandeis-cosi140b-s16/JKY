Mad Mex Oakland -- The only Mad Mex I have ever been.

I really, really like this place. It's the original and by far the best.

I love the food. The carnitas burrito is excellent, and so are the chimichangas. Their appetizers are wonderful, especially the honey chipotle wings (half price during happy hour, fyi). Mad Mex does a nice job with their drinks, as well. They usually have a good draft list, and their margaritas are worth the price (specifically during the early evening and late night happy hours). Their Gobblerito (served only during Thanksgiving season) is a true dreamboat, despite the mediocre cranberry sauce they serve. Finally, half the staff is nice, friendly, and on-point. 

To put it succinctly, this is where my girl and I go out on a Thursday night for a quick bite and a beer for an easy date. We both leave this restaurant in a great frame of mind, every single time. That's about the highest praise I can give.
