They used to have a spot on the strip but even then this location in the hood of Vegas was and is better. Definitely worth the travel this place sports the best tacos in all of Vegas and some of the best al pastor north of ANY border. The rest of the menu boasts a larger variety of deliciousness than most taquerias and you should try all of them. But without a doubt you should always leave room for at least a couple of tacos al pastor. Screw the strip, if you're hungry make the effort to go to this gem in the middle of the desert.
