Incredibly tasty. It was actually a bummer to me how good it was, as I now know where the majority of my spare money will be spent. Five stars! I ordered the Fries Nachos which are essentially carne asada fries.... however you can choose any of the plethora of protein they have to top your fries. added beans, peppers, grilled onions, jalapeno cream cheese(wow), pico de gallo and sour cream. topped with their delicious red & green sauces, i'm upset that i'm not eating it right now. my girlfriend ordered street tacos and her sister got a carne asada burrito. i had to try both - and i was really happy with it all. let me say this one thing - nachos fries are the WAY TO GO, period. I'll be back very soon.
