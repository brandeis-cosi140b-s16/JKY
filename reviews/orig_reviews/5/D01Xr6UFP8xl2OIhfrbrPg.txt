I usually don't take the time to write reviews, so you can bet that this place is special. 

Definitely got a local hispanic vibe when we arrived, but the staff were great.  Everything is made fresh to order right in front of you.  They have 3 main taco stations for each type of taco on the menu. I recommend the adobado and asada tacos.

If want a delicious alternative to nachos, try the adobado fries.  They are piled high in a large to go box with spicy pork, cheese, cream cheese and guacamole sauce.  Very delish!!!   

I grew up on mexican food and this place is as authenticate as it gets!!
