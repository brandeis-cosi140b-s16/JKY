You'll feel like you're at a Hawaiian themed Chipotle, with a few exceptions. I have never had such a warm and friendly greeting from all of the staff. They all seemed sincerely happy that we were there and excited to answer our questions on the menu; also the food was great.

I had the kaula pig salad and the meat was really flavorful and tender, topped off of course with the usual lettuce and veggies that make it a salad. We were offered complementary coconut bark that was so delish, I have been craving more since.

The food is great and the service is top-notch, only critique is that is feels too familiar to caf√© rio, and chipotle. Although based on the friendly atmosphere, I will probably skip those other chains and come here next time.
