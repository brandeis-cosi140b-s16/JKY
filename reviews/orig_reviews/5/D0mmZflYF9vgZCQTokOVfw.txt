I'm shocked to hear that people that rated this all weren't as pleased as my husband and I have been for 10 years now. First off those that feel that they would be charged for a second round of chips, HOW MANY CHIPS CAN YOU EAT?? The helping they bring you for a table of 2 is HUGE! If you have 4 at the table they generally will either refill or they bring 2 orders to begin with. The service has always been prompt and friendly. The prices are very reasonable. The flavor of not only the salsas but the entire menu is outstanding. We searched for a place for about 6 months after moving to Mesa from Chicago that would compare to what we got in Chicago until we were told about Si Senior. We never go anywhere else now. Everyone we have brought there agrees that this is a GREAT MEXICAN Restaurant. Our only complaint is that for about the last year they close at 3pm on Sundays. Take a look around the restaurant while you're dining most of the guests are Mexican this should indicate to you that if the guests appear to be of the same origin as the restaurant, that would indicate to me that the food must be authentic if they are there to eat rather than cooking at home for themselves. I for instance am Greek, I have yet to find a good Greek restaurant here so when I want Greek I stay home and cook!!!
