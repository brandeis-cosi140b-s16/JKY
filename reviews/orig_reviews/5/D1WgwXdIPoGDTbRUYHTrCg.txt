This is our Wednesday night ritual and has been for months now! Every time consistently amazing food from tacos to bowls to fries all so yummy and great service! The bartender even gave us a complimentary taste of a new cocktail he was working on! Can't wait til Wednesday to go back for more! My one year old eats Pastor tacos there and loves them! I would recommend pastor, suadero, and the chicharron tacos, only complaint is the chorizo could be better but with so many other options who cares!
