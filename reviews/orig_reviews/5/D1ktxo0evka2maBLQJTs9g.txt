The happy hour in the bar is amazing. The best deals I ever seen. From 3-4, $3.00 wine and appetizers, certain well drinks and beer too at $3.00, from 4-5, prices go to $4.00, etc. 
Clare is the best bartender since the TV show Cheers. Oh and the Pinot Grigio there is sublime. 
Do NOT NOT miss the bean dip. 
Dinner there is amazing. I had the Mexican Ceasar salad with mesquite grilled shrimp on it and a side of Fideo, the only place in town that has Fideo. They could cook it like crap if they wanted to but they don't
love love love Aunt Chiladas!
