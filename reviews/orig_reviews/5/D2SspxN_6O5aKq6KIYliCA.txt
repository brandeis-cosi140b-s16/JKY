Went there on a whim last night. Mondays are all you can eat Tacos. Started out with the Spinach Con Queso dip and the All You Can Eat Tacos. The first plate was 2 Machaca Tacos with Rice and Beans. Each refill was 2 more Tacos. As a Taco Lover I have to say these where some damn fine tacos. I will be going back. Likely many times.
