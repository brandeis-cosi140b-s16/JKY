Mexican barbecue, as good as it gets!

Two stories, one funny, one stupid:

Tempe Urban Legend: At one point El Pollo Supremo had a fire. The staff of East Side Records (RIP) had to evacuate as well as they shared a wall. As the firefighters arrived, one turned to the other and exclaimed, "We have to save this place! Their chicken is awesome!" Don't you want to eat at a place that the Fire Department is desperate to save?

As I was standing around bullshitting outside a friends shop in Tempe one day, a girl in her early twenties was hanging out as well. The smell of the grills at El Pollo wafted over and she asked, "What is that place? Smells good!" "El Pollo Supremo" I said, "Mexican Barbecue." "Oh I hate Mexican food!" she said...too dumb to listen to her own nose! 

Tip: Don't ever let racism get in the way of eating at a place that your own nose tells you is good!

My favorite part about El Pollo Supremo is that they have chicken or beef. No substitutions is up on the menu, I am not sure what you'd substitute though as there is also a half chicken half beef option. Tortillas, red onions (eerily red), beans and salsa come with your chicken and beef.  Get some Horchata, do it right!
