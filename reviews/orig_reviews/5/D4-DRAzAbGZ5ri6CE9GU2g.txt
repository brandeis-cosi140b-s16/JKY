Every time I go to AZ to visit my grandparents, we come to "The Donkey." And I love it! 

We always sit in the bar (gramps likes to watch the TVs). 

Everything is absolutely delicious. The Silver Coin Margarita is my go-to beverage. The Guacamole is delectable. This trip, I ordered the Donkey Chop Salad -- bacon, avocado, bleu cheese, cilantro, jalapeno ranch, tons and tons of goodies. And they make it right there for you!

The shrimp appetizer is also incredible. (tip: just ask for the aioli and skip the jelly sauce). 

My brother always gets the Mac N' Cheese -- green chiles, bacon, cheese, macaroni, heaven.

I've never had a bad dish here!
