I don't know how it was possible to make a fish taco better than Dan's original joint, but he did it. I doubt I will ever have anything else here...so don't expect a review on anything but the fish tacos...but all I have to say is go here. Get the fish tacos. That's all that needs to be said. Good people. Amazing food. This is the kind of place all you locals need to spread the word about. Wow.
