The best horchata and salsa bar ever!! When you come here, you have to try the horchata, unique and oh so tasty. Also, I'm a salsa lover, I love to make it, I love to indulge in it, salsa is my middle name.  So when I come here, its always the best part of the meal. My favorite is the pecan salsa, so creamy and not what you would expect a pecan salsa to taste like.  The burritos are delicious as well and I've had the tacos too, everything is so eye appealing as well as tasty! I wish the restaurant was a bit roomier, but it stays consistent in the number of people coming in and doesn't get overcrowded. I wouldn't recommend to big parties. But overall I love this place and recommend you try it out.
