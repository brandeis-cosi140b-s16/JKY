So many things are right on with the Roke, food, drink, ambiance (if you're into dark sexy places) and if that's not enough catch bartender Stephen downstaairs, djing off his playlist of choice and it makes for a perfect evening. Get there between 4 and 6 for amazing small plate prices and it's quite possibly a perfect night.
