My new FAVORITE restaurant! Thinking about the food makes my mouth salivate. Being that I was born in southern CA and have had fish tacos that are amazing, these ones have really become my favorite! Tried the mahi tacos and shrimp ceviche...delicious! I can't imagine anything not tasting like heaven from here! Well done!
