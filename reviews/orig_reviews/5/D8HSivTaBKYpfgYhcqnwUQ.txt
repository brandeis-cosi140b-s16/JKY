Randomly came here for lunch and it was SICK.  Not only was the price $, but the beer was a $.  Happy hour here put a smile on my face.  

I would careless if there was a golden taco on the strip.   Give this place some love and you'll never believe it.  One of the best fish tacos. 

I left full and buzz for 20 bucks!
