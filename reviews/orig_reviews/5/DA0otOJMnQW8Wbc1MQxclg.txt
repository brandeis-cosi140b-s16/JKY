I am a HUGE fan of Mexican food. I have lived in Mexico on and off for about three years. I heard about this place and was...unsure...but after my brother in law went, and absolutely raved about it, I figured I would give it a try. 

All I can say is WOW. We were in a party of four, and ordered a few appetizers, and we all kind of communally taste tested our meals. I didn't have a single thing that wasn't fabulous. 

The restaurant itself didn't look like much but this place delivered, and it delivered big. It's pretty far away from where I live, otherwise I'd eat here every week. I've been back numerous times, and referred plenty of people. Of all of the "fusion" food places out there, I haven't found one that beats KoMex.
