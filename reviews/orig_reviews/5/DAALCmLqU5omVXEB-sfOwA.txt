This place is fantastic !  Just moved here from Calif and have been missing our favorite Mexican restaurants . This place is New Mexico style food and we loved it ! You can't compare it to traditional Mexican cuisine . We plan on making regular visits . 

Other reviews say that the service was terrible that was not the case when we went. Visited on a Sat night and was seated quickly. 

The only suggestion would be better lighting outside. Hard to see from the street esp if you've never been there before
