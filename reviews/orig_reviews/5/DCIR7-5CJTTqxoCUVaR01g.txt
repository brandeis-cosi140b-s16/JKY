This place is so yummy and so pretty! I had 2 al pastor tacos with pineapple and my boyfriend had a huge burrito al pastor as well! Both were delicious! We both also had the Mexican style corn on the cob with mayonnaise, cheese, and powdered chili! I had a michelada (cause they also have a bar) very spicy but super good I loved it all! Customer service was superb  all the workers make conversation and are so smiley which makes it seem like they're happy you are there and there's nothing better than that! I recommend this place 100%!
