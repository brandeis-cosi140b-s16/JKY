Wow - what a great find.  The food is amazing.  The salsa bar has an impressive selection of yummy and unique salsas.  The horchata is crazy good with fruit and pecans in it.  It all is bliss for the taste buds.

I got the veggie quesa and it blew me away.  YUMMMM.

I also love the art - I saw that a previous review said there was some controversy about whose art it really was.  All I know is it adds some beautiful imagery.

I wish the music wasn't quite so loud - I liked it but it was just really loud.

Overall, I am just so glad that this place exists!  Very exciting.
