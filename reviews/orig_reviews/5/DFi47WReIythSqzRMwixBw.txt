Food is good and fresh. Prices are reasonable. This is a small local restaurant. I told the waitress that this was my first visit and I was curious about the fish so she gave me a sample and it was delicious. The word "taco" is used but they use soft tortillas. I ordered the fish taco and quesadilla both delicious and fresh.
