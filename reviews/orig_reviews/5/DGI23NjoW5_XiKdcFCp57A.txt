The food and service are spectacular. I would drive to Latin America to experience it all again. The fajitas were spot on, and the margharitas were enormous and delicious. At least 5 different servers asked if I needed anything and did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for my food. Also free chips and salsa. Will come back next time I am in Charlotte
