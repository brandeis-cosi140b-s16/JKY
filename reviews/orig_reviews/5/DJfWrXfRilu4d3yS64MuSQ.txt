Casa Reynoso is habit forming.  We come here at least once a week.  This is the best Mexican food that this native Arizonan has ever had.  Some of our favorites...bean burro enchilada style, beef tacos (I'm always wishing that I ordered two when I'm half way through my first), the gollo burro, machaca beef burro enchilada style, buttery homemade tortillas....Yum!  My only complaint is that they are not open on Mondays and sometimes I get a hankering for Mexican food on Mondays that cannot be satisfied elsewhere.   We love that it is family owned and that they all make us feel like we're part of the family.  Our favorite server is Erica - she had our order memorized after the first time.  The margaritas are tasty and the beer is cold!  The atmosphere is casual, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable.
