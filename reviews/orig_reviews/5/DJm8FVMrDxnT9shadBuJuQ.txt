I enjoyed my lunch immensely.  The owner greeted us and promptly seated our party. Please do not let the fact this place is in the downtown part off the strip stop you from coming. Yes, the establishment is cozy but I was comfortable at a table that had six people seated. The food was authentic and  flavorful.  The waitresses were attentive and on it. This place will be my spot when we come from California.  Oh FYI the salsa is spicy, like make your nose run. But I ate all of it.
