Love El Hefe!! Been frequenting this establishment since it opened. The remodel looks amazing! Love the new patio, a lot more open and inviting. I have always get great service by the waitress and bar staff!  My favorite is Natali the bartender not only  drop dead gorgeous but very attentive and hilarious!
