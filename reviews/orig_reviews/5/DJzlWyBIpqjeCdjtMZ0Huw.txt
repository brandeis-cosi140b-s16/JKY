After a day of meetings and a pretty unappealing boxed lunch, I decided to stop by Baja Bar & Grill for a late lunch/early dinner.

Fortunately for me, it was happy hour.  Three tacos and a beer cost me just under $5.00.  I thought to myself, wow, am I really in Vegas?  

I had a shrimp, a fish and a chicken taco.  All three were nicely done.  I really enjoyed the chicken.  It had a nice crispy consistency.  Very good.

The staff was helpful and friendly and seemed genuinely happy that I was dining with them. 

Stop by, it is worth a visit!
