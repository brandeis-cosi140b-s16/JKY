Saying we come here a lot is an understatement! Everything on the menu is pretty good and and best of all - cheap. My favorites are the breakfast burritos, carne asada fries, rolled tacos and California burrito. Open 24 hours, we end up here after a late night out more times than I care to admit. Service is pretty good and they accommodate most requests.
