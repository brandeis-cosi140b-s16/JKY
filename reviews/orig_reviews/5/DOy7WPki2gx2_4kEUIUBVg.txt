My favorite restaurant in the Valley by far! The rice would have to be my favorite item on the menu. It is different from the regular red rice, but is a white cilantro flavor. The servers are always very nice and attentive. I have yet to have a bad experience at Blanco. I look forward to my next trip down there! 

Favorite Dish: Baja Chicken Tacos with extra rice :)
