The best lengua sopes I've had in town.  Very tender, melts in your mouth and flavorful.  You have to get to see for yourself!  Ideal for a late night cravings with friends.  I hear they normally have lines out the door, but I got lucky on a week day and was able to order & get my food in 20 minutes.
