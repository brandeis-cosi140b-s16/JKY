When you walk into this restaurant you think you're dining in Old Town in Albuquerque New Mexico. The decor looks fabulous from Navajo rugs to Kachina dolls and Indian pottery. I had very high hopes that the food would be great and I was not disappointed. The red and green chili taste just like home as if your mother made it in her kitchen. The portions and the prices are right on point. If you enjoy authentic New Mexican cuisine this is the place to be. You will not be disappointed.
