This place gets a 5 star rating for the atmosphere. The food is also good, but the atmosphere is phenominal and what really makes this restaurant stand out in my opinion. 

This retaurant is a bit of a drive for me, but it is one of my go-to retaurants I bring guests from out of town to so that they can get a taste of the Southwest.
