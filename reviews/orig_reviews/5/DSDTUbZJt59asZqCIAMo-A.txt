On a tear looking for new places to chow in Mad City and came across this gem! Holy Mother of Fuc* was this place awesome! It's about as mexican as the Marlboro Man so don't expect something along the lines of what people call "authentic mexican," but what you can expect is some of the most unique, delicious plates of their kind in this area.

The lady and I started out with some chips and salsa (Complimentary with a Yelp Check-In.) Basket of chips are brought out and you head up to the salsa bar where a variety awaits. Tried a little bit of each and all were excellent with the heat levels at a good medium. 

For dinner, I took in the 3-Taco Platter with rice on the side, no beans as they give me gas! For my taco selection, I had the Green Chile Chicken, Traditional Carne Asada & Chorizo/Black Bean taco. I would suggest ordering two tacos as they are stuffed with goodness and quite filling. Was not a big fan of the Chorizo/Black Bean taco, but that was the lady having me order it ;-). The lady had the chicken enchiladas (3) and has two with red sauce and one with their signature queso. The enchiladas were AMAZING and had me wishing I ordered them myself. Only downside is they were a little jewish with the red sauce and queso on top, so order it with a little extra.

I will soon be back to this place and would recommend this to anyone. The atmosphere is very casual, service was great, and would be great for groups and even families to head out to. Throw back a margarita or a Lone Star Lager to wash it all down! Cheers!
