The BEST place in scottsdale hands down! They have the BEST margaritas! They make their own mix and its NOT sweet! LOVE LOVE it! The bartenders are amazing not to mention there isn't a thing on the menu that we haven't tried that wasn't amazing! Check it out! Great atmospher for scottsdale totally chill, no heels needed!!! Order the Chimayo Chicken its my fav, I could eat it daily!!
