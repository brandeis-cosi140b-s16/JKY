I cannot understand why this place is in the orange with stars when clearly, they should be in the red! I gave five stars for a few reasons. One, the place is beautiful, the hostesses were very nice and the bartender made my drinks just right. Two, when we finally got a table I walked thru checking out the decor which was fab!!! And Three, my meal was freaking fantastic and so was everyone else's meal who dined with me! I saw nothing but clean plates at the end of the meal. I ordered the Fineo Del Mar which was a linguine with seafood in a creamy pinkish sauce which was perfectly spicy! The shrimp and scallop were beautifully grilled and the green onion added perfect flavor. The waiter told me it would be DELISH and he was dead on! Our waiter was really great and really sweet and he kept telling me how good I smelled ;-). So needless to say, I spent a week in Vegas for work and really didn't get to eat out until my last night in town and I am so happy we chose Javier's! What a treat after a rough work week. Hey! You gotta check this place out!
