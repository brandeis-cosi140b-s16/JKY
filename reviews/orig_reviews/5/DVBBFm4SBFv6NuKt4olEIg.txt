This place is amazing ! I've been craving sushi burritos for a long time since I tried the sushiritto food truck in Cali. I think Jaburrito is close maybe even better than sushiritto. 
I ordered the Rockport, it was soooo good. My favorite part about their sushi burritos is their flavor. There is literally so much flavor inside that burrito. I love whatever sauce they put in there. 
Their soft shell crab was delicious, and their spicy tuna was fantastic. I don't like my tuna too spicy, so it was the perfect amount of spice for me. I also like how you can either have seaweed or soy paper for the rap. 
The place is pretty small, and their place was packed and I went in around lunch time.   They have only been open for a few days and it's already this busy, that must mean they are really good. 
It's a very clean place and the customer service is really nice. There isn't a lot of chairs/tables to sit in so hopefully when you you try this place grab a table quick.
But overall it was a great sushi burritos will definetly go back!
