I heart Los Olivos, and in ways that go over and beyond any other Mexican places I've ever been.  Using my strict algorithm for Mexican perfection of chips, salsa, red sauce and margarita, Los Olivos becomes the benchmark by which all other places are compared.  Love it.

CHIPS are crispy, warm and perfectly thin.  I salt them and go to town on the freshly prepared SALSA, an addictive blend of tomatoes and jalapenos mixed with their HOT SALSA of red chiles and scarcely a tomato.  The flavor is just divine, best washed down with a FRESH LIME MARGARITA and plenty of salt.  I could dine on just the following and call it a day, but if I have a group to share with (or a lion's appetite) I will indulge in a cheese crisp.  The tortilla is pliable and perfectly chewy, and the Mary Lou with green chile con carne comes with a toothsome topping of tender beef chunks braised in green chile sauce and topped with melted cheese.  So good!

Our usual favorites are the beef tamales, crispy chicken tacos, enchiladas of all kinds, the chimichangas (my husband eats the SHRIMP CHIMI every single time we go, without fail) and the sumptuously perfect machaca, served dry with the perfect blend of spices and goodness and a tortilla to boot.  Num num num.

The service can be slow and at times lackadaisical - on other nights, the waiters are attentive and blazingly fast.  Just depends who you get.  If you go on an off night for service, definitely don't give up because the food is so darn tasty.  Rather, go when you have time to kill, eat and drink heartily, and know that you are in for a treat of an evening.

Sidenote: Man peddling roses inside the restaurant is persistent - I'm still trying to figure out who he knows or how he's related to the owners in order to be allowed to interfere with the service in the place.  Your guess is as good as mine.
