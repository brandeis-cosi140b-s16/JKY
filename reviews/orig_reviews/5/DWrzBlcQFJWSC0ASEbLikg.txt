My pal and I were looking for a nice dinner to catch up.  It was Dias de Muertos so we thought... Mexican.  This was a great choice.  All the staff was in make up and costumes.  Our server had a great face on!

As we look over the menu, our server was helpful and personable.  He was quick with my margarita and chips.  The salsa bar is a fun way to try new flavors a little at a time.  We both picked the Two Taco Platter.  I tried the Southern Comfort and Traditional Carnitas.  Both were excellent.  The beans and rice that came with the platter were some of the best I have ever had.  My friend had the Classic Carne Asada and one of the chicken ones.  She was in heaven.

We both look forward to trying this restaurant again.
