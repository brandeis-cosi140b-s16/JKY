The Mission is located in an inviting building adjacent to what looks like a Spanish-style church. You walk in through the outdoor patio, which looks cozy with a roaring fireplace. It was a bit too cold for outside, so we opted for indoor seating. It was packed on a Monday night! We put our name down and was told it could be up to an hour wait. The high-top table in the bar looked so inviting that we decided to eat there instead. It gave us a nice view of the place, which had wonderful chandeliers set low over the dining tables. The overall feel was intimate and romantic, with a rockstar edge.

The waitress was phenomenal. Extremely knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about the restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed. Service was excellent.

We ordered their award-winning Blood Orange margarita and the guac to start with. A guy came to the table and made the guac right in front of us. It was a nice touch, but I wish the experience was more interactive. He didn't ask us anything beyond how spicy we wanted it. Other Yelpers rave about the guac. It's okay. :)

For our main dish, we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the pork shoulder. The mahi mahi was perfectly fried. I found myself wanting a sauce of some kind on the tacos. I ended up adding the sweet BBQ sauce from the pork dish. Not the ideal combo, but it worked! The pork dish looked amazing. My companions said the meat was very moist and the self-built tacos were delicious. 

We also ordered the Grilled Street Corn and Black Bean Puree. The street corn is a corn on the cob topped with a rich, spicy, creamy sauce. It was the favorite for all of us. Very, very good. The black bean puree also packed some heat and was tasty. 

We were too full for dessert, and so we waddled away, happy and content.
