Best drive through Mexican food in Scottsdale. I go out of my way for this place.
I used to live down the street from this little gem. I would pass by everyday and assume that it was. A typical burrito stand serving mostly stomach aches and loose stools. One (late) evening on the way home from old town we stopped for something to soak up the bourbon. What happened that night was magical. This would be no one night (burrito) stand.

Fiesta burrito, translation: party of meat, beans, and rice in a blanket, is in fact, amazing.

It servers your very typical Mexican food. Burritos of all sorts, rolled tacos, etc.
The difference is that deist prepares things freshly and they do it well.

I now live ~ 20 miles from fiesta. Thankfully I work one day a week in Tempe and go out of my way on the ride home to stop by.

My favorites:

The breakfast burritos: I usually go for the sausage and egg but they are all great. Simple and made fresh.

The carnitas burrito. My cracking. Juicy pork with pico and guac. Hits the spot every time.

The carne asada burrito. Much better than other places I have found around Phoenix. Spicy and savory.

Rolled tacos. Not sure why these are particularly good here but I think it is the Fuad they put on top.

A few months ago at the 5th mile of the of the of changs half marathon, which ran right down McDowell  I almost stopped running to get a burrito. Only the fact that I had no money and the fear of a burrito belly for the next 8 miles kept me going. Next time I'm stopping.
