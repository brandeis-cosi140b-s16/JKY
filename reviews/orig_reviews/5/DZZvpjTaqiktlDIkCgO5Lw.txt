We had my wife's birthday party here, and had a party of about 30.  Everyone had a great time, and most of all, the Nando's staff made sure we were well taken care of.  Thanks to Gabby, Abby, Kim, and especially Will and Alex for a wonderful evening.  It wasn't our first visit, and certainly won't be our last!
