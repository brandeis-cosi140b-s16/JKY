I freakin' love Tex Tubbs. 

Please note: this is not a Mexican restaurant. There's not much authentically Mexican about their dishes...but they don't claim for there to be. This is Tex-Mex, and damn good Tex-Mex at that.

Get the taco platter, always. My favorites are the Avocado Frito (because avocado is absolutely at its best when fried) and the El Pastor & Pineapple. Their rice & beans are great, but the chipotle sweet potato fries with complementing mayo are where its at.

Go on Tuesdays when they have all-day happy hour. Their margaritas are amaaaaaaaaaazing...and cheap during happy hour!
