In my hometown, there's a food truck called Mogos which is Korean Mexican fusion.  Their burritos are delicious.  When my classmate told me about Komex, I was extremely excited because I don't go back to my hometown often enough to get my Korean Mexican fusion fix.  It's a really small, hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant maybe 6-7 tables at the most.  They don't serve fountain drinks, just bottled beverages. They have a variety of meals on the menu, and I ordered the bulgogi fries & the bulgogi burrito (for my lunch the next day).  The fries were no more than $10 and the burrito was no more than $7, and their portions were HUGE!  Considering how expensive bulgogi usually is, I didn't expect that much meat in my meals, but I am completely satisfied with the portion sizes.  As I mentioned before, I ordered the burrito for my lunch the next day.   I was a little hesitant about that because burritos are not usually good the next day, but I hadn't gone grocery shopping & needed a meal for my 12 hour shift, so I just decided to give it a go.  I'm glad I did, because it was perfectly fine the next day and I really enjoyed my lunch.  

Not only was the food excellent, the service was as well.  I was greeted & served by an older lady (maybe the owner?) and she was very chipper and professional.  Even though the burritos come with pico de gallo, she always asked if I still wanted it inside the burrito or on the side.  I'm definitely coming back!
