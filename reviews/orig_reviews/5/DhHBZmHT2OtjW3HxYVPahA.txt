The food is and always be the star of the show at Rositas Place! The red chile beef consists of large pieces of beef, stewed with red chilies (probably dried) until super tender. Easy enough to smash with your fork while eating. The red chili burro (which is huge!) is somewhere around $8 if memory serves me correctly so I always have them make it enchilada style: slathered in delicious red enchilada sauce and cheese then passed through the oven. Authentic sonoran flavors? YES! 
 The red and green salsa that comes out with the freshly fried corn tortilla chips upon sitting down is also amazing. I swear, if no one were looking I could drink that stuff! Both are an excellent topping for the carne machaca tacos: shredded beef cooked with peppers, onions and tomatoes. 
Another favorite part of Rosita's place for myself is the ambience. I've been eating here for over 15 years, and I don't think it's changed a single bit, probably since its existence. When I walk in, I feel like I'm at home. A couple of the lovely older waitresses have been here for quite some time and they totally remind me of the parents of good friends growing up, and its not suprising to be addressed as "mijo" or "mija"...
Being that I no longer live in the southwest, whenever I'm in Phoenix, Rositas Place in an absolute must stop while in town...without a doubt!
