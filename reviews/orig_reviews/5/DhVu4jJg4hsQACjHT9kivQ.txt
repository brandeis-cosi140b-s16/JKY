What can I say that hasn't been said already?

Excellent food.  The service is actually quite slow- they have not scaled up to keep up with the recent demand.  But this is one of the few places where the quality of the food can truly make up for the sub-par service.

Prices are also rock bottom.

Can't wait for them to open up the Tempe store because Phoenix is a real hike for us from Gilbert.
