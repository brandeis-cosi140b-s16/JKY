I've been to this location a couple of times and each time our waitress/hostess was awesome!  Not sure if there was a different waitress that the other review was for, but we've had the same one each time.  The service was good, they were constantly refilling our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed.  

They have lettuce cups for taco shells if you're looking for a lower carb friendly option.  We've had the skewers, lettuce cup tacos, bulgogi burritos, bulgogi chimichangas, egg and spam musubi, nachos/fries... all have been delish!

Closed on Mondays, but their other location is open.
