MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! 

Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
 The patio area is nice all year round.
