This place has the best customer service I have ever experienced. I have been here several time, and the day after New Years I brought my sister to experience this place for herself. She was very amazed with the attentiveness of the waiter. As soon as we got there we received our chips, salsa and beans. All the food keeps getting refilled at half full, the menu is very good. We had four different plates ordered and all of them were delicious. Even though this place is not on the strip it is worth the extra miles to get good authentic Mexican food. Guacamole is made on the spot with all fresh ingredients, the staff makes you feel at home they are super friendly and make you feel at home. Service is fast. Free refills on traditional Mexican drinks (nonalcoholic, of course).  All these things keep us coming back. The flan does have a strong rum flavor and is too sweet for our taste.
