I am officially a fan of buffet style type brunches where you never leave your seat.   You just order off the menu and the food keeps coming.  I do suggest ordering about two to three items at a time and once delivered it's a good idea to let your waiter know what you would like next as the wait for the food can vary.  Add to that you may not love everything you order so you will have options.   

Bonus points, this brunch comes with bottomless mimosas in a variety of flavors for an additional $8. My boyfriend and I met our tourist friends here for Memorial Day Weekend.  Even with it being a holiday there was no problem getting reservations and no wait.  My favorite mimosa was the pomegranate but I also loved the watermelon and the strawberry.   The food standouts for me were the steak and eggs and the sweet potato pancakes.  The majority of the items I tried were on the spicy side minus the pancakes.  My least favorite dish was the pork belly waffles.  I like pork belly but this was just a piece of flavorless fat.  

If you are a local make sure you sign up with your waiter for the 15% off locals' deal.   We sat inside for this visit but weather permitting I would love to sit outdoors next time.
