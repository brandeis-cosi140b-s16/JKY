I stopped in Friday night for this just reopened gem. The restaurant has been completely remodeled and has great food. This is not your typical rice and beans Mexican cafe. It has a number of terrific dishes both as entrees and small plates. I tried the halibut and it was outstanding. Outstanding chef. Decent wines. Cute interior. This immediately had become my favorite downtown restaurant.
