Restaurants cringe when my family when my family walks in the door... " 2 Adults and 5 Kids". It's just something we are used to as a large family. Juan's... was completely different. 

Welcomed in and we were seated at our table right away. Adrianna took our drink order and brought chips and salsa to the table before our kids could organize a protest. In fact Adrianna was incredible... drinks were always full and the chips never ran out. 

Rolando our server was excellent. He'd visit with the kids and make them laugh. 

Rolando and Adrianna made the dinner experience perfect for our large family.


I almost forgot the food. When the kids received their food... they were quiet. That's how you can gauge how good a meal is. My wife and I ordered fajitas for two and they were delicious. 

Juan's will be a regular dinner choice for our family.
