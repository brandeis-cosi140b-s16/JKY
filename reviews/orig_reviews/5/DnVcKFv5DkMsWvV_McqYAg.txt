This place is a must if you ever find yourself in Scottsdale! Selection is amazing and drinks are prepared flawlessly. Personal favorite is the sampler platter (serve's two with no problem) and a Long Island ice tea. Now add in the patio, misters and a typical 115 degree summer day!!! Heaven has arrived!!!

Now open a place in Denver, CO! We need a amazing Mexican restaurant.
