I love coming here. If I want good fast quality Mexican food, then this is the place. My friend recommended this place to me after telling him that I miss eating tortas from back home. I was sold with my first torta on my first visit.  I come here so often that one of the girls knows me by name now. 

I haven't tried the whole menu yet, but I do love the Paquime torta, carn√© asada torta, and ribeye torta. The cucumber drink is delicious too. I will also buy their deserts; pan dulce, tres leches, choco flan.
