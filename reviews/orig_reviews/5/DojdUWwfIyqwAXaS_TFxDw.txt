These people know what they're doing. It's a great efficient setup where you watch the food being made from scratch. Homemade tortillas always warrant a blue ribbon for me.  Here, they roll the dough and cook them on the huge rotating comal you observe while standing in line. Chicken is grilled fresh in front if you.  If you get a burrito, have it enchilada style.  If it weren't for the calories, I'd eat here every day. Their tres leches is the best Ive ever had, even in higher end restaurants, even though it isn't made on the premises. I have to give this place five stars despite the usual bottleneck at the cashier.
