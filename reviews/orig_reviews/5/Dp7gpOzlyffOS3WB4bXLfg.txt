Excellent food, excellent value. Favorite Mexican place. Order huaraches with chorizo and you won't be disappointed. My bf likes the corn fungus in a fried quesadilla - I'll pass. Chips are various salsas are also delicious and different. The only downside is that it's small and can be crowded, but it's worth the wait!

To the people comparing this place to El Toro and Dos Reales - really? You've go to be kidding. 

The chicken tacos are a little bland, I will say that.
