So good. We are vegetarians so we got the tostada and burrito bowl. The best part of my burrito bowl was the flour tortilla- it was perfectly flaky and crunchy. The rice was tasty and soft, and the vegetables were crunchy and fresh. 

Also, the young woman who served us was very helpful in explaining what we should order because it was our first time. She explained the rice and beans had no animal product, thankfully. Only issue was there was no guacamole, but she explained its because they make everything fresh and the avocados are out of season. 

This place is cheap with great tacos that really fill you up. The seating is comfortable and they have a lot of space. A good amount of booths. Would definitely go back if I could, but I'm from Chicago.
