This was the first place we ate when we arrived to our hotel. It's so pretty and romantic just a little too dim. The waiter was extremely nice and attentive. My fianc√© ordered the carnitas and I ordered arrachera. Both were very tasty and very juicy. The salsa was very good as well. We both ordered a margarita which was just perfect, not too strong nor too light...it was just perfect. It was on the pricy side ($75 for just the two of us) but well worth it!
