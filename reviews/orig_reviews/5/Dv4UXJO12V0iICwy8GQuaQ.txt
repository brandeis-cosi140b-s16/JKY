Although its New Mexican - Mexican food, it's the only decent Mexican food place in Vegas. Growing up in Arizona, we had phenomenal Sonoran Mexican food in the southern part of the state, and good New Mexican food in the mining areas around Globe/Miami.  What we have in Vegas is California or even worse - east coast influenced Mexican food. No heat, no flavor, and so very bland.  The carne adovada at Carlito's could be a little more spicy for my taste, but I'd definitely recommend it to my friends. They do a lot of BBQ events in conjunction with wine/liquor tastings at Lees Liquors. Their green chili tri-tip and ribs are phenomenal. Huge servings and so delicious.
