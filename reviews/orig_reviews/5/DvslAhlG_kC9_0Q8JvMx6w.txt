Great food for the price. Always fresh and delicious. I've gotten rolled tacos and breakfast burritos and tamales and other stuff and everything is yummy. The salsa bar is fresh and gas cucumbers and carrots. Service is nice. They bring you your food if you fine in. It gets pretty busy for lunch but they just added an extra counter. They even have french fries that my little Bruce just loved and made her so happy! And she loved the cute red hi chairs and the Mexican man statue greeting you at the front where you order. They have a big selection. Great location.
