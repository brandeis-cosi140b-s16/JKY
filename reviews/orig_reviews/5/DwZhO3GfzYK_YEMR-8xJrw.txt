A hidden gem amongst the bright lights and big, expensive city of Las Vegas! This was something I've never tried before... Korean/Mexican fusion? What? You've got to be kidding, right? Nope! And I'm glad others reviews helped to steer us to this WONDERFUL place during our stay in Vegas. I could only wish that we had found it sooner! 

I had the fusion tacos -  Bulgogi beef. $1.29 each.... and worth twice that! They state they're small... but, these pack a mega punch! Soft flavorful beef....the sweet cabbage... the tasty corn tortilla... HEAVEN.

My hubby also enjoyed his meal. He went with the 2 meat combo plate. Bulgogi beef and Dak-gogi chicken. He was only sad that he couldn't finish it all! (and we had no place to heat it up and store it for leftovers in our hotel :(  super sad).

And the fried wontons? A definite must! Try them! I mean, they're only a dollar for goodness sakes!

We came out of there content and stuffed! And, our bill only came to around $20 for everything! (including our passion fruit mango iced teas! yum!)

Last, but not least, the people working there were so polite and gave excellent service. Even while visiting at prime lunch time with a packed house!

I WILL be visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas.
