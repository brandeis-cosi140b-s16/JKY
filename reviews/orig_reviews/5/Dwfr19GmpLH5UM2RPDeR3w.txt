Tried out Three Amigos for the first time and I will be returning. I am very big on food and I will say the food here is very authentic. I went on a Friday and was able to score the $5 Migareita special and ordered the Supreme Steak Nachos. Let me tell you that meal could feed a table of 4 and it was only two of us. The nachos were delish and cooked just right and my Migareita was pretty strong. The service was great and pretty fast.
