My family loves Lindo Michoachan.  This location is the closest to our home, so we eat here often.

The restaurant gets very crowded during peak hours....here's a secret of ours....we like to come at 10 am on Sunday morning for an early lunch.  Why?  Because there is nobody there yet and you get seated right away.

Food - during my most recent visit I had the Milanesa Torta.....it was the first time I've tried a Torta at Lindo and it did not disappoint.  The bread was perfect and the milanesa was cooked perfectly.

We also enjoy the fresh chips & salsa that also includes bean dip.  Most mexican restaurants don't give you beans with your chips & salsa, but they do!

The tortillas are made fresh daily....if you don't believe me, you can watch them make it.  They have an action station where a woman prepares fresh tortillas.

Service - The employee to customer ratio is very high so your water glass is never too empty and the chips & salsa will be replenished quickly.

Will I return?  Oh yeah!
