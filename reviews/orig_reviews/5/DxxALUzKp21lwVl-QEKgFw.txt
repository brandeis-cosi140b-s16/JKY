This place is a frequently visited spot for the boys when we make our annual Vegas trip.  Love the margaritas and the staff is always friendly and fun.  Have eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here at various times on different trips, never been disappointed.  It's a great location to sit, drink and watch the people walking the strip.
