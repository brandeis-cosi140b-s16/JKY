We've done a search for years for a replacement Mexican restaurant for our favorite that closed by our house. We now found it but unfortunately it's on the other side of town from us. The food is absolutely fabulous! Not touristy and a great locals restaurant. I wouldn't presume review any one item in particular but you can't go wrong with whatever you order.
