I've always loved eating at Valle Luna because of the food and the specials they have throughout the week. We recently purchased food from them for a party of 40 people. It was an ultimate party platter the cheese enchilada casserole. Their food purchased in bulk is just as good as in the restaurant on a single plate, they don't cut corners and slap something together fast just because it is a large order. We had 40 mini tacos on the platter and each one looked as it had been topped by hand, rather than just handfuls of toppings thrown at the plate.

The price was also very reasonable, if you've ever bought food for large amounts of people from a restaurant, then you'll see a great value in getting the food for less than $5 per person.
