I am a picky eater and very very American when it comes to my food so a good review from me to KoMex you might find hard to believe but I did. 

Well here it is, KoMex is delicious, yummy, flavorful, big portions and great prices. I was introduced a few months ago and have been there alot since finding out about this place. They are a small business with only about 10 tables in the restaurant and the owner will normally be your server. She is the nicest lady and works really hard at her job and her business. 

This might sound strange but I always get the Mexican taco's (steak) and they are the best steak taco's I have ever had. KoMex makes them on those small corn shells and they are perfect. The taco's come in steak, chicken, pork, fish, and shrimp.  They start you off with freshly made tortilla chips and the guacamole is home made and my girlfriend loves it as she almost always eats it all up. 

I feel as if I should mention some of there other menu items that my girl gets all the time, chicken teriyaki=great, Mongolian beef= unbelievably good and the pork taco she claims is better than the steak but I doubt that. 

In the end, we get out of this place with a VERY full belly and still a fat wallet, well as fat as I had it to begin with the wallet that is. 

So here's the deal, if you haven't been here before GO and GO now cause it's just delicious and coming from a picky eater that tough to say.
