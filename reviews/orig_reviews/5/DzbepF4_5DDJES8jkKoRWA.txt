Best Mexican (southwestern, spanish?) food in town.  No competition.

First, I'll adress some common complaints - yes, its in a rough neighborhood.  Could the best Mexican restaurant in Phx be located at Fashion Square or north Scottsdale?  Hell no.  As for parking, ever been to a large metropolis (Phx doesn't count)?  Finding parking is part of the adventure.  There is a wait - wouldn't you be worried if a place this small was half-full?  And yes, the Guacamole is basic, but that's exactly how its supposed to be - if a blender or food processor is involved, its not gonna be good.  

The slow roasted pork is absolutely incredible.  The margarita's are great, and the wife and I even split an expensive shot of tequila (thanks to the big spenders at the next table over for the inspiration).  The Tilapia was also really good.  Finished the night with some amazing churros.  

Great mix of incredible food and ecclectic location/decor.
