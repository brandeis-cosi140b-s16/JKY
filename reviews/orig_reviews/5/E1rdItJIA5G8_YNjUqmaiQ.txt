Oh, Cantina 1511, how you bring out the Mexican fiesta in me!  

I've just had wonderful dining experiences here and I would highly recommend it for a few venues:

1) girls or boys night out
2) laidback, but not too casual first date
3) celebration evening (i.e. birthday, anniversary)

Quick and dirty review:

1) Excellent, tasty food.  You must get the guacamole.  The waiter will make it right at your table with fresh, whole ingredients.
2) Service was outstanding.  Waiter was attentive, but sure not to rush us (even during restuarant week when the wait was over an hour).
3) Prices won't kill your wallet.  You're likely to even leave with leftovers.  Gotta love 2 meals for 1.  
4) Drinks are very yummy.
5) Atmosphere is casual yet not too informal.

My only complaint is that during busy hours parking is very scarce.  Although, if you have a few bucks you can vallet!  

Muy bueno, Cantina!
