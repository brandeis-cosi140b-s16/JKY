For the fist time visiting we definitely will return. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar.  Good happy hour specials. We ate Wahoo fries ( everyone should try those ) Maui bowl (steak) and Cajun chicken burrito. The meat was seasoned very well and cooked just right. Ginny the bar tender was fabulous. Overall a wonderful experience and a new spot to go to and love that its family friendly.
