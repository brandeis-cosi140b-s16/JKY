I really love this market. Although it is a little off my regular route of stops when I go to Pittsburgh, it is worth it.

This is great because 1-It is Mexican products being sold by Mexicans, therefore they are very knowledgeable on what they sell

2-The Carniceria(Butcher) This is the only place around when you can get specialty Mexican butcher items such as Arrachera for making Carne Asada.

3-The taco stand out front is superb!!

4-They have a lot of Mexican soaps and laundry detergents that I miss being able to buy from CA.
