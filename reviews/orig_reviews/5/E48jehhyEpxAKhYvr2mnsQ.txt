The Skinny: There isn't a clear sign outside but just KNOW it's there so find parking even though you don't see the restaurant.  It's located next to Luci's Healthy Marketplace so if you see that, you're good.  They have this amazing Carne Adovada so make sure you don't miss it (this is the sole reason for the 5 stars).

We came here for breakfast on our way through Phoenix thanks to fellow yelpers and it did not disappoint.  We got the Carne Adovada and Eggs, and the New Mexico Burger.  The Carne Adovada was delicious.  There is no other way to describe it.  If you go here, this is what you need to order.  The hash browns were pretty limp and had a weird, bitter taste to them...not sure if it was the oil they were using or what, but I was pretty disappointed...I really wanted hash browns!  The New Mexico burger was pretty good and did not have the kick I expected.  It was a little bland though so I had to use some of the ketchup that came with my fries.  The fries were tasty and crispy so it made up for the hash browns...somewhat.  

So, why the 5 stars?  The Carne Adovada...it's out of this world.
