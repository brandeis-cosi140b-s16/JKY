The husband and I came here on a whim because I had an overwhelming craving for Mexican food. We searched via yelp and luckily were just down the street. 
Juan might be the best server we have ever encountered- he was fun and personable. The food was authentic Mexican, genuine Michoacan flavor! We had the carnitas plate and eggs with shredded pork, highly recommend both dishes and this restaurant. We've decided to make this a tradition and stop here every time we come to Vegas!
