One of the best burritos I have EVER had! 
The Chili Verde Burrito...... you really must try this fabulous creation. It is amazing!!!!
My husband had the breakfast burrito with bacon and he said his was really good.
I will def be back, the problem...... I don't know if I can go and try anything else.....the chili verde burrito was just that good!
