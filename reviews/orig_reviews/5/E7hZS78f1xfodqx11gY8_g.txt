A definite stop when I'm in Vegas. I've been here on my last 3 trips to Vegas and I've never been disappointed. The meat is extremely juicy and tasty and the toppings are delicious!

What we've tried:

- Carne asada fries: Delicious! The carne asada here is insanely tender so these fries are a lot more satisfying than the carne asada fries back home.
- Carne asada tacos: I love that these tacos come with guac and pico de gallo! 
- Lengua tacos: My favorite!!! The lengua is the best meat here! So tender!
- Spicy pork tacos: I like the creamy sauce that compliments the meat. And of course, the meat is tastyyyy. Yum!

Overall, I really love the fact that the sauces are all different for each type of meat that I've tried.

Free refills on drinks which includes horchata :) Mmmm.
