My family and I visited the Taco Haus for the first time tonight. We received a very cheerful welcome from Chef Payton. We love going to Brat's Haus  and were happy to see the great job they have done with this new restaurant.

We enjoyed every little bit of the food we ate  this evening.  The service was fast and the girls were happy and fun. We ate from a ceviches to empanadas. The pork, chicken and beef taco (carnitas) were delicious.  We had the chance to try the shaved kyle salad and I the flavor still in my mouth. Fresh, crunchy, and minty flavored. 

To end the night, we had some flans and tres leches cake. Wow! Loved it!!!
We certainly will be back. We want to try the brunch menu. Can't wait for it.
