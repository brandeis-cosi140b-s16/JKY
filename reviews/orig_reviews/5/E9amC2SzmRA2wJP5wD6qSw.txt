Ate here after the Cubs game. It was around 3:30, so I don't think we ordered from the lunch menu. The sign said New Mexico food, but my experience with New Mexico is much hotter and more volume then flavor.
I had a Mimi Chimi with chicken. It very good and just the correct size. Beans served with it were also very good.
Sarah had a barbecue chicken pizza. It was more then she could eat and was very good.
A pleasant place to eat. Good service and prices were reasonable too. Several others came in who had also been to the game, so this must be a well known place to eat after a game, even though it is not real close to the park.
We will be back soon.
