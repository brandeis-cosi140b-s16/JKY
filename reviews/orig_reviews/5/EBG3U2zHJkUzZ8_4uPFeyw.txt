I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!   This small family run restaurant is OFF THE HOOK SO GOOD!!!!!  The staff is amazing and attentive the food is the best I have had since moving to the valley from California.  I have since been by their twice since my first experience and both times there has been a line down the sidewalk..ensuing this place is definitely one of the best around.  Don't let the outside of the building and really small sign fool you...this is a must try if you are in the mood for authentic Mexican and the homemade chips and salsa rock too.
