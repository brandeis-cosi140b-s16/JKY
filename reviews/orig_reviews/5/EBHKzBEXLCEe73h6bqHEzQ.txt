This is an unbelievable place. Supremely unique, surprisingly high quality, and has the most amazing atmosphere of any restaurant in the area. 

The grotto bar downstairs, which you access through the stone encased stairwell, is the ultimate downstairs bar in Arizona. From the stamped copper bar top, to the fireplaces, and the dark sexy booths in back, it's the perfect place to rendezvous. Upstairs, you'll find an upscale version of what Richardson's was before it burned. Hardwood floors, adobe circular booths, wine cellar walls, another bar, and a beautiful fire make it a very intriguging dining room. They are users of Pandora Radio, so they have all sorts of variety playing over the airwaves. 

The food is fantastic. Some of the highlights are the Rokerij Benedict, an english muffin topped with tenderloin, crab, egg, and jalapeno hollandaise. Try the Surf & Turf if you are truly hungry which is a couple of bacon wrapped shrimp, a crab enchilada, and a tenderloin. Both dishes are incredible, but perhaps not as much as some of the small plates you'll find, like the tenderloin toasts, topped with double creme brie, or the ubiquitous roasted garlic plate. Currently, they are also serving Richardson's menu, and in addition to the dozen or so specials on the chalk board nightly, one could dine here every day for a month and never have a duplicate meal. 

Rokerij is a true neighborhood hangout with unique food, friendly people, and an atmosphere you cannot find elsewhere.
