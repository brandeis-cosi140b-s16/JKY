This place was super yummy.  We got seated immediately and the service was quick and friendly.  I had a veggie burrito that was awesome, and the chips and salsa were great as well.  We sat at a high top in the bar area and could watch the games on as well as enjoy lunch.  Fun atmosphere.  Highly recommend.
