It's delicious! But shhhhh, don't tell anyone else, lol.  Place gets packed real quick but totally worth the wait.  I tried three different things, the fish taco, carne taco, and the hotdog.  Fish was really good, tasted fresh.  Carne had great flavor and the hotdog was yummy with the avocado and bacon toppings.. mmmm..   What really stood out to me was the different sauces they included, everyone had a different flavor that really set off the food.  I don't live right by the place but would differently drive a few more miles  to eat here.
