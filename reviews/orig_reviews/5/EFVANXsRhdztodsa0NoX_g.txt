Best Mexican food in Phoenix hands down! This place is one of my weekly lunch go to's. They have great lunch combination specials and every person gets soup to start. The hot sauce is hot hot hot, but so delicious! It gets pretty busy during the week for lunch, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes if you are going during peak times.
