Their happy hour is to die for! My coworkers and I recently came here after a hard days work and were pleasantly surprised by their amazing service and delicious food. They even have a special on Thursdays for ladies to take a photo at the restaurant and post on their social media page to receive $2 margaritas all night. I'm talking delicious, quality margaritas too and not just $1 frozen thing. Definitely recommend this place!
