If you want street tacos that will remind you of the ones you get south of the border, this is the place to be! Their horchata tastes like home-made as well. My fiance loves the bombero burrito, but beware because it is big and spicy. Every time he orders it, I need to have a bit because it is so tasty but he needs to stop me because I have horrible heart burn problems.
