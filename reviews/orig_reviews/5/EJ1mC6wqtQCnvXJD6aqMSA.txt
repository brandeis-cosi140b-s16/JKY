I've never heard of Wahoo's Tacos before up until I recently visited my boyfriend's house deep in Henderson. Sadly, I haven't tried them out until I went to Huntington Beach, LA but I am extremely glad that I did! Ever since that day on the beach, I've gone to Wahoo's Tacos at least 2-3 times a week because it is just amazing! I'm a foodie so whenever I try/like something, I get addicted very quick! 

I would highly recommend to stop by! $2 Original Tacos are my absolute favorite! Nothing too fancy or too simple, but it's entirely worth it. They come with lime, pico de gallo and an extra tortilla. Makes everything worth while including the (unfortunately) long wait times! If you're looking for a splash of that Cali lifestyle, Wahoo's will give it to you ;)
