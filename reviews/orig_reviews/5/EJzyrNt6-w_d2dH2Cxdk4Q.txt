Everytime I go to Verde I have a great experience.  The breakfast/brunch is fantastic.  Prices are reasonable.  Check out the jalapeno cream cheese/french toast (I'm not sure what it is actually called, but it is freaking phenomenal.  You'll thank me later.  (Well, just thank them actually.)

The owners are always there and walking around talking to people.  The tequila is out of this world.  Great service, great food. Nothing in Pittsburgh compares.
