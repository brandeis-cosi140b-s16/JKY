Yum! Chipotle who? Same style but so much better! Great cilantro vinaigrette for the salad. Fire grilled chicken was so good! Lots of drinks to choose from (horchata, mint lemonade, etc). They lined the salad with a tortilla. Good, fresh REAL guac. Go early to avoid the lunch rush--they get a pretty decent crowd.
