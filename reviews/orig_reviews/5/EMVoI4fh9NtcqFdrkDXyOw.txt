Super amazing food. I'm visiting from new mexico and would never have tried this place just cause I can get the same food back home, but the quality and quantity is AMAZING! I will definitely come back here when I'm visiting vegas again. I would recomend the encheladas or faitas. Drinks were also very strong and good tasting. 
Would recomend the waiter Adan.

The manager mark was the most helpful in our visit here, only making the experience that much greater. 
Thanks for the experience
