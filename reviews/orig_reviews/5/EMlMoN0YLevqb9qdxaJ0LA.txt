This restaurant is just down the street from our condo, but we had never tried it until tonight.  We were greeted warmly when we came in, and told to sit where we liked.  The service was very good, as were the recommendations from our server.  We had the chips and guacamole/salsa for $6 to start, and then I had the wild mushroom quesadilla ($10), while my husband had a combination of 3 soft shell tacos (short rib and another kind, $8).  Both meals were delicious, and the quesadilla was so huge, I'll be having the rest for lunch tomorrow!
The Arizona Cardinals game was on, which made for a lively atmosphere.  
Beer was very reasonably priced, and we'd be drinking if we hadn't come from jogging! 
We will be back!
