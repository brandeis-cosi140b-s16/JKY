Need hotter sauce, but otherwise can't complain! Came here with my parents for my first time in Phoenix. It was mid-afternoon, not to crowded, and we were seated quickly. The waitress was very amiable and took our orders with ease. everything came out quickly, and it was all delicious! I got a chimichanga, and my parents both ordered burritos. Would definitely recommend and plan to return!
