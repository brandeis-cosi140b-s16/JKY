It has been a while since we ventured this way and we forgot how good the food really is.  The menu is excellent, the smells coming from he kitchen are rich and mouth watering.  They are very busy tonight but we manage to get a seat.  

We order a couple of appetizers, Mexican Shrimp Cocktail, large chunks of crab, shrimp, lime, avocado, and tostaditas, very good, and the Volcanoes tostaditas, 3 mini tostades with yummy melted cheese, pico de gallo and creme.  Both very good.

For my main entree, I couldn't resist getting the El Molcajete (fajitas), grilled carne asada, tiger prawns,  grilled nopales (cactus) and again some yummy melted cheese served in the volcano bowl.  Love this, a must try.

Service was great, food was delicious, just wish she'd open a location on the West side!
