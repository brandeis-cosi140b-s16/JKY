Great place! Finished my Vegas stay by stopping by and having some good breakfast!  Coffee was great- took some to go. 
I was in a rush to make it to the airport on time & was worried that  the server and food was going to take long- but food was quick and exceptional service by Christina-friendly and quick made sure to check up to see if anything else was needed. I will definitely be returning on my next Vegas stay!
