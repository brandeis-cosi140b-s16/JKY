Looove Burrito Shack! The owners and the food are awesome! The portion sizes are filling and the ingredients always taste fresh. A great Mom and Pop place that I have visited several times. I was put off the very first time I visited because it literally looks like a shack (that is intentional!) but once I tasted the food, I was hooked! I love that the owners are flexible with my crazy order of a vegetarian burrito with no real veggies--only rice, cheese, pico de gallo and guacamole. It's weird to a lot of people, but tastes so very good! I love going to this place and recommend it to others. Yum! : )
