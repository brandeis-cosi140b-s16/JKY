Excellent Breakfast.  If you are looking for something fresh and exciting for breakfast check them out.  We had excellent service from Adam.  It was our first time in for breakfast so we sampled several menu items and shared.  The butter sauce for the pancakes is liquid crack!  We were also given a sample of their smoothie.   It made my hubby a yogurt lover.   The gravy on the biscuits n gravy was not heavy like everywhere else.  The chirozo gives it a yunique touch.
