We wanted to try something new, so I yelped Mexican and Las Cazuelas came up first.  I was skeptical because I had never heard of it, but we decided to give it a whirl.  We are sold after one visit.  This place is a small, family owned hidden gem, nestled in between all the chain restaurants on Eastern!  I had chicken enchiladas de salsa verde and my husband had the taco oriental & chanclas (sliced bread rolls, stuffed with shredded chicken, avocado, onion, drizzled with chorizo sauce).  This was fun to try something new and the menu items are unique.  Everything was delicious and they serve complimentary chips and salsa.  Even the salsa was good, and different from any other salsa I have had before {which is a lot of types since chips and salsa is a staple food group for me}!  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices, this is your place.
