Santos Lucha Libre is estupendo!!  This is another little gem hidden in the central northern Phoenix area.  It's not far from another little gem, Los Reyes De La Torta.  Santos Lucha Libre is a very unique dinning experience with delicious food and friendly service.  

First impression ~ "Nacho Libre" mixed with Chipotle, but I was wrong on both counts!  This place is decorated with loads or lucha libre mask, costumes and really neat artwork on the walls.  It's an "eye - spy" fantasy room that is done very well and yet entertaining.  

Their food is served similar to how they do things at the Chipotle but they offer a much larger selection and it taste much better.  They offer asada, pastor, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas and a few other proteins you can have assembled into street tacos, burrito and on a salad.  I had the 5 street tacos with a asada, pollo, carnitas, pastor and barbacoa, some spicy and some normal.  You can choose spicy on I think everything, but the level of heat is pushing my limit so I mixed it up.  everything tasted great!  My son had a burrito and it was packed with asada and it must have weighed 16 oz. I bet.  It was huge!  He loved it but he couldn't finish it.  

I've recommended this place to so many people and everyone that has tried it keeps asking me; "when are we going back?!"  I'm looking forward to going back again soon.  I hope to see you there!
