There's this new way of doing small business in Vegas, and Nacho Daddy is the prime example. The management just gets it. Quality food & drink, fair prices and friendly staff - everyone says it, but very few nail it. Even a great kids menu! I'd recommend it to anyone. Oh - and try the buffalo wing nachos.
