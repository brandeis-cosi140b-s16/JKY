So good! It's hard to find good mexican food here in Arizona, I'm from California where it runs rampant, but they have delicious food. The staff is really helpful and nice, and don't harass you. The food is always quick, I proabably eat here 2-3 times a month. I moved here a year ago and they had the best "chicken en mole" enchilada which was seasonal, I can't wait for them to bring it back!. Outdoor seating in the ARizona center, I love to grab a beer and quick lunch then head over to the movies on my days off. I definately recommend it!
