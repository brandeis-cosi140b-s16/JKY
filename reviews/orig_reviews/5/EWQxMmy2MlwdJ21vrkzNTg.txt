Love California style Mexican food and this place deliveries. Got the carne asada  burrito with the green salsa and was great. Did not have to wait long to get my food. Was lunch time on a Saturday. The only thing that I would like to see on the menu is carne asada fries and I would probably be once a week. Thanks for the great lunch.
