Rokjeri is the type of place you go when you want a good meal, great atmosphere and feel like you are in a different place in the world.

The food is incredible. My husband tried their porterhouse steak with an incredible holindase (spelling error, I know) sauce. When I tried a bite, it was the first time I ever understood how a steak can melt in your mouth. Like butter. Ugh, just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

The upstairs is dark, sexy, open and smells delicious. The downstairs has a few tables, few booths, a huge fireplace and a bar. You can't go wrong sitting either place.

You should probably make reservations if you plan on stopping by, as it's always busy!
