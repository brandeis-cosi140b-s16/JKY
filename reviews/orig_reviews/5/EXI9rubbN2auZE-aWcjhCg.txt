We came here for a nice lunch during a weekend trip from Chicago. We sat on the beautiful back patio. We ordered tableside guacamole as well as the pork and fish tacos. They were great!! Our server was Angel, who was so kind and attentive. He gave us great recommendations on both margarita and food choices. We couldn't have asked for better service. By the far the best Mexican food we've had in Arizona! Angel also raved about their brunches where they smoke a whole pig and everyone can make their own tacos - which sounded great. Would definitely come back for brunch, lunch, or dinner!
