Super good Mexican food. And the drinks were really different. (In a good way!)

My mum and I were really hungry and wanted to eat before going to see Bodies The Exhibition in the Luxor (we'd seen Bodies before in Seattle... it's NOT "banned everywhere else"). We split the combo fajitas (tender grilled chicken, flavourful steak strips, and large, well-seasoned prawns). I ordered a Mango Ginger Margarita and my mum ordered the Spiced Apple Margarita. Both drinks were excellent and just the right amount of boozie.
They only gave us 3 tortillas to start with (even though we mentioned that we... the TWO of us... were splitting them) and it took a while to get anyone's attention to get some more. But the food quality was very good and the portion size was great for 2. We both were full and no leftovers. I liked the homemade tortilla chips, too.
