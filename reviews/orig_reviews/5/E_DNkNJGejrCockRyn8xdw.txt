Yes, this mostly lived up to the hype. I must say that unlike many people in these reviews, I actually preferred the red over the green chile. I ordered one of each. Got the red enchilada style, the green au naturel. 

If you're in central Phoenix and craving a burrito, this is the place to go. I can see how it would get really uncomfortable in the summertime, though; there's no indoor seating.
