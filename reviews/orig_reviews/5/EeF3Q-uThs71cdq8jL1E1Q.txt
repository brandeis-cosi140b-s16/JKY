Great food! The guacamole was soo good. The pickled peppers were amazing! Great service!

The only problem I had was the protestors outside showing us how there duck was prepared. There were  about 15 protestors handing out pamphlets on the cruelty to ducks in the preparation of one of their signature dinners. I was appalled by the brochure I was handed after my meal. Thank god I don't eat duck or participate in the manner that these animals are treated.  

I would recommend The Mission. But maybe they should re think the duck course prepared. It almost ruined my meal thinking about it. No animal deserves to be tortured alive for human consumption.  Back to vegetarianism for me....
