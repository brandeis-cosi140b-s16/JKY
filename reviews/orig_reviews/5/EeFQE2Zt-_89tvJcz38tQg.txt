Always great, never a miss! Had drinks and an appetizer last night meeting up with a friend. Our server was super nice and he didn't seem to care we just wanted to chat and not really eat. He even recommended mixing the kiwi and strawberry margarita together, it was a great choice!!! We ended up getting dinner to go and when I got home it was packed up neatly and just as yummy!!!
