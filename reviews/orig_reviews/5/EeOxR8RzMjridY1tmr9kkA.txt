We had dinner here last night and the wait was 45 minutes for a table.  We went to the bar to wait and a nice couple was just finishing and gave us there table upon leaving - score! 

El Encanto's dirty little secret is their frozen margaritas.  Nick was our waiter and the bartender, said the machine was malfunctioning but would do his best to get us our drinks.  Well, drinks magically appeared and they were delicious as usual.  Dinner was exceptional, I had the Fajitas and my boyfriend had the Carne Asada Relleno. Wow, both dishes, the steak was cooked to perfection and so tender, you barely had to chew and cutting it was like butter. I want to give a shout out to Nick - even though he was busy both behind the bar and waiting on tables, he was very attentive each and every time he walked by the table, he asked if we needed anything and made sure that we were ok. It was a very nice experience overall.
