We have been waiting for this place to open for months. The service has been a little slow, but everyone is trying to get used to the new system. The food has been great, not a complicated menu, very simple. The parking isn't the greatest, but we live close so we usually walk. The owners are extremely nice and friendly and they have a great following.
We are actually going there again tonight.
