This place is amazing! The staff who attended us at this location here (Josh &the GM David) were so helpful in introducing the concept they were very attentive and genuinely interested in sparking up a conversation with us. Thanks guys!!! 

I had the huli huli chicken burrito, topped it off with the essentials and threw some of their delicious pineapple mild sauce on top. This was our first time here but definitely not our last.
