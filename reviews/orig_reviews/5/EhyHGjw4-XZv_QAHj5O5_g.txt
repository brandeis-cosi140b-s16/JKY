There is no reason to eat at any other restaurant in Indian Trail. La Unica is simply the best. 

The service is great, the newly remodeled interior is roomy, well lit and just all-around pleasant. 

The real gem is of course the food. In probably close to 100 times eating here over the past 6 years I've never had anything I didn't like. If you are in the mood for something a little different try either the Pollo a la Crema or the lunch chicken soup. 

The only minor quibble I have is the flour tortillas. They are just Mission tortillas. Fresh and always warm of course but nothing special. But short of making tortillas themselves I'm not sure what they can do, it's not like there is a tortilla bakery in the area.
