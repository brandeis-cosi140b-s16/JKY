What is the best way to get an Asian to eat Mexican food? Make it fusion with Korean. After a few years of working in a Mexican and then a Southwestern restaurant, Mexican is usually lower on my list of favorite cuisines. 

With Komex, they definitely change that mindset. For $2, you will get a taco that is stuffed full of meat, veggies, and ask for kimchi. If you are trying to go lighter, the option of a lettuce wrap instead of tortillas can be done. The bulgogi is my favorite to put into or onto anything. Tacos... BULGOGI!... Nachos... BULGOGI! It does not matter, bulgogi needs to go on it.
