Was wondering why this place didn't have a higher overall score, but I see that it's due to just a couple low reviews skewing it down. 

My experience was great. Before even knowing about this new joint downtown, I had Mexican corn on the cob from their booth at the Life is Beautiful Festival. Delish!! I planned to go back for another one in the second day of the festival, but my friend and I stumbled across the new Nacho Daddy restaurant just off Fremont St. before we entered the festival. We decided to eat lunch there instead, and it ended up being a great decision.

I had the street tacos, one of each kind (steak, chicken and pork) and the Mexican corn. The corn was just as good as I remembered, and the street tacos were amazing. My friend had the Nacho Average Burger Nachos and really enjoyed them. I also had the raspberry margarita, which is made with their agave nectar and homemade sweet and sour. It was very yummy!

The restaurant/bar had opened just a few weeks before. The decor and atmosphere are really nice, with a large bar separate from the dining area. The service was great too; all the waitresses were really friendly and attentive. Although I don't frequent downtown Vegas much, I'd totally go back to Nacho Daddy if I'm there again.
