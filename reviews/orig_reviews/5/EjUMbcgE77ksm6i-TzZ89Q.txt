Fish tacos and the Oaxaca hotdogs are *amazing*. As a slight warning, the strip mall it's located in is shady as hell and occasionally some weird (and smelly) customers will make the experience take a turn for the strange. But the bottom line is, the tacos are amazing and these guys deserve all the attention they can get. Shout out to the bald dude with the beard!
