This is their first attempt at Breakfast/Brunch. They did a great job in being engaged with their customers. They forgot to update their business hours on yelp and it shows "closed", but I can assure you they are open. 

Excellent place for breakfast/brunch!! Excellent service, entertainment, the ambiance is excellent, oh yeah and the food is great--what else could you ask for!?! The mariachi is top notch! If you are close by, stop by, you will not be disappointed.
