I never thought I would find a taco I loved more than the al pastor at Tacos El Gordo.  I was wrong.

The minute I bit into my carne asada taco (with extra hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, and cheese), I was in love.  The carne asada was tender and flavorful.  One taco was PLENTY.  The thing is absolutely massive.  We also ordered a side of rice and beans (and an al pastor taco for my fianc√©).  We had MORE THAN ENOUGH, and every bit of it was delicious.  The beans are to-die-for.  

We loved it so much, we went two days in a row for lunch.  Do I feel guilty for splurging on such a high-calorie meal?  Sure.  Was it worth it?  Heck yes.
