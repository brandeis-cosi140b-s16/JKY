Upon first hearing about this new mexican food place down the street from my apartment i was not expecting anything great whatsoever. boy was i surprised. This place is definately a keeper. Not only is the atmosphere amazing (fountains and candle light) but the blue corn enchiladas i had and continue to have are so delicious that i keeps me crawling back. I definately recommend anyone to try.
