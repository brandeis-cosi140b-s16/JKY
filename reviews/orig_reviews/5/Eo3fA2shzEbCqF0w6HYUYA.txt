I LOVE El Encanto! I probably eat there at least twice a week and everytime I order the exact same thing - Pollo Fundido and chips & salsa. The ambiance at this restaurant is great and I love the atmosphere. They have a pond full of ducks and turtles, which I love to watch while I am eating. The staff is great, the food is great, and the experience is great! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique place to dine out!
