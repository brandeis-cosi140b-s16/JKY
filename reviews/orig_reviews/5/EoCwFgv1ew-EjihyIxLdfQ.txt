I regularly get my dry cleaning done next-door and occasionally stop in at French Grocery for a snack, but I had never gotten around to stopping into Mucho Macho Taco until yesterday when I needed something to turn my day around after a botched attempt at holiday shopping. This was a fantastic choice - I picked up two of the 50/50 tacos to go (carne asada and chorizo, plus queso fresco and pico), and I spent the rest of the day telling anyone who would listen how great they were. The staff is very friendly too, and the service was really quick for my take-out order. Parking at this shopping center can be a little challenging, but I bet you could park pointing towards the street at the shopping center on the other side of Missouri and be fine with a 2-minute walk (most of that would be waiting on the traffic light). I had previously been bemoaning the absence of a certain Texas-based taco chain here in Phoenix, and what I've now realized is that fantastic tacos are already here and waiting on me to discover/enjoy them!  :)
