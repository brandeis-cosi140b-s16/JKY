Normally, I wouldn't give 5 stars to a place this loud, chaotic, and not exactly spotless.  But it is the day before Christmas Eve and half the city was in there buying tortillas, tamales, etc, including yours truly.

Of course, I had to have lunch too.  I had the 3-way burro (red, green, bean) so that I wouldn't have to choose which way to go.  All I can say is that if this what a 3-way is about, I'm in Mr and Mrs Carolina, and bring enough tortillas to cover a king-sized bed!  Those are damn good too.

I seriously need to find a reason to be in this part of town more often.  Oh, and some may have heard me gripe about so-called "cheap" Mexican food.  This really is cheap.  Tacos for $1.75, $3.25 for a burro, and I found a penny in the parking lot!
