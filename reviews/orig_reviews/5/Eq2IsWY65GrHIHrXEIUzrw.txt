Ohhh Rokerij, how I love you so!

To begin, I do not think I have ever encountered an unfriendly or rude server here. The staff, both upstairs and downstairs, is incredibly friendly and helpful.

The wine list is amazzzzzing. So many yummy wines to choose from! Start with a glass of wine, then choose a couple of appetizers like the Brie Toasts or the stuffed mushrooms. Then, as a main course, go with the Garlic Plate or the Gumbo. Sooo good. Or the Porterhouse, or the Sea Bass, or the Pasta Heidi.. Can't go wrong with any of those. Even their House Salad is amazing. 

After dinner, enjoy some berries and gelato. Not too fattening but absolutely delicious!
