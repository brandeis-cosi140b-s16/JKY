Tacos Atoyac reinforces my belief that the more expensive your Mexican food is, and the fancier the establishment appears, the worse it's probably going to be. I mean, EVERYONE knows that the *good* stuff lies in plain, secluded little strip malls that are easily overlooked. 

Just pop in and get whatever you want. I am convinced Atoyac can do no wrong. I ordered a simple pastor burrito. Carne asada is easy to do, but the arduous process of choosing a marinade that's just-right is in my opinion the litmus test for whether or not a restaurant is legit. Part of me wanted to say it's too sweet, but as it disappeared fast, I realized it's unique, but really hits the spot. 

Sevice was fast, and all meals come with grilled onions and a grilled serrano, which is just the right amount of heat for me, and definitely too much for most people who will read this. Be careful, and have some delicious horchata ready just in case.
