I loved it! This will definitely be a regular place for me. The food was great! They dont skimp you on anything. I ordered the Burrito and Taco combo. Both the burrito and taco were stuffed with beef and not overdone with cheese or sauce. My BF got the chicken enchilada verde combo and each of his enchiladas were the size of my one burrito. You definately get what you pay for. Each combo comes with chips and salsa (of course), fideo soup, and then a side of rice and beans. For 3 of us our bill came to $37.66. You definitely cannot beat that, especially compared to many other Mexican restaurants.
