We are from out of town and ran across this restaurant looking for some breakfast off of the strip. I think we hit the jackpot because everything we ate was delicious! Starting with cheese enchiladas, beans, rice, chicken taco, all very tasty. And to top it off, they were making fresh flour tortillas that they served us hot in a warmer! Although I lost at the casinos, we were winners at Don Juan. We'll be back!
