Found this gem thanks to Groupon.

First off, it is a bit far from the Strip, but I feel that adds to the appeal. It's a place for locals. And that's what makes it a gem. 

Now as I am told, I am not a hookah official from the hookah crowd, but I know what I like to smoke! The mixes they put together are quite tasty. We had the Mummy.

As for the food, my buddy had this Russian lamb soup.  It was delicious.  I tried a bit of the broth and it was well seasoned, just the right amount of coriander.  Unfortunately they were out of beef (later to find out that it wasn't that they were out of beef but the beef they had was marinated enough according to the owner Alex and he didn't want to serve it...that is the type of quality I appreciate).  But I did get their fries and they were perhaps the best fries, perfectly crispy and seasoned. 

Alex also brought over some of their homemade fruit punch.  It was excellent.  Not disgustingly sweet like many other punches I have had at other places. It is just fruit juice from 7 different fruits.  Very refreshing. 

The service is excellent and pretty attentive. I enjoyed meeting Alex, and I hope this place succeeds as it should.  

I would like to come back to this place next time I am in town.
