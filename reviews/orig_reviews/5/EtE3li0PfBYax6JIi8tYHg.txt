We went to cash my paycheck at the red rock casino, and planned on eating at the yard house. But I have been wanting to try this place and my husband agreed. So glad we did!!! Such a cute set up. We had our six year old son with us other wise we would have sat in the bar area which seemed to be much more populated. Either way we lucked up and hit happy hour. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had!!! My top two (because I can't pick one) would be the shrimp and swordfish!!! And my husbands favorite was the chicken taco he did have the shrimp and said that was his second but he didn't try the swordfish. We both for he mahi mahi and that was my least favorite, it almost taste like styrofoam. Guacamole was great! And I love the complementary chips and salsa. My fav salsa was the tomatillo! Wish they sold that in a large size, I'd pour it on everything!! And the children size was huge, we were actually contemplating on ordering the nachos from the happy hour thinking they would be bigger than the kids menu. But we were wrong my son normally orders of the adult menu but needed a Togo for his nachos. I also had the margarita on the happy hour and it was good. I was actually expecting it to be super watered down but it wasn't. I have zero complaints and cannot wait to come back!! I jut wish I remembered my waitress's name!! She wasn't wearing name tag so I couldn't double check . But this place is on point!!!
