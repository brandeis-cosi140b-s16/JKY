Plenty of seating in doors and out with friendly staff. They had a few problems (I didn't see anyone bussing tables and their lemonade machine went on the fritz while I was ordering) but it seems like a really great place.
I got the carne asada quesadilla, a steak taco on flour tortilla, and a pollo taco on corn tortillas. These are street food style and came on styrofoam picnic plates wrapped in foil. The tacos were good sized but I thought the quesadilla would be a litte larger - however, there were plenty of ingredients stuffed inside. The meat was delicious! Perfectly seasoned. I also loved that the onions/cabbage was minced so you got a lot more flavour with each bite and it was more uniform, instead of big chunks like some places do. The tortillas were really fresh and grilled. No complaints at all about the food. 
I also got a large lemonade "agua frescas". To me, aqua frescas is more like a naturally flavoured slushy where this was just fresh juice, but it was still really good and tart. If you like really sweet lemonade, you might have to add some sugar! 

Two tacos, a quesadilla, and a large drink for just over $10. It's street food at sit down prices, but the taste makes it worth it.
