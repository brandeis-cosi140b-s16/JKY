This place was pretty clutch. My girl and I came here for some bomb Mexican food and we found just that! They start you off with a sexy little plate of chips, salsa, a white sour cream sauce (amazing), and some bean dip ( also amazing, especially when mixed with previously mentioned white sauce). We ordered the carne asada quesadillas, which were amazing, although a little on the overly cheesy side. If everything wasn't amazing enough, our entree came with free sopapillas! These come in either cinnamon sugar or plain. Always go cinny-sug. 

Will be back to try the rest of the menu!
