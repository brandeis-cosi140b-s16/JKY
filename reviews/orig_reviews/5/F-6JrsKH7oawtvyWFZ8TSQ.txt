I used to live in New Mexico and have been searching for Mexican food that came close to the flavor and heat of the hatch chilies used there...until I found Arriba on Camelback. I love spicey food and theirs in the hottest in town (the menu has a "hot" factor so you can avoid the heat if you want). My fiance and I always start out with the queso fundito and then take our pick of the rest of the amazing menu. I recommend the Roswell Tacos and the Spinach Enchiladas. 

I have been to other Arriba locations but this one has the hottest food, best ambiance, and service.
