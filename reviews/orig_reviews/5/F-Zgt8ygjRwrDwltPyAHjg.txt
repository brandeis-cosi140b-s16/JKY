Fantastic.

I came here with a big group of friends (9 of us) for a fun night out. We had a great time-- delicious food, good service, fun atmosphere.

We started with pitchers of their red sangria. One pitcher was $34, but served about 12-15 cups of sangria. The sangria was fruity and we all liked it-- which, with as big of a group as we were, is saying something.

The food took a while, but they kept the chips and salsas coming as quickly as we could eat them. The chips were fresh, and was served with a trio of salsas-- a pico de gallo, a red chipotle salsa, and a salsa verde. Everyone at the table had a favorite-- but everyone's favorite was different. I couldn't get enough of the chipotle, but the people next to me loved the pico and the verde, so...

We ordered some guacamole, which was prepared tableside just the way you want it. Perfection. Gave enough for everyone to get a big spoonful.

For dinner, I had the gorditas (which was an appetizer) and the cerviche de hauchinanga. The cerviche had an amazing sauce. I could have eaten it all day. There were three kinds of gorditas served: beef, pork and shrimp. The first two were melt-in-my-mouth delicious. The shrimp one was not, and I did not bother to eat more than a bite or two since everything else was so good.

It was pretty expensive, I won't lie, but it was our fancy night out on spring break, and the food was definitely worth it.
