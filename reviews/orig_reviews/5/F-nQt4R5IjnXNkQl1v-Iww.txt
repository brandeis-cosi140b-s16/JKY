This is the only "New Mexican" food I have been able to find in Las Vegas.  For those who know the difference and want authentic Hatch chili read no further and just go...now!
New Mexican fare differs from other forms of Mexican food because it is focused around Hatch chilies.  This ingredient comes from Central New Mexico where all the stars align to produce this unmatched and unmistakeable chili.  The owner stays true to Senoran New Mexican cuisine and gives you the option to chose from red or green in most of their dishes.
Some of my favorites include red chili adovada enchiladas layered style with a fried egg on top, green chili chicken enchiladas, and the nachos.  Also, there are always specials which are delicious (I love the ribs).  And don't forget to save room for a sopapilla for dessert!  
Being that my father was from New Mexico, this was the food I was raised on.  If you haven't tried it, give it a go and you'll be hooked!
