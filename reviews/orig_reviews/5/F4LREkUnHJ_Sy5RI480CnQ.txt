One of the better Happy Hour places around. Incredible prices on the street tacos and they're damn good too! Been there a handful of times and always return when we're in the area. Trying my best to schedule a weekend staycation at the Clarendon with the wife for sometime now. It has a gorgeous pool, and with the Gallo Blanco Cafe & Bar attached it would make for a very nice getaway.
