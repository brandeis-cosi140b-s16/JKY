Best Tacos in Vegas!! Can't believe I'm eating these tacos in this city! These tasty tacos seem like I'd be driving to California or Mexico for them. Pork Tacos are AMAZING! Especially with the avocado sauce and all the fresh fixins! Oh and if you like pineapple, ask for them on the pork tacos! You're Welcome!
