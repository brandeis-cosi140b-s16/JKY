This is probably my top restaurant, Mexican and non-Mexican. Originally I wanted to go there to try the churros with goat's milk dessert. But naive me realized the entrees and guacamole are where it's at. Any time I have guests willing to shell out a bit more for a meal, I always stop here. There's usually a wait of about an hour, in that tiny restaurant, but it's worth it. Their homemade pomegranate seed guacamole (cranberries when pomengranate is off season) is a must. And I love how instead of chips and salsa on the tables, staff bring pieces of bread with this oiive tapenade. I have never had a bad thing here, from the tortas to their duck. If I could afford it, I'd eat there once a week 'til I conquered the entire menu. On weekends, they have live music which adds to the already casual, urban atmosphere. I once went to a cooking demo with chef/owner Silvana. That lady knows her stuff!
