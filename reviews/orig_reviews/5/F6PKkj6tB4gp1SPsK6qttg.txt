We adore PoPo's. I love going here because everything that we've had thus far has been pretty much perfect. The flour chips with the queso spinach dip are so effin' tastey and the shredded chicken is up there with the best ever. But there is one down side to at least this location...Manuel. He is a server that apparently hates his job or at least he hates the customers. His answer to what is the "green sauce" like was.... "it's like the red but green"............. This is on top of terrible service from him in general, l so if you go stay away from his section and you should be fine :-)
