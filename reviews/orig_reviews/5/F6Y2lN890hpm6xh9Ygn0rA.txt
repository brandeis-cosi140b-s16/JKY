You know those delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurants you just can't keep a secret? Well you've found it. This is the best Mexican food I have ever had, nothing on the menu disappoints. I wish I could keep this spot a locals only place, but it's too good not to share. As others have said, the short rib tacos are great!
