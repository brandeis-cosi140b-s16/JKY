the food was perfect, so unique and the bartender was soo sweet. house margaritas were delish and i'm very picky. the tacos were small but very filling. protein portions were very generous inside of these miniature tortillas. tried shrimp, brisket, and carne asada & mushroom. very impressed by all. also got a sample of the house made white sangria... high octane! very tasty. will be back for sure (:
