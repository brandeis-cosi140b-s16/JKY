Went to El Bravo with the family tonight at my mom-in-laws request and yes it was as tasty as ever.  This place is as good as it gets for authentic Mexican food in Phoenix.  The service on the other hand is usually not the greatest when they are busy and tonight they were busy so I feel pretty lucky to tell you that the experience was great.  I usually get the #5 which is a corn tamale, sour cream enchilada, beans & rice which was awesome tonight.  I have also had there 3 flat enchiladas with egg which is also the best.  The green chili burros, bean burros, tacos, red beef tamales, and tostadas and they are all fantastic.   The place is a hole in the wall establishment snuggled in the SW corner of 7th Street & Butler (South of Northern).  The atmosphere is pretty nice considering the area and the price of the food.  They charge for the chips and salsa but its only a $1 and good chips and salsa are worth it.  We also buy a dozen flour tortillas on our way out the door each time we visit.  There is rumor for one to be open up more north like maybe Norterra area!
