I love this place!  I always order the mahi mahi tacos. The queso is awesome too.  I think the last time I went there was a shrimp taco with thai chili sauce but I substituted for mahi and it was no big deal.  Tequila shots are a must here. Great atmosphere.  On busy nights there is always a wait but try and get the patio of it's nice out.
