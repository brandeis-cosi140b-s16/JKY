They have some of the best guacamole in town!  This is an intimate little place, only about 20 tables or so plus a bar area.  The hostess stand is very disorganized and waiting space is limited, however the bar is a great place to kill time.  Bartender is awesome, super friendly, and she even brought out some chips and salsa for us to snack on while we had a beer and waited for our table.  Somehow the hostess got confused and forgot we were waiting at the bar and marked us off the list, but we got it all resolved.  

The food, oh my goodness, the food is muy delicioso!  It took a little while to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  I had the sizzling fajitas de camarones with their yumazing handmade flour tortillas and he had the pollo estilo reforma agraria, which is a vinegar marinaded chicken dish.  We also loved that they have a lot of huevos dishes not limited to breakfast hours.

And like other yelpers have noted, the parking lot is tiny.  Knowing this ahead of time helped me mentally prepare to be patient and creative with my parking options.
