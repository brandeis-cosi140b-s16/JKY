Los Dos is absolutely other - worldly!  There are no flavours like this that I have found in Canada. Of course, this is not surprising. This quaint establishment offers a straightforward menu with amazing tastes. Faves  include Cheese Crisp - be sure to ask for sliced jalape√±o and  Adavada Ribs, 

 Be aware that Los Dos brings the heat and it is fabulous! You will need at least tres cerveza with your meal!

Service is always polite and accommodating. Meals arrive promptly. 

I like how Los Dos honours the US Military - very cool! 

I highly recommend this spot!
