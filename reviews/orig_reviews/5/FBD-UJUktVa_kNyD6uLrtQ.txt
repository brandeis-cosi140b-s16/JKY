We decided to have our wedding reception here, and so glad we did!  

We looked at a whole list of places to host our wedding reception while in Vegas, and opted to go with Border Grill.  I would say one of the first reasons we choose Border Grill was because of Christina, our event coordinator.  Christina was on the ball, and made the entire process as simple as could be.  She was a lot more helpful ad insightful than even that of our wedding planner.  We did work with Jennifer and Jill in the days leading up to our event, and they were both more than accommodating.  This seems to span the board at this establishment, as their employees all seem to exude the same type of mentality.  The customer is definitely number one here! 

We actually grabbed some drinks here on the first visit, during happy hour, and their margarita was spot on!  The bartender made it to perfection.  On our second time through, we grabbed a drink and had a quick bite.  The fish tacos were delicious and once again the drinks were right on par.

When it came time for our event, everything was taken care of.  We weren't left wanting for anything.  The staff did an amazing job getting the venue ready for our group, and they continued to go above and beyond throughout the event.

I can not say enough about this place.  We will definitely be back next time we are in town!!!
