Someone said the drinks overpriced??????  HAHA a five dollar DELICIOUS pear mojito is overpriced???  Same person said the menu was limited.....well as a chef myself, i would rather see a small menu perfectly executed than a cheesecake factory menu where everything is blah....... the food here is awesome. We had guac, (very nicetouch of orange), the Inca salad is very unique and to die for! My favorite salad EVER. Tacos were very good, and where to begin with the fresh , locally grown, non gmo, and organic vegetable???  Three local farms featured, three sampled......how do YOU think they were??  Right........FANTASTIC!  We shared a torta, the torta Noca, with carne asada and an over easy egg and guac on it, the bread was light and airy and the flavor excellent. We had no room left for the coconut pudding, but got and shared one anyway.........light, fresh and again spot on delicious. We will be back if they keep it up......to you haters out there, STAY AWAY from here! I dont like to wait for a table! 
All that and two Negra Modelos, and a pear mojito, and the bill was well under 60 dollars.........well done Mr Robson, and Mr Robson, well done.
