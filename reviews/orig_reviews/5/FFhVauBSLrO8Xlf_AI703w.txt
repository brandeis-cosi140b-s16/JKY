I've been to this restaurant a few times and finally decided to rate it.  I usually don't eat anything but fast food in Vegas but Taco's and Tequila is awesome.  Fast friendly service, I'm always greeted with a smile by the hostess.  This particular day we did the mariachi brunch which I have to tell you it was amazing.  The mariachi band is not loud and obnoxious, they are tasteful and even play jams like "ms. New booty" very entertaining.  The prices are very reasonable, good atmosphere and absolutely the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had in my life and I've had home made and my local cuisine (I live in California so our local cuisine is authentic). I had a blast and it was a great value and a great start to my last day in Vegas.  If you're looking for something different and want good value, service and amazing food then check out the TnT mariachi brunch!
