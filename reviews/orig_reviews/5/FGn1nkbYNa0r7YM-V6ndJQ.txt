This spot is awesome I've Been going here for about 9 months. This is the most consistent restaurant...check it out you'll agree... tip top in all areas! Good Mexican food and you can order fries on the side.  Red chilli meat burrito rocks (made with roast not ground beef). Refried beans are super yummy too. Pricrs are luke a fast food joint but it's all homemade Restaurant is aways clean and the employees are fun
