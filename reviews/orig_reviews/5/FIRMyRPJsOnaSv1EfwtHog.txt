I love this trendy restaurant! They serve authentic Mexican food - zesty dishes that use the perfect Mexican spice blend. The Tortilla soup is a must have! The carnitas tacos were served with a green salsa, avocado and cilantro were tasty - you get a free side if you order 3 tacos. We also had the Mexican Sweet Corn as an appetizer - so good! The servers were friendly and attentive.
