First time eating here and I gotta say, the food is really good and very FLAVORFUL and the staff is very friendly and nice. The employee Lety greeted me with a nice smile and great attitude. She told me that it's just like chipotle but way better and I gotta say she was right! Great vibe in the restaurant as well. Def coming back.
