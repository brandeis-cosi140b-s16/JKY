I am a fan. Coming from California, most of the mexican food in NC has been disappointing at best. La Unica, however, is authentic and good. Free endless chips and salsa with a variety of fresh made salsa's and cheeze dips is a great start. Every dish I have had there has been excellent from the Barbacoa burrito's to the Chilequilles to the enchiladas. They don't serve liquor though so get a beer; no margaritas. It helps also that I speak some spanish.
