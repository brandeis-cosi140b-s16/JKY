Came here the day after they opened. The lay out is a little confusing, since this place is essentially a taco shop in a really fancy restaurant. But the staff was really nice explaining how everything worked. We even got samples of a  few different types of meat! 

After 20 minutes of indecision we went with Lengua(Tongue), Cabeza(Cheek meat), Al Pastor (Pork), and Asada tacos, along with an Al pastor bowl. We also tried all of their salsas and extras, and EVERYTHING was delicious! Their al pastor specifically was excellent, and the lengua and cabeza tacos were also great! We regretted not getting the mexican street corn since it seemed like everyone ordered it. 

Definitely coming back since it's delicious food at a reasonable price. This location is also much closer to us than all the other locations around Vegas.
