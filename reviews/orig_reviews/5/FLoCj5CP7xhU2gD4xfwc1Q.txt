This place is SERIOUSLY amazing. The atmosphere, decor, and semi-secret bar present a wonderful dining experience. Our server Jamie was attentive, thoughtful, and helped us choose amazing pairings for our food. The food...oh my goodness, I am such a foodie, and this totally hit home! I will come back here ANY TIME.
