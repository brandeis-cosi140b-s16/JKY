We had a fabulous experience here. The open air restaurant was exactly what the 6 of us were looking for. The atmosphere was casual, the service excellent, and the food and drinks were fantastic! We had several different flavors of margaritas, a michelada, tuna ceviche, queso flameado, and taco entrees - all of it great. I am very surprised to see the less than stellar reviews here. It also didn't hurt that the waiters were quite attractive.
