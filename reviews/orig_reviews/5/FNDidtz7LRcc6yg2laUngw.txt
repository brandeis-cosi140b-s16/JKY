This is my favorite salsa in the bay area. I get their steak tacos, pico on the side, side of cheese as well. Chop up the jala-pep-pep they give you, add it on there with the cheese, pico, scoop of salsa. Don't forget to squeeze that lime on top. BOOM! I like the greener salsa only. Cannot vouch for anything else on their menu.
