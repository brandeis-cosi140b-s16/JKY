I just enjoyed an excellent meal. The Hanger Steak - a special - was moist and tender, perfectly cooked, and each of the 3 sauces stood on its own.  

There were 9 in my group, and everyone was pleased. I love taking a group here; everyone always leaves happy.

Thank you again for the superlative service, Jose.
