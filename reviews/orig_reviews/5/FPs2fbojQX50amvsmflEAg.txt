So, anything that sounds Hawaiian is a must try, especially in Vegas.

I had heard they were going to open, but didn't know when, so today when I drove by on my way to work, I noticed the sign and knew I had to try it. 

The drive through is not functioning yet, so I went inside. the first time might be good, the menu isn't big nor complicated but you gotta know your choices and seeing the whole board helps. 

First, pick put the type, burrito, bowl, salad or taco. Choose your meat, add the 'filler' like rice, beans, cabbage, etc....

Next add the salas, finally add all the other condiments like guacamole and sour cream. Oh yah, you can top it off with a saald dressing too!

I got a salad, huli huli chicken, (small bite size grilled slightly crispy outside chicken) with bed of romaine lettuce, add the spicy tomato with grilled Maui onion,  ( don't worry, it's not spicy at all, buy savory), I added sour cream, guacamole with hawaiian pink salt, and the roasted sesame gingerette (tasted the sesame but ginger not so much).

It was really good,  enjoyed it and will difinitly be back to try more! Friendly staff, excellent service and good flavors!
