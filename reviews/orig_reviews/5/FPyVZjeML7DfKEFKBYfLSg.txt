My hubby and I loved this place. The bulgogi fried rice was awesome.  Since we moved to the area we have been searching for good beef bulgogi.  We finally found it here.   The tacos, burritos and fries were also fantastic.  It is definitely worth the trip to that part of town.  We will be back many, many times.
