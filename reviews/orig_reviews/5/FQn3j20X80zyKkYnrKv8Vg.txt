Leticia's by far is the very best Mexican Restaurant in the valley.  My husband and I have lived here for 16 years with nine being in Green Valley.  This is right in our neighborhood and the entire staff makes you feel like you came to dine with relatives.  The food is not only the best Mexican food but the best home-cooked restaurant in town.  The Cadillac Margarita is awesome!!!! Go, enjoy, you will leave being a happy soul!
