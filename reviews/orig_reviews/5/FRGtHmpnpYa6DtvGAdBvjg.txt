Had a great birthday celebration meal and adult beverages tonight.  Table-side guacamole was fun and delicious.  Shared the Mushroom Enchiladas - delightful.  Our server, Louis, was great - attentive, prompt and responsive to our questions.  The GM, Mike, was very helpful in providing us assistance in resolving a problem using a VISA gift card.  Wonderful service and special food.  We'll dine here again.
