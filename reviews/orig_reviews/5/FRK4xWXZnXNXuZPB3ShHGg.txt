First of all I would like to start off saying that this restaurant is absolutely amazing !!!!!!!!the place is breathtaking. We stopped by at around 5 without a reservation but the hostess were kind enough to squees us in in a timely manner. I did order the enchiladas del mar dish was about $25 but well worth every dime! Portions were enough for 2! My husband and I shared a guacamole and its to die for. To drink we each had a signature margarita I had kiwi my husband had mango they were by far the best margaritas we have had! We will absolutely be back to being friends ! Can't wait to be back !!
