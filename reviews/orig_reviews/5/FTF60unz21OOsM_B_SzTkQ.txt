I live six blocks away, but its natty exterior scared me off. The other day, I scoped Mexican restaurants and this came very highly rated. 

As we walked in (with my 11-year-old), it was clean and rustic (another word for an outdated and sparse sh*thole). The clientele combined many Hispanics casually speaking Spanish (big plus) and face-filled Caucasians. Within 10 seconds of seating, we had a bowlful of chips and fresh mild / hot salsa and very pleasant greeting from the server.    

Opening the menu, they filled the pages with Mexican perfection. We're a little adventurous (me more so than my 11-year-old) and was excited by the menu items of tripe, tongue and cactus. OMG, right!?!?! Those items are only found in a Taco Bell entree by freak accident. 

Don't worry, there are many conventional items as well. 

Chowing on chips, we slugged a couple of Jarrito sodas (I had tamarind and he had lime). Before 10 minutes passed, our burritos came. He had beef and I had seasoned pork steak (carne el pastor). While digging in mine, I had to nibble on his too. Both were incredible; the meat was tender and delicious and included sides were refried beans (perfectly seasoned, cooked and homemade) and delicious rice (slightly smoked and cooked to perfection). We were in such delight, I do not know we recalled breathing.

To go, we picked a beef tongue taco (he would not promise to resist French-kissing the taco); Platillo Guadalajara (special with steak, chile and cactus); chimichanga (MASSIVE); tamale dinne and  two Cokes (glass bottle) for UNDER $50! 

Before I typed this up, I sampled the plates and the food is consistent. All the food is homemade, filling and perfectly textured/seasoned. 

I feel like such and idiot for holding out on this joint.
