I live near the Aria so I usually walk over to Javier's for dinner. I sit in the self seated tables around the bar and I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be seated even on busier nights. I love their chips and Salsa. They do have mild salsa, the regular one is too spicy for me.  Also I can't say enough about their Shrimp Tacos, perfection! Towards the back of the restaurant they have these beautiful wooden wall art work. It's spectacular, make sure you see it up close!
