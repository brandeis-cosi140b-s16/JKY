My cousin was raving to me about Taco y Taco and when I finally got to try it, it totally lived up to the hype! 

The place is huge. So much seating! Very clean & modern feel. 

You get in line for tacos based on what kind of meat you want. They have everything! Al pastor, carnitas, pollo, barbacoa, carne asada, and more (even tongue if that's your thing!). Street style tacos with everything - onions, cilantro, and salsa are where it's at! Although you can get burritos, tostadas, too. 

I went for carnitas, my favorite, and they did not disappoint! Juicy, crispy on the outside, and packed full of flavor. 

And let's have a moment of silence for the Mexican street style corn. ............. Get it, squeeze with fresh lime, stuff yo face, be happy. 

Salsa bar, thick crispy chips, cheap (2 tacos and corn for under $10!), and you can find me at Taco y Taco every time I'm in Vegas.
