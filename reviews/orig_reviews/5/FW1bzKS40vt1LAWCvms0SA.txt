I absolutely love this place.  My must-have is the tripe taco - hands down thee best of the bunch.  This is the dish that I always order. The tripe is crunchy, yet chewy.  It may be a bit oily but that's what happens when it's deep-fried before it's minced and served. If you decide to get this or any other taco, tostada, burrito, or nachos, just make sure to get everything on it, else it just won't taste right.  You can also ask for some free sauteed scallions and peppers, which are actually quite good as a side with your dish.  Their horchata is pretty damn good, too - none of that powderiness that lingers in others's mix. 

This place gets pretty packed, espcially on weekends and nights.  I couldn't imagine it any other way, though.  Well, actually I can, but it's on the strip, and the place has great food and for very decent prices. Regardless if you are drunk, coherent, strolling around the area, or hungry for some Mexican food, check this place out.
