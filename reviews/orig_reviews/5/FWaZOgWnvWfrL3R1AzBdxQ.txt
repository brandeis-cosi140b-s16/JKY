Went back to Scottsdale with some friends for a part work trip part vacation and we had go here.  The food is just so good and the bloody-marys are also very tasty.  I went for the meatloaf topped with green chilis.  It is a giant slice of meatloaf that comes with a couple eggs.  I went with over medium, not to runny.  Also comes with a flower tortilla to snack on, we had to remind them for this.  My wife had the green chili stew that I had to steal a bite of and as expected, she could not be trusted for her word alone, was pretty spicy and equally tasty.

Once again wish we had time to stick around for the happy hour.
