I love this place. Authentic New Mexican style food with a fun vibe. My favorite dishes are the red and green "christmas" chicken enchiladas, green chili stew (perfect for when it's cold outside!) and bean + cheese burro with green on top! I've never had a bad experience, and the margs are seriously awesome! Plus the bar tender is pretty hot ;)
