We made it - Visit #3-  I crave this place!  I live in Southern California, but traveled to Vegas to celebrate my birthday  for 3 days.  KoMex was on my list of places to eat.. OMG, I ordered the pork belly taco wrapped in lettuce and the bulgogi taco.. Delicious!  The spicy salsa is a must try.  I could probably drink this stuff it's so good!  The chicken wings are flavorful.  Kinda sweet, not spicy, but very tasty.  I topped them with some spicy salsa.  KoMex has changed their menu, but the favorites are still on it.  Also, they now close at 4pm on Sundays.. We barely made it.
