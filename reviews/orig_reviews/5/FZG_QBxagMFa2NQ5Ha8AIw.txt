This restaurant was beyond amazing!!  The service and, the ambience was unsurpassed!!!  The food was delicious and very authentic which is hard to find in Vegas.  We are a Mexican family so we definitely appreciated the amazing food.  We had a very large group of 22 people and were celebrating two birthdays.  Noe, the manager greeted us once we arrived and made sure that we were taken care.  Our waiters, Christian and Angel were extremely attentive and their service was efficient and prompt. To celebrate my nieces birthday, the mariachis serenaded my niece with a couple of songs, and the servers also came to sing happy birthday and gave her a special birthday drink.  I can not say more about this restaurant, it was just such a memorable experience for our family!  I'm just sad that there aren't any Lindo Michoacan's in Los Angeles.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and go back to Lindo Michoacan! :)
