I can't believe what a great venue the Crescent Ballroom is. It's as if the owners/designers thought, "What do people want before, during, and after a concert?" (Then they correctly answered, "Booze, burritos, and more booze. We'll throw plenty of clean bathrooms in there for good measure.")

The other night I got the chance to see St. Vincent at CB. The concert space is a great size - it fits plenty of people (even with places to sit!) - but you still get to be at one of those intimate shows where you can SEE the band. And if I'm going to a St. Vincent concert, I want to SEE the beautiful Annie Clark as she's playing. Not just a humanoid shape on a stage so far away that I can only assume that it's the band that I hear playing. 

If your favorite band is playing at Crescent Ballroom, do not miss the opportunity to see them at this venue. It is a great addition to downtown Phoenix with a bonus of being located only a block away from the lightrail stations. Get there early for some food and drinks too.
