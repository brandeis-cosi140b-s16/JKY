Food and wine abound here. The outside is charming an looks like an old Spanish mission so the name is appropriate. There is a parking lot directly across the street if you can't find parking in front. The bar is very nice and the bartenders very attentive. I'm a red wine lover and the selection is decent. The place is candle lit and very romantic if you're in need of a date destination. It's nice to have a drink at the bar while munching in some table side guacamole (highly recommended). The patio is a different feel and is awesome if the weather is nice. I ordered the pork shoulder and green pozole. They also have an amazing kale salad (I'm a sucker for kale). Definitely go when you have time and not in a rush. If it's not too packed the bar is a gem.
