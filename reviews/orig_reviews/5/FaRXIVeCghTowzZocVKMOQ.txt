Just got back from lunch with coworkers and this place is amazing. We had the 5 salsa flight which was great; gave a chance to savor many flavors. Then cane the tacos and those sure didn't disappoint. We were all raving about the braised pork. Go get some tonight! And at the end I placed a to-go order for a coworker and the salad is the size of a toddler! She said its amazing; she had me order the chopped chicken salad with chipotle dressing. I'm so going back to this place.
