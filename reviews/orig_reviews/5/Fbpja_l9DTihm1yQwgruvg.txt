Move over El Gordo's. 

Taco's are $2 each, with burritos under $6. Nothing is overpriced here! I went here at first because of their Jelli radio ad, but from that time, I was hooked. I often bring friends from out-of-town here and they rave that they cannot find anything like that back home. 

One meat beats all other: Al Pastor. I can order four of those bad boys and still eat more. Their asada meat is also okay, but rather dry. I can spend $8 here and be so full I would not eat lunch the next day. If you're in a group (because this is the only way to avoid single person gluttony), get the fries with al pastor meat. Comes with cheese, lots of guac, and other fixings. I would recommend only ordering the half size because that was enough to feed four people and then some.

Everyone is really nice -- even when they heard my order wrong, they still fixed it and delivered it to our table. The salsa bar is immaculate, with six different types of sauces. The space is always very clean and they play a variety of songs. I enjoy watching Telemundo variety shows, though. 

Their customer service is also amazing -- we came in one day after EDC and they were running a special. Proof of attendance = 1 chorizo taco. 

PRO TIP: Check in via FB/Yelp and receive a corn on the cob -- they've seasoned it with hot pepper and buttahhh. I never knew until the cashier mentioned it.
