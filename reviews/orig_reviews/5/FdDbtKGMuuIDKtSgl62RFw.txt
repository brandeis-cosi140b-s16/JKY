Love this spot! Prices are good for the strip, food is better than what you will find in the overpriced mexican themed restaurants in nearby casinos. The Habenero salso is HOT!!! I come to vegas 2 -3 months out of the year .... Usually here for 2 weeks at a spell.... I come here every other day! In a city where you don't always get the quality you pay for, I feel this taco shop exceeds the norm! The spicy pork is delicious , and the carnitas is moist and full of flavor. Great lunch spot when you are in a hurry.
