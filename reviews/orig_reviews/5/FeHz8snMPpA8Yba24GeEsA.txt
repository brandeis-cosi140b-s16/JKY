TIP: cash (or check) only, so stop at the ATM before you get here.

Came based on a friend's recommendation, location is completely nondescript, easy to miss.  If you can't decide if you want steak or chicken - pick both! they have a combo plate. 

this is a no nonsense hole-in-the-wall serving good Mexican food. If you've been to El Pollo Loco, this is what the non-gringo, non-franchised, non-commercialized version would be. (And I l admit, I like the occaisonal El Pollo Loco, there is always a place and time for that kind of food, usually potlucks, but anyways - I digress)

this is a good mid-week work lunch spot.
