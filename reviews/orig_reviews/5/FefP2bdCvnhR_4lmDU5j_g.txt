I love this place. I'm glad it's a but of a drive from my house or else i would be a fat, fat man. It's the upscale Chipotle of enchiladas. The service is quick, and their sauces are delicious, although they could be a little spicier in my opinion. The corn filling is to die for, I could eat it all day, and their green chile pork is great too. Any time I'm in the area i try to swing by. Still need to try it with an egg on top.
