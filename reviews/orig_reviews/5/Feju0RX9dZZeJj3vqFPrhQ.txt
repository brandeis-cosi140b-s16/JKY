Everything was amazing, and we spent less than $25. Friendly waitstaff, quick service, fun ambiance. 

The salsa verde on the chilaquiles is the best I've had in Phoenix. I subbed egg whites for the poached egg, and they were fluffy and perfect.

The fresh squeezed OJ is so fresh that it's like sucking an orange. At $6, the large is more expensive than some meals, but it was totally worth it.

Gallo Blanco buys meat from The Meat Shop, and that means spicy, fresh chorizo and other pork straight from the hog. I will eat here every chance I get.
