Ate inside - hostess said the wait is 15 min, we got the table in 15 min. Wanted Chicken Sabana, waiter recommended Chicken Jalape√±o; switched to that and really liked it. We  felt the food came a bit late, but didn't time it and could have been subjective as we were tired and hungry. Waiter was nice and friendly. Overall, great food and smooth experience, which given how busy the Strip was at the time, it was quite something.
