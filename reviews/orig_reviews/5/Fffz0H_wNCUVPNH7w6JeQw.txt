I'm in love with Cafe Rio! I've eaten here over 100 times and every time I'm delighted. I can never go wrong with either the pork or shredded chicken salad. This is one of the only places that my whole family can agree on and all be delicious. I love everything about it. The location at Horizon Ridge and Horizon is lacking service, but this one seems to get everything in check.
