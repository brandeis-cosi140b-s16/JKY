Don't judge this book by it's cover. Tucked in the back of a strip mall on the corner of Alma School and Warner in Chandler Taqueria Mi Casita looks like any one of a thousand Arizona taco shops. One taste of their enchilada sauce and you'll know that you've found a special spot. Had the Bandanos Burro with carne asada and it was amazing. Fresh ingredients made with plenty of love. Great spot, friendly service.
