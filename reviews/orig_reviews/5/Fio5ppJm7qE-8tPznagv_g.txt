We went on a Wednesday afternoon on Mexican Independence Day. It was not busy and the service seemed fast. You order and get your food before you pay. Seating inside is limited but people don't linger so it's easy to get a seat. The food was awesome. I tried four different tacos and all were very good. The best tacos I have had. I can't wait to eat here again.
