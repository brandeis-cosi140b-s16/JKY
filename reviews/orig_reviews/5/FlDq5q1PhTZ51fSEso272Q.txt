If you're looking for really good breakfast burritos, this is the place to come to! A lot of burrito places have greasy burritos that make your stomach hate you afterwards but the Original Burrito Co. does a great job at making everything fresh to order with a clean, non-greasy but most importantly, delicious taste! They offer two different types of salsa, a green tomatillo salsa, and a red tomato salsa with cilantro and green onions that has a nice kick to it. Personally, the tomato salsa is my favorite over the green salsa but both are fresh and good! All of their dishes (including burritos) come with a side of chips however their breakfast burritos do not.
