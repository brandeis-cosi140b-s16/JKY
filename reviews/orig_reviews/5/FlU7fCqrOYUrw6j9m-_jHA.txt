My husband and I were there on 8/29 for the first time and we really enjoyed everything we ordered. We ordered three tongue tacos, omg all meat and super good! We also ordered the al pastor taco and the meat was on point with the flavors of al pastor. Carnitas is my fave so we had to order some, and they are the best carnitas I've had on this side of town, I was so happy they were awesome! They also have green and red salsa on every table not super spicy but very good and authentic. The street corn was good too. My only complaint is that I thought it was bit pricy for Mexican food, but everything we ordered was super good and worth the price. Oh I can't forget to mention, they have Aguas frescas I tried them all and they were all so refreshing and delish! Try the spinach agua fresca it was so good. Will be back!
