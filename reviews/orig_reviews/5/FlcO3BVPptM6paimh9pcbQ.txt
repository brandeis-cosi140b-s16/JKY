Fajitas is by far the best place for.....fajitas.  The homemade tortillas are some of the best in the City.  I am not sure if any of the other mexican food is even any good here because I have been going here for years and only order the Cadillac and Chicken combo platter of fajitas.  The salsa is very good if you like fresh tasting salsa that is very runny.  The guac isn't always very good but the meat and toppings go well with the dish.  The atmosphere is supper casual and the bar sits in the middle which isnt very large but this place gets super busy in the evening and there is alot of energy in the place.  I have been going here for years and I cant think of a single time the service was not fast and great.  I highly recommend trying it out if you are in the area.
