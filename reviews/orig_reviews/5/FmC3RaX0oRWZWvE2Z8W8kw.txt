Just had a fabulous dinner here. This place is kind of a hole in a wall...but cozy and welcoming. You order at the counter. I got enchiladas, my boyfriend got a pork torta...something we had never had. His food came out before mine but we were both blown away. Hands down the best Mexican food we have ever had! After, the waiter came to our table and offered a free dessert since we "waited so long for the food". We literally waited 3 minutes! The gesture was so incredibly nice but we totally did not mind the short wait! Would definitely come back!!!!
