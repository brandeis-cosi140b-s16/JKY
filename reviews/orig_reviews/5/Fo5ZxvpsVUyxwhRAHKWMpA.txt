I am imagining that there is a great chef behind the scenes due to the number of specials and caliber of the food and combinations.  I had salmon with the awesome mix of asparagus, corn and wonderful sauce.  It was so delicious.  The platter had tons of asparagus, and the salmon portion was large, so no skimping here!  I will definitely go back when in town.

Tiny place, but packs a punch!  I went here with some friends on a Sat night and somehow the wait was only about 15 mins??  There is really no place to wait, so we stood in the doorway and had our drinks.  It worked out.  Anyway, the menu was mostly seafood and there were tons of specials for the evening. 


Ambiance is on the dark side and pretty loud.
