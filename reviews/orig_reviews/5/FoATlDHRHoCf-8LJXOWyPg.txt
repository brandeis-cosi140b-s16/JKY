I will echo what all the review below.The business is family owned and operated and the customer service is amazing! They let you sample all the meats which are off the charts! The restaurant is super clean and they have tv's to watch sports. They make their own taco salad shells and I can't rave about them enough! Please come by and support this amazing local business.
