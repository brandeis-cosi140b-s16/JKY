I should receive a free Gym membership with how much I eat here.

I absolutely LOVE the tofu lettuce wraps, vegetable chimichanga and french fries.

The first time I went to the North Decatur location I got a little lost. The place isn't easy to find but as I did a U turn, I saw a very long line out the door of a hole in the wall looking place, looked up and realized I was in the right place! I quickly pulled in, parked and waited in line. Despite the long line and how small the space is, the cashiers moved through each persons order rather quickly. When I got to the counter, I had asked them what their best vegetarian & vegan friendly dishes were and by was I surprised on how informed and genuinely friendly their staff was. It wasn't long before I placed my order. An extra spicy Korean vegan burrito, french fries and a drink. Needless to say, I fell in love and have been eating at KoMex ever since.

Now, I tend to frequent the Buffalo & Flamingo location simply because it's closer to where I live but don't worry, both locations are fantastic! Do not miss these hidden gems!
