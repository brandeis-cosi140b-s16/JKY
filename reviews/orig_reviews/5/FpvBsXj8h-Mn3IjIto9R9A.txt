Probably one of the more affordable restaurants in Aria. But with that said, you can expect to spend roughly $40-50 per person if you stick with a main entree and one alcoholic drink. With our $50 beverage and dining credit, I did some Yelpy research and figured that we could make like thieves and get away with an upscale dining experience for 2 for a grand total of $9.

At Javier's, the best meal to get is "La Tablita". You won't regret it. It can easily feed three adults, maybe even four. For $46, you get ample servings of rice, beans, rajas (roasted peppers), pico de gallo, guacamole, carnitas, chicken, steak, and tortillas. We knew we did good when we got lots of drooly stares as people passed us and got seated at their tables. 

The carne asada steak was seriously the best steak I've had in my life thus far. Thin and smoky and juicy. The chips and salsa are also complimentary. They don't offer it straight up but ask for the "green" salsa (also complimentary). It's a tomatillo salsa - spicy and sour and sweet.

Dress nice or you'll stick out.
