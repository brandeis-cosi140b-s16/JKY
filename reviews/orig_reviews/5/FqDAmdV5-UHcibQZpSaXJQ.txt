Ok. This place needs to be on TV. Its also one of those places-for those of us who live in the East Valley-that is a #STAPLE. Worthy of its own hashtag even. Worthy of Best Of Phoenix. And quite frankly, the reason why you should never go to Chipotle, or any other imitation. This place is real.

Real enough to run into the owners of a business that has been around for 30 plus years. It makes a difference when the ownership cares so much, and it shows up in the service. I've never not once experienced less than super friendly service. Customers are welcome here, and there are plenty of regulars as a result.

My writing won't do the food justice, so I'll just say that you are getting the quality of food normally you would have to sit down and wait for; not to mention, the kind of food that would give your wallet a beating. However, you'll leave this place with your wallet not having as much as a scratch. Its all because they know how to offer value here.

Lastly, expect authenticity when you eat at this clean and comfortable establishment. The flavor that lands in your mouth from their artfully made carne asada burritos is no doubt due to REAL recipes. This ain't no "On The Border". 

Plently of mexican restaurants to choose from in the area. Plenty of perpetrators. Stay away from those and eat here :).
