So many of the reviews hate on this place because of the small menu - so what? You want a big menu? Head to Taco Bell or Denny's. You want a cute little taco shack that decided they're going to focus on perfecting two meats - carne asada and pork al pastor - then put it in tacos, burritos, or on a vampiro? Then this is your place. And randomly, they have grilled corn on the cob as well! 

This is the best pastor I've ever had by far. And the second best carne asada (after the taco cart behind Charlie's on 7th Ave in Phoenix). They cook up everything fresh and to order, yet are still lightning fast. And if you're in the mood to hang out, their outside area is great: benches, heat lamps, sparkly lights.

LOVE THIS PLACE.
