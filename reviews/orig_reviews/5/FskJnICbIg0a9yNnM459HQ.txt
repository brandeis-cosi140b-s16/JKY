A MAJOR step in the right direction for Mill. This is not some crappy college dive bar. It actually has class, but not in that stuffy/douchy Scottsdale way.
I guess I'd call the design and the interior "Modern Hacienda." I enjoyed the huge patio bar that faces 6th St. (This location on the street, as oppsed to hidden away, is important to create an authentic urban environment.) There is another patio out back as well. 
If you like tequila, this is place to go. I had many margaritas. 
I loved the shrimp tacos. They were smaller than I thought they would be but I felt satisfied after I inhaled them. So much flavor and so satisfying. 
The service was friendly and attentive. There was a guy who kept coming and filling up my water. That is critical for me: I hate begging for water. (It's the difference between a good tip and a great tip.)
I had my server bring the General Manager out so I could tell him what an awesome restaurant he had. I was there the 2nd night it was open and it was packed. 
This is my new favorite place and I'm glad I live so close so that I can stumble home drunk any night of the week.
