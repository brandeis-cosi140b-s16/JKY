Thanks fellow Yelpers!

This restaurant was FABULOUS!  I had a helluva time finding the place, since I'd never been in the neighborhood before and didn't think to remember the exact address.

Here's what I got for less than $7:
---  Complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole(!)
---  Two fusion tacos - one beef and one pork.  Both with kimchi and their super hot sauce.  These had so much stuff on them that I had to eat them with a knife and fork.  I know, bad form on my part.  
---  One fish taco
---  A complimentary dessert - a sectioned orange with a toothpick.  Cute!
---  One can of Diet Coke

A portly (stout?) (rotund?) (pleasantly plump?) lady was sitting near me.  She ordered FOUR TACOS, stuffed her napkin down her shirt, picked up a taco, and WENT TO TOWN!!!  Sauce was running down both her arms and she was dropping some serious food.  It was a sight to behold.  

One of my friends (a fat guy) once told me, "If you're a fat guy, the food never hits the ground first."   But I digress.

They need to charge more!  I told the Asian lady (the owner?) this when she brought my bill.

The space is small and it's out of the way for tourists like me.  But WOW, the food is OUTSTANDING!
