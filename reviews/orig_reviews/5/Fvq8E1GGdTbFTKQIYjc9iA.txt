Dang that is some good salsa!  I really like Lindo's but not a huge fan of their salsa.  Really like the salsa at Cabo in Red Rock but their food is just average.  Finally.  I have found a Mexican joint with good food AND good salsa.  Salsa here includes a fire-roasted chipotle salsa, green salsa and bean dip.

Ended up here on a Saturday night.  Pretty crowded, which is always a good sign.  Nice lighting, cute little area.  This is a great date spot.  Our server Luciano was great, service was prompt and most importantly, the food was really good.  Although I ate so much of the salsa that I barely touched my shrimp tacos, they had a spicy creamy chipotle sauce which was awesome.
