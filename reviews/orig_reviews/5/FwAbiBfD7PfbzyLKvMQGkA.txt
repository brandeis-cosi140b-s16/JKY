Wordsworth is a hack.
Van Gogh, complete chump.
Mozart should be ashamed.

Because in comparison to the genius, the beauty, the absolute dream that is the Ceviche de Atun created by the mastermind that is Chef Garces, in the gracefully elegant setting that is Distrito those old dead dudes failed to create anything of importance.

No but really, dat ceviche!
The menu description of it will pique your interest.  Yellowfin tuna, Serrano-coconut sauce, lime sorbet, tomatillo, tostaditas.  Seriously, Wordsworth, get your crap together, man.
 
When it arrives to your table, it will look small.  Like many of dishes here.  Tiny even. Inside this small bowl you will find the tuna, lovely, with tiny little tortilla chips the size of nickels.  The sorbet is there too, a vibrant and pleasant green.  All luxuriously bathed in that serranno- coconut sauce. 
Oh and whats this? This delicate little cloud resting in this beautiful landscape? Cilantro foam.  Suck it Van Gogh, 'cause those finger paintings of yours got nothin' on this.

From your first bite to your last you will experience the most fabulous symphony of texture, flavor, and temperature in your mouth.  Mozart could bang out a concert, sure, but the flavors in this dish meld together to surround your tongue in a true euphoric experience that hack could never quite deliver.

So, basically.  I really like this ceviche.
