My partner and I were staying at the Wigwam and wanted something close to the resort. The Old Pueblo Cafe was a brief five minute walk right across the street.

When we arrived we noticed a "closed" sign in the window an hour before the advertised time. After some initial confusion, an employee spotted us and explained that they were still serving food next door. We sat at an outside open bar, still unsure if we were in the right area. After a moment, the wall opened to reveal a "secret passage" rotating wall-door, and the bartender emerged. No joke!

She was friendly and brought us full menus and offered us drinks. The House Margarita and Long Island we ordered were decent but priced pretty well. The food came out within minutes and was hot, tasty and in large proportions. The Fish Tacos I had were fresh and delicious! Highly recommended.

If you're looking for a great place to stop and eat while at the resort, you need to check this place out.
