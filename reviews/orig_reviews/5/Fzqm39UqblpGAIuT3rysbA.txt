Oh man, we love this place. The drinks, margaritas especially, are KILLER. We've tried several flavors, including the "with smoke" option, the cheeky cheeky boom boom, and another one that I can't remember (lol). The food is wonderful. I stick to the quest fundido with spare ribs. Perfect portion size. We usually sit at the bar and it doesn't have the traditional bar vibe. It's our new favorite place in town. The drinks are STRONG too. For the price, you're getting a great drink. The place isn't cheap,  but it's completely worth it.
