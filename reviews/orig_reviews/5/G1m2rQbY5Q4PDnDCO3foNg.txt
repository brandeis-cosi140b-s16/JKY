Ok, so this is a corporate, run-of-the-mill, family tex-mex restaurant. But sometimes the experience makes the stars. 

I was running around, with my 3 month old in the mall, having a pretty hectic day. So I stopped in for a quick bite to eat. All I had was chips and guacamole (two orders actually) and a margarita to calm my nerves. Now the margarita was mostly sugar so 3 stars at best and the guacamole wasn't too bad, but when the diaper needed changing and the baby needed feeding, the server was cool. After changing, I returned to a table of fresh chips and full water. Baby needed feeding, so he grabbed some hot water with a smile. I think I just got that genuine happiness that is tough to come by in restaurants, especially a customer with a stroller and a baby. So, because of the great attitude I got I had to give this place a five star rating.
