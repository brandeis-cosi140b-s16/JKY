Ate here on December 16. This was the first stop after checking into our hotel. I always make Border Grill a priority on my Vegas trips and again, I was glad I did. The service was great. They are always so helpful answering questions about the menu and making suggestions. I had the fish tacos and my friend had the special of the day, a pork burrito. They were both excellent. I always get great service and great food at the Border Grill.
