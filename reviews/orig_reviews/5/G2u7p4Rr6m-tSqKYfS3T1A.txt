Went with our motorcycle group today.  Was very busy, being Biketoberfest Sunday and all, but our 20 minute wait went by quickly watching the ducks and turtles in the indoor pond.  The service from Jessica was wonderful and the food was So Delicious.  The husband and I split two meals, we shared the Carne Asada Tacos and the Red & Green Tamales.  They were so wonderful.  Everyone at our table loved everything they ordered, I don't think there was a thing left on our plates.  This was my first visit, but it will not be our last!
