We tried this place on a recommendation by a friend. I've lived in Arizona for about 10 years and this is definetely in my top 5 Mexican food places! I had the shredded beef tacos and let me tell you they were the best I ever had and that is saying alot because I have had alot of shredded beef tacos! The outside patio was awesome! The only downside was the crappy chips and salsa. The salsa was the runniest I have ever has. It is very decently priced, we had two entrees and two beers and it was only about $24!  Even if you dont live near oldtown you should make the trip to this place! I give it a "Hot damn! That was some tasty food!"
