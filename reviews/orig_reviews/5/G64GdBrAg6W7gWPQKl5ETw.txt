Just happened to notice this place driving down Bell a couple times.  It is nestled between a car wash and a thrift store. Once I walked inside I was overcome, in a good way by the smoky smell of the wood they use to smoke their meats. We got seated right away, and noticed that the music they were playing was really good. Then my wife looked up and saw a live musician perched on an upstairs stage. Would have never guessed it, throughout our meal we were loving every minute of that. The food was excellent, but the best dish was the beef fajitas my wife ordered.  I am telling you right now, they are the best anywhere in town. I guarantee you that. Love this place and will definitely be returning.
