The green chili burrito enchilada style is amazing! The chili is perfectly seasoned, not too mild or hot. The beans are silky smooth and delicious!  Also the owner is so friendly. He is always genuinely happy to see you. He makes it a point to get to know you and call you by name.  I would rate Ritos higher than 5 stars if there was an option!
