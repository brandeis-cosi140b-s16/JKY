I don't usually feel the urge to update a review from a good experience, but this one is worth mentioning.

I had a friend in town last night, and we decided to pay a visit to Gallo Blanco. I told her all about my amazing experience from a couple weeks back: the elote, the tacos, the el julio.

Having said all that, I was excited to return!

On this "normal" Wednesday night, the restaurant was PACKED, but we were seated within a few minutes.

Our server made polite conversation with us and said "I'm a foodie and that's why I love working here." I wish every server felt this way at every restaurant I go to. As a self-appointed food nerd, I felt like I was in good hands.

In any case, here's the skinny:

Cocktails: El Julio (as always), the prickly pair margarita (it's delicious), aguas frescas (some sort of watermelon vodka cocktail that was VERY strong), and capped off with a Hopknot. All solid choices.

Food: We shared everything. Order of chips/guacamole. To die for. The Elote. It truly is a religious experience. The Cotija cheese! Smoked Paprika! Also, we shared the Pica Rico burger. So many different flavors. The smoked chili peppers and the avocado! It was a perfect balance. 

Between the two of us, we only hate half of the burger. That's how big it is. 

My best advice is to come here with people who are not scared of eating and indulging. This is the kind of place where you want to enjoy your meal. If you are trying to be healthy, it's a treat. 

This is my new spot. If only I lived in downtown....
