The further into the sketchier parts of Phoenix we drove, the more I knew that Mariscos Playa Hermosa was going to be legit. Its quite unassuming from the outside but the overly-enthused lobster sign out front let's you know you've arrived.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa may appear a bit ghetto but open its doors and you've entered a tropical island paradise.  The inside reminds me of what the Chiquita Banana lady's house would look like...  blindingly bright colors, suns, moons, parrots, wooden fruit, flowers and trees.  
 
There was one man running the show and he was superb.  Very attentive, expedient and friendly.   You won't be disappointed with the shrimp culichi or any of the cerviche menu options... not to mention the wide margarita selection.
