OMG!  After months of driving past Cafe Rio without stopping, we finally stopped in and ate.  Wish we had done it sooner!  Fresh wonderful food!  We went back two days in a row.

Fresh food, clean premises, great tastes!

Cross between fast food and traditional Mexican restaurant, but wonderful.  To bad they don't have a bar on premises.

We give them 5 stars all the way!
