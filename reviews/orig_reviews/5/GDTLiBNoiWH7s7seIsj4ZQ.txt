This is a review of their newer menu items. 

Fish taco - I was expecting fried fish but this is REAL grilled fish served with cabbage and sauce.  It reminded me of legit fish tacos I've eaten in San Diego. Brushfire's fish taco sets the bar high. 

Fuego wings - meaty wings, nice sweet and spicy sauce. As a bonus I received 5 wings instead of 4 that are listed on the menu. Definitely worth the $1 upcharge on the meal.
