Yummmmy!!! I stayed at Treasure Island for five nights and regret not trying Isla on our first night there (tried it on my last night). Now I am back home wishing I had more of the crunchy corn masa cakes, oh and the quesadillas are to die for. I loved everything. The service, drinks, appetizers and main course....Simply Delicious! It was truly a surprise!

I will be visiting Vegas soon and will make it a point to dine at Isla.
