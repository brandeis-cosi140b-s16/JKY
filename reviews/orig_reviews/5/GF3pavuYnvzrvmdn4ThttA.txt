Wow.  What a surprise! This place has all organic non GMO ingredients and what a difference in flavor!   I ordered the street tacos and after a very recent trip to Mexico I can tell you that these tacos are authentic and better than the tacos of Playa del Carmen.  Raphael was our server / bartender and he whipped up a mean pi√±a colada to go with the tacos.  I'll be a regular for sure!
