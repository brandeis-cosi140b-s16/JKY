We've eaten here twice now and enjoyed it both times.  My 9-year old daughter LOVES the rice.  The black beans are perfectly cooked and delicious on their own or with the rice.  I got the same thing both times because it was so good - both vegetarion options as tostadas.  The guacamole and salsas are very yummy and the chips are some root vegetable that I can't recall but they were perfectly crisp and delicious with the salsa and guac.  It's BYOB.  We'll definitely be going back.
