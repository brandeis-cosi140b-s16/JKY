Surprisingly awesome! Visited this restaurant during lunch and the service was fast and friendly. Sat at the bar and ordered the braised beef tacos and they were amazing. Fresh corn tortillas, rice, flavorful beans and delicious salsa help you create the perfect marriage of taste and texture in every bite. I'll definitely try this place again!
