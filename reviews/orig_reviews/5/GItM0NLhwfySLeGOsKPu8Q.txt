Awesome Happy Hour! They spin the "wheel of sin" approximately every 15 - 30 minutes and whatever it lands on is the $2 special. The wheel has mostly margaritas, beer, and shots. It is fun and if the crowd is good, people really get in to the wheel spinning. We ordered several of everything the wheel landed on. The food looked good, but we were so full of $2 specials we couldn't eat.
