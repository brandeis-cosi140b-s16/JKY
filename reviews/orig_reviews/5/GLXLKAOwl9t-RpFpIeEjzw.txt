At first I was confused by the ordering stations but the employees were helpful.  Love it how you can customize by choosing the meat you want on your desired menu item.  We got Carnitas Nachos and they don't go cheap on the meat or toppings.  Also got a Carne Asada Burrito.  Both meats were flavorful and juicy.  Chips are freshly fried.  Nice salsa bar with lots of choices.  Restaurant is very clean.  Will definitely return when we are in Vegas next time!  Please bring Tacos y Tacos to Los Angeles!
