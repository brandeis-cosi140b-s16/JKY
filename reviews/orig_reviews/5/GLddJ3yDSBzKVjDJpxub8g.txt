Pedro's is very far from my house (45 mintues) but it is worth every single second of that drive.

The place is not nice... i'd more so call it a "whole in the wall". However, the staff is nice and the food is delicious so it makes up for it.

It can be pretty busy, so sometimes there is a small wait. Some of the seats are bad, so it's nice when you can go when they have down time & while they let you seat yourself.

Food is great- chips and salsa with the chunky salsa is awesome. I love their cheese crisp and the Pedro's special (cheese enchilada & beef taco). 

Prices over the years seem like they're going up... so check out the deal on the chalkboard as you're walking in, that will save you a few dollars.
