LOVE THIS PLACE for a great locals night out!

To get thing started, are hostess was a doll. She offered us a seat on the floor until I saw the booths, and asked for one of those instead. She didn't bat an eye, and led us to a booth. 

The drink service was prompt, and our waiter, Luis, was no non-sense. P.S. I LOVE the waitstaff attire here: they have cowboy-esque black colored shirts with pearl buttons and skull and rose embroidery. A very nice touch.

We ordered the "Bloody Maria" (a bloody Mary with tequila) and a house margarita (the special was a margarita with 3 street tacos). There was plenty of alcohol in the drinks and they used special care mixing the ingredients. Bloody Mary was nice n spicy! Just how I like it. 

Two of us ordered the Santa Rosa salad with chicken. HOLY COW WHAT A SALAD: black beans, big chunks of mango, lots of avocado, pan fried corn, grilled chicken, finely shredded carrots, and nicely shredded lettuce. The salad is tossed, so every bite is super flavorful. It's also super deceiving: the bowl looks small, but good luck finishing it. This salad is filling!!!!! Seriously, one of the best salads I've ever had!

The service was prompt and attentive. Luis came by a couple times to check on us, but didn't linger. Water glasses were filled and the check was brought quickly. 

Also, I totally love the ambiance in here. Lots of low lighting, leather bound menus, wood finishes on everything, etc. Very romantic!

The ONLY criticism I have: the music playing through the restaurant was totally random. They were playing top 40 radio hits. It was out of place. This place is so cool and unique, I think they could find some more complimentary music to go with the setting and food.
