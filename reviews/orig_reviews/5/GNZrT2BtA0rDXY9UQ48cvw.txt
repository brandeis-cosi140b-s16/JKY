Wow! Super tender, fresh, perfectly cooked carne asada on a toasted out of the world delicious torta! I cannot wait to go back! Authentic as it gets, decent service and amazing food! They didn't serve alcohol during lunch despite the margarita signs everywhere, but who cares?!? This place will make your taste buds happy, but beware you can get addicted on the first visit like me.  The service can be horrible, but I almost don't care.
