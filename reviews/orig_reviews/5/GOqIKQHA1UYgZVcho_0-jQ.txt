Every time I go to visit my job site I plan lunch with my girlfriend here. We have been visiting this place since 2007. It is a great find for lunch and dinner. I believe it is some of the best Mexican food in town. 

Lunch can get crowded so we usually get in around 1130 and are seated right away. Get the guac!! It is a little extra but totally worth it. I have never had bad service here and they are very attentive and the food comes out pretty fast. Not fast like microwave, but within a good amount of time for the amount of people they have sitting in there. 

I usually get shredded beef tacos or enchiladas and the love the rice. Everything is just so yummy. Oh yah and the horchata, YUM! I had bad Mexican just days before I came last Friday so I definitely needed the right stuff!
