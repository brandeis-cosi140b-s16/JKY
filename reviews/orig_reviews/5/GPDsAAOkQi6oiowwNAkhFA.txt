Excellent food, great service, and chef Paco is super nice! I had the pineapple shrimp which is served inside of a half pineapple. It was juicy and spicy, exactly how I like it. Hubby had the pulled chicken burrito which was crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The cilantro rice is also really good. Don't forget the churros in the end! Amazing! Def coming back! :)))
