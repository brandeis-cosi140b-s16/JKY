Never had anything bad from here! Love the chicken and pork. Their bark is so good! They let you try the meats to see which you like so there's no wondering if you should have gotten another instead. They toned down the killer jalape√±os which is nice (very fresh and with seeds !!! ). Not enough places have bean sprouts ;)
