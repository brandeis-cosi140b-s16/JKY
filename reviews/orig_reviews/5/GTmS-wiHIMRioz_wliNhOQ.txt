Very nice place to eat!! I've had authentic mexican food (I'm mexican so that's a given) but this place has its own flare to its food and I appreciate their efforts. Nothing beats moms home cooked food but when mom a.k.a. The wife is to tired I a nice to find a place like this to fill you up. Guacamole was made just right and right in front of you btw. The carnitas familia plate was more then I expected and very flavorful. Definitely a place to come back to.
