so my mom is in town and wanted some good mexican food.  i ran through the list of places that i know in my head and have frequented.  i stumbled across La Condesa and suggested it.  but i wasn't sure, i mean, i wanted to take my mom somewhere nice and i wasn't sure about La Condesa's atmosphere or food.

after much deliberation we decided on going.  and boy oh boy, we were not disappointed in the least!

to begin with, i'm a big fan of dia de los muertos imagery.  so to walk up and see a big mosaic sculpture above the door, i was already biased that this place may be my new favorite mexican food spot.  inside was decorated much the same with beautiful paintings of dia de los muertos portraits.  stunningly beautiful (i wish i had asked if they were for sale, but they had just finished up a remodel, so i was assuming they were not available).

their salsa bar is amazing!!!  my personal favorite was the jicama salsa.  but i could seriously sit and just eat chips and salsa.  

i had a big sur dogfish shark taco and a carne asada burro.  the calabasitas (mini-squash, kinda like zucchini) were amazing!

the service was great too!  she was very friendly and was willing to chat up with us...always nice when i'm trying a new place.

this will definitely be my new joint for tacos and burros, hands down!
