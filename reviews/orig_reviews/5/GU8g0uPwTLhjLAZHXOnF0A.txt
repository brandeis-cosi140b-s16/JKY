The food here is so good! My sister and I just flew in and were starving when we submitted stumbled into this place. I would have included pictures of our food but we ate it up so quick! The grilled corn was on point. The Baja Shrimp tacos were juicy.  The chicken quesadilla was huge. The Horchata Colada taste exactly as it sounds and I highly recommend it. Our server, Justin, gave excellent suggestions. I'll definitely return!
