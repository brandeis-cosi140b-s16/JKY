Everything was so tasty. We ordered a few small plates to share. Imperial shrimp is off the chain! Came around 2:30 .. Great timing! We were the only ones in there for a bit. Fantastic service from Chris & Chef Paco visited the table. Classy decor. Open 24 hrs. Local food done right. Highly recommend!
