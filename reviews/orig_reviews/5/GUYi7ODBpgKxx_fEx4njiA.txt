OMG!  I SO LOVE this place!  Even the iced tea is outstanding.  But I have to write about the carne asada.  This is the best carne asada ON THE PLANET!  They use ribeye steak and serve it with a roasted tomato salsa.  Oh, so yummy!  It's a party in your mouth, for sure.  You can get it in tacos or a burrito.  The burrito comes with chunks of avocado; my friend loved it.  In fact, she had it on Friday night and again for lunch on Saturday, and she swears they put crack in the carne asada.  For dessert, I got the tres leches cake, which came with coconut milk ice cream and a pineapple rum sauce.  I almost asked for a spoon to get the last of the pineapple sauce.  Plus, it's in the Clarendon Hotel.  The decor is hip, the vibe is very cool, and they let you use the pool if you ride the Critical Mass bike ride.  They have rooftop seating.  I haven't tried them yet, but I hear the drinks are great.  Plus, they use locally-sourced food.  What's not to love?  I'll be back there Tuesday for the taco special!
