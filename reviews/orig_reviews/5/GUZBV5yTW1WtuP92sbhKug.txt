best mexican food anywhere. I've been eating here forever and its a definate staple to ahwatukee residents. The # 18 breakfast burrito is good but i ususally go for the #13 chorizo and potato breakfast burrito anytime of the day. 
i always make sure to take any out of towner here for their food. My boyfriend who lives in indiana alsos makes a poin t to stop here when he comes out.
