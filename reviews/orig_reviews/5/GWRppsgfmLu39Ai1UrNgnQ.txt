A great place for some food and brews. I make an effort to get here more than once a week. The food is excellent, the beer list is awesome and the margaritas are the best in town. When you can't choose a drink, count on one of the friendly bartenders to lead you to the right drink. 
Just a great place to watch a game, listen to music, live music or comedy. It's never dull no matter what day of the week you stop in. Oh and by the way, the breakfast line up is up to par. 

Have a blast insisting one of your friends do the real tequila shot with the scorpion. 

I just love this place!
Food, entertainment, service, and drinks!
