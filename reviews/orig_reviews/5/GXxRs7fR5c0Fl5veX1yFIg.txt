Sooooo good. The burgers are just heaven. Staff is super nice. Now here's a little something I didn't see coming: Grilled Portobello Mushroom in place of the burger. Sounds crazy, right?  It isn't. It's to die for. Perfect place to go for a burger along with your vegetarian friend/relative. My daughter is a huge fan of their Carnival Corn and I love their sweet potato tater tots. My husband and son LOVE the pulled pork with their shake. You will not be sorry to visit this local burger joint. It's high end burgers with local flavor and friendly staff.
