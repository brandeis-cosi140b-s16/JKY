Finally some mexican food that has an authentic flavor to it. I order the chile relleno, tamale and cheese enchilada special and all though it didn't had beans and rice like the normal platters do I was not disappointed at all. I used the drive thru which is a big plus to have, the wait was no longer than 5 minutes, the girls were friendly and took with me a menu to share with all of you in case it was good. I am happy to report that this will be my go to fast mexican food place from now on.
