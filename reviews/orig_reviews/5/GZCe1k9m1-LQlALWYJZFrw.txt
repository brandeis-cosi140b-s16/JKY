By far the best Mexican food I've ever eaten (and I lived in the East Bay for nearly a decade).  It's gotten to the point that I'm seriously considering faking a pregnancy to justify how often and how much I eat at Maize.  When I leave Illinois in the near future, this will be the only thing I miss.  I actually cried the other day thinking about losing it.
