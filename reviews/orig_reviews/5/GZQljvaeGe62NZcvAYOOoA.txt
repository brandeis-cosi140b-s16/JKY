Came here for dinner last Friday and it's so improved from last time! Everything was PERFECT! From the staff to the drinks to the food, it was all superb! 

First of all, Rachel (our waitress) Chris and Destiny were all attentive and very helpful. 

We had the following... 
Guacamole with chips and salsa 
Ribeye 
Empanadas 
Chile Relleno 
Ahi Tar Tar 
Blood Orange Ginger Margaritas 
Vodka B----- (can't recall the name but so refreshing) :-) 

Everything was perfect. I am salivating every time I think of the Tuna Tar Tar and that yummy green sauce it was served with. 

Although this was the best meal we had in a long time and we were stuffed, we decided to finish it off with Tres Leches. I never had anything that good. 

I will absolutely be back here every time I am back in Vegas. I highly recommend the Border Grill for anyone that wants a great meal and service. They have seating inside and outside and it's equally good for groups as it is for romantic dinners. 

Thank you Border Grill for a GREAT experience! Keep up the GREAT work!!! :-)
