For the people that give Chuy's anything less than 4 stars for the food can you please tell me where you will find better TEX-MEX anywhere along the Eastern Seaboard? I went 1 time last week when I was in town for business and this location could thrive in Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio or any other hardcore Tex-Mex competitive city. The service was great and so was the food.
