We went in for happy hour. Erica was our server and she was great. She answered all of our questions, and showed us (and explained) the dinner menu, so we understood the Asian/mex fusion, and so would come back for more. 

Food was great- we ordered gauc, chicken, fish, and mushroom tacos, edamame, calamari, tuna roll--and everything tasted fresh and was presented well. 

We will definitely be back for dinner. The decor and atmosphere reminds me of a a lot of the restaurants I went to in England and Europe when I lived there, so it was a refreshing surprise when we walked in to see something designed so well.

I look forward to tasting their dinners!
