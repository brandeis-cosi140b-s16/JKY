Visiting a friend who insisted we come to Carolina's on my first morning in town to get a breakfast burrito To Die For.

She was totally spot-on.

These delicious hand-made tortillas are fantastic!  I wish I could take a bunch back to Seattle with me, but since they're freshly-made, I'm guessing the lack of preservatives will make that a better idea than reality.

I enjoyed the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito with plenty of salsa.  I loved the spicy/smooth combo with the sour cream in the burrito.

I hope I get a chance to eat here again before leaving town!
