Amazing sushi burritos!! What!!?? Yes, I said sushi burritos. Crazy idea, but it comes together so well; with fresh, fresh fish, as well as all other ingredients. I had the Baja; nice and spicy with jalape√±os, spicy tuna, ahi, cilantro, cabbage, and a few other ingredients. So good, I want to try everything on the menu! This is a must for any sushi lover looking for a fresh take on the way we eat sushi!!
