Can't get enough of this food! Adobada plate is beyond amazing!!! Guacamole is so fresh! Salsa has a unique taste that leaves you craving chips and salsa throughout the day! I'm guilty of coming here every day for lunch this week. I'm not ashamed to say it!  Lol... 
Only minor incident was that I  asked for no tomatoes yesterday and they accidentally put some (hey it happens can't knock them for that) I did bring it up to Janet and she made sure to tell her cooks personally not to put tomatoes. Shes always smiling and such a sweetheart.. what more can you ask for. 
Wow they're playing Luis Miguel!  I FEEL IM HOME....#GEM! #GEM! #GEM!
