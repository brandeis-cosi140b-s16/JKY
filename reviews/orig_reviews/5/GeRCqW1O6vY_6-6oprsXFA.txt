I've been searching for good Mexican food in Vegas that doesn't send me straight to the shitter, whether it's on my knees throwing up, or sitting down, face in my hands crying about my poor anus.

I just sneezed and farted at the same time, and I guess I'll include that in the review since I'm writing about food covered in cheese.

I've tried a few things here. The guacamole is amazing, and while we're on the subject of shit (my fault, sorry), it turned my poop a deep forest green. That's fucking awesome! Besides being delicious, it made me laugh hours later when staring down into the porcelain bowl.

The chimichanga burrito is top notch, and I also sampled the chicken burrito. I was very happy with both, and you bet your white ass I'll be ordering from here again!
