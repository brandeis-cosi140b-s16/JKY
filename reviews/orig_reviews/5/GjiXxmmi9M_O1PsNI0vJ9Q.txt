If a place in Phoenix has almost 500 reviews and it still has almost 5 stars, you know it has to be good. I came here for a quick lunch after work one day, and couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The fish tacos I ordered were absolutely delicious, and the staff was very friendly. The salsa bar is genius! So many different flavors, it's like having 10 different dishes in one. 

Overall, do yourself a favor and try Santisima if you're in the mood for Mexican.
