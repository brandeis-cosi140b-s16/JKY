We just finished eating lunch,  and we really enjoyed every thing that we ordered.  We had one of the best waiters in any local restaurant.  Kyle did a fantastic job and was very polite and professional! We haven't been here in a couple of years, and we will be making this restaurant one on our regular places to dine.
