Miguel's has all the things I like:  delicious food, good drinks and candy!

The servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! The chips were hot and perfectly salted.  The salsa tasted fresh with a really nice kick to it.).  A lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, but I have no idea what their names are... 

The margaritas are definitely worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  So the large is an investment... lol  

They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect for a light lunch, but still filling...

So, I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, but put that aside... This is one of those things about not judging a book and blah, blah... The inside is clean, the food is super tasty, the specials are great, they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... What more do you want?
