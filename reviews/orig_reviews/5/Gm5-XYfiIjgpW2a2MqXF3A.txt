I've been going to Chino for over 10 years and it is still probably my favorite place on earth. In all that time, neither myself or anyone else I know has had any issues (while eating or after). I have taken many a friend to Chino's for the first time and their lives have never been the same (in a good way, of course). The place is a dive but it's not gross by any means and they'll let you sample anything on the menu.

The jade red chicken is the most popular item and for good reason but try it in a quesadilla and it'll blow your mind (no really, try it- the owner himself was the one who turned me onto this and I will never go back). The black beans...so good I could eat them all day (but don't, unfortunately). I usually get hengrenade chicken as my second item and stick with white rice for mixing with my chicken and beans but the chile relleno and jerk fried rice are also fabulous. And a free (giant delicious) cookie for dessert...um yes please; the Snickerdoodles are classic but my one true love is the Volcano cookie. 

Love the Mexican panda, love the plastic chairs, LOVE THE FOOD. Chino really is the best so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
