This is hands down the best late night eat in Phoenix.  There will be a little wait, and your eating outside. But done despair, this is the BEST carne asada you've ever had. 

It's a late night tradition, I think, to gorge yourself on their food on Friday and Saturday nights. And if your not... Your loss.
