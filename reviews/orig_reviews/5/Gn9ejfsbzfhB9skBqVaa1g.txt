We had no idea what to expect walking in here. We were blown away. The ambience, service, drinks, food - even the music - all outstanding. The best Mexican food I've had in years. The queso is insane. The guacamole is insane. It was hard to make room for the rest of the menu, which is - wait for it - insane. That good. Can't wait to go back. I can't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant already planning my next visit. Don't let the parking scare you off. Park across the street at Jersey Mike's (it's allowed). Try a Paloma. Have a shot. Get the queso.
